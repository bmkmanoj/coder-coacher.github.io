with another video and in this video I'm
going to be showing you how to ddos on
Windows now I remember I've shown you
guys one way or two on how to DDoS on
Windows and that was using the command
prompt now I'm going to show you a
special tool that does everything that
you can ever think of when it comes to
ddossing so if this will be the final
video or tutorial on how to DDoS on
Windows obviously I've showed you two
ways or not on how to DDoS on Android
and now here is the final way on how to
ddos on Windows so without further ado
let's get to this on my desktop I have
this file here which are downloaded and
I will link it in the description below
so once you downloaded it just extract
it to your desktop or wherever you feel
comfortable and open it and open it
again it is like as you guys already can
see it is the low orbit ion cannon so
just make sure you run this as
administrator and it will give you this
window so this is a very advanced DDoS
tool so as you can see very nice
presentation low orbit ion cannon by
protocol shout out to them so basically
a step number one select your target so
you can enter URL that's a website or or
any link that you want to DDoS IP which
is the most common type of DDoS attack
and so you can just add an IPS ogle at
my local IP 168 point zero point one
local IP for my router and hit lock on
so once it locked on it's going to give
you this and tell you that yes your
selected this IP so let's go down to
attack options now in attack options
this first line here is for websites so
we are not using website at the moment
and you have the TCP message so this is
the message that you can give your
victim of or yo the DDoS victim so very
simple you can write anything so
I'll race on the wall you what you got
sorry you vote old
alright so that's basically you can
enter whatever lesson you won there for
a victim or cleaver at a tea method if
it's an IP address you're attacking TCP
transmission control protocol if you're
attacking a website HTTP UDP is for
advanced IPS or MAC addresses so TCP
that's what we're using threads is the
amount of packets you want to send you
can send as many as you like even up to
a million but on this lesson set at 400
make sure wait for reply is all
otherwise it's if the IP is invalid it's
just going to keep on sending dead
packets and you can also change the
speed of the attack or the speed in
which the packets are sent so the faster
be more aggressive your DDoS attack will
be so basically this will this is how
how fast you want to to really really
attack your victim and how damaging you
want to be attack to be so you can keep
it wherever you want
I see that medium is good enough unless
you are trying to attack a website or
something like that
and the final step is to just hit -
which is I'm charging Malaysia so
obviously that's what you have to click
and hit it and as you can see requested
it's flooding the flooding flooding
flooding flooding flooding and obviously
it's not going to give me anything right
now because I'm I'm attacking my router
that doesn't make any sense but if you
have your IP hundred percent this will
work yeah so that's basically how to use
LOI called windows very simple just
download it the link will be in the
description and yeah now the other thing
only to talk to you guys about is um I'm
going to be creating my my website for
the channel we hackers plate official
website you can get everything hacking
programming and gaming any resources and
stuff will be on that website so I'm
currently working on that now
in the meantime I have my blog which I
set up on WordPress so you guys can
check that out if you want
I have all the documented versions of
the toriel's that I've made on my
channel if you have any suggestions

now some some of you guys have asked me
to to be using kik-kik messengers so I
have created an account on kik my name
