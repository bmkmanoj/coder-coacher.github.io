with another video and in this video I'm
gonna be showing you how to install Kali
Linux on windows 10 this time also using
the windows subsystem for linux so for
those of you who have watched my
previous video where I covered how to
install it using a docker system you can
see now that they have finally released
it so thank you so much to the Kali team
you know for releasing this on the
Windows Store making it easier to
install and also there were a lot of
errors that people were faced with you
in the previous video where we use the
windows will use the linux workspace
switcher that allows us to change
distributions and again as I spoke of in
the previous video regarding installing
Kali Linux on the windows subsystem for
Linux is that this is a fantastic
opportunity for many distributions to
get on board with this and it allows
them to get an even better you know user
base and you know possibly can convert
these people once they try it out to use
you know in any one of these Linux
distributions so it's a great thing
overall for the Linux community in the
sense that many people are able to try
it out really easily and when it comes
down to calories next they released it I
think about two days ago and I wanted to
go through it to make sure that it
worked without errors and indeed it does
the installation is smooth and it is
error free at least it was for me so to
get it installed you need to make sure
you have your Microsoft Store open I'm
not sure how many times you've opened
that up but I'm really really glad that
I have this time and you just want to
search for Kali Linux all right very
simple simple stuff like that and just
give it a few seconds to load the
results up and they you right should be
under the apps section so just open that
up and under the app section you should
have it and it it should prompt you to
install it you can just hit install or
download the file is about 122 megabytes
so just get that to download it and once
you launch it which is what I'm doing it
should start up the windows subsystem
for Linux now by default if you don't
have that in if you don't have that
enabled on Windows
you can go into your control panel go
onto into an uninstalled programs and
turn on Windows Features on or off and
you want to go just wait for the Windows
Features this little menu to open up and
you want to go to the bottom and you
want to look for Windows subsystem for
Linux and you want to make sure that
that is checked all right so you want to
make sure that that is enabled and just
hit OK and then you can launch it all
right so I've launched it and by default
it's not gonna give you this screen it's
gonna prompt you to install it and then
it's gonna prompt you to enter your
username and your password so I've
already done that so I don't need to do
it now the most important thing that
many of you will be wondering is can I
install the penetration testing
frameworks and the truth is yes so if I
just try and first of all update my
repositories so I've to get update which
is ma again another error that some of
you faced in the previous video and the
reason why is because you have to create
your own your own repository file and
you had to finally add your repositories
in there and then you can go ahead and
update so in this case let's just update
which is eirick I really recommend it
and it's going to ask you for your
administrator password I'm gonna enter
I'm just gonna enter my password and
there you as you can see it is
successfully getting the headers and
there you are fantastic so just give
that a few seconds to update the
repositories and then finally you can
upgrade them alright so I'll get back to
you when this is done or actually it
should be done now don't worry if you
get the the set configuration or the set
policy error that is something they have
acknowledged as well the next thing
again is you can sudo apt-get upgrade
which will upgrade your packages and I'm
just gonna enter and as you can see
there you are I've upgraded mine so they
up to the latest version of course the
latest of what has been installed now by
default this does not have any
penetration testing tools installed
pre-installed that is so to get it
installed is really very simple what you
could do is just sudo apt-get installed
let's see something really simple
because I don't want to install
something like Metasploit framework
that'll take a while so I'm just gonna
try something like Wireshark hopefully
that is in the repositories I'm just
gonna hit enter and as you can see yes
also this is quite a large download so
653 megabytes and no I'm not doing that
right now but if you just hit yes as you
can see the download the download
process begins and that's how you
install your penetration testing tools
so I have tested this and it works now
one thing that you will be facing or
will be an issue but are really not an
issue a serious issue is the fact that
Windows Defender of course as we know
will block most of the penetration
testing tools when they're downloaded
and that's because it'll categorize them
under malware or viruses so what you can
do is you can just launch your your run
command here and just open up your app
data folder for some reason that's all
sorry my bad app data app data and you
want to go into your local you want to
go into your let me see if I can
remember that programs how was it
programs or packages I can packages yes
packages and you want to go into your
kali linux package right here and you
want to copy this directory here because
this is the folder in which kali linux
is installed using the windows subsystem
for linux so just copy this address and
then now you want to open up your
Windows Defender so let me just do that
right now so defender there we are open
Windows Defender and we can go in to
virus and threat protection we can
scroll all the way to virus and threat
protection settings and we move on so
for those of you want to disable it
completely you can just you can just
disable real-time protection and then
you don't have to add an exclusion which
is what we're doing alright so you don't
go into exclusions and add or remove
file exclusions and you can see by
default I've already added mine so any
files downloaded in this folder will not
be scanned or
we will not be detected for malware or
viruses so just close that up and by
default you can see that this is still
downloading Wireshark and yeah that was
how to get Kali Linux set up of course
using the Windows Store courtesy of the
Windows Store and this is really
something very very exciting and again
it's something that I talked about that
has you know a huge potential and we'll
be looking at this in future videos
because this is something that I want to
cover and I want to explore the
possibilities here so I'll be making a
review video
I'll be going through it and as a
follow-up for this video I'll be making
a video on how to install the different
desktop environments on it so you can
actually get the desktop interface
working or desktop environment working
now the most common one that has been
currently configured correctly is the
xfce so I'll probably start off with
that and then I want to look at some
others like the you know like KDE etc
etcetera but that's for the next video
so as you can see the download is
currently working and I you know
straight out of the box it should all be
working and you should be able to run
penetration tests from the subsystem
anyway regardless of that that's going
to be it for this video I hope you found
value in this video if you plea if you
did please leave a like down below as
for your questions and your comments you
know the drill you can hit me up in the
in the comment section or you can hit me
up on my social networks or on the
website and yeah thank you so much for
watching and I'll be seeing you in the
next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
