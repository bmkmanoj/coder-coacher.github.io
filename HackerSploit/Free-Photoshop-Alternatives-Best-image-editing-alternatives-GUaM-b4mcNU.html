with another video now we all know that
the best image manipulation tool is
Photoshop but however it does have one
drawback and that is the price so in
this video I'm going to be showing you
the top alternatives for Photoshop that
up completely free of charge and we'll
be giving you all almost similar
features to Photoshop for free so
without further ado let's get to this
alright guys so the first website or
actually service on the on this list
it's not a program as I said it is a
website called Pixlr
now what pixel is offering is a fully
fledged image editor online so you don't
need to download any files or programs
everything runs off your browser and all
you need is an internet connection and a
an updated browser obviously so as you
can see you can create an account or you
can log in if you already have one but
they do offer you test and a desktop
application if you don't want to do it
through your browser which will be
helpful if you don't have a very very
fast internet connection what I'm gonna
be showing you basically they have the
pixel editor and Pixlr Express so the
trick Pixlr Express runs through a web
application but all I'm gonna be showing
you is the pixel editor that runs to the
web and basically this is a full fully
featured image editor and I'm going to
show you that in a second so let's get
started so as you can see it gives you
this very nice box on page similar to
photoshop where you can create a new
image open an image from your computer
or you URL off basically an image from
the internet and an image from library
or Facebook so pretty pretty good
options you have here and very nice so
who's that up and as you can see it has
almost all the tools you would expect
from
of a very good image editor like
Photoshop which is what we're drawing
comparison to here because it is the
best but as you can see it has
everything that you can ever need so you
can go ahead and create a new image and
you have the your presets and you can
also create your have your own
resolution in width and height so let's
go for a stranded one I'm gonna go for
1280 by 720 that's basically a standard
sized and you can you also have the
option of making it transparent so very
nice over there and you can basically do
all that you want that's basically the
crop or select tool and all apply any
changes and basically it has everything
that you could ever need you have your
types of brushes very nice very very
very advanced and you have your eraser
you have the fill and basically you can
choose whatever color you want to fill
with so it's almost like Photoshop but
just likes a few basic features that
Photoshop has in my opinion this is the
best online image editor that you can go
for so let's get to the next one alright
alright so the next program on the list
is a paint.net now what this means
basically what this program is it's a
free program obviously that was
basically meant to complement paint on
Microsoft Windows so in hindsight it is
a an advanced version of paint and
basically it has a lot of features that
will really really help you if you're a
mature image editor and you just
basically need the the fundamentals the
fundamental tools that obviously quite
an image editing you have your crop you
have your zoom you have your saturation
you have your erasers you have your
stamps you have your text editors you
have your polygons that you can use to
create and very very nice and smooth UI
as you can see over here very nice let
me just finish that and let me show you
something very cool all right so that's
your basically your your effect solid
color you have diagonal cross and you
can also use the percentage so if you do
that and as you can see this is
basically a complement to paint and
features that pain did not have an
amazing you have your overview right
here and you can I'll show you what
you're running so you have brought brush
with and all the good stuff that you can
you can ever want basically in a image
editor however the one one thing I
didn't really like about this image
editor is that it it didn't have any
support for for multiple plugins and
basically you could not use any cool
effects in terms of adjustments of the
image but apart from that I think this
is a perfect image editor for the
amateur image editor so very nice
program I highly highly recommend it the
link will be in the description so yeah
go and check it out alrighty guys so the
next program we have here is GIMP now I
know many or most of you guys know what
GIMP is it's a very popular image editor
or it is the go-to image editor on Linux
and the best part is it's free and this
is one of the closest programs or image
editors that can come close to Photoshop
and I'm not joking guys this is a
fantastic image editor the only thing I
I have a problem with is the fact that
it has a very steep learning curve and
the fact that you have to really react
apt if you be if you've been using
Photoshop to using this and it will be a
help if you're trying to use this in the
hopes of getting better at Photoshop so
if you're planning to move to for
Photoshop I would recommend staying away
from this program not that it is a bad
program just because it's a very
different program in its functionality
most most likely because it is a native
to Linux and is the go-to image editor
for Linux I have nothing against it all
I'm saying is that if the foe if you're
gonna if you basically you're headed
towards using Photoshop I would
recommend if you've got if you're going
to use it as a compliment Photoshop go
ahead but if you're planning to use this
as means of helping you use Photoshop I
wouldn't recommend it because it's very
different so as you can see it has all
the tools you can
one need this basically has I think it
also has a few tools that Photoshop
really doesn't and as you can see you
have your filters and it's going to give
you a preview of your image which you
can just edit there and if I if I mask
the radius more and give it a very nice
feel if I give it about thirty five
terms of the effect and percent black
I'm gonna reduce that slightly to about
150 and hit OK and you can see it makes
it even better
so basically I like this program because
it's very simple and as I said it's very
different but very very very good so
that's been basically GIMP or Jim or
whatever you want to call it so this is
one of the programs I I'll say is a must
have on your computer whether they use
it or not it's a must have and if you
can you if you can learn how to use it
you can really really get some good
effects so that's basically GIMP alright
