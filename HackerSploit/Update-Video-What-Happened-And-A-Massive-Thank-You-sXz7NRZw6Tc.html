with another video and you guys might be
asking yourself why the hell hasn't this
guy uploaded a video in like almost a
month and I actually have a fantastic
reason as for not doing it and that's
because my channel actually got reported
two times so if you guys are you guys
know about YouTube's content and
basically they're the reporting and
basically Content ID and it's really
complicated but basically what happened
is that someone reported my channel for
sexual content and an offensive language
now that first of all immediately just
made my my channel disappear and I
couldn't do anything so I actually had
to report it to YouTube
obviously they give you about two weeks
to report it which I actually did
actually they call it appealing it I had
to appeal for my channel and prove that
I had nothing to do with those to do
with what other person had claimed now
the reason as to why this was was so
serious is because this person actually
targeted my channel and created about
six fake Google accounts or gmail
accounts just for the purpose of
reporting me and if you if a video gets
reported I think about three to five
times for the same for the same
basically report of sexual content and
harassment they will basically report
that's basically one report but I got
two so that means my channel was
ineligible to upload any videos and I
was unable to use my channel so
basically had to appeal it and YouTube
at the time I which I appealed it
YouTube was you could say really really
busy because of the the current
monetization strategy that they were
working on the new monetization strategy
because as you guys know YouTube has
been undergoing a few a few problems in
the in the last one or two months
regarding YouTube
and ads and monetization and the fact
that companies are leaving YouTube
monetization that has nothing to do with
why I stopped uploading the videos as I
said I had no control over my channel
and I had to get it appealed and I
actually got it back just before the
two-week period had had actually ended
so I got it back and obviously had a few
comments from you guys which I replied
to and the other thing all to talk about
guys is a lot of people watch my videos
some of them will come to my video to
comment basically a link or basically
advertise their channel or basically a
website no I usually remove these
comments and the reason I do that is I
know for a fact that people adverse
advertising those links are dangerous
and I don't want to be held responsible
for allowing someone to upload the
malicious link on my in the comments
section and then you guys innocently go
and click on them and you either get
attacked or you know it's basically it's
not a nice thing for anybody so I'm I'm
just going to make it very very frank
here that I'm not going to tolerate any
other links in the comment section you
can have links that are related to the
video I will review each and one of
those links if they're helpful to the
topic discussed in the video I don't
want videos comments basically telly
saying that there's a hacker here and
you can contact him and he'll hack any
accounts for you I don't tolerate that
at all that is nonsense if you want to
hack bank accounts be sure to find
someone else to go and do it for you
right this channel is not about hacking
bank account and it's not about anything
illegal this general is about educating
and that's what I'm going to stick to I
am NOT going to tolerate any malicious
any malicious links that are provided in
the description or in the comment
section of the video unless I approve
them and I make sure that they are safe
for you guys to to basically click on so
if you see a comment in the comment
section just know that I have approved
it and it
safe to visit if you don't see just know
that it wasn't safe
the other thing guys are honest thank
you guys so much for the support you've
given me even though I haven't uploaded
the videos you guys have basically been
giving me suggestions your bid contacted
me asking me questions and you know
basically it's been a real really
community and its really turning out to
be what I wanted it to be which is
basically a community that's based
around learning and learning from each
other really so I'm really really happy
and thank you guys so much you've
actually made me achieve my dream which
is to actually have a YouTube channel
with a consistent following of
subscribers and also viewers and people
just watch my videos as I said I'm not
concerned about the YouTube ad revenue I
really don't care about that and I
really didn't do youtube for for any of
the money that you get on it I just did
YouTube to help people and I think
that's pretty evident from my videos so
yeah guys that's basically it it's a
quick update video so a lot of big
things happened I mean managed to save
the channel believe me it was actually
gonna I was actually going to lose this
channel and all the work that had put
into it that's far from the point now
I've got the channel back and I'm really
looking forward to uploading more videos
so thank you guys for the support I'm
really sorry I wasn't able to upload
anything but I was actually able to
reply to you guys comments so that's a
that's a plus I take it as a plus I hope
you guys look at it in the same way I am
but yeah I expect videos anytime from
now thank you guys so much for watching
I'm going to continue the ethical
hacking course I'm going to make some
deep web videos from what you guys
requested and yeah that's basically it
guys thank you so much for watching this
video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
