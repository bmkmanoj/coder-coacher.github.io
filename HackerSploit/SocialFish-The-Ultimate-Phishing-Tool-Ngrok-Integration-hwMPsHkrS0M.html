with another video and in this video
we're gonna be looking at social fish
alright so a lot of you guys have been
asking me to make a video on social
phase and and to actually discuss how it
works that is the main thing that you
wanted to know all right so I'm on the
github repository the link will be in
the description and for those of you
don't know what social fish is social
fish is a fishing tool that has ng ng
ROC integrated so a lot of people do not
understand what's happening with n zero
well essentially ng ROC allows you if we
go to the ng ROC website it allows you
to use local servers actually tunnel
local servers so that Allah gives you
the ability to to hide behind entities
and firewall so in theory how it works
is you connect to the ng ROC service
right and then they allow you to
obviously go through a firewall or any
T's in this case the firewall is you
know pre-configured on client side
operating systems to refuse connections
coming you known ports that are closed
and vice versa now again as you can see
through the little picture here you
connect to the ng Rock servers and you
can get access to the client and then
they can then send the details over to
you without you know without actually
raising an alarm to your firewall or to
the firewall on the client alright so
how it works you download and run a
program on your machine and provide it
to the port and network service right so
web server so we're gonna be low using
the local web server and that's what it
uses on Kali Linux it uses the Apache
web server right so then it connects to
the NGO of cloud service which accepts
traffic on public addresses so again
you're using a public address which is
great and then it relays the traffic
through the ng ROC process running on
your machine and then to the local
address that you've specified so to the
local address it is completely Seco is
secure it's using the HTTP protocol so
it's you know it's extremely secure and
this is fantastic because when it comes
down to social engineering this will be
really great so let's get started again
the github repository would be
and I'll show you all forget the
prerequisites installed so just clone
the repository as I'm doing right now
and I'm just going to go into my desktop
and I'll be providing this little how
does NG Rock works image for you guys so
you can understand how it works really
all right so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna change my directory to the opt
folder where all third-party software
stored and I'm just gonna clone the
repository here so git clone and I'm
gonna paste that in there and I'm gonna
head enter and just let it flow in the
files now depending on your internet
speed mine is a bit slow today so please
forgive me for that yours should be
extremely fast so there we are it's done
all right so if we list the files now we
have social fish so I'm gonna change my
directory into social fish and I'm gonna
list the files alright the first thing
you need to do which is really simple is
you need to use the package installer
the Python package installer which is
whipped install and we use the our
command and we select the requirements
dot txt file and we hit enter and this
is going to install ng rock alright so
give that a few seconds now I already
have ng rock installed because I use it
for other projects of mine alright so as
you can see the requirement is already
satisfied W yet so it is supposed to get
the W gate service fantastic
it's called t-table gate service so if
you look at the requirements here they
prerequisites that is you need Python
2.7 running W get from Python and PHP
and sudo which are pretty much the
standard so you can see that it was
tested on kali linux linux mint ubuntu
and mac OS so you know that's also
fantastic so it's really very simple to
get it running all you have to do is
just make sure that the python file is
is executable so that this is the python
file the social fish dot p Y so chmod
plus x social fish all right and we hit
enter and if we check now yes it is
executable so we're going to launch it
by it in python social fish alright and
there we are
voila and it's gonna start downloading
ng rock fantastic so give that a few
seconds again depending on your internet
connection it could take a while or it
could go really really fast
fantastic so now it's gonna start
preparing the environment and it's gonna
ask you whether or not you're going to
you agree to the terms of you
which in this case are to use this tool
for educational purposes which is
exactly what I'm doing so I'm gonna eat
yes and now you can select a fishing
option of course it's sorted in terms of
the most popular websites you have your
Facebook Google LinkedIn github Stack
Overflow WordPress and Twitter now
before we begin its gonna start the
localhost on the web server so make sure
you have no localhost or you have no
services running of Apache in this case
even tour alright but the port is pretty
much the port 80 so we know that so for
example we use the most popular one
which is Facebook so if we hit one for
Facebook it's not going to ask you for
the standard fate page phishing and you
have advanced fishing which allows you
to use the poll mode and login with
functionality so let's look at the
standard which is standard page fishing
so this will just create a standard you
know fishing page but the great thing is
to mask the URL which again we'll be
looking at probably in another video
because this is great as I said it's
using a secure protocol so I'm gonna hit
one alright and it's gonna start
generating the page obviously and it's
going to move it into my local host
which is my Apache
localhost server and once it's done it's
going to give me an NG Rock link
fantastic so it's going to tell you that
the development server is started at you
know so and so listening on port one
twenty seven point zero point zero point
one port 80 fantastic so the document
you can look at the the document root
and there you go and you can use the
ctrl + C combination to quit pretty
standard stuff so the ng Rock URL is
right here and if I open this up you
will see what I'm talking about so if
everything worked correctly it should
give me a facebook phishing page here
fantastic and now let's test if we can
enter some credentials so I'm gonna try
and enter something like test at
gmail.com
oops test at gmail.com and find that a
password like something like test let's
just enter test one two three and I'm
going to login and again it should just
redirect to be page again fantastic so
looking at the credentials that were
gathered as you can see here the
credentials were emailed test at email
comm and password test one two three
fantastic so as you can see it does work
and once you're ready to quit just hit
ctrl + C and you should be go you should
be good now again if you run it and you
look at the other vectors that you can
attack in terms of these sites you have
things like github which you know is
really great because it's giving you a
lot of options now as I said the main
trick here is to mask the URL so let's
look at something like Google alright so
Google stand phage page phishing
so if I'd one all right again it's gonna
start the localhost and it's gonna you
know clone the site so just give that a
few seconds is this really a fantastic
tool that we're looking at here and
there you go so just let it open up here
so let me just open this link there we
are fantastic let me just open that link
sorry if my virtual machine is quite
slow it has been I have to actually
perform some troubleshooting on it for
those of you asking and it closed the
previous one for those of you asking who
have actually asked me on in the comment
section why their virtual machines are
slow I'll be making a video on
troubleshooting that fantastic so as you
can see it has opened up a gmail prompt
here to use to essentially use your
username and password combination now
the problem with this is it's using a
very old vector here so this is the old
Google logo as you can see and this was
how it was probably around 8 2013 so
that's a weakness that you know users or
targets may be may be exposed to and
that can lead to you getting you know
detected or getting this page detected
as a phishing page but irregardless of
that this should work you know if you
were to send it over email and chat more
specifically email this this should work
however if you try you you should try
and mask the the the URL all right and
once you've done that you pretty much
have a good shot at you know a
successfully social engineering your
target and then getting them to enter
their credentials again I do throw out
some caution please do not try this you
know without permission
written permission that is and yeah
that's how to use social fish and that
is how ng ROC works it's a fantastic
service you can also use it for you know
real world projects tunneling traffic to
test or create scripts so that's going
to be it for this video guys
I hope you found value in this video if
you did please leave a like down below
if you have any questions or suggestions
let me know in the comment section
now you can post your questions as well
on the website alright and the the great
thing I've done there is of created a
forum where you can post your video
suggestions or video ideas there or of
videos that you want me to create so now
you recommend that you post your video
ideas there you can also hit me up on
kik and yeah thank you so much for
watching this video guys you know let me
know what what other videos you want me
to make on the website and I'll be I'll
gladly do it so I'll see you in the next
video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
