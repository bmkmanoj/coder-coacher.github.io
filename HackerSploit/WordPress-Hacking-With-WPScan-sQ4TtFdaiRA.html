another video and in this video I'm
gonna be looking at how to exploit
WordPress more specifically we're going
to be finding the username and the
password on a vulnerable WordPress
server or in this case we're actually
using a virtual machine that has
WordPress running on it now the reason
I'm doing this and a lot of people ask
me this question is why hasn't your
channel got any copyright strikes and
that's because I perform everything in
my virtual lab that means I'm not
attacking anyone or causing harm to
anyone apart from you know the targets
in my lab so I have downloaded a
vulnerable WordPress server that is
running on Debian from turnkey Linux I'm
pretty sure you know that site right now
they have a lot of virtual machine they
have a lot of VMs that you can use for
testing at set and you know you can
learn and practice a lot of stuff so I
have it right here and I've started I've
configured it up and I've used the
default I've use the default credentials
so I actually don't know what the user
name and password combination is and
we're going to be doing it live so
there's some information here that it's
giving you which is pretty helpful we
know that the the server the IP address
the local IP address is 192 point one
sixty eight point one point 108 alright
so let's get started so what I'm going
to do first is I'm just going to start
off with 192.168.1.1 or eight right and
obviously it's going to be a wordpress
site as you can see here and now the
most important thing is to start
enumerate in the username and hopefully
we can crack a password now I you know
like to just tell you that I'm using a
word list a special well a basic word
list that I found quite a few years ago
that has been actually quite helpful so
I have that already downloaded and
hopefully we can find the username and
password here so it's using default
credentials so it'll be much easier but
I'm just explaining and this is just a a
bit of a practical explanation as to one
how one would go about doing this using
WordPress scan all right so we know it's
running WordPress and you know if you if
you if you're familiar with web
penetration testing you know that what
this sites have the WordPress admin page
right that allows you to log in so we
know we can actually log in here sorry
about that
all right so anyway it's working really
really well
so what press is actually running and I
do not know the login credentials so
we're gonna hopefully try and find them
now we do have the server IP and
obviously we do know that it's running
WordPress right so the first thing we
need to do is we need to open up
WordPress scan or WP scan alright so as
you can see I have it on my favorites on
my dock here and to launch it it's
really very simple you can just go to
your terminal and you just hit WP or
WordPress can so double whoops my bad
sorry about that guys apologies there I
was smashing on my spacebar alright so w
WP scan alright and if I just hit enter
it's going to give me the help options
there we are so there's a lot of options
and we'll be covering most of them here
you can also use the W scan help all
right so to enumerate the help options
there we are so we have the help options
and we're gonna be using some some basic
commands here but Analects be explaining
what they do alright so let's get
started now the first thing we need to
do is we need to enumerate the user
names and this can be done you know you
by exploiting the vulnerable plugins now
by default as I've already said this
WordPress version is vulnerable and it
is set up to be vulnerable and it's just
a way of me explaining how this goes
really ok so let me just clear that up
and we can get started and we maximize
the terminal because we're gonna need
all this the real estate that we have
that we actually need alright excellent
let's begin so now we're going to start
off with when you just enumerate the
help
yeah just to get started so we are going
to actually start a numerating username
so the username of course we're looking
at the basic syntax here so again since
we are using the you command because we
are targeting a URL so the syntax will
be pretty simple we'll be using the you
command we'll be using the e command if
I can find it here yeah there we are
there to enumerate options and then
we're going to be enumerated in
usernames so again it's going to get
user names here and finally we are going
to be targeting only the vulnerable
plugins all right so that is right here
VP only the vulnerable plugins so let's
get started I'm just going to clear the
terminal again and there we are so WP
scan and after that we use the IP
address so one ninety two dot one sixty
eight point one point 108 excellent now
we use the e to enumerate all right the
e command now use you all right because
we are specifying in him enumerate user
name so you is not actually an argument
or a parameter it's more of an
expression of enumerate right so EU so
enumerate user names and I want you to
target only vulnerable plugins there we
are
so hopefully this returns the default
user name so great enter and this should
be relatively quickly because again the
user name is not is going to be the
default user name so I'm just gonna hit
enter and whoops sorry about that
oh my bad apologies I forgot to specify
the you command there to target the URL
so once we enter this should give us
alright so there we are
and it's targeting the Oh immediately
we've got it alright awesome as you can
see the default WordPress username is
admin so that's the really really easy
way of targeting vulnerable plugins to
find the username again you know
targeting the vulnerable plugins are
super important and this gives you an
awesome as you can see WordPress super
cache actually have used this plug-in
before and actually did they fix these
issues no but this was something really
really big I actually
remember a lot of people explaining this
back in the day the doc wordpress super
cache is essentially just speeds up your
website and purges the files on your
website to make it load faster anyway as
you can see it's performed its
enumerated to username and we have the
username as admin
fantastic now we need to enumerate the
password we need to actually brute force
for the password right so I already have
a word a word list that I've created or
a hat form from a long time ago and it
has all the default username and
password combinations for most of the
top websites you know in the world so
for example Yahoo Gmail you know - it
adds all of that stuff so I have it
right here
and I've already modified it and sorted
it so that it takes you know a less
amount of time for the WordPress scan to
actually get the password all right so
I'm going to clear this out so we've got
the username and now getting the
password awesome so now we essentially
need to get the password so WordPress
can let me just enlarge the terminal
here and clear that again we'll press
scan there we are we'll press can you
point 108 that's the IP address or the
URL for that matter now we are also
enumerated username swoops and
numerating the username because it's
also very important to enumerate user
names with the password combination all
right now we specify word list so we are
specifying a word list here alright now
after I specified the word list we can
then select the directory of the word
list - I'm on my route and on my it's
actually in my root directory so I'm
going to select the word list dot txt
file there we are
and let's hit enter and let's see what
we get it should actually do this really
really quickly this this word list is oh
there we are
fantastic did that really liquidy and
again it used the brute force and it
took like zero seconds I believe
there we also log in the admin username
is admin password is admin 1 2 3 and
let's actually try that right now that
was really really quickly
yeah that was really really quick so
WordPress admin and the username is
admin password is admin 1 2 3 I believe
or actually I believe the username of
admin with the lowercase if I'm correct
yeah I can actually see that it's
telling me to area alright and we have
successfully we have successfully
exploited word base now granted that
it's running the you know quite an old
version of WordPress WordPress four
point seven point four a regardless of
that with with the plugins that it does
have installed we were able to exploit
it really really easily using WordPress
can and it's a fantastic tool really now
one would go about usually what a lot of
the black hats to is they would go to
plugins and they would add new and
they'll go to the file manager alright
so let me just show you this right now
we'll go to the file manager and they
would look whoops they would actually
install the file manager go to plugins
and install the file manager plug-in and
then they would get a reverse shell and
replace it with the 404 page and then
actually trigger that page and they
essentially have access or a reverse
reverse shell or a matter British shell
right so they would install the file
manager and if I just you know if I just
search for reverse shell whoops this
fill PHP there we are
reverse show PHP and this should
actually return quite an easier there we
are PHP reversed shell that's the one
they use a lot so I'm just going to
activate the file manager here and I'm
just gonna download it pretty small file
I'm gonna save it's essentially a very
very simple PHP of course it has to be
in PHP because you're replacing the
actual 404 PHP file alright so there we
are I'm gonna open this up and then just
open that up let me extract this here
and we have the PHP reverse shell there
PHP reversal copying the PHP
reversal you can read the readme and you
can configure the PHP reverse cell
obviously to connect to your IP address
here as you can see there's a few there
we are change this so the IP address
you'd essentially change that and the
port you want it to connect to and yes
you upload it and replace it you replace
it with the editor here settings and you
go to general I believe that the general
yes you go to general or appearance and
customize their your appearance and
editor there we are that's what we have
to go to and one would go to the 404 if
I can find that there we are for for
template and they would replace the in
they will just get rid of all of this
and they will replace this 404 script
here and update the file and what
happens is when you go to for example
192 one 168 point one 2108 and you go to
the 404 page there we are it would
essentially load this script and you
know they go for a four dot PHP for that
matter so that would grant you you know
that would actually act as a backdoor
into the WordPress system and they go so
that's essentially how to exploit a
vulnerable WordPress system I know this
was quite basic but again it's very
important to understand the flow the
flow of procedures and how things work
so we started off with a numerating
usernames passwords and then we logged
in and then you need to you need to find
a way to maintain access and then
there's clearing up your tracks but in
this case in most cases the blackhat
hackers will you know just take over the
entire WordPress site and they claimed
responsibility immediately so that's how
it's done and hopefully this also gives
you great awareness and few security
tips you can take away from this if your
WordPress site owner get make sure all
your subdomains are you know if you if
you have a subdomain and you're
performing some testing on it and you
know you're running some really some
really really vulnerable scripts please
do not list them just work on them in
your own you know modularized
environment and do not upload them to
your server until there
ready right the next thing is to keep
your WordPress updated and keep your
plugins updated that's very very
important and I would really really
recommend that you do not install any
plugins that do not have good ratings
you regardless of whether or not they
perform a task you know really recommend
that you use the most popular and the
highest rated ones because they are they
promise the the best security all right
and the last one is to take regular
backups of your site so that in case of
anything of any breach any hack you can
easily you know you can easily get ahold
of your site and you can reapplied it to
another WordPress server and you're
pretty much good to go so that's gonna
be it for this video guys thank you so
