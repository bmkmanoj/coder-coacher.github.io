with another video and welcome back to
Python for ethical hacking and in this
video we are going to be looking at the
while loop and using ranges we're also
going to be looking at comments which is
really very simple and I feel that we
can actually cover it in this video now
I got a comment in the last video
basically saying that the videos are too
basic and that's because the reason
they're basic is because I have there
are some beginners here too Python and I
need to explain everything in the way
that they can understand but what I'm
gonna be doing now is I'm gonna be
covering all the advanced stuff and then
we'll move on to be to creating the
tools that we set out to create but
that's basically that and we can get
started here so we're going to be
looking at the while loop so the while
loop is pretty similar to the for loop
except you initialize things quite
differently so let's have an example
it's always fun to do these things with
examples what if we wanted to print out
numbers let's say a number from from
let's say 1 to 20 how about that well
how do we do this well it's very very
easy instead of using the normal print
whoops let me just get off get rid of
caps lock so it would be very difficult
to go ahead and print 1 2 etc etc so
we're gonna be using the while loop you
can also use the for loop over to use
the for loop for this and I'll be
explaining how to do that with the range
function so let's get started with the
while loop so the first thing we need to
do is we need to initialize a counter in
the form of a variable so in this case
the the variable is going to be X and
the value is going to be equal to 1
alright so once we've given X the value
of 1 which will act as our counter or
our starting point we can then go ahead
and use while X all right being the
counter while X is less than or equal to
20 all right
well X is less than or equal to 20 we
use our colon to take us to the next
line all right
and then we say print X all right now if
we were to save this and run this you'll
notice something interesting happen let
me run this and you'll notice that it's
a continuous program meaning the loop is
not ending
the loop does not have an end point or
an Oran or an exit point in which it can
stop the loop pedal from running and
what's happening here is you're getting
one one one one one and that's because
if you look at what we've done right now
the value of x is just one and we needed
to change after the program loops every
time and the way we do that is by using
the increment operator which we want to
increment the loop we want to increment
X by one every time the route the loop
runs pardon me so X is equals to X plus
one some of you might be familiar with
this in other programming languages it's
really very simple all you have to do is
use the X plus plus which means X plus
one but here we have to use the X is
equals to X plus 1 so we're assigning a
new value to the variable X and missing
at the current value plus 1 every time
the program loops so if we save this and
run it you're gonna see it prints every
number from 1 to 20 and that's pretty
awesome if you ask me so you get the
idea the first thing we did is we
declared a variable which is going to be
our counter and the value is going to be
1 all right so this will be your
starting point so if I would have
changed this to 0 and we ran this you
will see that it'll start from 0 if I
started it if I give the value from 5 it
would start from 5 but I'm just gonna
stick with 1 and then we went on to
using the while loop so we're saying
while X is less than or equal to 20
perform this loop and it's gonna do it
the first time and it's the the value is
going to be 1 so it'll say ok that's
gonna do it the second time the value is
gonna be 2 all the way until 20 and
that's when it it stops running the loop
and it stops at 20 with the value of X
being 20 because we indeed did print out
the value of x here so that's how to use
the while loop and how to use how to
print out numbers from 1 to 10 pretty
from 1 to 20 rather so very very
interesting now the other thing on to
show you guys is how to use comments all
right now comments are a very simple way
of documentation and let me just get
that code back
and pretty sure most of you who are
already doing programming are familiar
with what comments are used for these
for documentation and act as a mean of
just letting you know what each line of
code or each section of code is doing so
let's say we could go up here and to
declare a comment we use the hash tag or
the hash and we say and then you type
out your comment so I can type out right
here the coloration of the variable and
it just gives you an idea of what that
line of code is doing right and as you
can see there's something called block
comments and if we just separate that
now that's a block comment now if we
look ahead and if we save this you'll
see that Python will not and any other
programming language will not process
the comments the comments are strictly
for the programmer or the developers use
and as I said it's very very good as a
form of documentation and you can add
them anywhere you want so that's it for
comments one more thing I wanted to show
you guys is how to use the arrange range
is a very very helpful things and and
allows you to use a range of numbers for
any type of conditional relational
operation so let me show you how to use
this let's say we wanted to print out on
1 to 10 the numbers 1 to 10 as we have
done here but with the for loop well
with a for loop we already remember that
the variable would be declared the
counter would be declared here and we
would say for X in blah blah blah right
I'm sure you guys remember that but now
what we have to do is we declare the
variable for X in and then we use the
range function and then we open your
brackets and in here is where you put
your starting point and your ending
point in this case we are starting from
1 comma 20 and then we use the colon to
add another resultant line here and we
say print let me just do that print X
and now here we don't have to increment
anything the reason being is because we
are saying for the variable X in the
range of 1 to 20 that means it's gonna
essentially just print out X in the
range of 1 to 20 song from 1 all the way
to 20 so you do not have to increment
the loop every time so if we run this
you can see again it'll do the same
thing and if you look over here it's
gonna say 19 in this because it starts
from 0 all the way to whatever you
choose in in range you always start from
0 so from if we were to start from 1 to
20 that would be 19 numbers and that's
what it would display so that's
basically it for the range and that's
basically it for this video guys in the
next video we'll be looking at
dictionaries and probably modules after
that and then we can move on to
functions after that we will be moving
on to creating our projects our network
tools etc etc so we're almost ready to
start creating our tools we just have to
go buy a few of the basics and a few
advanced stuff anyway guys thank you so
much for watching you know the drill if
you have any questions or suggestions
please leave them down in the comment
section or hit me up on my social
networks if you have any if you want to
contact me you can also use kik if you
want the latest news hacking news and
hacking resources check out my website
link would be in the description and
I'll be seeing you in the next video
