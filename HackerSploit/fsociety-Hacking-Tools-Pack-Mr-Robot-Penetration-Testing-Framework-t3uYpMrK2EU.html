another video and in this video are
going to be looking at the F Society
hacking tools back alright so this is
essentially a penetration testing
framework that will give you all it'll
give you all the tools that are used in
the mr. robot series now for those of
you asking what exactly is the mr. robot
series what well it is a TV show that is
quite interesting actually and its main
focus is about a hacker no I'm not gonna
you know give you guys any spoilers and
tell you stuff that you probably want to
you know explore yourself that's if you
haven't watched mr. robot but let's get
started so yes this is a very
interesting script editor I thought most
of you guys would like to see and not
because it is about being a script
kiddie but for the fact that if you're a
beginner this can be a fantastic place
to start off alright so I have to get
the github page at the github repository
the link will be in the description and
the all credits go to the author I'm not
taking credit for it I'm just showing
you how to how to configure it and how
to get it up and running so that you you
two can explore it as well so you can
just clone the repository and just copy
the link or you can download it as zip
and save it wherever you like now I've
already done my research on this and I
was exploring it quite a bit and I have
to say I'm quite impressed and I'll
explain why
but first what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to go to the to my poop's
to my opt folder sorry there we are and
I'm just gonna create I'm just gonna
clone it in here right cuz I actually
want to perform some more some more
research on this script so git clone
alright now it turns out that this
script does really even work with
Windows and with Linux using the T
terminal emulator on Linux I or on
Android sorry about that so it does work
on Android as well and Windows using a
terminal emulator and I'll be actually
making videos on that I how to get it
running this can be very very
interesting you know given the fact that
you can now use it a script
this remotely alright so once you've
cloned the repository if we list it down
there you can see it's called the F
Society so we're gonna just browse into
the folder F Society and we're gonna
list what's in here and it's pretty
pretty simple right you have your Python
you have your installer SH which is your
shell executable you have your the
license the mobile dot py and your plate
dot dot shell right this is what we need
to do is since you're on linux guessing
Kali Linux or any other penetration
testing distribution we need to change
the permissions so install dot sh and
now we can execute it so let's list
there we are so let's execute the
installed on SA there we are alright so
it's going to start installing it and
credit through the author it is the - Oh
tools installer alright so I'll just
give it a few seconds and there we are
so a director has been found and that's
because I already had it installed so
yes installing it and it's gonna clone
into the it's gonna clone the other
folders into your user and your shared
documents right alright so as you can
see once it's done install installing
it's gonna ask you always done you can
execute the tool by typing F Society
pretty simple right awesome alright let
me just back out of this directory and
we're going to start it up so f society
alright as society and there we are
awesome fantastic right and when I don't
know let's just get started with what
this is exactly this is a framework
alright it's very important to
understand this it's not gonna give you
a you know hacking powers or you don't
have to know anything about hacking to
use it it is essentially just a
collection of all the tools of all the
popular or important tools that are used
in the mr. robot series or or you know
simply put these are tools that are very
very popular in hacking right so let's
look at what we have we have the it's
divided into sections which is awesome
so we have information gathering
password attacks wireless testing
exploitation tools
sniffing and spoofing we were packing
private were backing post exploitation
installing and updating and you can
finally exit the script
awesome right so let's start off with
information gathering all right so in
information gathering these are probably
the most popular tools as you can see
you have your n map obviously you have
set tool kit which is a social
engineering tool KT of your port
scanning host to IP also very cool
WordPress users XSS strike you have your
doc will Google Docs you have your
crisps and there's a lot of tools as you
can see these are probably the most
popular or the tools that you're most
likely to use and you can just select
them so if I selected as the set tool
kit they are gonna ask you for the
permissions of granade yes and it's
gonna start it's gonna download the
version from the github repository it
doesn't matter whether you have it
installed and that's what I was getting
to is that if you're on win if you're on
on Android for example or on Windows
it's not going to assume that you have
the package installed already and it's
gonna do it for you so that's very very
interesting and useful right but again
my connection right now is really really
really slow so I'm just going to avoid
doing that and we can just go back here
alright so again it's divided into
different sections and you're free to
check them out as you please we can look
at something like password attacks you
have your cup and n crack also very very
powerful tools looking at things like
exploitation tools we have your 80 scan
SQL map shell noob you have what what is
the other the Joomla SQL injection
scanner that is very very awesome I mean
you guys interested in SQL injection
that is something you need to check out
to be honest alright so let's go back
and you can check out all the other
sections and the tools sorted out now
the reason I'm showing you this is not
because um this is going to make you
better hacker not at all for a beginner
the reason why I recommend this is it
will give you an understanding of how
attacks are carried out and how the
tools are sorted into or depending on
what they can do right so for example if
you're a beginner and you never knew
what tools belong in the information
gathering section or what are the best
tools to use you just check and there
you are
and then
then on you can get to learn how each of
them work which is awesome right all
right let's go back and let's say you
wanted to know how to you know perform
sniffing and spoofing you can open that
up and there we are so we have the
social engineering toolkit we have the
five Fisher SMTP mailer awesome right so
you get the idea
SMTP mailer is a spoofer is a email
spoofer so you get the idea and then you
can go ahead and use it so again this is
a pretty pretty awesome tool that I
found it can be really helpful it I'm
not saying that you want to use it all
the time I personally am NOT going to
use it because most probably I know
already you know the tools are and the
tools I use the most are kept on my
toolbar right here you know depending on
what type of work you're doing but
nonetheless it is a very very good tool
to get started with hacking and even for
the experienced people out there it can
also be quite nice actually to have
something you know so centralized in
terms of a framework so yeah guys that's
gonna be it for this video thank you so
much for watching if you if you found
value in this video please leave a like
down below if you have any questions or
suggestions let me know in the comment

check out my website HS play calm and
one more thing I want to say is that
we're going to be having different
challenges every week now I've
introduced a new series we were going to
have a CTF or capture the flag series
where we'll be trying to solve all the
capture the flag challenges that we can
and of course the winner is going to get
a price so yeah that's going to be it
for this video guys thank you so much
