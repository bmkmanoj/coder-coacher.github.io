with another video and welcome back to
Python for ethical hacking in this video
we're finally going to be building our
nmap network scanner so this is going to
be part 1 of 2 so let's get started so
in this video we're gonna get started
building our in map network scanner so
we're gonna make it our own type of
custom scanner that will scan a specific
range of ports use a specific IP address
etc etc so let's get started so the
first thing we're gonna do is we have to
import the nmap module which I will be
talking about when it comes down to
modules but first let's import the nmap
module hopefully if you've watched the
first video we managed to download it
and we had it installed and as you can
see I'm currently working on Kali Linux
right now because first of all the
editor in the previous videos was having
a lot of contrast issues so yeah we are
back here and let's get started so what
we need to do now is I'm going to create
a variable and I'm gonna say NS somebody
that's gonna be their short form for
network scanner or nmap scanner in short
so I'm just gonna say n map alright dot
and the first thing we need to do is we
need to get the port scanner alright so
once we have the port scanner with good
next step when that we need to do is we
need to just print out the N map version
which i think is very very useful it's
not a must but dot n map whoop oops
I think it's n map version like so
alright parentheses and just below that
we can get started now so now we can
open up the n map scanner which is done
by using the variable n s dot nmap scan
dot scan all right and into parenthesis
now in here use the single quotes and we
can start using our hosts or IP that we
want to scan for open ports particularly
now so what I'm gonna be doing is I'm
just gonna be using my local IP which is
and I believe it's the same for you
depending on the router that you're
using 192
one sixty eight point zero point one and
please for the love of God I don't want
anyone at the comments telling me that
you can do us this IP and that I've
shown you my IP this is a public IP
address all right this isn't an actual
this is a network a network reserved IP
address so this is a set of ranges of
IPs on the network so don't even try
trying to do this this might backfire on
you if you know what I'm saying so the
next thing we need to do now is we need
to specify our port range and that's
really very simple so you can start off
from port one all the way to the extent
of the pots but to save time because if
we give the full range of ports to save
time what we're gonna do is we're just
gonna use I think pots until 1024 yeah
that'll be a good enough range to find
any services that might be running all
right now to separate your arguments use
the comma and obviously we're going to
open this again and in here we're just
gonna verbose the information and for
the people saying I don't know what this
V means trust me I do know what it means
what I meant is that it's gonna ensure
that it displays the version I know that
it means verbose I don't when I'm
explaining I don't mean that it's called
version I trust me I know what it means
all right so those are the arguments
that we're going to use for the for the
end and map scan the next thing that we
need to do is we need to print the scan
info so print and in there we're gonna
say n s dot scan I believe it's scan
info right there we are
and once that's done now we need to
print out the CSV file or the CSV and we
just say print right n s dot CSV so
that's just gonna print whatever is
output and we open that up and now if we
run this let's see what we get all right
so what I'm going to do is I'm just
gonna save this and
let's run this let's see what we get
alright we get something interesting as
you can see it's canned really really
quickly which is always awesome so it's
telling us the version we then have the
this the range that we entered so in
this case it TCP we have the services
that are running and provides you can
see quite an ugly type of user interface
but nonetheless it's working so then we
have a host hostname protocol type etc
etc so we have our IP range and it's
telling me that we have two ports open
which is awesome we know it's working of
the TCP 22 and TCP 80 which are
obviously as SH and HTTP which are both
open which actually something pretty
pretty awesome for an attacker but that
we actually know that it's working now
and we should be looking at adding more
features but that's going to be part one
of this video series I just wanted to
make that part clear and in the next
video we'll actually get started working
with more advanced things in the end map
scanner and yeah that's basically it for
this video guys I know it was a bit
short I don't want to keep them short
and sweet so that you can learn and
implement things quickly so that we can
move on to the next steps anyway guys
thank you so much for watching this
