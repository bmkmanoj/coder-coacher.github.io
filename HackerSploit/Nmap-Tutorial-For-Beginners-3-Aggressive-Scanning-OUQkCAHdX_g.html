with another video and welcome to your
third in map tutorial so in this
tutorial what I'm going to be talking
about is some aggressive scans and
basically how to get more information
from your scans and more powerful
scanning options so without further ado
let's get to it
so the first thing as usual you have to
open your terminal and you have to
initialize n map pretty self-explanatory
you should already know that by now so
again I'm just going to use the help
command just to make it easier for you
guys to understand alright so let's say
we want to get information about what
operating system is running on the
basically the site or IP or IP ranges so
how would we go about that well luckily
for us we do have a command or a
parameter that can actually give us that
information and that is the a parameter
which as it says here will enable OS
detection this version of the operating
system excuse me
and it will give us script scanning so
to see when in Scripture running and
traceroute so that's basically what
we'll give you so let's actually try
that right now with the scan me dot n
map org all right so let's try that and
lap capital a and this can me dot n that
whoops excuse me I actually press
something wrong there excuse me guys
dot nmap org all right so let's see what
it actually gives us all right it's
going to start scanning and given the
fact that I'm not specified any port is
going to go to a thousand ports and it's
actually grabbing the operating system
information and all of that stuff so
it's actually using the aggressive scan
which is basically what a means is
aggressive so just let it scan and let's
see what we get now what what thing also
already tell you guys is it's going to
give you a trace route but I'm going to
recommend that you just eat a trace
route is really not important at this
time so I just want you to ignore that
for this period of time I'm going to get
to it later so let let it finish
scanning alright there we are
it actually scanned so it's going to be
the latency and
it's going to scan a thousand posts by
default that's what nmap does but you
can specify how many you want to or
which ports like you mention the
previous video so we have port 22 which
is SSH and it's running OpenSSH going to
it's running on a bundle which is pretty
strange out of the expecting something
like Red Hat but nonetheless maybe just
a test server for the site so turning
we're going to linux and it has been
host key i'll explain what this is later
you really don't need to know that and
then you have HTTP which is running
Apache standard stock and it's giving a
little teaser here telling you to go
ahead and scan me so I'm really going to
ignore that right now and again see it's
actually running the in the next kernel
so that's basically how to get oh s
basically like an aggressive scan and
now let's say you want to find out what
services the service versions of the
services that are running basically like
this version of the operating system
that's running it may have given it here
but I just want to show you the
difference so to do that you actually
have to nmap small s and a capital S and
then we're going to try that again dot
nmap org right and let's hit that and
let's see what it gives us right again
it's going to take a while to scan and
what this means is just going to show
you these services the service version
that's what it means and it's just going
to give you the version of the of
whatever services operating systems are
being used on the server or IP ranges
and how this is helpful is for like if
you wanted to know if there were
vulnerabilities for example in the bun
22.4 for example and you had exploits
you would really want to know what
you're attacking so you can actually
line up exploits specific for the
version so it's really really important
to that so Ubuntu 2.8 pretty much giving
us quite similar information to the
first scan but it's pretty minimal yet
it's left the traceroute and
like that returning 122.8 Apache two
point four point seven which it really
it did it did give us up there so it may
seem like it's not a very important
function but trust me it is when when it
comes to scanning really really big
service all sites or IP ranges or an IP
so now in the previous video I showed
you how to scan for specific ports all
right now entering a specific port can
be well you can play it it takes quite a
while and for a beginner you really just
want to get the the important ports like
for example SSH HTTP echo and MySQL so
the command for this is basically and
map shuttle death I'm going to explain
what that means and let's just be
scanned me I know using it more than I
should know but I'm almost done just
explaining what these these advanced
commands are so n map F scan me dot n
map tour org all right what the f means
is basically fast and it will actually
just give you the most commonly targeted
pops so let's see what it gives us and
you can actually see the most important
targeted pots all right so it's targeted
if you going to scan for 100 pots all
right these are the well as I mentioned
it's going to Kanpur thousand by default
but if you enter these the F which means
fast it's going to scan for 100 pots
alright and these are going to be the
most important pots so that it scan for
TCP and HTTP these are the only
important ports that are open so if
there were more it would have given you
more of the important posts like in
MySQL and stuff like that so that's
basically how to just target in
important ports without actually
entering a specific but very useful if
you're a beginner and you just want to
check out all the open important
pathetic as instead of going through all
the 1000 all right the other thing I
wanted to mention I know
you guys a lot right now but I forgot to
mention this in I think the first video
is with nmap you can actually scan more
than one in a row so if I entered scan
me talk nmap org right and let's
actually use the first command and let's
say we wanted to also scan let's say we
wanted to scan google.com/chrome on
Shogo will won't say anything to me for
this um let's say we want to save it
again as I mentioned this time we're
going to save it as a txt file which I
will show you how to do right now home
Alexis desktop that's around save it and
mousses can dot txt make sure you
specify that and it's going to create a
txt file and let's see what it actually
gives us so it's going to let's open it
and again because again it's going to
scan for Google and it's going to scan
for nmap scan we go Denver Couture again
it's going to give them a very good
format so Google has three ports open
and scan we don't end my pants two pods
open so that's a pretty cool way of
scanning multiple in a row and you can
add as many as you like that's just a
quick time-saving tip and that's another
way of actually selling it as txt so you
don't really don't need to use graphical
output all right so that's basically
I'll go enter multiple IPS you can also
in addition do this you can actually say
n maps let's use means fast again let's
say Daffy Duck Go Go dot-com we've
actually used this can me domain more
more than I think I should have you can
actually enter an IP address so you
don't use a comma so let's say
192.168.0.1 let's see what we get there
that's basically me routed basic the
router IP there let's just see what we
get I'm gonna save it to
whole desktop and can txt alright that
you were to get such meanness can for
google and it's going to scan for the IP
and as you can see my router has a UPnP
I'll explain what that in later and it
just basically allows you to scan an IP
and a site in one line so this is really
really cool stuff you actually can save
you a lot of time one last thing before
we actually end end the video I know of
showing you guys a lot in this video but
yeah one last thing let's say this'll
actually is one of my favorite commands
because it just saves a lot of time so
let's say say in map this will save a
lot of time so let's say end not open
google.com right and let's again save it
to home lexis desktop and can actually
let's see the cattles can this time and
let's see what it gives us
alright and this is the one I'm guessing
right here and you see it can really
fast because it's just going to give you
the open ports it's not it's not going
to be any of the other stuff that's
closed or I mean that that's filtered or
any of the pods that nmap is really not
sure about so that's basically the last
command only to show you here I hope
this video helped you guys again I'm
going to ask you to share this video so
a lot of people can can get this content
