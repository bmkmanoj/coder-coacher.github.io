with another video this video is gonna
be focused on personal security and on
anonymity in the form of a VPN alright
so you might be asking yourself well
what exactly is a VPN well a VPN stands
for a virtual private network alright
and its purpose is to create a an
encrypted tunnel between you and remote
server that is operated by a VPN service
provider alright so then all the
external traffic is going to be routed
through this tunnel so that your data is
secure it was kept secure from prying
eyes and best of all your computer
appears to have the IP address of the
VPN server therefore masking your
identity alright so why do you need a
VPN alright why is it so important
especially in 2018 and moving onwards
well it all comes down to your personal
data and privacy you see your internet
service provider can see everything you
do and the they use this to the
advantage by compiling anonymous
browsing logs that then sold to
marketing and advertising agencies to
then fine tune the advertising
strategies and obviously monitor
browsing habits alright so if this isn't
enough to have you worried in 2017 the
Senate voted for all ISPs to sell their
customers browsing history without their
knowledge or approval
alright so it's really important to
protect your your identity and obviously
to have privacy and with that with the
impending threat to net neutrality it
comes as no surprise that customer data
has an an activity has become the prime
commodity that is being traded by
advertising companies and monitoring you
know for monetary value alright so in
this video we're going to be looking at
one of the best VPN options out there
and in my eyes one of the best ones that
is not VPN alright so let's get started
alright guys before I get started with
this review I just want to throw out
that this review is completely unbiased
and this is my personal and honest
opinion about node VPN right with
out of the way let's get started now as
I've mentioned after performing my
research and reviewing a plenty of VPN
services paid VPN services out there it
it has you know come to my conclusion
that this is probably the best option
when it comes on to pricing speed
privacy and obviously anonymity alright
and let's see why so as you can see
right now I'm on their website and it's
just gonna give you a very nice intro
page as you can see advanced security
Internet freedom and complete privacy
now pretty much all VPN services throw
that out there they all want to be known
as the base the best are the fastest and
the most secure but let's look at why
not VPN is probably the standout option
alright so if we just scroll all the way
to the bottom and you can look at the
features that it does have but
furthermore you can see one of the great
features it has is it can it allows you
to protect up to six of your devices
simultaneously alright so you can run
this on Windows on Linux on Mac on
Android on iOS and on Windows alright so
again it's a fantastic option if you
want a multi platform a VPN service
moving along to Bob your server
locations you can see that it has over
3,500 servers to choose from all over
the world and that is great when it
comes down to flexibility and how you
want to go about your anonymity and what
location you want to select in terms of
your VPN server all right you can look
at some of the of the companies that
have actually vouched for Nord VPN you
have wired you have the Huffington Post
you have BuzzFeed Forbes
CNET you have TEDx as well you have
entrepreneur you have Yahoo tech etc etc
so again it is a really really well
known VPN service and it's been there
for quite a while now and in my opinion
it's the best and I'll get to why in of
just a second alright so in terms of
their payment plans I I have a special
link in the description that you can
click on it's an affiliate link that
will give you a special discount on node
VPN ad on all types of subscriptions you
have your simple you have the best offer
depending on how you want to go about
your plan you have your one month plan
two years and you can get a one year
plan all right
and the great thing is is if you don't
like it or you're not enjoying it or
don't find it worth the money you can
get a 30 T 30-day money-back guarantee
all right so you can get your money back
if you don't find it if you don't find
that it's good enough for you
okay now looking at the great features
that it does have and the features that
I was really you know I would really
wanted to show you guys and you my
audience specifically is firstly it has
no it has a new lock policy as you can
see right over here right now what does
that mean well that means it's not going
to log any of your data or your browsing
activity and the reason that is is
because the company not VPN is
registered and Panama which means it
doesn't have to disclose any of the
customer data and an information now
this is fantastic because again remember
I was talking to you guys about
selecting a VPN that does not log your
data
this one is guaranteed not to log your
data and it's really really awesome
if you're performing your penetration
tests or you're looking for you're
looking fit being serviced for your work
and depending on what you do all right
looking at the other features that are
really really amazing is obviously we've
talked about these server locations you
can have up to six simultaneous
connections you have a kill switch
dependent on selecting applications that
you want to kill when the VPN service is
done off and I'll get to that in a
second you have unlimited band bandwidth
and they have double encryption when
when it comes down to encryption what I
was going to tell you about is the
protocols that are being used IV are the
Ikey II version 2 and the IPSec app the
IPSec protocols which as you know are
military-grade okay
the other cool thing that is allowed is
p2p sharing I know not a lot of VPNs
services offer that you have onion over
VPN servers which is fantastic that's
now that's really exciting and probably
in the future videos we'll go over that
and finally for those of you who who are
in China or you're in countries in the
Middle East that that have the that have
a VPN services blocked this is a
fantastic option for you and if you're
looking for a VPN service this one will
work great for you so again at the start
feature for me is the fact that there's
no data logging which means your data is
kept private and you know you really are
safe okay so now let's go over how to
use node VPN really really simply it is
a very simple application to get started
with so once you have selected your plan
it'll just take you over to a download
where it'll take you it'll allow you to
download the the executable or if you're
an Android or iOS you can just search
for the on the Google Play Store or on
the App Store for the application and
you just log in and there you are
alright so I have the application on my
desktop and as you can see I've logged
in and now let's look at how easy it is
to connect alright so as you can see
it's gonna tell you up here that you are
not connected obviously so you have this
huge little switch here that will
connect you to the nearest server or you
can select a server anywhere around the
world that you want to connect to so
let's say I wanted to connect to Ukraine
for example and it's gonna say
connecting to Ukraine so give that a few
seconds to connect to Ukraine and once
it's done connecting it's going to give
you the it's gonna give you the the
message telling you that it's connected
and it's going to give you your IP or
the North VPN server IP and you'll get a
little log here if you're on Windows as
you can see North VPN connected to
Ukraine fantastic so again it's going to
tell you you're connected to Ukraine
resolving your new IP address now the
great thing about a node VPN that
something that I really enjoyed is how
easy it is to connect to a server so if
I go to countries and as you can see
it's gonna tell me what country I'm
connected to and the server the server
number which in this case is Ukraine our
server number four it's gonna tell you
how far it is from your location it's
gonna tell you a download and upload
speed depending on whether or not you're
downloading or uploading data they'll
then tell you the speed of the server so
again you can select the servers
dependent on their speed so let's look
at the top of the list so it's sorted
out alphabetically so let's say we
wanted to connect to a server in maybe
Argentina so if I click on Argentina
it's gonna connect to Argentina no
that's really very simple but the great
thing about this is if I just select
this little menu icon here and you can
see that it's gonna it's going to give
you the list of servers in Argentine
that you can connect to and they are
sorted out dependant on their distance
obviously and their speed so let's say I
wanted to connect to Argentina
which looks to be the fastest I can just
click on connect and it's as simple as
that and you're pretty much good to go
all right so as you can see I've
connected to this default serve in
Argentina give her a few seconds to
connect to and let it resolve the IP
address and I can show you that it
doesn't leak the NS data as well which
is again something that we really
touched upon many many times on the
channel ok so again it's connected to
Argentina and it's gonna say resolving
your new IP address all right so give
that a few seconds to resolve and once
that's done we can go and test for any
DNS leaks and I can show you that it
doesn't indeed a leak any DNS
information ok so let me just go back to
my browser here and what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna DNS leak test comm as you can
see so let that load up hopefully the IP
address is resolved here was it resolved
yes then as you can see it's gonna tell
you your new IP is going to be oh our
one thirty one point two fifty five
point seven point 84 just in case you
wanted that information as you can see
it's let's open up the DNS leak test the
DNS leak test page and you can perform
your standard test right over here and
it's going to test the for any DNS leaks
and it should as as it if it's working
it should display the DNS server in the
appropriate country as you can see the
DNS server is located in Argentina there
for protecting your identity completely
so this is really really awesome and
again my standout feature was mainly as
the fact that it works with no data
logging and you can have up to six
simultaneous connections with one
account alright so that is going to be
it for this video I hope you found value
