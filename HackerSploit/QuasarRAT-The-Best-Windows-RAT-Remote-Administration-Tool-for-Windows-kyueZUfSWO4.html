with another video and in this video
we're going to be looking at K Surat
alright so let's get started now before
I get started I just want to make a
quick up his flight app and I have
completed it now and I'm looking to get
it published by tomorrow I had a few
delays with the app and getting
everything up and running but no need to
worry now the app will be released on
Monday and will be on the Play Store the
Google Play Store by Tuesday the latest
right so I'm looking to get that
verified on the Google Play Store and we
should be good to go alright so let's
get started with the video so as I said
this video is about how to set up and
how to use case a rat alright so you
might be asking yourself well what is a
rat you could be asking yourself so for
those of you who don't know what a rat
is a rat is essentially a remote access
tool and does essentially what the name
the name you know describes it to do it
gives you remote access to a operating
system or a computer or even a mobile
device but in this case we case a rat is
a remote administration tool that works
or is made for Windows alright so this
will give you the functionality to use
it on Windows all right so it's coded in
C shop so that will just give it a whole
lot of stability when running on Windows
as an operating system alright so it
does have a user interface and it's
fantastic right now looking at some of
the features that we have some of the
best features have to be the the fact
that it gives you the no IP comm support
which means you can use a dynamic DNS
and you if you perform your port
forwarding which is essential if you're
trying to run this over you know the
internet using your public IP address
all right so you can the other awesome
features are that you can view the task
manager on the client or the targets
computer you can view the file manager
you can use the startup manager you can
perform a remote desktop connection
alright you can perform remote webcam
commands meaning even take pictures
record video you have the remote shell
you can upload and execute you can
download and execute you have a key
Locker
you can perform computer commands like
shutting down or restarting and - and
standby you can use reverse proxies
alright which means you can use reverse
socks5 proxies so if you're using proxy
chains you know you're good there and
you have your registry editor now that
is a lot of power so I have to throw out
caution
please please please do not use this in
any legal way I have to throw their
disclaimer and you know whatever you do
with it I'm not gonna be held
responsible because again this is going
to be it's it just gives you a lot of
control over you know whoever's computer
you try and attack if that's what you're
going to do so again I'm not going to be
held responsible for this I'm just gonna
show you how everything works and all to
get it up and running alright so the
simple requirements are is that you need
net framework installed on the client
and on on on your host operating system
right so it does work on both 64-bit and
32-bit operating systems architectures
you have the operating system supported
our Windows XP all the way to Windows 10
fantastic right so let's get started now
I have already have the github
repository opened up right here so it's
caser at I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing
that correctly so again all credits go
to the to the rightful author and all of
you guys have been asking me why I'm
doing these this vide step it is and the
reason why I'm doing them is the the
special tools that I'm showcasing give
you a good idea of how they work so
essentially what I'm trying to show you
here is I'm going to show you the tool
and hopefully that will get your
curiosity running and you'll be looking
into making one of your own so that's
all I'm trying to do right so and plus
this is a fantastic tool if you're using
it at the right way right so again it's
really very simple you can just clone
the repository and I'm gonna be working
on Windows because that's what it
recommends and you need net framework so
what I'm gonna do I already have the
rack installed downloaded and I have it
set up and I'm gonna be using that for
demonstration right so what I'm gonna do
is I've created a rat folder on my
desktop so I'm gonna save everything in
the rat folder so I'm using I'm using
github on Windows which is as
it allows me to perform the clone
commands and just allows me to download
all the files much more easier all right
because I use this a lot for my code
management right so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna whoops and you just go back
here I'm gonna brought into my rat
folder you can save it on your desktop
if you want to which is what I've done
but I'm just gonna be showing you how to
do it so I'm gonna say good clone
alright so I'm saving everything in this
file just for the purpose of showing you
how to download the files oops did I
copy the did I clone depository there we
are we've copied it let me just do that
again and I'll paste that in here
right so paste that in there and I'm
gonna hit enter and it's gonna start
cloning its gonna download the files the
files are quite large a few megabytes
I'm not quite sure of the speed so
please do pardon my internet speed it
shouldn't take too much time if you have
a very very good connection so let's
open up the folder that we saved all the
files into which is the rat and as you
can see case a rat alright now I when
you open this you might be a little
confused alright so don't be confused
it's really really very simple you have
two options of building the you have two
options of building the app or the rat
for this matter you can use the visual
studio solution file right here which
allows you to open the project
individual studio and to compile it or
to build it alright so if you're looking
at if you want to look at how that code
works you can again look at that and you
can you know perform some reverse
engineering as to how it works and you
can learn a lot really by by doing that
but we're not gonna do that because I
want you I won't really show you how
it's done very easily the other way is
to use the windows batch files that are
here you have your debug any of your
release so obviously we want to run the
release because again that is the
release version the debug version would
allow us to use everything so you just
want to open that up and it's gonna
start building the release version
give it a few seconds it shouldn't take
too much time it shouldn't take any time
at all don't worry it gives you a few
errors don't worry about that and it's
gonna build everything into the bin
folder
alright so enter the bin folder and
enter the release folder and there we
are that's your executable rat folder
rat file alright so I'm gonna close that
up man since I already have it
downloaded what I'm gonna do now is I'm
gonna delete that because as said I've
already downloaded all of that and I'm
going to open up my folder which already
created and I'm gonna go into my release
right and I already created the remote
access tool and I've already locked it
onto my other windows computer on my
network and I'll show you that it does
work but I'm gonna blur out some of the
information for my privacy as well so
I'm just letting you guys know that so
once you open up case'
you just open up like that and as you
can see right now we have nothing
because I'm not connected that computer
to the network yet that's because I want
to just showcase how to run this alright
so the first thing is to let's look at
the file and that's pretty simple it
allows you to close it so that way it's
really really simple right and in here
you have your all you have your
computers or your clients that are going
to be connected so as you can see
they're sorted into IP addresses you
have your type your user PC which is the
name the version and the status use the
status the country they're in the
operating system they're running and the
account type or it account type in
administrator or UAC alright in the
settings we have something very very
interesting you can set the port you
want to listen to I recommend just using
the default port that they give you it's
really not you know the best thing to to
change the pots and then you know make a
mistake when building of the file and
you know you're listening on a different
port alright so leave this on the
defaults again you can change whatever
you feel like if you're confident in
doing that you have your ipv6 support
you can listen for new connections on
startup so that's if you want to run
this as soon as you start up your
computer you can try and port for it
also very very important you can also
activate the new IP DNS update I told
you about that which is really really
important or one of the best services we
are running a remote access tool over
the internet what I mean is if you are
connecting using your public IP you're
trying to create the reverse connection
right because that's how a remote access
tool works you're not using the targets
IP you're using your IP so it's very
very good or important to she
your IP in case the person finds out and
is able to reverse-engineer that and
find out what IPO or what is the going
the outgoing connection right whether or
not it's coming through a port that is
not listened to you know I hope you get
the idea so we're not gonna do that
because I'm gonna be demonstrating this
on my network again this is my lab I run
this lab and that means that everything
is on me I'm not hacking someone else's
computer so for those of you asking why
my youtube channel is gay isn't getting
copyright strikes it's because
everything is running in my lab and I'm
doing it in an ethical way right so I'm
gonna close that up and we're gonna go
to the Builder section now now this is
very very important right here right so
as you can see we have us the basics
settings first now in here you can
select your client tag and that's the
the name of the client that you want to
specify so let's say if you had a
computer this is just the name that you
want to give to the computer you're
going to be listening to right you then
have your process mutex and this is
something I wouldn't recommend you to
touch if you don't know what it really
means this is a but this is really when
it comes down into understanding the
process management in a computer and how
Windows handles it so if you have if you
have understood how that works you'll
understand what a mutex is so as it says
a unique mutex ensures that only one
instance of a client is running on the
same system this just means that you can
only run the the rat is running on one
instance on that system instead of it
running multiple times and giving you
multiple instances right so let's look
at the connection settings now now again
as you can see I'm running this on my
local network and I've already set this
computer my host computer I've set the
local IP address and it's listening on
that port to do that just enter it here
it's important you need to otherwise
you're not gonna get any connection when
you create the file so if you're a local
network you want to select this IP
networks you know IP address you this
computer's IP address the local IP
address again if you're trying to do it
the public IP wave I'm sure you know how
to do that as well but again if you're
going to do that I highly recommend that
you use a dynamic DNS
okay so once you've added you may you
have to make sure that this port is the
same as the one you're going to be
listening on very very important and
this is for your encrypted connection
just leave that as default the password
is one two three four you can change
that if you're interested in doing that
the installation settings very very
important now now this is where social
engineering comes into place a little
bit right so your installation settings
you know depending on your target
whether or not they're tech savvy or
they understand how processes work in
Windows and whether or not they you know
whether or not they understand what's
going on in these systems and like
normally users who don't really
understand you know what what the task
manager is about where you install it is
very very important because again if I
use a snooping around yeah you know
their system files and they find this
weird name
we know that's currently running and for
example if the performer netstat command
and they see that these outgoing traffic
to a you know you're using a very weird
port as you just as I just showed you
right there they're gonna get suspicious
so you can choose to install the client
which is I would recommend that but you
have to be really really smart about how
you name the file and in what
subdirectory and directory you install
it in them for me the best place to
install it in is the system folder
because obviously I'm gonna just tell
you what I think and this is because not
many people will suspect that they're
going to be malicious files in their
system folder usually most people that
have seen you know quite tech-savvy
people usually like to go through the
program files or they go into the app
data all right now app data is good not
a lot of people check there but you know
if you're caught it can be really really
bad right so you can choose to do that
I'm not going to do that you can also
choose to run the client when the
computer starts which is awesome now
again this is where it all comes down to
social engineering if you leave this out
like this right and someone checks their
task manager and goes to the startup
option and they find something with a
name like case er client startup
they're gonna get a bit nervous so you
know stay away from naming things that
obvious you know you could name it
something like Java up data or something
like that so Java updater and you can
then build it all right now going to the
assembly settings here is where you can
just change the file information again
if you're trying to make it look a bit
more believable you can change the
assembly icon so really this rat is
giving you a lot of freedom in whatever
you're doing you have then your
surveillance settings which you can
enable your key logger fantastic right
and you can again enable the key log the
keyboard logging you can then log the
directory name and you can set the
attributes to hidden so that it's not
found by any snoopers or users that are
quite smart with and understand what's
going on right so what I'm going to do
now is I'm going to hop onto the network
no I don't want to save my settings oh
yeah sorry I forgot to tell you guys
something once you're done with your
setting just hit build client and it's
going to build it and it's gonna save it
groups pin and it's gonna save it in a
folder that you specify I've specified
client and this is the program right
here that you're going to copy over or
somehow move it to your targets
operating system however you do that you
know that's up to you
so what I've done is already have it
running on one of these Windows
computers on my network which I use for
testing malware and I use it for a lot
of really you know weird malware stuff
that you know I have to virtualize
because there's a lot of stuff that can
go wrong and what I've done so I'm gonna
connect to the network and what you're
going to notice now is it's gonna come
up my computer is going to come back on
I'm just going to I'm gonna blur out
what is important here so that you guys
do not you you guys you know I have to
you you have to respect my privacy I
hope you understand that so what I'm
gonna do is I'm just gonna block out
some of this stuff right here so I'm
gonna block out the IP address right and
and the operating system I'll leave that
the way it is but I'm gonna connect with
the network right now so I've gonna
change the country and the IP address so
you know just to preserve
previously I hope you guys understand
that so um I'm gonna run this on the
computer now I'm doing that right now
it's ready in front of me
all right that's running the next thing
by the way this is not detectable by an
antivirus so you you know that's that's
a huge plus right there so when you're
ready just go to settings and you want
to hit start listening alright so that's
going to listen that on that port for
your connection for an incoming phone
connection reverse connection so I'm
going to start listening and I'm going
to save that and we're gonna have to
wait now for it to detect me on the
network I'm gonna go yeah alright so as
you can see we have found the computer
which is fantastic and as you can see
I'm running its DB tag is a lexus
station i call it that because that's
where i run all my weird stuff the test
station so it's gonna give you username
and your pc name right you then have
your version the operating system
version you have the status you have
your user status and i said it'll give
me the IP address but i'm not going to
show mine for privacy
you don't have your operating system
which is windows 10 pro and the user
account type which is the user alright
now you're most interested you know what
we can do now all right so let's let's
check out what we can do exactly so the
first thing i'm gonna try and do is I'm
gonna show you these awesome tools we're
gonna start from the beginning all right
the first thing you can do is perform a
connection you connection management
really where you can connect update or
disconnect you can also uninstall the
client which is awesome it gives you
that ability remotely you then have your
system which gives you system
information it gives you the ability to
access your file manager your startup
manager task manager you remote shell
TCP connections reverse proxy registry
editor and you can elevate the client
permissions this is just incredible I
mean you know the amount of power you
have with this is incredible and not to
mention you can shut down restore to
standby I mean I remember back in the
day we used to run these different PHP
rats and they would we would write
scripts to turn off the computer
like when I mean turn off I mean like
just without warning not correctly shut
down and yeah we corrupted law
of computers yeah we did a lot of weird
stuff but going back to what we can do
here we have surveillance which allows
you to check out your remote desktop
remote webcam password recovery and your
key Locker all right and miscellaneous
allows you to remote execute a local
file which means you can execute an
executable form this from the host
computer and you can visit a web site or
you can show message box to mess with
people all right so again the some of
these things are quite nice to have now
let's look at the system again you can
look at the file manager and there we
are awesome fantastic you can look at
the different disks installed so let's
say we go to users and we can go to my
user and we look at my desktop and as
you can see we still have the same file
and we have the client file which I
copied right here and I ran it just now
so awesome fantastic right so you can
actually browse for files here you can
download files you can upload files you
can rename the files you can literally
do everything to the files that you want
which is incredible all right so that's
the file manager pretty self-explanatory
the next is the startup manager which
allows you to you know to run what
services start up and I have not
installed much on this I have my
onedrive I have the security which is
which is the saint's which we looked at
in the previous video we then have the
Java update tool right now looking back
at the system we then have the task
manager which will look at the current
tasks running which is it's quite nice
to have this and to understand what's
running so we have Skype running that's
just Windows for you you know Windows
has weird services running in the
background all right now let's look at
something else we have the remote
shelves you can write your remote
shelves right here so we can perform an
IP config oops
we have nothing oh there we are we
actually ran the command so yeah it's
using the windows reverse shell and you
can you can see the IP the local IP
address there and yeah that's working
perfectly so we can run remote show
commands a really really well system we
then have your TCP con
actions which I'm not going to show you
for obvious reasons reverse proxy
registry editor something very very
interesting alright so you have to
elevate the privileges to run the Regis
registry editor so there we are
fantastic and we can you know the damage
you can do is unbelievable right so
system now what else you have to look at
we can actually run the we are not going
to shut down or restore the computer
right now because that would be somewhat
stupid all right now let's look at
something that I really really love and
that is Remote Desktop alright so what
I'm going to do is I'm gonna start up
the remote desktop right now and there
we are it's gonna give you a lot of
options here you can enable mouse input
you can enable keyboard input you can
change the quality right you can change
you know if the computer has multiple
monitors you can monitor both the
monitors and you can finally hit start
to get started there we are fantastic so
this is what I'm currently running on
that computer the test computer so I'm
going to open this up the Start menu
right now so let me just do that
hopefully that doesn't lag out cause I I
am running a virtual machine and there
we are fantastic right that is working
splendidly let's try and open my files
here this was the client file that I
just ran as you can see client build and
that is essentially going to be the file
that we ran that which is the rat
alright so fantastic that's working out
really really great and yeah that's
basically it now if I enable the mouse
input will allow me to control the
computer from here so if I open that up
there we are it did open up to open
Microsoft edge which I don't recommend
you do on any you know normal
circumstances for obvious reasons right
so that's working up let me just expand
that so we have a better resolution of
what's going on you can in lock and
large that and have quite a good idea of
what's going on on your targets computer
but I'm gonna close up edge because I'm
running this virtual machine on some
really really low resources right now so
that's how to use your remote desktop
really really exciting stuff alright so
I'm gonna stop that and I'm gonna close
it up and now I'm gonna try and use the
webcam
hopefully it allows me to start it so
yeah that's because I've disabled the
driver for obvious reasons as well
so I'm not gonna be able to show you
that looking at surveillance you have
your key logger so let's get logs so
there we are we did open the HTML file
which was opened by Microsoft edge so
I'm gonna try and log some new files in
here all right so what I'm gonna do is
I'm just gonna type something like CMD
again
pardon my poor performance on my
computer let's see if we can get
anything new the logs are stored in the
HTML file there we are and there we are
so we got the commands CMD let's try and
run another one so let's see let's say
you're trying to log into your username
so let's say you entered your email like
so so hackers ployed a gmail.com there
we are and if we get the log just to see
if everything worked takes a while to
update back back back
alright updated yeah there we are it
does work so it does give you a
keystroke command as well and some of
these special keys that you could be
running awesome so yeah we are getting
to the last you know things that we can
do and yeah you have the key loggers
password recovery that is just for
recovering passwords you know through
password files and stuffs totalize you
can see it's gonna it's going to
automatically get and have not entered
any passwords on my keychain on this on
Windows 10 because it does provide you
with one regardless of the browser that
you're using right you then you have
remote execute and visit website so you
can enter website that you want to visit
so let's say HS ployed comm that will be
pretty cool if it does should if it does
show up so visit website so let's see if
that opens up it's obviously going to
open up on Microsoft edge right so again
just I'm just gonna give it a few
seconds here what I'm going to do is I'm
going to open up the remote desktop so
you can actually see what's going on
whoops for some reason we're not getting
that connection right now but I mean it
is connection let me update it whoops
so it still connected there we are
so miscellaneous what I'm going to
remote desktop hopefully it opens up
right now it's probably trying to open
up the web page let's see if we can
access the file manager oh yeah we still
can so there must be an issue there with
the remote desktop connection oh there
we are it's working now and that the URL
did not open but that's probably because
of the overflow and as you can see one
is also something also very very cool is
the ability to check your FPS right here
and depending on your connection you
know from your is since this remote it's
a remote what do I mean it's a reverse
connection the con the speed or the
quality it is determined by the client
that you've installed this on but that's
it really you can see the power that
comes to you when you use you an use
case a rat so you know thumbs up to the
author and yeah this is a fantastic tool
you can you know go ahead and check it
out and understand how it works and yeah
so that's going to be it for this video
guys thank you so much for watching I
hope you enjoyed this video or you you
know you found value in it if you did
