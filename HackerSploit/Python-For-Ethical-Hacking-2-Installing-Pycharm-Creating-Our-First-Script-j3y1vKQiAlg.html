with another video and welcome to the
second the Python for ethical hacking
series in this video we're gonna get
started with downloading and installing
PyCharm and we're gonna run our first
Python program or script so I hope you
guys are ready and let's get started so
I said we're going to be using PyCharm
as our IDE of choice ID is an integrated
development environment and what you
want to do is just open your browser and
you can just go to google.com and search
for pie pie charm and it's gonna be the
first link obviously by Chum Python ID
for professionals so the website is
pretty cool you can go ahead and explore
it if you want what you can do is just
hit download now and you want to select
the your operating system of course you
can do this on Windows Mac or Linux
which I recommend you do it on so you
can test it especially since we're going
to be building tools that are going to
be more custom to the Linux font you
could you know run your files on Windows
but that would just defeat the entire
purpose so the reason we're using
pycharm is because you know it has an
inbuilt debugger and it just provides
you a very good way of maintaining your
code so I've tried other integrated
development environments but I think
pycharm is one of the best ones out
there so you can choose between the
professional version and the community
version professional version just gives
you a full-featured IDE for python a web
with community you get a lightweight ID
but really it does everything so you can
just hit download I would recommend use
the community version of course if you
want to buy the professional version go
ahead and do so so I've already
downloaded the community version so just
hit download and it's gonna ask you to
save a file but I already have
downloaded the pi PI chump community so
what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna
close up my browser and I believe if I
navigate to my downloads folder right
over here I have my pycharm community so
what I'm gonna do is just open a
terminal here
and what I'm gonna do first is and my
route so or you know what what I can do
first is just let me try and extract
this file because the
pycharm file is a tar file so that means
it's compressed so let me just list what
we have in this folder which we know is
the pycharm door tar file so to
uncompress we use the tar tar zed let me
remember this x VF i believe from not to
run and then we give the file name might
be so in this little command here we are
basically saying Z is the or X's for
extracting and F is for the file name
which in this case we know is pycharm so
PI and if I enter ok there we are so it
started extracting the pycharm archive
so just give it a few seconds to
complete of course it really depends on
the size of the file and the speed of
your computer so there we are I have a
PyCharm extracted and now we can just
view the folder and what we can do is we
can browse into that folder by by charm
community and there we are inside the PI
chock-full and now we have some other
files in here the installation process
is really very simple all you have to do
is browse into the bin folder so we're
going to change the directory into the
bin folder so CD pin and if we just
check what we have in there we have the
pycharm dot SH so we really do not need
to to change permissions for the SH the
PI chomp or SH file because you can
already execute it so if you have that
issue you cannot execute it just use the
chmod plus X which will change
permissions to allow you to execute the
file and give the file name but we since
you already have that we can just start
up PyCharm so PI charm dot sh alright
and which we hit enter it's gonna start
up PI charm and we should be ready to go
so just give it a few seconds ok so it's
going to ask me to complete installation
I do not want to
import my previous by jump settings
because I have none someone hit okay let
me just minimize that and it's gonna
give me a privacy policy statement here
and terms and conditions obviously so
I'm gonna hit accept and it's gonna
start up by jump Community Edition 2017
point two alright so just let it start
up the first start up will be quite slow
obviously because again it's it's quite
a good IDE and it's gonna bring this
prompting the this is gonna prompt you
with the initial configuration so it's
going to ask you for a key map scheme
just stick with default Forex win you
have your IDE theme which you can change
from IntelliJ to Dracula
I'm sure or dark EULA pardon me I'm sure
most of you who have used the IntelliJ
IDEA is already familiar with the themes
that they give you I'm gonna stick with
the IntelliJ and I'm gonna leave
everything default here and I'm just
gonna hit OK and there you are so it'll
give you this nice welcome screen where
you can create a new project so I'm
gonna create a new project and obviously
I'm gonna try and save it to my desktop
so what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna
save it to my desktop right there on my
desktop and it's gonna ask you what
interpreter you want to use again some
of you have said that you that python 3
is installed I know it it comes
installed with Kali Linux but as you can
see you can choose from python 3.5 and
2.7 we're going to be using 2.7 so just
hit create alright so just give it a few
seconds to create your project again the
first startup will be quite slow but
give it some time and it should start up
perfectly and let me makes it maximize
that it's going to give you tips of the
days I'm just gonna I don't want to see
these tips on startup so I'm gonna close
that so just let it run usually it has
these processes running it's going to
update and index the files
and obviously it's going to start up the
meterpreter or the the Python the Python
syntax so just give it a few seconds
hopefully it doesn't take too much time
and we can get started with creating our
first project but we can just minimize
that and what we can do is we have our
project view so let me just give you
guys an basic overview of the interface
off by John so I hope I've maximized
that screen oh there we are okay so this
is your project view or your project
Explorer where you can view your project
files and it's really very simple in
this case we are just creating a PI a
Python file or a Python script so it's
going to give you a D directory in which
it is saved in and obviously from there
you can create new files so for example
new you can go into Python files an HTML
file but I don't know why you'd want to
do that especially from an ID like like
PyCharm but we're going to create a new
python file and it's going to ask you
for a name to name so we're just going
to give it aa
no that's too basic let's not do a hello
world let's say print let's just say
Python rocks alright something as simple
as that let me make sure I type that in
right and it's going to ask you what
type of file you want so we want a
Python file very important just hit OK
and it's gonna create the Python file
for you and as you can see it's going to
open it up for you and welcome to Python
so I'm not really not going to introduce
any of the advanced commands in right
now as I said we're going to be learning
by creating a project or a script so
we're just gonna try and print out
something really really simple here so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just say
print oops my bad print and open your
quotation marks this was basically just
going to print out what I've put in the
quotation marks or the speech marks
which is my name but we don't print my
name what on a print is
Python Python rocks like so and again to
save I believe the shortcuts are oh yeah
you have to actually save this to a
destination so I'm gonna save this on my
desktop so as you can see the name is
gonna ask you if you have a name so
Python Rockstar py 2 data tree yes on my
desktop and I'm gonna hit ok ok just let
it okay so it's already exist so we
don't really don't need to do that but
if we just see what files exist on the
on the desktop we can see that we have
the Python Rock store py so if I try and
open that up hopefully it opens alright
so there we are so we already know that
it's it's the one we wrote so we can
execute this in the terminal and it's
really very simple
I'm going to open a new terminal because
that one is is in charge of making sure
that we are able to run by jump so I'm
gonna zoom in alright and what I'm gonna
do is I'm just going to browse to my
desktop like so very simple and I'm
gonna list all the files now as you can
see the python file right here is not
executable so we have to actually change
the permission for that so we're going
to say chmod plus x and we're gonna say
the PI thorn rocks dot py and if we list
now we have the Python Rockstar py as an
executable file so is the Python command
oops
python and python rocks or py and if we
enter that as you can see it's going to
display python rocks now I'm guessing
you guys get the idea this is a very
basic script and hopefully this will act
as a starting point for many of you to
begin using Python so that's basically
it for this video guys in the next video
we'll actually get started with creating
our first project and we'll be looking
at the basics of Python and how to
incorporate them into a project I hope
you guys found value in this video if
