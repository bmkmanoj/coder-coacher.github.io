with another video and just a quick
little tutorial video before we move on
to the next tutorial of the next video
in this series a lot of people have been
asking me which distro I would recommend
for beginners now look I have no
specific distro I use a lot of Linux
distros everyday as you can see right
now I'm using peppermint OS as my
desktop destroy our use this is my daily
driver on my main computer and the
people have asked me well for ethical
hacking what Linux distro do I recommend
well as you know there are well actually
you may not know that they're actually
12 - I think 16 penetration testing
distros out there and it can be really
intimidating as selecting the correct
ones for you and the truth is there
isn't a correct one and what I'm the
reason I'm saying this is because I can
install all those penetration testing
tools on any version or any Linux distro
and I'm going to show you that right now
I'm going to install all those Kali or
pirate OS tools on peppermint OS or
anywhere you know or any Linux distro
for that reason or for that matter for
example you can do it on a boon to Linux
Mint and you can actually use them as
penetration testing distros so really
you it all comes down to what you're
comfortable with so if you want to
install these packages on any lien
exists all you want to do is why do I'm
going to be showing this just for the
Debian disclose for arc videos or maybe
I'll make another one but this is just
for Debian distrusts because that's what
both Kali and Paraguay's are based off
so I'm just going to open a terminal
here and I'm going to enter my root
so I'm actually on my route right now
and I have a couple of commands I've put
them in a text document they will be in
the description section so you can just
copy it from there if you don't want to
type them out so first thing you want to
do is you're on a basically install gate
all right so the only is make sure you
install gate so you can access the
github repositories so it's going to
read
package already have get installed so
it's going to ask you to install it and
you pretty much get install it
don't worry about this error code this
is a personal basically just something
that happens in peppermint OS next thing
you'll need is the the khutulun is
basically the depository on github that
basically gives you access to these
tools so you wanna add that repository
so just add it I already have it so I
really do not need it as you can see
just cloned it next thing you want to do
is you wanna turn the khutulun into a
and executable so you're going to use
the chmod command we're just gonna paste
that there and we're going to run it and
it's cursor is not going to give you any
any result or any message so pretty much
after that you should be good now all
you have to do is just launch cut tool
in just launched it and there you are
khutulun so basically these all the kali
linux repositories so as you can see you
can actually add them and update them
you can view you will install the
classic menu indicator and the install
the kali menu so really as i said you
it's locked up it's not really about the
linux distro it's just about what suits
you best so as you can see we have as i
just view the categories of what i can
install you have all the actual the
actual section in the in both kali linux
black arc actually on almost all
penetration penetration testing distres
excuse me so you have information
gathering and there you can really find
a tool like nmap h ping 3x click or
Wireshark so really you can install
anything you need and more specifically
what you need so if you guys are really
not keen on moving to khaled index or
parrot OS don't worry you can actually
install the packages from here and still
run your destroy the way it is so you
can actually run a bun to with these
tools and that's actually an advantage
because open to is much stable than kali
linux but i really have seen that parrot
OS is quite quite stable I have
installed quite a bit of packages and
it's run in
pretty pretty cool anyway enough of that
this is just a quick little tutorial
before I proceed and just to clear up
the air on people who are still on the
fence as to what distro they want they
want to use anyway guys that's basically
it for this tutorial
quick reminder I'm going to be
continuing the ethical hacking series
this video will be right after this one
just a quick reminder that tomorrow
actually going to do the deep web video
so that'll probably come anytime in the
afternoon to the evening I just wanted
to let you guys know that's every
Saturday and I also thinking of starting
a new series maybe on Sunday or even
possibly on Saturday basically and ask
me a video where you can basically ask
all your questions maybe we can run it
life and I can answer them life so yeah
that's up to you guys let me know in the
comments section below otherwise guys
thank you for watching the video it
would help you leave a like if you
didn't dislike the video and let me know
in the comment section if you have any
questions hit me up in the comment
section or in on any of my social
networks I will reply to your question
if this video again if this video did
help you please share the video it
really helps a lot of people and it will
help me so yeah guys thank you for
