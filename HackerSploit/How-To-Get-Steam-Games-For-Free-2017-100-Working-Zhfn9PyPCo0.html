with another video and in this video I'm
basically going to be showing you guys
how to get Steam games for free or PC
games for free so let's get started so
you just want to open up your browser
and go to Crowe has it calm now many of
you guys have requested this tutorial
but the reason I'm making it and as you
most of you know most of you PC gamers
know that the steam summer sale is
Croton and the games are going for a
really good price so you maybe should
check that out as well if you're looking
for really good prices on games but if
you can't afford a game don't worry
about that I've got you covered
so you want to go to a website called
Crowe a sitcom the link will be in the
description section so all you have to
do is just go to that site and basically
that's it you can just browse the games
that they currently have they have most
of the popular games and they're
currently adding as many games as they
possibly can and you can basically look
at what this site is about and you might
be asking yourself how is this actually
possible well if we read the About
section of the website
it's going to say that the goal of this
website is directed towards providing PC
gamers with the latest game releases
these game releases are functionable and
stimulate minor characteristics of an
actual copy of game however these games
contain limited functionality does not
qualify them to be given the title of an
actual copy by this we hereby state the
games do not contain multiplayer and
future updates so basically none of
these games will receive future updates
or have multiplayer capabilities of
course I think you guys understand why
that's there because this is technically
technically pirating a game but it's not
really pirating because it's in the name
of testing the game and hope hoping to
buy it when you can afford it but
basically all you can do really is just
search for the game you want for example
over here we have WRC 6 which is one of
the latest games in rally or racing for
those of you interested in this genre so
it's really very simple just click on
the link and it will take you to the
page and it will give you some
information about the game and then
right down here you can download it
directly through mega for most of you
for some of you or maybe some of you
who've never heard of
megha is basically a cloud storage that
offers down a direct downloading with
very very high speeds so it's going to
take you here you can basically download
it directly through your browser or with
the mega sync program if you have it
installed or window on Windows or Mac
you can then also go download it with
our via torrents so just go into the
torrent section right here
and it's going to say basically you can
download it right down here it gives
some system requirements just it torrent
download and it's going to ask you to
basically select a torrent client so if
you guys are not familiar with torrents
you basically made a torrent client a
torrent client is a program that will
allow you to download and seed torrent
so one of my recommended torrent client
is utorrent or you can check out
BitTorrent or if you guys have any of
your own personal preferences you can go
ahead and follow through with that so
you can download utorrent it's free or
you can download BitTorrent but I'm
going to be using Q BitTorrent that's
what I like so I'm just going to select
Q BitTorrent and it hit open link and
it's going to open up my BitTorrent
program right here as you can see cube
BitTorrent and it's going to start
receiving the meta data and it's going
to basically give you information about
the game and the files so make sure
everything is selected for example here
I have the WRC 6 folder and I'm just
going to hit OK and it's going to start
downloading so let it just let me just
get the seeds and appears and as you can
already see it started downloading again
this will depend on the actual speed of
your internet but it shouldn't take too
much time it's about 8 gigabytes of data
so that's basically it guys you can just
download the game it's they already pre
pre activated so and probably will come
with a crack for the game so you can
actually just download it and install
the crack and you're good to go so
that's basically how to get Steam games
on for free really if you're looking for
any of the types of games you can look
for basically you can just search right
here for example if we search for
Grand Theft Auto 5 as you can see if we
scroll down right here there we are
grand theft auto 5 you can just click on
it and it will basically give you a
direct link or a torrent link I would
recommend a torrent link especially for
larger games because it just makes the
whole process of downloading the game so
much easier so that's basically the game
will continue downloading and again
depending on your internet connection it
shouldn't take too much time though so
that's basically it guys go ahead and
visit crow has it calm and just search
for any of the games that you want to
download or to try and that's pretty
much it enjoy guys thank you so much for
