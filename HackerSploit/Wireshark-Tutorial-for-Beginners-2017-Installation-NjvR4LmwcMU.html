with another video and welcome to
Wireshark for beginners so in this set
of tutorials I'm going to be teaching
you how to use Wireshark and I'm going
to be moving you from a beginner level
to an advanced level or an intermediate
level so you might be asking what is
Wireshark well Wireshark is a traffic
analyzer now you might be asking why do
I need to learn why I shock well if
you're a network administrator system
administrator and you interested in
basically monitoring what's going on on
the network this would be handy for you
or if you just a curious parent at home
wants to make sure that your children
are in browsing the web you know in more
illicit methods I mean visiting
inappropriate websites and stuff like
that so basically it's just a tool for
monitoring what's going on on your Wi-Fi
network that's basically it for the
layman
so I guess anyone can really learn how
to use these two it's nothing really hot
so yeah let's get to it some of you on
your website it's Wireshark org
there we are that's the website I will
link it in the description section if
you don't want to type it out I don't
know longer to take bottom yeah once you
load it up I just want to hit download
and it's free by the way
so the current stable release it's
Wireshark two point two point three so
we have the latest stable release here
you have you different platforms you
have a Windows micro s we have source
code for Linux I do believe that you
have to install it through D terminal on
Linux let me know if you want to
pretoria on that so again you have your
different architectures in terms of cert
platforms so we have a 64-bit windows
and 32-bit windows I'm going to download
the 64-bit because that's the version of
Windows are running and the processor
basically the processor that our money
but I already have it downloaded and
installed please do note that during the
installation I want to make you have to
just install windows windy caps that's
what it's called
give you that prompt during the
installation to install wind pcap now
make sure you do install green pea cap
because as again it's one of the
components that goes hand-in-hand with
wire shock so once you have it
downloaded and installed it's very
simple process I have it right here
very nice icon it's a shocks in a blue
shocks in boot it up and you're greeted
by what appears to be a loading menu and
this very very very complicated looking
program but don't worry it's nothing
really complicated so basically what I'm
going to do I'm just going to give you a
basic overview here of what to do to get
started we're going to look at the
advanced stuff in the next video I'm
going to cover that then so welcome to
Wireshark well thank you very much so
what it tells me to capture don't worry
about this using enter a capture filter
so basically here what it's asking you
is what network interface card are using
and want to use to monitor your traffic
so right now you can see there's some
activity on my Wi-Fi card that's pretty
interesting so I think I'm going to use
my Wi-Fi card although it using is
Ethernet just go ahead don't worry about
the VMware network adapters I have
virtual machines running on my computer
that's why we have these virtual network
at that adapters and I really do know
that they might not be working unless
you actually running the virtual machine
but nonetheless that's for another video
what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to hit Wi-Fi there we are I'm it's you
want to hit this green button oh it's
already started so unfortunately I did
not have to press the start button to
already start it for me so that's
missing
Yona if you want to start the capture
just hit the green button if you want to
stop it it's red
alright and then once you stopped it's
going to stop capturing the packets so
that's basically how to get started
using wireshark
I'm going to cover all the other
basically the tools and basically all
the other nooks and crannies in the next
video but yeah I hope you guys are
interested in this series of videos I
know
going to help you a lot or maybe a lot I
don't know but if it if it does and you
