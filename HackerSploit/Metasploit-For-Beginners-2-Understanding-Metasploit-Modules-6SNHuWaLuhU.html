with another video and in this video we
are going to be looking at modules in
Metasploit so this is part 2 of the
Metasploit series or the Metasploit
course and in this video we are gonna be
looking at modules so as we touched upon
in the previous video we looked at what
modules are very basically and the
purpose of that video was to take you
through the interface and get you
comfortable with using Metasploit right
but now it's time to understand what
each of the components are again that
will give you a better understanding of
how they all work and as we already know
if you understand something you can get
to use it much much better than if you
just you know zoomed over some of the
concepts and some of the you know the
real core functionality of Metasploit
right so what I'm gonna do is I'm just
gonna start up I'm back on cally by the
way so some of you guys thought that I
was actually sticking with parrot I like
to keep things a little bit different
here and there
so msf console oops I'm going to just
start off with that and let that the
framework load again I'm running this on
a virtual machine so you know resources
are not going to be the best right now
but well while that's starting up I'd
want to explain a few things now as I
mentioned all right when when the
Metasploit console opens it gives you
some options right and it will show you
the types of modules now the types of
modules are like the auxilary the
payloads the exploits the encoders the
knobs all right so there's six of them
and one of them is the post right so in
total you have your exploits your
payloads your auxilary your encoders and
your post and your knobs all right
now looking at the architecture you know
Metasploit again it's very very very
important that you understand this
looking at the architecture the the the
the basic structure is that modules are
categorized into six but you've already
mentioned the exploits payloads auxilary
and code has posted knobs and then it
that is then superseded by the MSF
console or the Metasploit console
framework and then it is it is
superseded then by the core and then
finally by directs in terms of the
libraries so to put this into the
interface you to put it into sense when
it comes down to interfaces you have
your GUI and armitage you then have your
command-line interface and then finally
your console so I hope you get that in
terms of the architecture right now
something very very important to
understand is to understand where the
modules are stored all right so we can
just go you know open a new terminal
here hopefully that lets me open it up
right now
all right so new window again bear with
me the speed could be a bit of an issue
but don't worry about it I'll sort that
out in probably the next videos it won't
be this slow for some reason it's really
really lagging out right now all right
so what I'm gonna do now is in let me
let me just zoom in so we can have a
better picture of what's going on here
all right so now most of the time or all
of the time should I say the Metasploit
modules are stored in the user and the
share folder right or the shared folder
here and again Metasploit framework
whoops
let me just complete that Metasploit
framework framework all right now again
that's a directory now you might be
wondering what lies in yeah well the
modules line here all right so if I list
all the files in here as you can see we
have an interesting bunch of files we
one way targeting is going to be the
modules folder right here right because
that's another way of accessing the
currently installed modules or the used
modules right so see let's go into that
into that folder Phylis the files in iam
as you can see it's further divided into
these six categories that I mentioned
earlier we have our auxilary encoders
exploits nobs payloads and post right
very very interesting you might be
asking what do we do now now the point
here is I was trying to explain the
directory the file directory structure
and how it's really sorted out
okay now the modules the directory
contains the six subdirectories all
right which then contain different a
type of module sorted into into what you
see all right now let's start off with
the exploits right the exploits usually
are used for exploitation you know very
very on that's very easy to understand
these are modules that are allow that
were created for you to take advantage
of an exploit or a vulnerability in a
system okay so let's see what we have in
exploits so I'm just going to go into X
place right now CD exploits if I list
that as you can see these are the
current exploits that you have sorted
out in terms of the operating system or
the target operating system in which
there is a vulnerability so you know for
example you have Apple iOS Android
Firefox freebsd linux you have your
Solaris UNIX windows and obviously a Mac
OS X all right so as you can see this
lists everything really really well let
me just list that correctly I wanted to
list everything there we are alright so
as you can see they listed into further
sub directories which are sorted in
terms of the operating systems now we'll
be looking again these are just meant or
you know specific to the operating
system you're trying to target so if I
was to try to to try to target Windows
and I list what's in here as you can see
you're gonna have a lot of other files
and the again further sub directed into
their different forms of vulnerabilities
like you could exploit them the oracle
PostgreSQL proxies the firewall etc etc
you get the idea so exploits I used to
take advantage or to exploit a
vulnerability in a system right that's
one type of of a module now I'm going to
back out and I'm just gonna clear that
and let's look at what other modules
that we have the other modules that we
have are the payloads alright or you can
go into the encoders but let's look at
payloads first alright so payloads these
are files that are left on the exploited
system alright and basically speaking
what they allow you to do is they give
the attacker
access or control over the system right
now these are usually called rootkits or
well most of the time they really
separated from each other so not so
basically not all payloads are rootkits
and simply put payloads allow the
attacker to own the system all right in
which they are left in so let's see what
we have in the payloads folder right CT
payloads and if we list all the files
there as you can see you have your
single stages and these stages so let's
see what we have inside each of these
directory now the as I've said they've
been divided further into three
directories singles are these these are
small well I don't know how to explain
it to you these are like this small
these are small pieces of code or or I
don't say X place they're usually
designed they are designed to to take
like one single action all right now
stages are used for performing or you're
creating a communication between the
attacker and the and the target and this
can be then further used to deliver
another payload all right and stages
stages are very very large payloads that
can give the that can give the attacker
like a very very very good control over
the target so for example this can allow
you to have meterpreter instances you
can have VNC and stuff like that right
and that's what what payloads offer in
terms of single stages and stages so
singles are very very small they use for
performing one specific attack like you
know key locking for example that's a
very very vague example stages allow you
to perform or to to create a
communication an instance of a
communication between the attacker and
the target that can then be used to send
another payload to the system the the
target system right stages of very large
payloads that allow you to perform large
or you know potentially more dangerous
types of attacks the likes of you know
VNC connections or meta pradesh shells
or even reverse chose to be very very
basic right now let's go back here okay
and I'm just gonna go back and again
we're looking at the other types of the
other types of modules here the next one
that we're going to look at is the
auxilary and the the auxilary oops let
me go back into modules I seem to have
gone further out alright so looking at
the we have looked at the exploits and
the payloads now let's look at the
auxilary alright the auxilary is
something very very interesting
alright the auxilary will give you a
very very very unique types of attacks
in in the sense they give you things
like dos they give func dos
functionality they give you further
functionality they give you scanners and
again this is becoming really really
popular because again they're giving you
things that that you cannot find in
other any of the other categories
whether it be payloads and exploits all
right so the axillary is giving you very
very robust tools things like you know
dos functionality as I've said scanners
so you know vulnerability scanners and
stuff like that so things that can
really really come in handy so let's
explore this further right so CD I
change directory into auxilary
alright and we'll list that in there and
as you can see it's sorted into
something very very interesting so you
have your crawlers you have your
sniffers passes your scanners yours
prefers and you can check them out there
so you know they are divided further
into these awesome directories right now
again they're they're going to be
categorized into you know directories
that you will find familiar if you have
been hacking for a while you know things
like sniffers buzzers etc etc and they
the primary use often of the auxilary is
to is to scan the target system right so
they allow you to scan for
vulnerabilities and to perform probably
most likely denial of service attacks ok
so that's that's basically what the
auxilary is simply put all right now
let's look at the other
modules right alright so I'm just gonna
go back and I'm gonna list everything
again and now we have the encoders
alright the encoders are very very
interesting all right these are simply
do what they they sound or what they say
the the encoders are used to re-encode
payloads and exploits alright so they're
used to a lot of people have been asking
me this well they're used to get past
security systems such as anti viruses
alright so this is where you really
really want to be looking if you're
looking for encoders or if you're
looking for evasion techniques right so
let's look at what we can find inside
its CCD encoders right and let's list
what we have inside so as you can see we
have different types here and this may
be confusing let's brought further into
these these subcategories which one of
them being the PHP let's list and in
here you might not understand what's
going on and we'll trust me we'll be
looking at all of this because it's very
vital to understand this now listing all
the sub directories you can see that
they are divided into somewhat
understandable categories right so
they're divided into you know for
example CPU architectures like 64 bits
32 bit you of your C or command prompt
you have your PHP alright so these I
they are used or give you the option to
create an encoder or to use a you know a
specific encoder based upon the target
system so if your system is 64 bit
32-bit you want to go through PHP you
have to use the command prompt so again
you I hope you guys are getting the idea
but it's very very important to
understand how these are divided because
once you understand that you know it
just becomes a whole lot easier so let's
go back here oops my mouse pointer was
there
oops alright now let's look at knobs
right knobs or something very very
interesting and something that not a lot
of people take seriously but essentially
what they are okay for those of you have
done programming or you've done compute
to science I'm sure you have taken a
class on machine programming or machine
languages all right now an op is is
usually or mostly most commonly known as
a no operation all right now this what
this allows you to do is what or what
this means is are not causes the
system's processor or the CPU to do
nothing for an entire clock cycle all
right no this is very important to
understand right
you might be asking but what the hell is
this or what how is this going to help
us
well knobs are very very good for
allowing you to get a system to to
perform or to run a specific specific
file or code for that matter
after you've exploited the buffer
overflow now this may sound like
gibberish if you've never done anything
to do with you know very low-level
language or machine language programming
but you really don't have to worry about
this they are used to exploit the buffer
overflow okay and essentially you really
just need to know is that they're used
to allow you or they're they allow you
to run or to execute code or a remote
execute code on the target machine
alright so again we can just browse into
knobs in list and again sorted simple
quite similarly to what you would have
on your encoders you have your
architectures you have your your
different languages in which you can
pass it you have your again your
architectures are there alright so they
are subdivided into multiple
architectures and stuff like that
alright now going back all right let me
just go back so you just know that this
is used to exploit the buffer overflow
there's nothing really interesting there
but we'll be using it also because they
do come in very handy when you're
talking about much more complex and
you're very very very tightly secured
systems now again we have look
most we've looked at these module
categories and again they all provide
you with a different way of of getting
into a system and also you know they
give you a lot of functionality and
understanding how these are subdivided
for example the auxiliaries the encoders
the exploits the knobs the payloads and
the post are very very important for you
to understand and I hope you guys have
have understood what they all do now
talking about posts which is the last
one here posts are simply or what it
means is post exploitation I'm sure most
of you knew that and these are you know
they're going to be used after the after
the system has been exploited so you get
it you know they allow you to perform
extra extra pieces of functionality or
they give you extra pieces of
functionality once you've exploited the
system alright so in in in hackers or in
penetration testing terms it allows you
to they allow you to do perform you know
further attacks on the system after the
system has been owned all right so these
can include as we have done previously
you know things like key loggers spying
on the webcam or the microphone etc etc
and again it's subdivided into the
operating systems of choice we can check
out for example Windows which is
probably the most vulnerable operating
system ever created on this planet but
that's for another day right all right
sorry about that so as you can see you
have your different categories and
enough told you I already knew this was
going to be there you have your captures
you have your privilege escalation you
have your gathering you have your manage
gathering being where you would find
your key loggers so if I just open that
up and I list for files in BL you're
gonna see that there's a lot of stuff in
here right and one of my favorite ones
actually remember doing this back when I
was in school was using the one of these
these exploits right here or these
modules if I may say so it was to
enumerate the product keys
and you know you can actually just
delete the Windows activation protocol
on on the windows computer and they
would basically be be stuck with with
Windows without any sense of activation
and the operating system would be really
really burnt to the ground some of the
interesting ones as you can see a
Bitcoin Jaka
hmm that's pretty interesting but I'm
just gonna skip over that because that's
for another day right alright so looking
back at the categories that you have in
here in the the modules you have your
axillary encoders exploits knobs
payloads and post and I hope in this
video of understood what they all have
have in you know in terms of Metasploit
and I'm sure once you have understood
these using Metasploit will be a
complete breeze you know there'll be no
struggle at all understanding how
everything works so yeah guys that's
gonna be it for this video I hope you
