with another video and this is just
gonna be a quick video and essentially
what we're going to be looking at today
is how to detect and to mitigate the
vulnerabilities that were earlier
discovered this year the specter and
meltdown vulnerabilities that have
affected processes
so really I'm focusing this on Linux and
most specifically Kali Linux that's
because most of the major software or
operating systems have actually been
following up on this and have released
you know various updates for example
Windows release the updates within I
think about twenty something or almost
thirty hours so that was quite
impressive to see that they were able to
you know so-called
patch the problem up but if you've never
heard of what I'm talking about it is
essentially a vulnerability or these
they were actually released earlier this
year that showed the process or the
memory leak that processors had and the
mitigations that that the software
companies have put in place or hardware
companies really in relation with these
software companies I've actually started
to impact the performance of some
computers so it'll be really interesting
to see what people or they'll do in
order to bring back everyone's or the
affected users systems into the their
respective performance performance class
but irregardless as I said it's very
very important that you know how to
handle these issues these kernel related
issues when it comes down to linux and
more specifically kali linux right so a
lot of people have been asking me this
and there is actually it's very
important to check this now the risk is
higher if you are using an intel cpu so
again i would highly recommend that you
upgrade your distribution and you
upgrade your kernel with this matter
what distribution you're running but um
i'm pretty sure that debian have
released theirs their update and again
if you're running a certain processor
there might be some some processing gaps
or performance issues that you'll
experience so i'm going
show you how to check this and this can
be done with an awesome tool here it's
called the specter meltdown checker that
essentially just checks your computer
against the the Seavey's that were that
were released earlier this year
so it's really very simple it's very
very simple to get on your system and to
to actually run so what I'm gonna do is
let me just open up my terminal here and
go to my desktop and what we're gonna do
is we're gonna clone this so a lot of
people have been asking me why I
actually physically pasted in what I'm
doing and that's because a lot of people
if I use the key map commands or
keyboard shortcuts a lot of people will
ask me what I did and you know just gets
a whole lot complicated so if you want
to paste in you know how to do it it's a
simple right-click and paste if you want
to use the keyboard shortcut use the
control the control shift v right I
think is that is the correct key map
yeah there we are
all right so and then just hit enter to
clone it so I've cloned it on the
desktop it'll just take a few seconds
there we are
let me change directory into there like
so alright so let me list the files and
as you can see it's a shell file or a
bash so if we just run it Specter or
actually we just clear this and let me
just maximize this because there's a lot
of information that's going to be
printed out so what we're gonna do is
there we are suspect
oops meltdown checker there we are and
it's gonna start checking it now because
I'm running this in a virtual machine
and I already know that the host
operating system it does not have a
vulnerable it doesn't know it's not
really vulnerable to this to these V's I
know that yes as you can see here you
know it's gonna it's a very very fast
script essentially there were three CVS
or Spectre variants as they are called
as the these CVS were called we have the
expect a variant one and two and then
finally we had the third one which was
called meltdown right so essentially
what's happening here
is as you can see the first CV or the
specter variant one I am vulnerable to
this and this is mainly for almost all
processes released you know in in them
in modern time and as you can see only
23 op codes found heuristics should be
improved when official patches become
available so this is something related
to the kernel as you can see here the
Spectre variant 2 there is a mitigation
that already exists so support for
mitigation for this process say yes
kernel support no but again as you can
see it's not vulnerable your CPU vendor
reported your CPU as not vulnerable so
I'm pretty much safe there
as for the meltdown which is probably
the worst of them all or the most the
most damage causing you have your again
for me it's not vulnerable now for
yourself it could be vulnerable and I
would recommend that you immediately
update your kernel headers and
everything related to your system just
as a precaution and probably you
shouldn't be using it for you know
because it is vulnerable and regardless
of what you are using your virtual
machine for or whether or not you
install it on a physical machine you
should take these steps to mitigate
these these these vulnerabilities as
they're called so yeah that's gonna be
it for this video guys I hope I helped
you in this video or and you know I
provided value to you if you if you
found value in this video please leave a
like down below if you have any
questions or suggestions hit me up in
the comment section on my social
networks you can find the documented
version of this video on my website it's
actually quite popular and how to
mitigate yourself correctly on all
platforms really so yeah thank you so
much for watching guys and I'll be
seeing you in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
