with another video and I have a bit of a
different type of video for you guys
today basically I'm just going to be
introducing you guys to steam it now
some of you guys might be LCS over what
in the world is steam it well in a
nutshell steam it is a social media
network or a social network that
actually pays you for posting on it now
you might be asking yourself well I
don't find that that just seems a little
too far-fetched for me and I don't
really believe it
well this is fairly a fairly new social
network and it's basically focused of
mostly on bloggers and people want to
share a worthwhile content now let me
explain what what this basically is now
as you can see it's basically a website
where you find different posts some may
say their blog posts but just different
posts that are educating or just
informing people right and they are then
ranked up as you get up in terms of how
much how many uploads they get and as
you can see you might be seeing a bit of
money right here now what that is as I
said is Steam it actually what when
people upload your post you actually get
for your up vote now that is awesome I
mean that's all it to introduce this
this platform to you guys because many
of you guys may be bloggers and we want
to make make some money out of it I mean
I'm not judging you whatever you want to
do there but basically what I mean is if
I go to my blog right here I've been on
this for about two weeks right now and
I've been testing it to see whether it's
true and some of my posts haven't made a
lot but as you can see here I have posts
like this one right here which made me
two dollars and just got seven up votes
only it got a few comments and seven up
votes so basically this platform is true
so it all depends on the content that
you're basically you're you're putting
out there really so it's it's free to
sign up and you don't have to pay a
single single buck or dollar whatever
your currency
is but basically in essence is it's a
social network that is sorted very very
simple and you basically have your home
this is basically the people you follow
you then have your new which are new
posts posted by everyone on the Steam
eight network and as you can see some of
these have not yet been been uploaded
and you can see the time they were
basically post it you then have your hot
which are basically hot posts which I'm
guessing most of you guys know these are
very popular and as you can see you have
it's been uploaded about 508 times and
it's basically a blog about well I don't
really know the words of travel on
budget airlines so pretty interesting
again it's all about providing a value
so if I just go back here into the hot
section you can see these all the hot
these all the hot blog posts none of
your trending and these are basically
trending and nothing is there right now
when it comes to your tags and topics
this is basically your tags when
creating a post if you guys wanted an
in-depth tutorial on how to use this
platform just write down in the comment
section at all basically be explaining
how to use this platform to your
advantage well the reason I actually
created this video is because firstly I
wanted to share this platform with you
to create an account is really really
just simple if I just logged out you
basically create an account name is
going to give you a password and you
basically it gives you a blog right here
where you can enter your your name it
has your About section and it has your
followers posts and the amount of people
you follow alright so basically you just
create a you submit a story and as you
can see I'm working on one right now and
I'll continue working with that sometime
today but basically my point being is
that once you basically post a post it
goes live on this team in network and
you basically get paid in steam now
again I should have mentioned this
earlier is that
this is based of the steam
cryptocurrency now cryptocurrencies are
kind of complex especially now since
there's got a lot popular right now thus
the reason you're seeing a platform like
steam 8 steam is basically a team of
crypto currency alright so basically
steam is a crypto currency right so if
you can basically go and research about
it it's very very similar to Bitcoin and
is one of the top dogs with aetherium
and again I don't want to go in depth
again if you guys want more information
on or you want more videos about crypto
currencies just let me know and I'll be
happy to make them so steam is a
blockchain based social media platform
where anyone can earn rewards so
basically you get the idea it's based on
the blockchain right that's what Steam
it is all about is based on the
blockchain now a blockchain is basically
a public ledger of all the transactions
that go that basically taking place in
the cryptocurrency area so you know
again if you want information about that
I'll be happy to make that but I'd want
to get into that so basically in essence
you create you create an account with
your name and whatever information
whatever you're about you then a link
your website or your YouTube channel
which is what I've done right here and
you can basically start submitting
stories and in terms of how many how
good the post is and how many people
upload it you can get rewards as you can
see right here and then you have your
wallet section right here which as you
can see my current amount of rewards
I've got is about three point two two
dollars and this is amazing because I
said most of you guys are bloggers and
or some of you guys are bloggers and
maybe this was the platform that you
were looking for
again this you're getting paid for
nearly nothing so that's basically what
I only to explain you then you then have
your wallet again as I explained where
you can then cash out the money you have
and that's basically it you can
basically make money from making a blog
post again the blog post have to contain
some value and they cannot be any
plagiarism all right so that's basically
what I wanted to put out there so my my
request
you guys is to go and check this out I
will link my profile in the description
if you follow me I'll give you a photo
and then we can upload each other's
posts as a small new community and from
that we can make we can basically give
each other rewards I'm going to be
posting every day I'm going to be
posting a new story every day and if you
guys are interested you can you can have
a look I'm not forcing you guys to
upload the post just go go through it it
maybe even comment and by the way I
forgot to tell you guys that you can
actually you actually gain some money
from commenting on the posters you can
see not a lot but you get caught you get
money from uploading comments again the
posts have to contain a bit of value but
that's basically it guys just a quick
little video just sharing this with you
