with another video and in this video I'm
gonna be showing you how to install Kali
Linux on a virtual machine more
specifically how to install it on a
VMware Workstation or whatever version
that you are using now again a lot of
you guys have been requesting for this
and I do understand that I've only made
one Kali Linux installation video and
it's about that one Kali Linux
installation video and it's about time I
update it so I'm gonna be showing you
how to install it on a virtual machine
or more specifically VMware right now
and then in future videos regarding
installation I'm gonna show you how to
install it on VirtualBox and then
finally how to install it on a flash
drive and then you the installation
process or the steps are pretty much the
same so let's get started
so the first thing you want to do
obviously is to go ahead and download
your Kali Linux ISO alright now I'm
gonna be using ie you can just open up
any browser that you're currently using
I'm gonna assume that you're using
Windows or Mac OS or or even Linux
depending on whether or not you want to
virtualize it or not again it's all up
to you as I said the installation
process is pretty much the same so
essentially what you have to do just
said for Kali Linux right in your search
engine or whatever search engine you
feel is necessary or is good for you so
just give it a quick search and I don't
know why mine is taking so much time
there we are all right so the first link
it's that's the one you wanna hit it's
gonna say Kali the next penetration
testing and ethical hacking Linux
distribution awesome click on it
alright so just give it a few seconds to
load up of course your internet
connection might be much faster than
mine and on the home page it's just
going to tell you our most advanced
penetration testing distribution ever
all right now it's gonna give you the
latest release now as of this video the
latest release is 20 17.3 and I will be
updating it if necessary and if I feel
that the changes need to be made any way
you you can go through all of this and
you can look at the block and the
changelog or the logs that are that give
information about the changes or updates
that have been made since we want to get
this installed what we would do is go to
downloads and just click on that and
it's hopefully gonna open up the
downloads page and there we also
download Kelly the next images alright
so right here essentially Kali Linux is
going to be separated into different
types of images depending on
customization for example you have your
different architectures you have your
32-bit and 64-bit you then have your
light versions which are well on light
versions of Kali Linux simply put you
then have your different versions with
your dist your different desktop
environments that's if you do not enjoy
the ignore desktop environment that it
comes already pre-installed with so you
can choose your mattei your ex @ c ii or
LXDE and there's also the Amaral and
your AR m hf alright so in terms of
that's in term in terms of desktop
environment so you can have a fair
choice of whatever you feel is good for
you when it comes down to your VMware
virtual machines you can actually
download this these are already virtual
machine files that allow you to just
open them up without installing Kali
Linux that's good for you again you
might just want to skip through the
process all you have to do just download
it but if you're downloading the ISO and
you want to learn how to install it the
correct way and how to configure it just
a select one of these ones again make
sure to get the architecture right I'm
using 64-bit and you can choose to
download it using HTTP or torrent I do
it through torrent because again many
times I might you know I'm not going to
just download it directly because I
forget I've downloaded it and I just
want something running in the background
that can download the latest versions
for me alright so I already have mine
downloaded and it's on my desktop so
once it's downloaded you just want to
have it somewhere handy in my case I
have it on my desktop and now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to open up my
VM where we
right here so it's amusing workstation
14 Pro the the installation process
shouldn't be any different if you have
if you have updated it to the latest
version
but overall the process should be quite
quite like like wise to yours even if
you're using an older version all right
so it's gonna take you to the home the
home section here and it's gonna give
you three options so you want to create
a new virtual machine alright so a new
virtual machine and it's gonna say what
type of configuration do you want now I
would recommend to just use the typical
which is recommended if you're a
beginner you really don't need to think
with anything about you know anything in
the custom or Advanced section in terms
of configuration so just hit typical
alright so then it's going to ask you
for the installer disc which is
essentially a funny name of a funny way
of saying where's your ISO now as I said
mine is stored on my desktop in my Kelly
the next folder like so and I'm just
gonna select the ISO file so make sure
you select that and I'm gonna hit open
and it's gonna tell you could not detect
what which operating system is in the
disk image don't worry about that all
right so just hit next what you want to
do now is select the guest operating
system now this is pretty
self-explanatory here you just specify
what your operating system is based on
always it's going to be based on Linux
so make sure to select that and then
it's going to ask you for the version
now for the version you can essentially
just specify that you want other Linux
other Linux three point X or three point
anything or later kernel
depending on your architecture you can
select the 64-bit or the 32-bit alright
so make sure it's three and above
now usually what other people would go
for is something with Debian but that
seems to give people a lot of errors
when it comes when it when it comes down
to configuring the virtual or the VMware
tools the guest Edition tools as well so
make sure you select other Linux a three
or later kernel 64-bit that's the
version hit next
alright now you want to give your
virtual machine a name I'm just gonna
call mine
best virtual machine
Kelly alright because I already have
mine installed I don't need to do it
again so the location is pretty much
wherever you want I'm gonna save mine on
my desktop I'm gonna create a new folder
and I'm just I'm just gonna rename this
let me just rename that to cally test
alright so this is where I'm going to
store all the files related all the
virtual machine files for this virtual
machine so cally test hit ok again you
can save it to wherever you want or
wherever you feel it's comfortable
hit next now in here you can specify the
virtual hard drive space that you want
to give your virtual machine again it's
all up to you if you're using your
virtual machine for a lot of stuff and
you you anticipate that you're going to
be having a lot of files you can specify
as much as you want as much as you have
on your hard drive for me I use it for
pen testing and I'm not saving huge
files at all I'm usually just again
performing pen testing so mine I would
keep it about 20 gigabytes if I need to
go anything higher a maximum of 50 and
that's pretty much a good for me alright
so then you have the option of splitting
the virtual disk into multiple files and
it will tell you why they're gonna see
exploiting that this makes it easier to
move the virtual machine to another
computer but may reduce performance with
very large disks now usually I stay away
from splitting it I like keeping all my
virtual machines in one disk in a single
file because most of the time if you are
trying to copy your virtual machine
files there is a chance of corruption
and once that happens you cannot
troubleshoot at all
you cannot restore ok you can take
snapshots from a corrupted you know if
one of them is corrupted you can't get
the complete snapshot so I hope you guys
get an idea of what I'm talking about
so just hit next alright now it's gonna
ask you it's gonna give you the option
to customize your hardware again this is
something very very specific to what you
want and how you want to configure it I
usually keep my memory for Kali Linux at
about 2 gigabytes again I have 8
gigabytes on this computer that's how
much ram my physical rama have installed
so I usually specify about two gigabytes
for my Khalid NEX virtual machine that's
about good enough for me all right when
it comes down to processes I like
keeping that I have a quad-core
processor so I like a giving candidate
next to processors but it can work just
fine with one again it just really
depends on you when it comes down to my
display I like having my display
accelerate through you know 3d graphics
I like to have that enabled and because
I have a dedicated graphics card a 2gb
or a two gigabyte dedicated graphics
card I like specifying the recommended
amount which is 768 and megabytes
alright so make sure you select that or
you know again select whatever you feel
is appropriate for you if you have an
integrated graphics card the dedicated
memory will probably hover between 64
and 128 so make sure you choose between
32 bit and 128 megabyte sorry 32
megabytes and 128 megabytes all right so
I'll keep mine at 768 in megabytes okay
so once that's done you can then head
over to your network adapter and you can
select you want to if you want to bridge
you want it to connect directly to the
physical network or you want to share
your hosts IP address I like keeping it
or ear on that right so once that's done
you're pretty much good to go you can
specify other stuff like your USB
controllers and other options like that
but that's all up to you once that's
done you just hit close and it finished
alright so once you hit finish it's
going to open the virtual machine for
you there we are
and it's and what we want to do now is
power on our virtual machine they are
two ways of doing this from the left tab
right here and from the top toolbar so
startup or power on I'm gonna power mine
on and there we are
but VMware is powering on and we will
now be moving into the bootloader
candidate the next there we are and it's
going to give you options now a lot of
people here have issues with this now
let me explain all these options do when
it says life this is essentially
allowing you to run
in the next life four means of of you
getting a good idea of what the
operating system is and how it works so
you're not installing anything is just
allowing you to run the operating system
life maybe you want to check out how it
works how it looks how it feels
usually this is for people who are new
to Cali and want to see how it will
operate on their hardware's
they know stuff like that you then have
your persistence mode which allows you
to save files all right so you have your
life us be persistent mode which is
again a way of you running it live
without installing it so it's
essentially gonna run off your your
installation media so if you had
installed Kali Linux on a USB flash
drive and you specified a persistence
file or a special
you specified a storage amount for
persistence you you could actually run
color next or off the flash drive and
you can also save files as well so
that's pretty awesome now a lot of
people you know make a mistake of going
in to install not understanding that
that is going to be the command-line
interface and there's nothing wrong with
that but if you're a beginner that can
be really really intimidating and you
can feel discouraged really really
quickly so I recommend going for the
graphical install so just a graphical
install and just give it a few seconds
to startup shouldn't take that too much
time at all there we are we're getting
the it's mounting the storage device
don't worry if you get a few errors here
and there it should start up just fine
there we are so it's going to start up
and here is the installation
installation page so it's going to ask
you the first step is to select a
language now Kali Linux has a wide
collection or a wide support for
languages so you can select whatever you
feel is comfortable for you again it's
all up to you so I'm gonna make I'm
gonna select - English and then gonna
ask you for your location you can
specify whatever you want I like just
keep in mind United States because I
live there and then it's gonna ask you
for your keyboard not again a lot of
people here make the mistake of you know
choosing their native keyboard layout
and then that messes up with Kali
and the keyboard shortcuts so just
please if you're gonna try and install
scripts and stuff that have key Mac key
maps already installed or already
configured just make sure you go with
the American English keyboard
configuration it's really not that hard
to learn and understand all right so I'm
gonna hit continue
now it's gonna start detecting the it's
gonna detect the ISO file and then load
the installation components from the ISO
file now usually a lot of people here
get an error when they are trying to
install it with a USB flash drive they
get the error that the files could not
be read now there are two things that
are happening here number one is that
you're using a USB 3 port which is
really not very friendly when it comes
down to called-- index and number two
the fact that you're using
uf UEFI instead of legacy alright now
again to fix that issue what you should
do is just unplug your USB flash drive
while it's on this screen and just plug
it back in and hit retry as soon as you
do that it should start loading up the
files immediately alright
so it's going to ask you to configure
the network and it's going to ask you
for your hostname for the system now
what this is is the name or your user
name on the network so you know if you
have a home network if you have a LAN
network or on your Wi-Fi how do you want
your virtual machine or your computer to
be known as again you can specify it
I'll just call mine Kali test
workstation
alright so because I usually have many
many virtual machines running I need a
good host name so that I can
differentiate them alright so I'm just
gonna hit continue now it's gonna ask
for your domain name now this is you
really don't need to specify this if
you're a beginner this is just a don't
domain name and you can specify to
whatever you want like for me I can just
say hack exploit comm and that would be
my domain name so this is when you
create a domain name for a group of your
computers I'm sure most of you guys know
what it is so you don't have to space
anything there you can specify whatever
you want now it comes down to passwords
you have to provide a root password so
I'm just gonna provide mine right here
like so let me just get rid of that and
there we are so it's gonna you can just
specify root password hit continue and
then it's gonna ask you for a it's gonna
ask you to configure the truck and the
timezone right which is awesome so I'm
just gonna select Central hit continue
and we should be moving to the next step
of the installation so it's gonna start
loading the additional components and
it's going to load up the disk partition
err now again I'll be showing you how to
do this when installing it on a you know
on a physical computer but I can just
give you some tips right now when it
comes down to dual booting I'm assuming
that you have already created a separate
partition now if you have done that you
want to identify that partition and you
should know the its exact space its or
its exact size in gigabytes or you know
terabytes whatever we have specified now
what I would recommend is going for the
guided use entire disk but again if
you've created a second partition in
your doing a dual boot you can select
manual alright and hit continue and it's
going to ask you to select your storage
device alright in my case I only have
one which is the virtual hard drive that
I created if you're doing this on a
virtual machine it's pretty much simple
just hit finish partitioning and write
changes to disk alright you can then
also go through guided partitioning
which will allow you to partition
accordingly and to specify how the files
are installed and the file systems are
installed so for us on virtual machines
what you have to do is just hit finish
partitioning
and if it if it gives you this error
it's gonna it this is basically because
you have not specified your your storage
device and hit continue and it's gonna
say create an empty partition table on
this device so that's what you would do
if you are running this or if you're
trying to install it on a physical
machine now going back to partitioning
the disks we can essentially
say guided partitioning let's just do
that right now and I want to go to
guided use the entire disk that's what I
would recommend for beginners hit
continue
and it's going to ask you to select the
disk to partition again in our case we
only have our storage device a which is
a VMware virtual disk hit continue and
now it's going to ask you for your your
partitioning scheme now this means is
it's going to ask you if you want to
partition all your home far and your
temp partitions or your temporary
partitions into separate partitions now
for beginners I would recommend that you
do this on in one partition because
again I'll be explaining what these
other partitions are for they basically
separate the user from the system files
which is what you would see mostly on
Windows but for now just hit all files
in one partition and again it's
recommended for new users suggest it
continue and you can just hit finish
partitioning and write changes to disk
and it's going to ask you to confirm
that some granade yes it continued and
it's going to start formatting the
partitions and it's gonna start
installing the system now this will
probably take a while so what I'm gonna
do guys is I'm gonna get back to you
when it's done
so I'll see you then alrighty so once
it's done with the installation process
it's gonna ask you to configure the
package manager so it's gonna ask you
firstly to to select a network mirror
now I don't want to use a network mirror
this is just a way of asking you to
check for new updates again if you're
using an outdated ISO this could be your
chance to update these sources and
obviously then upgrade your distro so
I'm not gonna use a network mirror I'm
just gonna hit continue and then it's
going to start configuring the package
manager so just give it a few seconds to
start up and we should get this screen
immediately don't worry if it takes a
bit of time this this section usually
takes quite a while to load the package
manager and then you then move on to
installing the grub boot loader which is
the last step all right so it's
installing the grub boot
and then it's configuring the it's
already configured the package managers
now it's again it's moving on to the
grub bootloader so just let this install
and again I'll get back to you once this
is done already so it's gonna ask you
where you want to install the grub
bootloader
all right now for us we want to install
the grub bootloader on the hard disk
pretty obviously and then it's gonna ask
you whether you want to install it on
the Master Boot Record for a beginner
just I want you to just make sure it
select yes don't
if you hit no it's going to ask you to
specify another location and then if you
specify another location you don't have
another partition which is why for begin
out specify that you just go through the
into the Master Boot Record now what
this means is that if you are trying to
dual boot alright if it was to install
it on the master boot record it means
that the Kali bootloader the grub
bootloader would be the primary
bootloader and I've seen I'm pretty sure
most of you have seen that that when you
did a boot when you did a dual boot it
was the Kali bootloader that came up
first that allowed you to select Windows
or Kali as the operating system of
choice and then once you've made your
selection it would boot into either one
of them
so again just make sure you hit yes and
hit continue and it's going to ask you
for the device of course ours is the
storage device a so I'm going to
continue and it's gonna continue
installing the grub bootloader
so I'll get back to you when this is
complete alrighty so once it's finished
with the installation it's gonna ask you
to boot into your new system and that's
what we want to do so I'm just going to
it continue and it's gonna finish the
installation so it's gonna get rid of
the live packages because we don't need
them anymore and this shouldn't take too
much time at all now before we move on
to the next step guys I just want to
inform you guys of our channel sponsor
or the channel sponsor so the general
sponsor is purevpn if you're interested
in one of the best VPN services around
make sure to check them out the link
would be
in the description you can use my
affiliate link to support the channel so
yeah we offer the best VPN services and
you should check them out the link is in
the description please go and check it
out and let me know what you guys think
alrighty so the Kali the Kali
installation is still just finishing and
we'll just give that it's you know will
s be at that time and I'll hit you guys
when it's ready alrighty so once the
installation is complete its gonna
automatically restart into our fresh
into our fresh operating system so it's
gonna start the booting process so it's
going to load our storage device and as
you can see it has successfully loaded
that and is gonna start stop it's gonna
start all the services that are required
then you'll see them starting up right
now again just give it a few seconds the
first startup is a bit slow but we
should be good we should be good to go
alright so again just give it a few
seconds and in a while you'll see that
the cursor starts appearing and that
means that we have it loaded all the
main components there we are so that
means everything is good ok we're almost
ready to begin and we can then move on
to configuring VMware tools with Kali
Linux but the that will essentially mean
that VMware is running at its maximum
efficiency and proficiency with Kali
Linux alright so we have successfully
booted into Kali Linux this is great
awesome
everything's looks like it's working now
by default if you haven't created a user
which you could not have in the
installation process the default user
name sorry about that
the default user name is going to be
root alright and the password is the
root password that you had set in my
case I know what it is make sure you
remember that and hit sign in and it's
going to take a few seconds to sign in
and just give it that much time and we
should be good
everything should be loaded and that
will be awesome
all right so once the operating system
loads as you can see it's going to be
pretty weird because the aspect ratio
and the resolution is going to be low so
the first thing you want to do is you
might want to start by configuring your
display
now usually as if you had not installed
the VMware tools you would not be able
to enter full screen in you know into
the full screen mode correctly and the
resolution options would be limited to a
very very weird aspect ratio now I'm
just gonna change mine too I usually
like keep in mind at 1600 by 1200 or I
keep it at 1920 by 1200 until I can
install VMware tools which is what I'm
going to show you how to do now so I'm
just gonna apply that resolution I'm
gonna hit keep changes awesome alright
now to install VMware tools it's really
really simple a lot of people mess this
up the same thing goes with virtual boss
so what you want to do is alright you
want to go into VM alright in the tool
bar right up here just go to VM and hit
install VMware tools right now once you
hit that it's going to load it's gonna
load the the live our ISO that contains
VMware tools and you have the option to
open with files or if you don't get that
option it's going to be on on your
desktop it's gonna be this disk so it's
a virtual it's an ISO file so just
double click on it alright and it's
going to give you a couple of files now
most people would do everything in here
don't do that I want you to copy the
VMware tools diversion that it's given
you in there the tart or GZ anymore you
want to move it to your desktop that's
where I would recommend you move it to
alright so once you've moved it you then
want to extract it so right click and
extract it here again give it a few
seconds to its extract alright so once
that's done you want to open that folder
alright the VMware tools folder let me
just drag this right here so VMware
tools now in that folder you can find
your standard stuff and we have the
installation so you wanna run this with
the terminal so I'm gonna right-click in
the folder and open a terminal and there
we are so we can bring the terminal in
here
and let me just minimize that and we can
view and we just zoom in so you guys can
see what's on the terminal now if I list
the files now you can see that we have
the installed dot Perl alright so what
I'm going to do is I'm going well VMware
sorry VMware and install dot PL once I
hit that it's gonna start the
installation process for VMware tools so
it's going to ask me dwell to install
the binary files yes I do in which
directory do you want to install them
the binary files are stored in the
binary folder the initialize directories
are stored in the et Cie folder correct
what is the directory that contains the
RC yes they are in the et Cie folder or
and then it's going to ask you for the
initial initializing scripts which are
also found in that subdirectory you have
to install the daemon files yes do you
want to install library files yes so
it's going to ask you the path VMware
tool does not currently exist the
program is going to create it yes I want
to create it so I'm gonna hit yes all
right
shouldn't take too much time to move to
the next step it's creating the VMware
tools library ok just give it a few
seconds shouldn't take too much time at
all this is quite simply one of the
easiest things that you can do and once
you you do this you can run you know
Kali Linux perfectly on a virtual
machine or a virtualized environment all
right so it's going to ask you in which
directory do you want to install the
common agent library files yes that is
correct
everything should be just as default
unless you've configured your bootloader
differently or your configured your
partitions differently when do I need to
install the documentation files yes the
path does not exist currently yes we
want to create it alright yes I want to
invoke the command to configure it all
right so it's going to start
initializing all right so let it just
start that up and we should be moving
right along again it shouldn't take too
much time probably because I'm running
this in a
realized environment you wouldn't have
to do this if you are too if you are
installing this on your physical
computer via your host allows shared
folders this is if you want you want
something like fusion or use the
parallels workstation you essentially
can copy files you know from like let's
say Windows to inside your virtual
machine so if I was to copy something on
the clipboard of virtual machine and I
wanted to paste it in my host you know
operating system I could do that so
that's very helpful I'll say yes I want
to do that VM block and it was dragging
on copying of files yes to want to
enable this feature yes I do
do enable the automatic kernel modules
yes now one of these things ordered to
tell you is you do not need to prepare
the kernel headers like you would need
to do we will get into that one will be
trying to install the Nvidia and the AMD
drivers we want to enable guest
authentication yeah no problem we don't
need to change anything there you have
to enable common agent yes all right so
it's gonna start you know loading the
initializing scripts for the kernel
again you don't have to you know change
the kernel headers right there we are it
shouldn't take too much time now give it
a few seconds and we should be good once
that's done you can probably you can run
it in full screen or the way in
exclusive mode which essentially makes
the whole operating system like it's
running Kali Linux alright there we are
again it's going to tell you to enable
the advanced features example guest
resolution fit drag-and-drop you have to
manually start the VMware user log out
and log back into your desktop session
restart your session blah blah blah so
let's see if this works right out of the
box or I have to log out so I'm just
going to go into view and full screen
and yes I do have to log out because it
is not opened in exclusive mood alright
so let me just go back to view and exit
full screen and let me just log out like
so
root and logout there we are and
shouldn't take too much time because we
have installed the VMware tools again
for advanced features you just have to
start the VMware agent that is you know
kids stuff
nothing hard there alright so let's open
up
so root enter my password and in we go
now essentially if if I have installed
the VMware tools correctly it should be
running perfectly now with with VMware
called-- next should be you know almost
like the brother to VMware right now so
let this load up and we can test that
immediately by by saying if we can run
it in full-screen and exclusive mode
that's one of the easiest ways to tell
if your virtual machine tools or your
virtual machine tools have been
installed so I'm going to go into view
and full screen and there we are as you
can see I don't have any borders and the
resolution has fit to my screen don't
worry if you get this different now if
you get this different artifacting on
the screen they should disappear in a
few seconds there we are so it has
adapted to the resolution and I'm
running Kali Linux perfectly alright
that's going to be it for this video
guys I know it's quite a long video but
I wanted to give you guys a
comprehensive a guide on how to go about
installing Kali Linux on VMware again
