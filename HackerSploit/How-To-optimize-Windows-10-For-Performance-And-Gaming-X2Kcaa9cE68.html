with another video now in this video I'm
gonna be showing you how to optimize
Windows 10 for performance gaming and/or
power usage so basically I'm going to be
showing you how to get every inch or
every ounce of performance from windows
10 so let's get started alright guys the
first thing I like to do when I store
Windows 10 and it makes the computer a
lot faster after I install all my
programs is I want to edit the programs
running in the background and the
programs starting on startup so very
simple I'm sure most of you guys already
know this but for those who don't I'm
going to show you you will hit the start
button on the search button and hit MS
pause thick sorry like that and once it
opens up you want to go into services
and tick hide all Microsoft services and
basically this is making sure that
you're not gonna disable any microsoft
services that may be needed so make sure
you take that and these are going to be
showing you these services that are
running by the programs that you have
installed
so basically I've disabled anything that
I don't need like the Google updates
service the Mozilla maintain and service
the Adobe update service and I'm just
keeping whatever I need so make sure you
just disable or enable whatever you
don't like hit apply and it okay now the
next thing one if you want to do is make
you want to go to startup and make and
want to disable the programs we don't
need running or startup and that will
highly improve your startup time and
make you computer really fast so open
task manager as you can see here a lot
of a lot of programs that want to run in
them at startup but I've only enable
about two or three of them because the
programs that I really need on startup
so for example USB disk security I need
that I'll start up my wipes of onedrive
I need that on startup and my antivirus
console I need that on startup as well
so that's basically how you enable all
the same programs just make sure you
select the program your training will
disable enable disable simple as that so
that's basically disabling apps running
in the background and
now the next thing I want you to do is
it is editing visual effects or the
visual effects within windows so go to
my go to your file explorer which is
Microsoft Lea File Explorer you go to
this PC hit properties and let's go open
this system window advanced system
settings and you are going to perform on
settings and and basically visual effect
now here
let windows choose what's best for my
computer this is really really bad
option because windows just make turns
almost all the visual settings on
according to the graphics card you have
and it's just basically going to be
using a lot of their visual resources so
what I like to do is just go to custom
and these are the settings that I need
for settings out of the rest and they
will click what pic is it basically
gives you the ability to see the window
that as you just get you can just see
what the window has instead of clicking
on it so show thumbnails instead of
icons basically it gives you information
about what's inside the folder so you
can see here in Crystal disk we have
that blue icon so I know that there's
stuff inside and it's just not a folder
whereas it it won't tell you what's
inside
so again smooth edges of on screen
faults this basically makes the on
screen faults look a lot sharper and
much better to look at smoothly school
this boxes pretty self-explanatory as
well it just make sure that the scroll
list boxes are very look very nice and
sleek and neat and that's basically all
I need in terms of visual effects so you
can either copy this or just go through
yourself it's very self-explanatory and
basically you can just change what you
don't like and what you like so after
done hit okay so that's basically how to
change visual effects to pay the
performance or whatever you're looking
for
now the next setting I want to show you
may be a lot of you guys don't know
itself it's exclusive to windows 10 is
your privacy settings so again search
for privacy privacy settings as you can
see open that up now in general you want
to make sure that these are all off now
basically this these services are
running in the background and you can't
even see them in the task manager and
what they're doing is sending
information to and fro your computer to
Microsoft giving them information about
your usage and what you like to you to
do and basically usage activity so make
sure you turn that on off now next thing
you want to do is location make sure you
change your location to off it'll be on
you can just change it to off and again
you can clear location history and make
sure that the applications that the user
application are off are all off unless
you want them to use your location same
goes with camera and microphone unless
you want a specific program to use your
camera microphone now next thing you
wanna go to is radios again turn off all
radios when you don't need them again
the accessing and and actually gives
opportunities to hackers to control your
PC it's really easy with Windows 10 so
um other devices so work slow feedback
and diagnostics now this is very
important feedback frequency windows
should ask my feedback never make sure
that's never because again it's sending
information to and fro your computer to
Microsoft and again that's taking your
resources and it's really it's really
useless if you don't look in diagnostic
and use its data once you've turned it
never this will all be grayed out and
makes no difference
background applications these are Metro
applications running in the background
that you may or may not want them are
for example get office I don't know who
would want that running in the
background it's just really really
wasting your resources and yeah just
what I do is just turn them all off
because I don't need them
I never use these Metro applications
with the inclusion of the store I'll
ever use it as well so that's basically
privacy settings that you may want to
change again if you guys knew about that
thumbs up alright so the next I'm going
to show you guys
most of the people or illnesses for
option so you wanna you just want to
openly start money or I am on it
so to power our options if you're using
a laptop the battery icon will be here
just a right-click it and you'll see
power options so basically Microsoft
Windows gives you a preferred plan and
an additional plans so they basically
give you preset plans that you use what
you can do is you can create a new plan
but really it doesn't make any
difference you can just edit the plan
that you're on to favor what you want so
in this video I mean in this this method
I'm going to show you how to edit the
whatever plan you're on to favor
performance so change plan settings
change advanced power settings and here
we are we have this small little window
and here we are we can go to wireless
adapter settings power saving mode and
you want to click that again and make
sure it's on maximum performance and
what this is is basically making sure
that your wireless adapter if you have
one is running at maximum performance
and giving the best speeds that you can
get all right you are go to USB settings
USB selective suspend settings enabled
now I leave that on because I don't my
of my external hard drives running
constantly it's basically just going to
increase the wear and they are using
power from the computer when they don't
need to so next setting you want to go
to is PCI Express and the link state
power management this basically is the
power management feature included in
your motherboard that family that allows
your PCI Express to save some power but
in all honesty you don't need it on
because it doesn't consume a lot of
power again you're just speeding up the
computer by turning it off so make sure
you go ahead
do that for a process of power
management now this will differ
according to what computer or laptop
you're running for example I'm running
an AMD processor and I have overclocked
it so it's anyway it's going to show
that my my minimum processor it is at
100 while it's not but Windows is
reading it as its stopped frequency so
really what I like to do if I'm running
on a laptop I will turn this around 50
it really doesn't affect it because
nowadays processes are really fast and
if you're gaming you don't need your
processor running at 100% capacity but
this is just a mistake with Windows the
reason is I've overclocked my processor
and it's reading it wrongly again system
cooling policy make sure that's active
and this will make sure that all the
fans are on when the computer is running
and make sure that your computer is just
cool yes it uses more energy but it's
it's at the expense of keeping your
computer cool which is very important as
you all know maximum processes tape
again you can keep this at 100 you
should be at 100 but if you're getting a
bit of heat issues on your laptop turn
it out about 95 again nowadays processes
are really fast and you don't need to
keep them at 100% every time so that's
basically I like to keep mine at 100
cause I really don't have any cooling
issues again so that depends on your on
your processor again so that's basically
it guys go down 8 power options and
that's how to edit power options to your
liking
now the last thing I wanted to show you
guys is the P telemetry options in a
program that I featured on my channel
before in a video on how to disable
spying and float we're in Windows 10 so
it's this little program here which I
always keep on my desktop very helpful
program just I will leave the link in
the description for download it's free
the program is not mine I'm not taking
any credit for it so please keep do keep
that in mind
and yeah once you've done downloading
you just run it and it yes now basically
what this program does is it destroys
windows dens file and telemetry so once
you're going to just go to settings now
as you can see you have a lot of
settings here you can delete the Windows
10 Metro apps but what's it gonna what
it this program does is basically it
down deletes the key logger yes believe
it or not Windows 10 has a key logger
installed and if hackers get access to
that you're in trouble and it's always
good to just delete the key logger and
telemetry now ad spy domains to host
file and block windows firewalls what
these these do is block all the the
incoming and the incoming and outgoing
TCP IP information carriers that are
sending data to and for Microsoft which
also can be tapped and also to just
really slow down maintain connection
because they always trying to
communicate with Windows again
disable private settings you don't need
private setting disable Windows Defender
you don't need Windows Defender if you
do just make sure you don't run this
program because I don't know who uses
Windows Defender really does it help a
lot I usually use other other pieces of
anti-malware but whatever you like you
can do here set the default Windows
Photo Viewer we all know we all love
Windows Photo Viewer not the Photos app
in Windows 10 unless you're different
and that's fine if you like alright this
simple spy tasks these all the
researchers that are watching what you
doing and sending information to and for
Microsoft
so then eight Windows 10 Metro
applications get delete all the Metro
applications if you don't need them and
that's what I usually do the early
applications I leave are the mail
calendar and lapse
alright so in utilities you can open it
it the host file which is a huge plus I
really really love this feature
basically I can just a get my host part
simple as that now going through the
local disks directory and going through
all the system the windows files just
find it so very nice feature there we
scroll system if you had deleted it can
be stored back to its final version to
its previous version late onedrive
are you I use onedrive so I
usually leave that off user access
control and you can disable and enable
it disable Windows Update and every
Windows Update self-explanatory disable
office 2016 telemetry remove old WDS
firewall rules you can that's rolling
back the Windows 10 destroyer firewall
rules and fix the screen rotate if you
guys are using a laptop and it has a
gyroscope or an accelerometer and the
screen flips you can just disable that
completely so that's basically it once
you're done with your setting just hit
destroy Windows 10 spy
once it done reboot your computer and
boom you're done so basically guys those
are my settings as to how to keep your
your version of Windows 10 performance
rated or performance oriented and
basically improve your overall
performance with the operating system
and when gaming or when you're doing any
power usage tasks so basically guys
that's basically how to keep your
computer fast Windows 10 computer fast
and speedy so guys I hope you guys liked
the video if you did leave a huge thumbs
up below if you didn't comment below why

of starting a gaming channel because I
think you guys will enjoy the gaming
content that I might put up I mean I
will put out but if you guys want me to
do that please comment below and I will
look into creating a gaming channel but
yeah guys thanks for watching the video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
