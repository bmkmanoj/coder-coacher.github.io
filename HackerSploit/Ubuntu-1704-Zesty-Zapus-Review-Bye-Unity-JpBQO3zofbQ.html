with another video and welcome to this
review video of a bun two lefties APIs
this is the latest version of Ubuntu
relevant to the data I'm recording this
video which is April 13th to 2017 so
this is basically the latest version of
Ubuntu running right now it's a code
name is zestes apis 17.04 that the
version number i'm just going to give
you a review of some of the features
that have added i'm going to actually
talk about what the future holds for
Ubuntu generally speaking so um they
haven't made a lot of changes and I'm
going to explain why but the main change
that I've made it this updated the Linux
kernel to 4.0.1 or excuse me 4.10 or
4.10 but that would be wrong if I said
that because with decimal places you
never actually say like that but that's
a pretty stupid thing all right I said
right there but they've updated the
kernel to as I said four dot 1.0 and
well it's brought a lot of stability as
you know the kernel is always updated by
by Linus and yeah it's brought a lot of
stability to the operating system of a
very good operating system as it is some
of the other features they've brought
are driverless printing now what is
driverless printing it might be asking
well for most of you who use who use
Linux you know that drivers are a pain
in the ass right installing drivers for
any other hardware device apart from
your mouse and keyboard are really
really really troublesome
especially if they are not supported and
this is a really really good step into
you know into encouraging more people to
come on to Linux and to use Linux and to
enjoy Linux port it is really and what
driverless printing is basically the
ability for you to use your printer in a
plug-and-play fashion really so you can
actually you don't have to install any
drivers for any specific printer it just
adjusts a lot
you use it as a plug-and-play device
similar to the way your keyboard your
keyboard would work so that's really
really awesome one other feature that
they've added really not a feature but
something that they've been pondering on
for quite a while and a very very
technical change is the inclusion of a
swap file so canonical the yeah well you
can say the firm that owns and controls
Ubuntu have actually well if you guys
know if you guys know how Linux is
usually installed it has its main hard
drive where the bond through operating
system lies it then has a swap hard swap
partition which basically acts has more
RAM when your computer is filled your
computer's Ram is maxed out I'm not
going to explain what a swap what a swap
partition is but basically I want to
have changed it into into a swap file so
the reason for this is because the
punter has found that most of the modern
systems have ample memory at their
disposal so a swap file on the other
hand will use a low percentage of the
hard drives free space with a two
gigabyte gap so basically they have
understood that computers have a lot of
memory to use I mean nowadays most of
the computers usually have about a
standard will have about 8 gigabytes of
memory and 4 gigabytes being the minimum
you never see anything lower than 2
gigabytes and that's good that's very
very good I mean they're making it more
stable and more more of a polished
operating system to to even a beginner
really now what the reason I'm reviewing
this version of Ubuntu is because this
might be the last version of Ubuntu that
you will actually use that will have the
unity desktop environment right so for
most of you who follow Linux or Ubuntu
for that matter very closely know that a
canonical have announced that they will
be ditching I think is the correct word
I should use the
they will be teaching their beloved
unity launcher or desktop environment
which is what you see right here for
wait for it for gnome eye now this will
spark a lot of controversy and already
has after they announced that now for
most of you guys who don't know what the
Linux the different Linux desktop
environment are basically just what you
see right here just like Android
launches they just provide a unique way
of experiencing the GUI or graphical
user interface and the current version
that we boondi uses is is one of their
own it's called the unity desktop
environment and they want to switch from
the unity desktop environment onto the
gnome desktop environment that is
unpopular districts like Kali Linux and
many many others that I can just I can't
remember any of the others but it's on a
lot of distros now you might ask
yourself well what's wrong with that
and why are open to doing this well
Ubuntu is doing this because they want
to focus more into the operating system
and providing and basically just
polishing it basically just taking them
a step closer to their goal of making
Linux one of the one well you can save a
world popular operating system that can
compete with Windows and Mac OS and
generally speaking Linux is far from
that because it's its revered as a as an
operating system that is very very
difficult to use and it generally will
will discourage any new any beginners
from using it rule of of basically
learning the way a new operating system
works and all of that you you get the
idea but as I'm saying Kubuntu right now
is an extremely stable operating system
if I was to recommend anyone to switch
from Windows to Linux this would be
first destroy I would recommend for them
second destroyed recommend is I would
say Manjaro or man Haro depends on how
you want to pronounce it that also is a
very very good stable
a linux distro but coming back to bundu
um they really not change anything in
this version of Ubuntu but the next
version of Ubuntu will I don't want it
to happen but I know it's going to cause
a lot of problems for Ubuntu the the
gloom desktop environment is not Taurus
its Vittorio's for being slow buggy
glitchy and it's just not a very very
friendly user user interface I mean fine
it's very similar to unity in the sense
that it's got a dock and you can
basically search use or you can openly
search by using your start or your
command your command key on your
keyboard but as most of you guys know
who use Kali Linux it's a pretty pretty
ugly pretty disgusting desktop
environment and maybe I'm biased against
it but I can tell you for a fact that
even when I install Kali Linux I
immediately go and install another
desktop environment I go and install one
of my favorite desktop environments
marte or make the meister desktop
environment and for the simple reason is
that it's simple and past which is what
abun 2 is right now so shocked when I
heard that they're going to switch their
desktop environment to something that's
slower than what it currently is I mean
the unity desktop environment right now
isn't the best in the world but hey look
at it it's actually it it's very very
user intuitive to people were moved from
Windows I mean here you have your help
you have your your users that you're
currently logged on as you can shut down
or restart suspend you then have your
volume toggles your keyboard input
layout and you have your internet
settings right there you then have your
you can basically launch similar to what
your Start menu does for you then of
your file explorer very clean simple
file explorer your trash videos pictures
music you get the idea it's very very
nice and friendly and it's not going to
complicate stuff especially for people
who've been using Ubuntu
for years I mean I know people who've
been using Ubuntu for their work and not
people who are tech savvy or people who
know programming or scripting these are
people who just reached over have never
used Windows and have always been using
Linux and this is what they know and
love and finally other you know Ubuntu
is what gets their work done and if it's
going to cause problems for them I'm
guessing a Bunter is going to lose a lot
of a lot of users I would have
recommended any other desktop
environment for them to use even KDE KB
would be a fantastic or even a cinnamon
desktop environment from Linux Mint I
mean that's a beautiful desktop
environment very simple you know Lennox
was always supposed to be a simple
operating system that could perform
complex tasks and the Gloam launcher I
have nothing against the bloem desktop
environment it has its uses and I'm just
not a fan of it I mean and I know tons
of other Linux or Ubuntu fans and just
users of Linux will will vote for that
that no one no one purposely installs
the Gloam launcher or desktop
environment on their computer no one
ever does it voluntarily
you might install any other but no one
in Strasburg norm launcher voluntarily
but that's basically what I wanted to
say probably um it's a really really sad
thing I don't know why I'm feeling sad
Boulder is only getting better but I see
that using the gnome launcher will only
take it as step backwards but hopefully
they can combat that and hopefully maybe
they can find a way to change what
they've done I'm running this in a
virtual machine right now and it I can
literally use this for anything else
that I want to do it's a perfectly good
operating system I can change anything
about it just good old open to and I
really wanted it to stay this way but as
I said they have ambitions for this
project and the owner they want to
really really push the envelope further
so you know best of luck - bull - and
they're yeah it's you know Bunter has
been there for a long long long time I'm
telling you like honestly like when I
was um
was a kid man and I remember using
Ubuntu at the time when Windows XP was
literally the most popular operating
system that's how old up unto is and I'm
just scared that it might fade away you
know it would be a pity it would really
really be a pity for such a beautiful
project to go down the drain you know
and and I'm not saying we'll go down the
drain because they've changed their
desktop environment I'm saying it
usually all it takes is one mistake you
know to to lose audio or all your user
base but I guess they know then or did
way better than me this is their project
and they're in control of it but you
know let me let me know what you guys
think in the comments section or you
know just just express what you think
about the current scenario with Linux
and the more specifically Punto so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video that
you found this video helpful I will
leave the link to it in the description
section where you can download Ubuntu by
the way it's free for those of you who
don't know I am actually I'm I'm just
shocked I have to keep on saying that
because there's some people who actually
don't know that one - is absolutely free
of course they do encourage you to to
make a donation to their to their cause
but enough of that I hope you guys
enjoyed this video really really sorry

depressing video from my end but it's
