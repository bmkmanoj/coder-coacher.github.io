with another video and welcome to the
new series Kali quickie now this series
is new and you probably haven't heard of
it and you might be asking yourself what
exactly is this guy doing well
Kali quickly is essentially a four
minute video where my goal or objective
is to give you something to use or a
quick tutorial or you know quick little
you can say something like a quick tip
in kali linux and specifically on how to
use a tool or to perform a specific task
that can really really help you know
individually right so let's get started
with today's topic now in today's topic
what we're going to be doing or what i'm
going to be showing you is how to add a
nun root user into kali linux
alright so you might be asking yourself
well why exactly do we know do we need
this I thought we need root and that's
true
in Kali Linux most of the time you will
be you'll be required to use root level
privileges right now the problem with
root level privileges is that if they do
possess or they do have a they bring
along a certain amount of risk all right
now you'll see this many times as most
of the applications or frameworks will
force the you know will force you to use
lower level privileges and they'll force
you to do you know to exit route so root
is important but it's also good to be
also functioning you know performing
your normal tasks on a non root level so
that you do not cause any damage to your
system
you know without you knowing with or
without you knowing right so it's really
very simple and hopefully I can just
show you how to do this really really
quickly so open terminal and yes you
have to be in your root account or you
have to be in the count that has root
privileges or the administrator account
rather alright so let me just zoom this
in so we can see what's going on all
right now to use this or to add a user
we use the add user all right we use the
add user command and then we specify the
type so no root
all right so add user no root
and that is essentially the name of the
account that we are creating so that's
the name so there we are it's adding
user no root and it's going to ask you
for a new password right so you can just
give it a pass so this is just going to
be a normal password so I'm just gonna
create mine right here and it's gonna
ask you to retype the password so I'm
gonna do that as well now it's gonna ask
you for the name so my full name we can
just call it Alexis
room number no we don't need to enter
that work for nothing there home for
nothing there as well other nothing is
this information correct yes we won't
wait why for yes and there we are that's
essentially how to add a non root user
now you can you can you could have
easily have done this through by going
here and going to account settings and
you know going to users and as you well
for some reason we don't have any users
here we'll probably have to log out and
log back in but you get the point and
the point exactly is you when faced with
a situation where you do not have a
graphical user interface this is how to
perform or how to do it using the
terminal so let's just try and log out
so I'm just gonna exit here and what I'm
going to do is I'm just gonna log out
there we are log out and just give it a
few seconds here to start up again I'm
back on my main workstation now so the
performance should be marginally better
with the virtual machines alright so
there we are
Kelly now so I'm gonna enter my name
here no root and the password there we
are as you can see it did work we have
an account here but the root privilege
it's not a root account that means the
by default to access the root privileges
we'd have to use super user alright so
that should be it and this was the first
episode of Kali quickie and I've covered
everything in under four minutes and
that is fantastic
