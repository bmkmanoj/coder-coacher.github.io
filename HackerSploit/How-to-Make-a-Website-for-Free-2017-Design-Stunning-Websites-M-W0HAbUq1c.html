with another video and in this video I
am going to be showing you how you can
create a website for free without paying
a cent so yeah let's get to it
so as most of you already as guests I'm
gonna be using Wix now the reason why I
recommend Wix for a free website is
because firstly the website creation is
absolutely beautiful it'll give you a
website creator that will just it will
just make you website development a
whole of a lot easier now let's just
google search that and go to wix.com if
that's what you want to do what you'll
do is go to wix.com and create an
account or login i've already logged in
as you can see I already have my site
over there and the reason as I said I
use Wix is because the website creation
is much easier and you can just switch
to a premium plan and they'll give you
your own domain and you're done if we
can basically manage your site it's
really easy and it just basically saves
time from traditional programming of
websites and stuff like that so I'm
gonna create a new website to show you
how you can now create your own website
so what kind of website do you want
great let's let's try and create an
online store just to show you the
possibilities capable now this is one of
the new features that Wix have created
create your website with Wix Adi
artificial design intelligence to help
you create a stunning website I'm not
gonna be showing you how to use that
because that's quite an advanced feature
and I'm gonna show you how to create a
website with the Wix editor the classic
editor which is so much fun and you can
literally just customize it whatever you
want
alright so here we have the website
templates that you can choose from there
like in fact the liar I don't know
there's like too much of them in fact
but what we were doing you're creating
an online store so I'm just gonna choose
a random one hump all this dude now
that's that's too hippy I'm gonna go
with this one this this one looks nice
home tech store so what you want to do
is you can view it if you wanna see more
about it or you can hit edit and that
will basically give you the option to
start creating website according to how
you want it so let it just load
already
once it's done opening the editors you
can see Oh greeted by a lot of options
here but don't worry this is all very
very self-explanatory so you have your
background you can add or remove
features from the website you have an
app market where you can download
install plugins and other stuff like
that and you can start blogging and this
is store pretty self-explanatory now
this is your basic website over here and
you have your menu bar and you have your
logo right there and there's a lot of
stuff that you can do but first I'm
going to show you a few basic stuff
so what you're on a at site you have
your keyboard shortcuts tools gives you
the rulers and basically it shows you
all all that you need in terms of
toolbars there's a very very basic
movable toolbar here
you can keep it wherever you want I like
giving mine on the right well as default
now you can zoom out undo and redo
obviously and then you can change into
your mobile view where you can edit how
it's going to look on a mobile device
which is as I said and this is all for
free until you guys choose the plan that
you want so you can switch back and
forth from that let's start with desktop
view edit desktop view and you can go
and save the website you can preview the
website if you hit preview I'll give you
a basic overview of how your website
looks there we are very nice this is
this is actually quite a nice template
so we're going to go back just hit back
or you can just go back to editor right
there and that's basically the preview
you can unpublish your website and give
it a domain obviously you still have the
WIC sites calm but as I mentioned you
can move on to your own customized and
premium domain where it's like a small
fee and they give you a domain so you
can be for example hack exploit calm for
example so once you're done just save
and continue I'm not going to save it
because I really don't need this website
all right so the functionality is pretty
basic it's your it's just your basic
drag-and-drop you using interface you
can just drag and drop text like so you
can edit the text over here so we're
gonna call this we're gonna we're gonna
create a store actually I'm gonna call
this so your home your store we're gonna
call this gadget gadget freak and it's a
stupid name and you can also change the
font right here as you can see our
themes you can can change the heading
and formatting fonts font size you can
push that all the way up and all the way
down you can then bold it italic all the
basic stuff you can do here very nice as
I mentioned no coding required so gadget
freak which is going to move that up
there and we're gonna keep these images
and you guys basically hear the point
and this is a single page website
template that means that there's not
multiple pages all the pages are just on
the same home page so for example if I
navigate to the newsletter page right
here it's going to take me there and
there we are so that that's basically it
guys see all the components are just
here and you can just edit them if you
want to change the background you can go
ahead and add the video to your website
of video background there's really a lot
of things you can do you can then add
different components you wanna add the
gallery you can add your gallery right
here
it just works amazing guys pretty pretty
cool and it's all up to you and the
reason why I really encourage you to use
Wix is because it removes the whole
coding aspect from it which really
frightens a lot of people from creating
websites you don't have to necessarily
buy a premium plan use the free one
until you show off what you're doing and
then you can move on to the premium
plans but this is one of the best ways
to host your website I would say right
now I do have another method or how you
can create a website
for freezing WordPress but that I'll may
I'll make a separate video for that so
once you're done you just hit publish
and there you are so I hope this video
helped you guys it's a very very basic
editor if I if it did help you or if you
enjoy the video please leave a like down

suggestions or you just want to tell me
