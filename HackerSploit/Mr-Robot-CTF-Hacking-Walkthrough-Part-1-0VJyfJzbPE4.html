with another video and welcome to the
mr. robot CTF walkthrough alright so
this is going to be a series where I'll
be going through the different CTF
challenges and virtual machines that you
guys suggest to me or I'll be finding
new ones that are released based on
difficulty alright so the reason I'm
starting with the mr. robot one is
because this was the most requested one
and a lot of you guys have been sending
me messages telling me to try this up
mostly because you guys have actually
gotten stuck during me you know along
the way and again I'm going to be honest
I haven't been doing CDF's for about one
and a half years now so I'm also very
eager to see how how much I've forgotten
or well not really how much I've
forgotten but how good I still AM that
being said I'm not going to brag about
anything let's see how difficult this
one is because a lot of you have been
telling me that it's quite complicated
and stuff alright so I thought I make
this video in in the place of the ss7
exploitation video which is still under
review if it still goes on or still
carries on I'm going to release it by
Monday on the website I'm going to use a
different video hosting service and/or
video sharing service so that you guys
can access it from the website that
being said welcome to the CTF series
this is going to be the first one and
let's get started so the I love the link
to the mr. robot CTF virtual machine in
the description it works with VMware
only so I have that running on a
physical machine and you guys might be a
little confused you know you might be
thinking to yourself well hey Alexis
what's up with your environment are
using para Torres again and that the
answer to that is yes this is also going
to be a new series where I'll be
reviewing a pen penetration testing
distributions and I'll be reviewing them
for a week on a physical machine alright
so the physical machine I have setup
right now is going to be used solely for
that purpose
and the purpose of this of this whole
series where I'll be testing these
virtual or penetration testing is osore
distributions is to give you an honest
review after using it thoroughly and I
use my workstations really thoroughly
and that being said let's get started so
as I mentioned I do not have I do not
know anything about the address but it
is on my local network so the first
thing we're going to do is a bit of
information gathering so I can use nmap
to scan my entire subnet but since it's
on my local network I can just use net
Discoverer so net discover by the way I
am using the tp-link tlw I'm not
actually sure about the model number it
is the the one that supports packet
injection I always get confused with the
model number
all right so net Discoverer I and I
select my interface which is LAN zero
which means I'm using a wireless adapter
and I'm gonna enter when I need to be in
root sorry about that so this is not an
interactive program or an internet an
interactive script so there we are net
discover lettuce cover eye lens zero
okay now this kawaii oops my bad there
my spelling mistakes always annoy people
I know that sorry for that net discover
I'll land zero wlan0 sorry and as you
can see we have got devices already on
my network here let me just expand that
so you guys can see what's going on we
have the VMware this is the one we are
looking for that's the virtual machine
and it's running on the IP address
192.168.1.1 wait all right so we have
the IP now looking at these screenshots
it looks like we are we can actually
access the IP from the browser so let's
see what it actually gives us for some
reason this is taking a really long time
to open Mozilla all right there we are
so let me open up Mozilla here and I'm
gonna enter the IP address here 192
point one sixty eight point one point
108
I should have blurred my IP address here
that is being displayed so I'm just
gonna hit enter and let's see what it
gives us all right so it is loading and
whoa all right there we are we have some
type of video playing here so it's
loading something this is definitely all
right so mr. robot login root and the
password and hello friend if you've come
here for you've come here for reason you
may not be able to explain it it but
this is part of you that's exhausted
with this world a world that decides
where you work who you see and how you
and
and you and how you empty and fill your
depressing bank account even the
internet connection you're using to read
this is costing you slowly chipping away
at your existence there are things that
you want to say soon I will give you a
voice today your education begins
alright so I think this is about joining
F Society so if you don't know about mr.
robot it is a teller the television
series in regards to hacking and I'm not
gonna spoil anything for you I recommend
that you go ahead and watch it for
yourself alright so we have the
different commands that we can use and
can we type here oh wow that's like wow
that is amazing man this is Wow that's
that that's kind of nice I'm not gonna
lie this is very very good skill that
was used to develop this server alright
so I'm gonna hit let's see let's step in
F Society F society a society yet
society there we are
sorry about my typing alright are you
ready to join F Society enter command
type help can I type help alright so
that was just a short video inform
question can I join how about can I join
all right hello friend let's say you
don't know me but I've been watching you
I know you feel like you have no voice I
I know you feel trapped I know you feel
controlled but I've been fighting for
you all of this is break time corporate
masters blah blah blah and if you're
ready to join me enter your email oh
definitely not
alright so it looks like it's just some
type of server and you can see that it
is a server so let's let's run some
vulnerability tests on this server so
I'm gonna be using nikto if you don't
know about Nick - it's essentially a
vulnerability scanner allows you to scan
for vulnerabilities on websites and web
web applications so let me just open it
up and we can get started so nikto h and
we can try the ID IP here H is the
syntax for a host 192 168 with one point
108 that was the IP I remember so we're
gonna hit enter and let's see what what
type of vulnerabilities is it has okay
so apparently we have
exercise protection and is not defined
all right so that's cross-site scripting
let's see what are the 1 bilities we
have in the meantime one that is
scanning because that usually takes a
while let's actually explore this
website alright so can I type in help
invalid email so let's just write tests
at gmail.com
oops tests at gmail.com and all right we
will be in touch all right thank you so
thanks for being or staying in touch
whoops so let's see wake up or question
yeah have questions let me type in
question and let's see if the scan is
still going on yes it is - going on so
let that continue scanning all right so
apparently the American Dream is a myth
I'm not going to talk about that because
that involves a lot of politics I'm
going to stay away from that everyone
steals that's how it works
capitalists give a gun and you rob a
bank if a man a bank and you drop the
world oh well that doesn't make sense to
be honest all right so this is still
scanning looks like it's found some
interesting pages here or
vulnerabilities for that matter so let
that continue scanning something
interesting I think we should find
something interesting in the meantime
let's try and see what this is going to
tell us here it looks like it's quite
interactive and there is something that
I should be able to get some information
from this so again test at gmail.com
well that is still yeah gmail.com and
let's try something else
help how about I try help here and the
command help this is very well designed
so I'm going to join we've tried to wake
up let's try wake up we haven't tried
that command is this still scanning yes
all right so let's see what else we were
able to get and the video is playing in
the background here this is interesting
this is actually very well designed I
must say so looks like we got an
uncommon header we'll probably have to
use a burp suite to intercept some of
these requests all right so robots dot
txt yes let's explore what we have in
the robots.txt that's actually very
important I actually should have done
that robots
txt let's see what we can find in here
oh wow
oh my all right so we we don't have a
user agent but we have two files here we
have a dictionary file F Society dot
dictionary and we have the first key all
right so this looks like this is the
first flag
so yeah this the robots dot txt and I'm
pretty sure we can download them we can
use burp suite Oh instead of using burp
suite let's use the W get so that's
still scanning let me open up a new tab
here so change to my desktop I want to
save the files on my desktop so instead
of using burps we can actually use W get
to download those files so W get 192
point one sixty eight point one point
108 what was the name of the file f
society-dot- diction no dictionary let's
start with that F Society so I think
that's a dictionary file that they've
provided for us so that we can perform
some brute force or dictionary attacks
yes society your dick is that not dick
dictionary alright so f society into a
dictionary alright so we got that file
let's get the other one which is key one
that's our first key so that's our first
flag key 1 of 3 dot txt I'm I'm a bit
too lazy right now something's gonna
copy that there we are let's paste that
in there key 1 of 3 dot txt so there are
three flags so I've already got the
first one so this is quite easy I won't
lie so key one of three dot XD alright
so let me clear that up and let's see
what we have in here so cat key one all
right so that's the first flag and we've
captured it awesome
let's see what this dictionary file has
is it large I'm not to show less tell
let's see how large it is well hey
that's that that's actually quite huge
let's see how many characters or words
this has so cat F Society F Society
store dictionary and whoa alright so
yeah this is this a lot of data this is
a lot of data and you can see it
contains a combination of well
essentially words and passwords that we
can use for brute force or dictionary
attacks because if they've given us this
then it definitely
means that they are going to be one of
those attacks involved yep
okay so let's clear this up I'm still
finding a way of how to actually gain
access here and looks like the
vulnerability scan completed and let's
see oh oh oh it's using WordPress it's
using WordPress WordPress installation
was found WordPress admin login all
right so it looks like this is going to
be our way in so WordPress admin
WordPress login dot PHP let's actually
see if we can access that so we've got
the files in regards to the robots.txt
file there as you can see the
society-dot- dictionary file and the
first flag or key so let's visit
wordpress admin so if it's running
wordpress then this should be quite easy
wordpress admin and yeah there we are
users block so that's the login page and
it's not using any SSL so that's also
great because then we can perform some
brute force attacks here all right
awesome so this looks kind of nice now
the one thing that's bothering me is
this dictionary file this is a huge
dictionary file man dear God how many
does this even have holy shit man this
is huge all right so we definitely need
to sort this dictionary file I'm
thinking of a way to do it let me open
our terminal here and maybe we can use
the sort functionality so I'm just gonna
cat F Society dot dictionary file whoops
I'm on my desktop yes cat F society nor
dictionary file and what we're going to
do is we're going to use these sort
functionality so sort sort you that
means essentially it means sort them
correctly from in ascending order and
we're gonna say unique we're gonna make
sure that it uses all the it suits them
uniquely and it gets rid of any replicas
of any duplicates sorry about that
because I saw a lot of duplicates here
for example let me just see edit edit so
I'm using unique that's actually very
very common so unique to make sure that
it gets rid of any of the repeated ones
so unique and we'll just call this
let's call it word list I'm just gonna
call it word list dot word list dot
dictionary I'm gonna keep it in the same
format because there's a reason they've
provided it was in that format all right
so let me it enter and it should
actually sort this out really well all
right so as you can see we then have the
word list dot dictionary here and
immediately you can see that it's it's
smaller it's sorted out it out from
alphabetical order from numbers first or
integers first all the way to Z so
awesome so it sorted it out and we are
good there excellent so we've sorted it
out now we need to actually try and log
in here now I don't know the username
and password now that's really bothering
me but we do have a word list or a
dictionary file here that they've
provided to us and I'm guessing has the
credentials okay so we have found the
login page we have found the two files
of the first flag and the dictionary
file so that's good progress I think we
need to use Bob sweet now we definitely
need to use Bob sweet so let me just
power that on you can also use zap if
you're interested in that all right let
me enter the password there and it is
the free version pardon me I don't have
not actually entered my serial because
as I mentioned I've just set this this
computer up and haven't entered anything
else
okay so burp suite is starting up and
hope it doesn't take too long in the
meanwhile let's actually enter or make
sure we select our proxy here make sure
it's running on localhost is that in
privacy I have to actually update prior
to us right now because it's running on
a very old version of Firefox so manual
proxy configuration it's running on the
it's running on the HTTP proxy local so
I'm going it okay and now wait before
web suite starts I don't want to update
it
let's hit next and start Bob so again
temporary project running it as super
user for those of you who are usually
asked which programs I can run in
interactive mode meaning you can use
them in you mean you don't need to be
running in super user
let's turn off the intercept here and
what we're gonna do is we need to get
the HTTP POST we need to get the post
here the post request what is being sent
because
we need to understand what fields are
being sent and then we can use maybe an
online cracking tool here
okay so intercept is off let's just hit
something like test and one two three
something like that I'm gonna eat login
oops sorry
let's turn intercept on and I'm gonna do
that again to test and one two three
let's hit login and I'm gonna say whoops
sorry there we are we got the post the
post request here so that is the
WordPress login dot PHP correct that's
what we want the host is 192.168.1.1
wait what are we looking for here we are
looking for this this is what we are
looking for the fields here so submit we
are looking for the the fields were
looking for here okay let me explain
what we are doing I've intercepted the
post request here that's being sent to
the server so essentially these are the
fields that we need to be looking at the
log the password and the word press
submit because we need to also submit
what we are trying to do so I'm thinking
the first thing we should do is we need
to find a username because we don't know
any username and the way we can do that
is by testing our username that will are
in that dictionary file that they
provided with us and then we just
provide it with a random password like 1
2 3 and then WordPress will usually it
will give us a response telling us that
this user exists but that's the wrong
password once we get that HTTP POST the
the response that means we have actually
got the username we can then use
wordpress scan to brute force the
wordpress our installation here and we
can then gain access okay that being
said we have turned on the intercept now
what the most important thing that we
need to do now is we need to use an
online cracking tool but I'm not sure I
think I've forgotten the syntax here we
are going to use Hydra
I think Hydra is better then maybe
looking at other because it it supports
us using the HTTP requests and
essentially the the requests and the
responses it allows us to perform manual
requests and responses so we need burp
suite and we need to copy this Don but
first let me actually just launch Hydra
here
Hydra so the first thing we need to
specify is firstly I need to verbose my
output because I want to actually see
what the username is if in case we get
it we then want to specify the the word
list file all right so we on the desktop
know we are on tour H so CD desktop I'm
pretty sure I talked about the syntax in
the Hydra video so if you're not
familiar with that you can check that
out in the Hydra video so Hydra we're
gonna verbose and I'm gonna use the L
command to select the word list and
we're gonna say word list we should be
on the desktop now where they store dick
their dictionary file and we want to
select a password now the password I'm
just going to use a random password
because as I said again we are not that
we need to know the username first
because we cannot brute force without
their username so password we'll just
set it as one two three just let's keep
it simple we don't need to complicate it
now we need to select the the host the
host we have to use it in URL format no
kit is 192.168.1.1 of eight because it
will automatically get it we have to
specify the the the file that we're
trying to proof us which is the PHP the
login dot PHP file okay okay okay let me
just think so we are targeting an HTTP
POST forum post remember it's a post I
don't know whether I've actually talked
about HTTP I should actually make a
video on that this is really
embarrassing sorry about that case now
what is the file that we are targeting
it is the WordPress login alright so let
me just copy that
it's the WordPress login and then we
need to start using these fields all
right so HTTP POST form we won't use do
we need to use the quotation marks let
me paste that in WordPress login dot PHP
we are then going to use the fields here
so that is log test password and we need
to actually customize those fields so
log log is equal to user I think that's
how it's supposed to be log is equal to
user that was the fields that end I
entered remember with the username e is
not actually test so now we need to
actually enter the field that we are
going to be brute-force
which is user and you do that by using
the power to the power of sign I'm not
sure what it's actually called just
correct me in the comments and the
password which is PWD always it's always
PWD remember that is the field is equal
to the value the value is always going
to be password I'm not sure I'm gonna
get this right I'm actually seeing how
complicated this is now and we finally
need to submit which is WordPress
WordPress submit I'm not to show that's
right word press submit and then that's
going to be equal to is it log in is it
log in because this is what press login
all right what that's going to be equal
to log in and then WordPress usually if
it's a wrong username it should return
invalid username that also works for
Joomla okay so submit is equal to log
Plus in that is the fee field over there
is that capital I n I'm actually for
cotton yes capital I n and then if if
this fails we have to also specify that
so if this fails we're going to say
equal to invalid username alright and
that's going to be invalid username is
that was it capital no username all
right invalid username so now this
should actually get the username for us
once I hit enter I just pray we get the
the HTTP POST request our response form
let's see if we actually get it alright
so it started and thank God I hit
verbose because we were not going to get
this I'm trying to look for the the post
response here but for some reason I
can't get it so this is actually being
up becoming a bit scary now so
essentially what we are looking for is
the post and that should be it should be
written somewhere on this side here
where it's specifying the target so let
me just keep on looking for it and let's
see if it's it's updating to the latest
one here nothing so far so I'm guessing
I'm supposed to let this continue going
I'm not sure we actually gonna get it
cause getting the username now is going
to be really complicated or should I
have actually edited that what if we
used a
normal dictionary because I don't think
I was supposed to actually edit it so
you know what before we actually
continue with this meanwhile ever let me
just see if we can find any regularities
oh that was something different no
nothing there yeah so what I'm gonna do
is I'm going to use the default
dictionary file that they provided with
to us which was the F Society inter
dictionary file so I'm just gonna do
that right now I'm just gonna edit that
F society the I shouldn't have actually
changed it it will come in handy during
the brute-force and so that it the
dictionary limit enter alright so yeah I
do not want to use the restore file so
just just skip it so I'm gonna wait for
10 seconds here because that's getting
really annoying there all right there we
are fantastic and are we getting any
risk although we are there we are we got
it we got it we got it we got it
there we are HTT p-- oast for the
response was sent from the server which
is Eliot all right so the login the user
name is Eliot oh wow alright so let's
actually note that down well Vanille if
by do something so the user name is
Eliot so we got the user name excellent
that's awesome man I didn't actually
expect that to work alright so I've got
the response which is Eliot we know that
the user name is Eliot and we can
actually try this by typing in Eliot
here Eliot let's see if we look in what
happens ah oops is my sorry the proxy I
don't think we're gonna need bub sweet
but I might be wrong let's disable the
proxy there and we can also close Bob
sweet here yes I want to exit let's
actually reload that yes resend invalid
user name oops
Eliot let's yeah password field is empty
yes so that is a valid user excellent so
we actually got the response that's
fantastic okay let's clear this off now
we have the user name and now we need to
get the password so that we can finally
log in to the administrator of the
WordPress I'm thinking we should also
use a Hydra because it cracked it
immediately right well it didn't
actually perform any cracking it just
got the username it enumerate that
enumerated the user name so let me just
clear this off we're going to be using
wordpress scan so wordpress scan or WP
scan i should actually make a video on
WordPress scan as well and we'll select
the URL
which is 192.168.1.1 or eight is that
the IP yeah it is the IP 192 168 now we
have got the username which we specify
at the end we need to specify the word
list which is done by word list are we
on the desktop
oh boy I'm not too sure all right so
word lists you know what we actually
shouldn't be doing this in route because
WordPress can has issues in route so I'm
just gonna close this up and we can open
up another terminal change to my desktop
all right let's stop clear and we'll use
the we'll use the other one that we
created the word list or dictionary file
all right so hopefully this works as
well so WordPress can URL URL here which
is 192.168.1.1 of a and then word list
now with the important thing about read
press scan is something that I should
have touched upon is you need to always
specify the location so home home it's
not going to assume that you have it in
your working directory because it's
going to assume that you want to use the
default passwords or word lists so home
Alexis that's the username and my
desktop and it's called word list dot
dictionary all right so that's the name
of the word list and we remember we
sorted it out so it helps us so so right
now this should be very efficient
efficient sorry and we need to specify
the username which is username this
should be very easy to crack now and we
got the is name which is Elliot so let's
hit enter and hopefully the WordPress
can oh we got an error here
what error did we get permission denied
looks like after actually use root sorry
about that guys my apologies let me
actually just copy this cause again I'm
and this they sometimes I can't just
keep on typing these commands back in
all right so let's hit enter let's see
what we get there we are WordPress can
has started and we should have actually
use WordPress but I didn't know the
server's running WordPress because we
are the robots so txt file immediately
detected so it's gone through the
different vulnerabilities and there it's
brute-forcing
elliot and yes this should be much
efficient look at the time limit it's
being that's being taken here
the eta is about three minutes I think
and it's going through the current
usernames and passwords combinations yes
so this is going to probably take a
while and it's all probably already done
so this is what I was talking about
remember when you have a huge word list
or a dictionary file and this is a
dictionary attack because we have
provided with a dictionary file and it's
just going to go through you know trying
the different combinations username
password username password so let's see
if we can actually get it I'll be
surprised if we get it really really
quickly because I'm guessing they've
made it as hard as possible because a
lot of you guys were complaining about
this so whilst we've until now we have
only got the first key which is key 1 of
3 dot txt
excellent so that's pretty nice I like
that we've already got the first one
there's nothing we can do here so let me
close the Preferences there because
we're not playing around with proxies
anymore and this is still brute-forcing
the time elapsed is one minute so yeah
this is gonna take a while if it takes
more than two minutes I'll probably have
to skip this and get back to you when
it's done all right so let's just wait
for this to complete it's already gone
through three 3,500 combinations so 30%
and this is actually going quite well
that's what that sorting was very very
efficient as you can see this one opens
really really quickly and it sorts
everything out in terms of their
alphabetical and numerical order let's
go back here has it got the password yet
not yet that's really weird man actually
I'm actually seeing this any time now
I'm guessing or we'll have to wait for
it to complete we'll probably put the
password right at the end I'm not too
sure let's see let's see again it's all
about trial and error I know this video
is going to be long but again I'll just
sit back relax and let's see how far we
can actually go down this rabbit hole oh
there we are
we got the password excelente excelente
so as you can see brute-force Eliot time
took is one minute 56 just as I
predicted all right so we don't have the
ID we have the name which is login is
Eliot and the password so let's copy
that that password is actually a good
password I won't lie that is good
password keeping practice alright so
we've got the username and password and
weird
with WordPress can let's see if we can
login please work
oops let me just paste that back in here
the password and login and come on tell
me give me a sec say yes yes we are
finally in excellent
so inside WordPress now I'm guessing we
no need to exploit the server we need to
perform some exploitation here now or we
need to exploit WordPress and I'm really
confused
because my admin and my admin where our
users let me check you from admin
administrator yes I am admin excellent
so that means I can actually install
plugins so let's see what how I can
exploit this so I'm thinking of
exploiting and or should I actually
create a backdoor node that will give me
access only to the WordPress folder we
need to exploit the WordPress server we
already have access to the WordPress
server so that's not a problem we need
to install we need to install a reverse
shell yes we need to install a reverse
shell now can we find a reverse shell
here shell oops reverse shell let's just
search one for dr. ko there's usually
one that you can get immediately just by
performing a simple search engine search
for some reason my internet is just
really annoying at this time reverse
shell yeah there we are pen test monkey
so we can actually use this reversal and
then gain access to the server Oh hold
on hold on hold on hold on
I think I have a better idea I remember
we can actually use Metasploit here we
can use Metasploit hold on we don't even
actually have to install any plugins
let's start Metasploit the MSF console
if I can remember the exploit name it
was a linux exploit for WordPress but it
required you to enter the user name and
password so this is perfect for us let
me just minimize that or we'll actually
need them right now so let's start
Metasploit please do not take time to
start man this is getting really
annoying now it matters play okay so
with plugins it looks like there were
some outdated plugins as well as you can
see it also had wordfence i'm not to
show detail of what fence no data the
standard ones
we can also install a file manager here
which I probably shouldn't do right now
because I'm waiting for my display to
start up here really quick are there we
ight started okay what was the name of
that exploit no let me just expand this
up what was the name was it WordPress
shell was it WordPress shell was it
WordPress admin shell so let me search
WordPress WordPress admin let me search
for that or shed the module database
cache was not built apart in my language
there I should have actually not said
that so I've already gone through
Metasploit on the channel so for those
of you a bit confused on how to use it
you can check out the the other videos
that I covered with Metasploit and it
looks like it's going through the
through the database I hope I find it
was it the WordPress admin reverse shell
or shell because it was a reversal and I
know it really needed you to enter the
our host the username and the password
and it also had a few of the options I
can't remember we had actually used this
I think in in college when we were
trying to exploit WordPress well let
that thing exploiting WordPress was
breathe man trust me or there exists one
exploit Unix yes it is Unix
web yeah that's the one I'd mention
upload so this essentially creates a
reverse shell for us automatically so we
don't have to create the reverse shell
and then upload it to the WordPress site
okay so as you can see the rank is
excellent and it was released in 2015 so
we're gonna say use remember if you want
to use an exploit we can say use and
then we just copy the name here or you
can type it in if that's what you prefer
so I'm gonna paste that in and I'm gonna
hit enter so there we are
wordpress admin shell upload so now
let's see the options you can just type
in options or show options all right now
we are getting to the hard stuff we need
to specify the password so let's set the
password pass set password and let's
copy the password here which is this
right here copy it here so we've set the
password to that we need to set the our
host which is the target IP which we
know set our host so this should be put
quite easy so then we should gain access
to the WordPress
then we need to perform escalate as
privilege escalation our host for ninety
two point one sixty eight one sixty
eight point one point one oh eight I
believe let me just confirm I don't get
anything wrong yes that's the one as
we've said the our host fantastic now do
we need to set the up what no we are
kana communicating through HTTP SSL it
does not have SSL remember if your site
has SSL always select SSO username
username username set username whoops
for some reason yeah there we are
username name there we are and the
username most Elliott Elliott so it's
what it's going to do it's going to it's
going to login for us and it's gonna
create the reverse shell for us okay
so let's actually see what happens and
then it's probably gonna create for us a
reverse meterpreter shell so I'm gonna
enter and finally let's hit exploit and
it's the moment of truth are you with me
let's go let's go let's go let's go come
on oh my god man no session was created
the target is not appear to be using
WordPress let's try that again come on
come on man this should work remember if
it doesn't work always keep on
retraining why is the the port the the
our port all the output why is that the
our port is set to eighty why is it
going through pot all Don set our port I
should have actually set this myself and
then I can exploit it to myself why is
it going through what the damn hell is
going on here you first started reverse
oh that's my IP oh sorry about that guys
exploit aborted due to failure the
target has not appeared to be using
WordPress alright so exploit completed
but no session was created let's see for
some reason I'm getting this weird why
is it even giving me this error man this
usually is to work really well
we host wordpress username closes we
have already added that the base path
target URL I probably have actually have
to set that so let me actually set the
target target
target URL is that target URL URI target
your eye and that is WordPress admin and
that is what press admin dot PHP
WordPress let me actually just log out
here WordPress login dot PHP that's the
file we are looking for that's exactly
what we're looking for footrests login
dot PHP does it already have the slash
for us your wordpress login dot PHP
let's place that in there sorry actually
enter that incorrectly let's try and
exploit this now for some reason we are
getting this this is really weird man
export the exploit failed this is really
really weird man let's try that one more
time for some reason it just isn't
working alright so it looks like we're
gonna have to find another way into this
system and this probably what most of
you guys were talking about it's
probably this is the this is the whole
deal with this this virtual machine
being very hard in terms of CTF we don't
want to use proxies required our hosts
our port we have entered that the SSL is
not required target username is required
what we are going to do is we are going
to try it exploit again and for some
reason it starts the reverse TCP Handler
and for some reason it just doesn't work
should I well actually I think I know
what to do
let's try run this in route because it's
probably failing to open the ports be
the posts that I was talking about
so MSF console myself console let's
let's try that again and then search for
the WordPress admin shell I think that
would that's what it was called but this
is really weird man we already have the
password let me just enter a key I will
probably have to use the reverse shell
as I expected we have to create our own
so let me actually search for that
reverse shell and it was pen test monkey
I believe that's actually quite a good
site they were a pen test monkey alright
so so we want to use let's see
you didn't use PHP or what language do
you want to use we can also use Python
but I think PHP is better because what
we can do is we can create it we can
then save the file let's download the
PHP reverse shell I'm gonna download it
okay and I'm gonna save it that's it
okay there we are
Shoal downloads they were pph be
reversed she has it open the folder this
is for some reason this server is
becoming unresponsive it's a problem
with my virtual machine let me just
check that out guys maybe that was the
issue sorry about that
I really I'm sorry about that because it
looks like my virtual machine may have
turned off let me actually turn that on
right now and I'm gonna try and run a
ping on it again alright so let me just
try and ping it using nmap yep and for
some reason the login is just not
working or is it my internet that
stopped working I'm not really sure so
for some reason I don't know what's
going on here man sorry about this guy's
let me just restart my network manager
service network that's probably the
issue here
restart I'm pretty sure because my
internet seems to be working fine I've
just restarted my network manager here
again let's see if that login that login
works again now we've connected to the
Wi-Fi network let me just stop the
request here I want to resend my
information and still our Wi-Fi doesn't
seem to be working oh there we ID is
working now alright alright so I think
that was the problem that was the issue
all right so we're gonna search again
for this really really quickly WordPress
admin because I know this video is
almost going to almost an hour now with
a WordPress admin well this is this
really embarrassing guy sorry about that
was it what this admin shell yeah it was
shell it was hell so let me just go
through searching it and I hope now we
can actually we can actually go through
it oh this yeah alright so so that's
fine it's going through the same
instance anyway we can still use the
reversal if that fails probably gonna
have to cut this video into two parts if
it gets too long because I don't want my
videos to be this long alright so we
have the reverse shell here and this is
the reversal so we can actually
with an editor let's just open it with
Jeannie Jeannie is a very good editor so
that's the reverse shell now it should
allow us to change our IP address which
is right here which we should change
here one ninety two one one sixty eight
point one point 109 and the port will
leave it at one two three four chunk
size normal and we can actually save
this so we can file save done all right
so that's done
excellent all right so we've found the
exploit here so I'm gonna say use and we
want to just quickly copy this right now
I know I'm wasting your time guys copy
paste that in this is my first time
doing this so it's off to actually after
a long time so show options set password
pass password and we want to set the
password here and let's just copy that
really quickly and let's paste that in
here paste that in there you want to set
whoops sorry about that guys set the
username we want to set the username
right now username and we want to set
the username to Elliott oops my bad I
keep on dead typing in my my caps lock
username said Elliot the our host set
our host set our host Tony to one point
one sixty eight point one point one
eight I think that the virtual machine
goes offline if I don't use it so that's
actually something you have to look at
and I think we can find it exploit the
mate enter it should actually create it
for us but if it doesn't then we have to
use the other reverse shell so it
started the reverse TCP Handler and yeah
for some reason it's telling us that we
are not using WordPress so let's try and
set for the last time the target URL so
target URI and we want to use current
setting will say WordPress let's
actually copy that WordPress login dot
PHP login dot PHP alright and grenade
enter and going to exploit hopefully
this time works and yeah it's definitely
not working so we're gonna have to go
through the reverse shell now ah we're
gonna have to upload it so
we're gonna have to piss the password
here let me just copy that quickly paste
that in there
log in like so alright and for some
reason it just keeps on going offline
what the damn hell is going on here man
let me just check again the virtual
machine for some reason it just keeps on
going online this is really weird man I
apologize guys this is getting really
annoying right now man so I really
apologize let me just switch back here
to my to my part OS computer and let me
just try and login back again okay this
is definitely not working there is
something wrong here something is
definitely wrong I don't know what the
issue is not running anything anything
on that virtual machine I am pretty sure
I have to what I'm going to have to do
is let me just see if my internet is
working really really quickly all right
so let me just save maintain it is
working here I'm just gonna try and
reload the page here it is working so
I'm really shocked as to what the hell
is going on I have to switch back to my
virtual machine so let me just switch
back here and let's see what the issue
is I probably have to restart it so I'm
gonna wait for it to restart here and
get back to you when this is done
alright so this is going to be part 1 in
the next part we'll be continuing where
we left off from and I'll be seeing you
in the next part alright so let me just
switch back here and remember I'll be
seeing you in the next part let me just
stop the recording now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
