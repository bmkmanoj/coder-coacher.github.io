with another video and finally guys it's
here I know it's been long I haven't
uploaded any video related to hacking
except the podcast by the way I know you
guys have been saying whether or not I'm
going to be it the podcast is available
on iTunes
I'm currently working on that to
basically happen so let's get started so
in this video well actually a Script
developer contacted me and asked me if I
could showcase his script for Kali Linux
and I said why not let me give it a try
let's see what it's all about and it's
pretty pretty awesome so I'm basically
going to be guiding you on installing it
and how to use it and hopefully I can
basically get an idea of what it is so
the link to the github repository for
this script is going to be in the
description section so you make sure to
check that out if you guys are
interested in this script again this is
going to be the environment this kali
linux environment that i'm going to be
working on many of you guys want a
parrot or videos those are also coming
really really quickly so let's get
started so what you want to do again is
you want to make sure you just open up
your browser i'm guessing if you're
running this on kali linux you want to
use firefox for some reason it's taking
too long now i believe i visited the
page prior i think yesterday just to
test it out and here we are that's the
page right here so let me just open that
up hopefully it does open that up i am
connected to the internet let me just
open that in a new tab right there so
you can close that out and here we are
this is the web page again link will be
in the description section so basically
this is the developer who contacted me
and asked me to do a review on his
script so let's actually get started so
i'm sure most of you guys know how to
install from github if you don't just
open up your terminal and you just want
to hit you make sure you have get
installed just hit sudo apt-get get
like so up yet get Kali Linux I'm sure
comes with with gate so you can make
sure you have that installed so
basically rather repository and we're
going to say get clone you then want to
go to the repository right here and it's
going you wanna go here and say Claude
or download it's going to say clone this
is the this the link that you want to
copy right here copy that to your
clipboard and you just want to paste
that right here so git clone is that
right here obviously my my working
directory is the home directory so
that's where the folder is going to be
stored but for this demonstration what
I'm going to do is let me just copy this
entire command so I don't have to write
it down I'm going to save it on the
desktop so you can see what the file
looks like
alright so let's let me just go to my
desktop desktop there we are so that's
my desktop it it's clean so we can now
paste this and we can make that work
from there so it's going to start it's
going to download the files as you can
see here is the folder el script so now
what we want to do if we check the files
on the desktop we have the el script
folder so I'm going to enter the el
script folder by the way the developers
made it really really simple to install
so we're inside the folder let's check
what we have we have the Installer SH
it's not going to basically if we try
and run it the normal way we'll try and
run an install script ah Sh you see
would get an error permission denied so
basically what we have to do is you have
to chmod plus x to change permissions
and install not sh to give us permission
now if we run V if we check the files
you can see the install dot SH is active
that means we have permission to run or
install it so let's do that
install dot sh I hope I'm not going too
fast
all right it's going to select really
really great installation process as you
can see so basically
existed it's going to say installing the
script is going to say fixing
permissions so basically it's going to
say are you updating or installing the
script so I am I think I already have it
installed so today I'm updating if you
guys installing or let's actually just
use installing so I so adding l script
done it's going to give you some pretty
good some funny funny comments that the
developers left oops
what do i do there okay I think actually
know what happened there
basically I I'm probably sure that you
guys are not going to get this error so
what I'm going to do is if I just try
and type after it installed it's going
to ask you actually I think I should
show you the complete installation
process CDL script
let me just enter the fold again and run
the installation again all right it's
it's going to run it for me but I think
that the reason I'm getting this error
is because I'm actually I've actually
installed this script so that's probably
the reason I should have actually got
uninstall it so I'm going ahead updating
alright so again there's a change log
pretty cool right so you're going to
open it for us
alright so it's basically installed now
if you're doing a fresh installation
it's going to ask you to basically to
configure your your wireless chords the
interface names so it's probably going
to ask you for your Wi-Fi card name to
do that just check IW config sorry is
conflict that's going to basically show
your wireless got their names as you can
see land this is probably using Wi-Fi
this is going to be your interface min
and if you're using the ethernet that's
going to be the name Ethernet 0 what
wireless wlan0 it then going to ask you
for your interface names in my
new mode now maybe some of you guys know
what my mood is I mean when it's in
monitor mode excuse me
so if I hit I have iwconfig it's going
to show me my current interface cards
and if any as you can see I have my land
0 that's currently active I'm actually
using internet right now but if you're
using my land 0 you'll see that the mode
is managed so we want to change it to
monitor mode not manage mode I think you
guys know how to do that it airmon-ng
that's one way of doing it M or ng start
start one plan zero all right and it's
going to start monitor mode for my Wi-Fi
card and it's going to say that the
interface name now is LAN LAN LAN zero
Mon so before the second option it's
going to ask you for the name of your of
your interface card when in monitor mode
and that's the name it's probably gonna
be so once you've done that you can then
type F I mean sorry L to basically run
the lazy script command just hit L I've
accepted the terms these two lists
educational purposes only use this tool
on your own network and network without
permission
the basic stuff right there and it's
going to ask you to basically tasking
whether you accept the terms so yes I do
and again this is what I was telling is
going to ask you for the name of your or
when manage mode what's the name of your
Wi-Fi card so we checked and we know
it's land 0 probably that's what you
it's going to be for you enter the name
of your wireless interface when in
monitor mode again I showed you how to
do that LAN 0 1 all right and then it's
going to say it done and if you want to
change it you can type interface at any
time really really great user interface
created by the way this is the developer
name I don't really know how to
pronounce this but this is first name is
eros so a huge shout-out to RS so there
we are we have the Navy script pretty
cool so basically you have all the
options in terms of numbers that's
probably help you and show most of you
on
stand how that works so you have your
you type I f4 ifconfig basically what
the purpose of the script is doing is
making everything easier for you instead
of opening multiple terminals when
you're configuring your working
environment so let's say you wanted to
enable your wireless card you could get
one you wanted to enable monitor mode
you can hit two you want to change your
MAC address again this is something most
of you don't like doing manually so you
could do it so it's going to ask you
let's try that it's going to ask you
what what the MAC address for what if
the phase you want to change let's say
LAN
zero so basically change it to a random
or specific so I want to change it to
random and it's going to do that if I
was connected it's probably not allowed
me to or to do that because I'm
currently using a Ethernet cable but
that works you can then view your public
IP which I'm not going to show you
because again I want to pro keep myself
as safe as possible
you have your arm you have your unknown
Cerf so if you have an unsourced
installed I have made a video on Adams
on announcers so you can check that out
you can hear your current Mac you have
tools your handshake you have web
hacking man-in-the-middle Metasploit so
it really just making everything shorter
and easier for you again it's called the
lazy script and I guess from that you
can deduce what it's all about so
another cool thing that is done that I
really really liked is this right here
be number 9 which is tools now the
reason for this is because this is the
tools that are currently a very popular
on github and are just scripts that you
would find but a very very popular
scripts that some of you may or may not
know I really don't know so I'm just
going to hit I have no additional tools
installed so I'm going to hit 5 we want
to install one of these tools and it's
going to ask me
aha what tools you're the install so it
has the angry IP scanner it has Fluxion
which is for Wi-Fi I'm sure most of you
guys know it has Wi-Fi it
it has Haku it has fun fun Wi-Fi cracker
of course some of them
are currently you won't find them in
Kalia next 2017 point one so they
actually there and some of them are self
independent scripts like the way the
lazy script is and you can install them
from here so let's say we wanted to
install fern it just hit 11 it's going
to say install in front its cloning the
github URL there we are and that's
probably going to start it's going to
start this tool Asian process isolation
I've clicked on that because it might
actually take longer than normal but
just let it install again it's up to you
again this tool is making everything
easier for you there we are
so let's go exit and actually I
shouldn't have done that let's go l as
you can see pretty pretty cool from just
by typing L it's really really awesome
the ease of access I have to have to you
know I just have to say a huge thanks to
Aris for this tool it's really really
simple to you so let's say you wanted to
check the tools online again we have our
Wi-Fi tools which is fun as you can see
fern is installed obviously red is for
things
Zack sees we have the axe is pretty cool
that I'm sure most of you DDoS is out
there know what rexy's is as you can see
caution I'll actually be doing a video
on the X is very soon so basically I
have Wi-Fi to install that comes with
with Kali Linux so we have fun let's try
and run fun I think it's fun with the
GUI I'm not sure actually have some
errors that's probably because again
there we are so we have fun Wi-Fi
cracker no you can select interface card
line 0 let's see if that actually works
all right we can then scan for access
points and I'm pretty sure I have some
weapon WPA networks that we can actually
get but that's for another video so guys
that's basically it for this video can
you actually enter
let me just exit this terminal and let's
run the script again again really simple
just
else and you're there so you can check
for updates you can fix errors you can
change the keyboard shortcuts depending
on what you guys want to do you can
enable multiple commands at the same
time that are actually doing one thing
again you can disable your wireless card
you can disable monitor mode you can
restore the original Mac just an awesome
tool that basically does everything for
you so I really really encourage you
guys to check this out because this is
one of the scripts that can save you a
lot of time and for beginners it's a
great starting point I would recommend
that you learn how to do each of these
steps yourself because it's very
essential that you know that but if you
already experienced in this this is
something that can really really help
you anyway guys sorry for the long video
I just wanted to show you how to install
it and to troubleshoot it in case you
have any problems I just showed you have
to install it and update it if that's
what you're doing so yeah pretty pretty
cool tool go and check it out for
yourselves let me know what you guys
