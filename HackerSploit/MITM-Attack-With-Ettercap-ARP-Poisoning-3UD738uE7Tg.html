another video so a lot of you guys have
been asking me to elaborate more with
the man-in-the-middle attacks and more
specifically to show you how to use a
tool called attack app alright so for
those of you don't know what attack app
is attack app is a fantastic security
tool that allows you to perform man in
the middle attacks on land or on your on
your local network alright so it comes
pre-installed and pre-configured in Kali
Linux which is you know fantastic so you
don't have to download or set anything
up all the only thing you need to do is
you if you haven't logged into Kali
Linux for a while just update your
packages and make sure you run and make
sure you're running the latest version
alright so in the previous video and we
were looking at a RP spoofing with ARP
spoof some of you actually noticed in
the comments that I did not forward the
packets in the sense that I did not
allow the the flow of packets through my
computer being the man at the middle
allowing it to flow to and back you know
through to the router and back to the
client or our target for this matter
okay so hopefully I can explain how to
do that right now I actually did it
before the video assuming that many
people know how to do it and a lot of
people were saying that their connection
isn't working and I actually remember
that yes that that is an essential step
so I'm gonna show you how to do it now
alright so just open up your terminal
and obviously make sure you're in root
it always helps and now we're going to
use the system a control command so
system control and we now want to select
the option W - right so W - right and
the net and not what was in net dot ipv4
yes we want to Ford ipv4 packets dot IP
fourth
sorry IP Fort IP four equals to 1.so the
value should be equal to one alright so
that is the command that will allow the
flow of packets through your computer as
you're acting between the router and the
client so I just hit enter and it should
give you the results saying yes the the
ipv4 IP will will
the value should be one all right so
once you've done you're done with that
we can get started with etic app all
right so etic app as the city is
pre-installed with Kali Linux so you can
just search for it and you can just go
into your search menu I'm just going to
attack app and you make sure you select
attack app graphical because that's what
I'm going to be elaborating in this
video so just click on it now before we
get started with actually you know
performing any man-in-the-middle attacks
you need to have a target so in this
case I have a target here all right so I
have a target there and this is a
Windows 7 operating system that is going
to act as our target so we're going to
try and intercept the packets being sent
between the Windows 7 operating system
and my and my router all right so once
you've opened up a tack app what you
need to do the first thing you need to
do is you need to select your sniffing
option so usually if you're connected
physically to the Ethernet so what I
mean when I say physically is you're
actually connected to an Ethernet
adapter or to a switch or to a hub then
I would recommend that you use bridge
sniffing so what this means is if you
are in a situation like you're in an
organization where you have you know
your computer is connected to a switch
that is also connected to other
computers in the organization I would
recommend that you use the bridged
sniffing otherwise in my case I'm just
gonna use unified sniffing because I
only want I'm only using one adapter
there's no bridged connection ok so now
it's going to ask you to select your
network interface I'm going to select
Ethernet 0 because that I'm using
Ethernet right now and by default you
can also select your wireless adapter if
that's what you choose to use so just it
ok and now as you can see it's going to
tell you that the unified sniffing
process is started and what you have to
do now is you need to add a target so
you want to go into targets and you want
to go into current targets now as I said
this is very very similar to our spoof
where you would simply add your your
router IP address and your target IP
address similar to what you would do
with with our spoof so what you do with
a spoof is you would firstly the first
step would be to select your to select
the target as the router IP address and
then you use the your target IP at
as the secondary on so in this case all
you need to do just add your your your
target one IP address as your router so
192 point one sixty eight point one
point one that is my router IP address
it is your default gateway address if
that's what you're wondering so you can
just type in ifconfig and you can find
your default gateway and just get that
and put it in here now you need to get
your target IP address which you can
which I'm going to do and I can do using
my command prompt here using the IP
config command so IP config it's been a
long time since I've used Windows seven
but boy it feels good so there you are
192 point one sixty eight point one
point one or two and which is gonna go
into our target and hit add and we're
gonna say 192 point one sixty eight
point one point 102 and we hit OK
alright so we've added our target you
know IP address and our router IP
address okay so now we need to actually
perform the the ARP poisoning attack
that will give us man in the middle
access so to do that it's really very
simple just going to man in the middle
and click on ARP poisoning and now it's
going to ask you for optional parameters
make sure you check sniff remote
connections and just hit OK so once
you've done that the ARP poisoning has
begun and it's currently running so now
you can use a traffic or network
sniffing tool like Wireshark or TCP dump
which is what we're going to be using so
if I just open up TCP dump I really
enjoy using TCP dump sometimes so TCP
dump TCP dump and we can say the
interface is Ethernet zero and we
specify the the port port 80 the target
or actually the host is 192 point one
sixty eight point one point one or tube
in our target and we whoops for some
reason we're getting an error port 80 or
sorry about that in N and 80 and we hit
the port sorry I forgot the port command
there it's actually been a while since
I've used TCP dump and for some reason I
keep on getting this syntax error here
so we've selected our host so n port 80
host and host so I forgot to add the end
and there we are alright so yeah
the syntax for TCP dump is
confusing in the sense that you have to
specify the you have to specify the
interface that you're using you don't
have to specify the port which in this
case we're using the TCP port and our
host which is 192.168.1.1 or two that is
the target IP that we want to sniff the
traffic from so now if I go into my
Windows operating system here and I just
let me just open a new window here like
so and I just try and open a site like
Reddit com
all right so reddit com and I just go
back to Kali Linux and as you can see
there we are the traffic is being
captured just as though just the way we
wanted it now additionally you can use
Wireshark if that is what is comfortable
for you but there you go that is how to
perform a man-in-the-middle attack with
attack app it's really very simple the
process is exactly the same as to what
you would find with our spoof and that's
because they're both using the ARP
poisoning method all right so that's
going to be it for this video guys thank
you so much for the support on the
channel we have really really grown this
month this year and our target our first
target is 50,000 subscribers our second
target for the is 100,000 subscribers
and I'm really really pushing forward to
it thank you so much for everything you
guys if you found value in this video
please leave a like down below if you
have any questions any at all hit me up
in the comment section on my social
networks or on kik alright and you can
check out my website for the latest
Hockey News tutorials and guides so
thank you so much for watching guys and
I'll be seeing you in the next video
