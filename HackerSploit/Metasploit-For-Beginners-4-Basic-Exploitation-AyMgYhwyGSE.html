with another video and thank you so much
guys for all the support just want to
throw that out immediately I will
finally hit 30,000 subscribers that is
incredible and you know I just can't
thank you guys enough and I promise to
make even more informative and obviously
more videos on the channel alright that
being said let's get started with
today's video so in today's video we're
going to be continuing with our
Metasploit and today we will be looking
at some basic exploitation alright so
again following up from the information
gathering section where we learned how
to get the information we're still going
to be touching up on information
gathering using you know web
vulnerability scanners or like for
example open vs and we'll be looking at
all of that right but for now let's
focus on some basic exploitation now
before we start I just want to let you
guys know that I'm using Metasploit able
to and I would recommend that you use it
as well all right now reason being is
because it goes hand in hand with
Metasploit and it's a fantastic way of
learning or practicing your exploitation
you know you can you can configure it to
match your yours your skills and you can
increase the security etc etc by the way
we'll also be looking at the web
applications that come with Metasploit
able to for example the damn vulnerable
web application
Mozilla day etc etc but but for today
let's look at some basic exploitation
all right so I already have Metasploit
able to running as a virtual machine and
I already know the IP address so what
I'm going to do is I'm just gonna
perform an nmap scan with Zen map here
so we have a visual representation of
what's going on okay so I'm just going
to perform a scan and while it's
scanning as you can see it's already
discovered the open ports so we know
that's good so let me just open up my
terminal here and we can start up the
Metasploit console
let me just use the normal term in order
here so we have a good idea or we can
see what's going on in the terminal so
I'm gonna start off the MSF console
alright or the Metasploit console as it
is so while they're starting let's check
what information and map or in this case
Xen map has gathered all right so we've
got the ports and today we're going to
be exploiting the first one alright the
first services which is the FTP port so
it's running v SFTP v SF TPD all right
so that's very important that we
understand that it's running that
service because that's what they're
going to be exploiting today okay so
let's check if MIT the Metasploit
console has started up there we are
fantastic alright so what we need to do
first all right so as I said the first
thing that we need to know is what serve
this are we trying to are we trying to
attack in this case we are trying to
attack the port 21 the FTP port and the
software version or the service version
is V SFTP D 2.3.4 now this is a very old
software or a service version that is
running and it is extremely vulnerable
and again because it is Metasploit able
we know that this is designed to be
vulnerable so oops let me just go back
here so let's actually use some of the
exploits that come with Metasploit of
all right so let me just expand my
console there and what we need to do now
is if you remember with the basic
commands that we went through is we are
going to be using an exploit alright so
again obviously from the title of the
video you already guessed that that
we're going to be using an exploit
so from this stage or notes I'm guessing
that you're familiar with the syntax
that we're going to be using so the
first thing we need to do is we need to
search we need to search for an exploit
all right so it's really very simple all
we do is it search and now we go at the
information that we have all right let's
say we did not know at all what we're
doing here what we would do is would go
from the version that we have which is V
SFTP D all right so we would search for
vulnerabilities that involve the V SFTP
D service or
so service so search vsf TPD right and
I'm just gonna search now again I've not
started the database or built the
database so it's gonna take a few
seconds no need to worry there just let
it go on and it's gonna it's gonna
respond or it's gonna display or it's
gonna output some results for exploits
that we can use depending on this
surface okay so I'll just give it a few
seconds and let's see what we get what
exploits we can actually use to exploit
the Metasploit able to vulnerabilities
on the ftp port alright now going back
to the ports here as you can see we can
see that the state of the port is opens
which is pretty obvious that's how we'll
be able to get the attack but when we'll
be moving on to more advanced states
when you know when we have port states
can be open or filtered we'll be looking
at how to determine whether or not we
can perform an attack on it
all right so it looks like we've
responded there we are that's the
exploit that we are going to be using
alright so let me just tell launch that
so you can see all right so matching
modules all right so it's found one now
it's gonna ask us and of course this is
an exploit so it's an exploit for Unix
alright fantastic
it's an exploit for FTP all right that
is great it's an exploit for V SFTP D
2.3.4 fantastic so we've actually found
an exploit that matches what we're
looking for so again it's an ftp port
and it's roughly running vs ftp d 2.3.4
so excellent we've found what we needed
now let's look at the additional
information it is a back door right very
important let's look at the disclosure
date so that was when it was disclosed
obviously it's a very very old one
durability again you know for the
purpose of learning the rank is
excellent which means it has been used
and has been coned confirmed to work the
description simply describes what it's
all about we have the vsf TBD which is
the software version and the version
number followed by the function of the
exploit that this gives you right so
it's a backdoor commander
Oshin fantastic now let's use this
exploit how do we go about doing that
well simply put we just use and we can
just copy this right again the reason I
highlight this is to just show you how
it's done
all right so we can paste that with
control shift V or you can right-click
and paste it as well all right so we're
going to be using that and then we just
hit enter and if it's successful it
should say exploit and give the name of
the exploit awesome now as I said if you
know the syntax the the most efficient
thing to do now or the most the best
thing to do now is to show the options
alright so show options alright so there
we are these are the options that are
available with the exploit so we already
know that the let's go through this
stage by stage alright so when it shows
you the options usually with different
exploits or different modules you'll
have different options that you can
customize depending on the on the attack
vector alright so for example here we
have the name
alright the name of the option which in
this case we can change the are host
which is the IP address or the the
target IP that you have to set in order
for you to perform the exploit right and
then for the output since it already
knows it's running on the FTP port is
running on 421 it'll already set that
for you but if a port is missed
correctly configured which I've seen it
is incorrectly configured which I've
seen many times before trust me on many
many top servers have actually seen this
with you known myself that where this is
the systems administrator actually
configures the FTP port onto another
port number now when this happens it's
very important that you get to to know
this and that's why I said information
gathering is critical all right so now
we need to actually set the our hosts
which we are we've looked at before so
it's simply put set our hosts all right
so set our hosts and finally you have to
know the IP address in this case I've
set up a virtual lab and I'm running
this on my local network so the IP
address is going to be a local IP
address or a private IP address
so one ninety two point one sixty eight
point one point 107 right that's my
Metasploit able to IP address yours
might be different it should be
different again you know your network is
not going to be identical to mine all
right moving along so we're setting they
are host to that and that is the syntax
that we're using and we're gonna hit
enter and it's gonna give you the option
there are most is set to that current IP
address we can now show the options
again to confirm that indeed it did set
and as you can see yes it did now all we
have to do or what is left is we just
need to hit exploit and it will open up
a backdoor
hopefully all right if everything went
as planned so exploit oops exploit and
we hit enter and everything went as
planned and everything should have gone
as planned we should get a backdoor
there we are fantastic it has worked it
has created a reverse shell and command
shell actually so there we are we can
see the port that is outgoing and the
port that is incoming and the date at
which the this was open all right so you
might be asking well what are we doing
here well we actually have a reverse
shell so if I you name a alright if I
just check some Linux commands there we
are linux Metasploit able to silver blah
blah blah with the date that exists
there etc etc so we actually have we
have access to the server
fantastic so if we list the files as you
can see we have whoa this now this is
what I'm talking about the damage that
can be done here is is quite quite a lot
so you know you can actually enter the
root directory that's the list what we
have in there we have the desktop let's
see what we have on the desktop of
course there's not going to be anything
because I haven't put anything on the
desktop and that's because I don't have
a a desktop or a a desktop environment
installed on the Metasploit able to so
if I list what's in there you can see
there's going to be nothing but I'm
guessing you guess the idea that is some
basic exploitation of the services that
are currently running on Metasploit able
to now we'll be moving along into more
advanced ones and said we'll be looking
at web
web penetration testing would be looking
at the web apps that currently come with
Metasploit able to like the dam
vulnerable web application or PHP
myadmin
etc etc so that's gonna be for this
video guys I hope you found value in
this video if you did please leave a
like down below if you have any
questions at all let me know in the in
the comments section and you can hit me
