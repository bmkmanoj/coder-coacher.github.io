with another video and this is going to
be basically a continuation of the
ethical hacking course but it's going to
be a bit of a bonus video so right here
you're looking at parrot OS now you
might be asking yourself what is parrot
to us and why am i making a video about
it or a review about it well just a few
days ago parrot OS three point five I
believe released and well I had to give
it a try because it is also a
penetration testing distro and a
security distro however they've really
really really put a lot of work into
this distro well this version of this
destroy I have tried this before and I
have to say they really have done a good
job now they have done such a great job
that they've actually switched out Kali
Linux for this now the reason I I will
encourage you to to actually try this
out I mean I'm not saying switch from
Kali Linux 2 pirate OS but that's what
I've done and for the simple reason is
that it's just a really really visually
or aesthetically aesthetic it's a good
looking district now good looking to
stroke what can it do you might be
asking well as you all know Kali Linux
is not very friendly on on older
hardware now I've tried this on like
three of my older computers and it
worked flawlessly while it's running and
only take about four hundred megabyte
program so this really really is quite
good now the other thing is the
interface or the desktop environment
it's running it's currently running the
Ubuntu male or the obutu mate desktop
environment with their own little
Creek's and as you can see it seemed
really really well I mean it runs
absolutely smoothly on any any laptop
that you have as you can see here it's
running really really smooth the
transitions are absolutely smooth you
can see if I open the terminal it has
its own little term terminal see
which is also pretty cool but generally
speaking is a very very good-looking
distro and it's lightweight and it
actually it really resourced friendly in
terms of in terms of how much it
consumes so just straight off the back
it's already better than Kali Linux but
what really stands out I think when it
comes to security distros is we teachers
now this is a fantastic distro for
beginners I mean I would really
recommend this for a beginner ethical
hacker over kali linux let me explain
why so in the application section you
have your sections here simple
straightforward will do mater or Boojum
Ubuntu mate so one of the key things
that I really enjoyed was anonymous mode
now this means it's going to use the Tor
proxies to basically make you anonymous
and it just with one click you will be
anonymous and I think I can show you
this right now I'm just going to hit a
lot of most mode start and it's going to
ask for your password because it does
need elevated privileges it's going to
open and just let it run all right so
what it says want to give you a
basically notification right about here
this is the notification section here
you should be able to browse anonymously
and it'll basically be changing your
location just from different locations
so it's like it spoofing your location
so let me just minimize this and we're
just going to try try and go to
google.com right and as you can see it's
given me the notification anonymous surf
global anonymous proxy activated so yeah
you do expect your internet connection
to be a bit slow because you're running
through proxies but hey you're pretty
much anonymous now the other thing is
that a lot of people ask me about
accessing the Deep Web I would highly
recommend this distro for the Deep Web
because this has literally really
focused on anonymity cryptography and
go hacking I mean it's fantastic our
Google is taking quite a long time
Volodya was probably because I've
changed my location but let me just
close it up and start it up again I'm
really sorry about that probably because
it actually started late where the
service the anonymous service let me
just let's just open Google here so it
does come with a version of Firefox that
this seemed to they're basically get the
dark scene which is also pretty cool all
that's loading I just want to show you
the real stuff what I think what really
said what really brings Kali Linux and
and part ways together to be compared is
there security and the ethical hacking
tool now this has everything that Kali
Linux has and it's very very easy it's
very simple you have your your most used
tools the tools that you've used the
most I've been using this for almost
like about three or four days and it's
absolutely fantastic so um you have your
most used to cryptography again this is
not in Kali Linux this only exists here
which is pretty cool if you're really
focused on that type of thing you have
information-gathering standard
footprinting so you have your you have
Dimitri you have nmap your Zen map and
all the good stuff there vulnerability
analysis is basically only keto and n
map again databases access assessment
excuse me you have SQL map SQL us and
simple stuff like that everything's
there M DB SQL some really really
powerful tools everything's here
exploitation tools here we have the big
boys we have the social engineering
toolkit very very popular on Kali Linux
you have SQL map again you have
Metasploit again very very big e of
armitage really really all the tools
here you have the OS backdoors this
actually a section that I don't see on
Kali Linux at all the basically the web
backdoors we have mission very very
popular tool proxy chains ah here we are
this is another fan
plastic feature I mean it just makes it
so much easier for the beginner just I
mean of course you want you want to
learn about doing it busy terminal but
really for all for a beginner or even
advanced user this just makes it much
easier and save your time so you have
basically proxy change and you can
configure them to get even more
anonymity kind of your wireless testing
where you are the the fern River and we
show Pat a cow patty excuse me they're
digital forensics all the good stuff
explica really good stuff I've used nmap
I've used the as you can see as the the
tools I use the most
obviously Armitage really stands out
also air crack so they all work
fantastic alright so as for the security
tools and all the hacking tools it
pretty much has everything and as you
can see I'm running this on my laptop as
my daily driver so this is actually what
I've been using for my programming as
you can see you have all my all my ide
installed as a term ID 'fb QT creator
and all that good stuff as well you can
actually use this with your daily driver
because it you it's not only a hacking
distro like candala like this actually
focused for developers and you can just
use this as your the media player
whatever you want really it's a fully
fledged index distro now one cool thing
I like is this little bar here and all
this basically is a task manager and
when you click it it's going to give the
system monitor that's what it's called
an email axe so as you can see the
release 3.5 64-bit blogger blog is the
desk of environment mater or mate I keep
on saying that so here we have the
processes or what you call the task
manager in Windows and as you can see it
gives you all that's running and you can
basically toggle the highest fire be
whatever be using whatever resources
they're using Firefox using a bit more
memory than normal but I would regret it
if it was Google Chrome or we all know
that Google Chrome is a real resource
demanding process alright pretty cool
there's a toast manager up there you
have your term
no I did mention that D terminal the
terminal is themed to their style and
it's just a normal terminal you can do
your really cool things like just your
stand in the next command I mean you get
the idea right so that's pretty yeah
pretty awesome all my drivers work
perfectly I have AMD dedicated graphics
card on this laptop and it works
perfectly my Bluetooth working perfectly
I am actually connected to Ethernet
right now but that also works perfectly
all right now I'm going to talk to you
about the things that I like and the
things that I don't like about the
system all right let's start with the
things I like number one it is
lightweight all right it's very very of
course it's quite large in terms of the
download size but it's very very easy on
your hardware it doesn't tax your
hardware as much as Kali Linux number
two it has a really really good using
the face and they smooth use it user
interface now what this means is it's
running at full 60 frames per second a
lot of people have told me that Kali
Linux is very laggy on the system and I
know that's true even if you change the
desktop environment to something like
XFC xfce excuse me RIA it's still going
to be laggy so this actually as I just
showed you is running at 60 Hertz 60fps
ultra smooth alright number three it has
it has extra it has a bonus it has bonus
tools then what can in the next census
it has more cryptography tools which are
quite important and it has the anonymous
surf which basically allows you to
browse anonymously in just like one
click you don't have to download the tor
browser or configure the proxy change
manually which is the has being like one
click or that's what that's the first
thing I like the the fourth thing I like
is that it's ultra its ultra stable like
I've been using this for they said like
about three or four days and it's not
got even one crash and haven't broken
anything I mean I've been installing
things with synaptic and it just worked
absolutely perfectly I've updated it
nothing is broken
so this is actually it's better than
Kalin next as a as a daily driver they
have a cool have a cool collection of
wallpapers here as you can see that it
doesn't just load I also put some of my
own here some pretty awesome wallpapers
as you can see this one looks pretty
cool pretty awesome but anyway yeah
those are the basically the advantages
now the things I don't like about this
district is number one is that the
basically I don't like the fact that I
can it has no such research bar where I
can actually just quickly launch into a
program I want that by searching it
actually has to go down and go through
all of these sections and go on to be be
basically the categories and then
actually have to click the program I
mean it has two tasks buzz here what
well that's what they're calling windows
and this they basically perform more
advanced features the bottom one
basically allows you to shut down or
logo for enter the log lock screen so I
really don't like it's really not user
friendly when it comes to basically
launching application it's very user
friendly when it comes to the
applications and what it can actually do
but it's not user friendly when it comes
to launching applications it's quite
slow like in Kali Linux you can actually
just hit the windows button or these be
just your Start button and it will open
up a search bar where you can actually
search for a program number two I have
noticed too that the terminal you have
to actually install a few additional
packages that well you can you could say
come with every distro in well every
good distro so that really just stepped
me off a bit but it's nothing to get em
you get angry over or get disappointed
over that's basically it I only have
those two problems that out actually
urge them to fix and actually tried
installing a search search but what it
really didn't trigger maybe I'll have to
check it
to perform a few other basically write
another script and that's basically it
guys
now for the continuation of the lessons
where I'm going to be teaching you about
anonymity in the next lesson we'll be
you can use whatever destroy you want
for the lesson you can either use this
the link will be in the description it's
free just go and download it try it if
you like it hey go ahead and use it if
you don't well
Kali Linux is always there for you so
yeah that's pretty much it guys
I hope this video helped you if you did
please leave a like please make sure
involved in my social media so I
actually know what videos are coming out
and whether I'll be having any polls
that I might be maybe for for the
giveaway and stuff like that
but yeah that's pretty much it the other
thing guys is if you have any question
regarding this destroy anything
regarding the basically the ethical
hacking let me know in the comment
section on my social networks or on kik
just taking up and we can we can see
what we can do about your question maybe
I can answer it maybe we can help each
other yeah that's pretty much it guys
thank you for watching peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
