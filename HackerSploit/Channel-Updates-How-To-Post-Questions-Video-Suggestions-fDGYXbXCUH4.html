with another video this time just a
different type of video a little bit of
an update video where I can talk
directly to you guys and the first thing
owners say guys is thank you so much for
the support of the channel and I want to
thank you all because it's because of
all of you that we've reached so far and
not only in terms of in terms of the
subscriber base but the fact that we are
getting even more countries different
people from even more countries joining
us on the channel and learning you know
learning a lot not just from my videos
but from each other you know I love the
engagement and the questions and the
communication that happens in the
comment section it really is great to
see that you're all helping each other
alright so the reason I'm making this
video is just to address a few things in
regards to the structure of the channel
right so the first thing that we need to
look at together and and we need to
understand is the the process of posting
questions alright posting questions that
you want me to answer all right now you
can post questions in the comment
section there's no worry about that and
I will try to reply to all the comments
all right because especially now since
the channel has grown there are a lot of
comments and I have to take time to
reply to each and every one of them
because that is what I believe in right
I've implied to each and every one of
your comments now if for some reason I
do not see your comment and do not see
your comment and don't reply I did not
do it on purpose alright some comments
get lost some of them get sent to the
spam folder I cannot control everything
regarding the comments so I will try to
respond to each and every one of your
comments within 24 hours okay now if you
were to post a serious question or a
question that you want to ask me
directly you can do it through the
website alright so the website I've
really really sorted it out to work and
it can serve a lot of purposes now so in
terms of your questions you can go into
the ask questions tab and you can just
click on that alright and if you have
not signed up already you can just do
that here and you can post a question
directly to me that'll answer alright so
you can just post a question here title
give it the body you can select a
question
category you can either tag your email
and your name so I can get in contact
with you if it's if it's something that
you know very very personal okay so this
is where you can post your questions now
please do mind that I'm only going to
admit it to technology or are related to
the world of of cybersecurity etcetera
etcetera now if you want to know contact
me for anything else you know that is
not to do with the channel and
technology then you can contact me
directly through my email okay so that
is how to post your questions now by
default you can still post your
questions in on my social networks for
example Facebook a lot of you guys ask
me questions there which I do answer as
most of you know and then as for Twitter
I usually use Twitter to connect with my
audience all right so a lot of you guys
have actually followed me on Twitter
which is awesome and we really have a
good time connecting with each other we
share a lot of you know we shall lot of
content there and it's a good way of
interacting with each other so if you
want some interaction with me direct
interaction you can you can you can
follow me on Twitter but that's only if
you're if you're interested in Twitter
I know Twitter isn't for everyone but
that's how it is alright so as for kik
now the thing with kik is a lot of you
or not a lot of you some of you are
actually spamming me with content and
you know you're sending me phishing
messages and you know one of one of my
accounts actually had to create an
account twice got it actually got banned
or I think it got disabled by Hickam not
sure how that works but anyway I'm going
to stop using take note because you know
a lot of you guys are misusing that and
sending me you know really stupid things
that you know sending me a phishing
email or a phishing link and I know what
phishing is is pointless you know you're
just getting yourself into another
another limelight so that is for posting
your questions right now as for posting
video suggestions a lot of you guys have
been posting video suggestions with is
which is absolutely unbelievable you
know this is exactly what I wanted for
the channel I wanted us to communicate
with each other directly the way we do
in the comments section
and I really really love your feedback
you know I really want your feedback so
if you have any suggestions regarding
you know suggestions in terms of what I
should improve or what I should work
what I should I should work on whether
personally or in terms of the content
you can all post that in the forum
section all right so if you just click
on the forum section you can see that
there I've created two threads in the
forum I have you have the hacking in the
acting thread and the video suggestions
now I'll add the the other thread here
that allows you to actually post
suggestions that you'd like me to make
to the channel and what you can do in
your videos in the video suggestion
thread if you just go into here you can
see that only one person has utilized
this which is is kind of sad because it
was actually quite a good suggestion and
this is a great way of centralizing all
the content so that I can see it in a
better way as I said the comments get
really really cluttered and if I don't
see a suggestion many of you think I'm
doing it personally or that I don't want
to make a video on that is that's really
not the case as I said this channel is
focused on the community and that's how
I want to keep it you know throughout
and for the length of the channel okay
so you can put post your video
suggestions here and your video
suggestions will get will essentially
get votes and from that I'll be making
videos on that you can also post your
other suggestions you know depending on
the changes or the improvements you want
to make you want me to make the channel
and we'll move on from there
right so I've looked at the forum
section and the the asking of questions
which you can do from my website you
know it works fantastically you can just
sign up and you're good to go all right
as for the website as you can see I've
worked I've put a lot of time into it
and constantly adding the latest news
I'm adding content and more detailed
tutorials that follow up with the videos
so that you can understand a little bit
more of what's going on in the video so
it acts as a great source of
documentation for the videos so this
will be a great you know a great hub
where you can come and essentially this
is going to be the channel outside of
YouTube all right so that's that's the
purpose of the website now when it comes
down to the discord server now this is
something a lot
you guys have been begging for me and
actually brought it up last week but
then I actually you know I came to the
conclusion that I if I want it to be
what I want it to be which is a
fantastic you know place where we can
all come together and discuss different
things and you guys can interact with
each other which is exactly what I want
it to be I needed to set it up you know
with certain parameters that limit a
certain few people from doing things
that are not going to be allowed on the
server so again I'm working on doing
that now but for those of you who I
selected to be the moderator I have been
in contact with you and not be getting
in contact with you soon because the
server is going to be back up this week
and yeah that's for those of you wanted
to know what's up with the discord
server why it was back down it's because
I was actually adding BOTS
I was configuring the bots and obviously
selecting the moderators and I've
selected them so I'll be getting in
contact with you if I did choose you as
a moderator so stay tuned for that
alright so that is we're going to be it
for this video I just wanted to explain
to you the different changes that have
making to the channel and that I'm
adding a little bit of structure to the
channel in the sense that you can now
contact me you know in a much better
place you can post your questions here
you can go through the forum and post
video suggestions you know video
suggestions that you really want me to
make videos on etc etc alright so that's
going to be it for this video guys thank
you so much for watching and I'll be
seeing you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
