with another video now I know I have
made a video in like three weeks or
something and that's because also dating
my rig right here just making sure
everything's going on it's of really
updated it and upgraded my computer so
yeah that's all sorted out so again the
next video that I promise which is this
video was the hundred subscriber Q&amp;amp;A so
I asked you guys your questions and I
got some questions so without further
ado let's get to this all right question
one is when and how did I get there
learn ethical hacking well that's a good
question because I learned ethical
hacking as soon as in our computer and
not not ethical hacking but just I got
interested into hacking you know
basically just trying to get into
systems just by as soon as I got my
computer I remember the first thing that
I did was when I was four years old
that's when I got my first computer the
first thing I did when they tried to
remotely turn off a another Windows PC
using a remote access and it did work
and Ecko dead easy message so we have
that is basically how I got started as
to how I learned ethical hacking before
I took the ethical hacking quad class I
was basically using the internet and
YouTube to learn how any scripting
languages and Kali Linux Linux so what I
would recommend is number one start
using Linux it's a perfect and free
operating system you have dozens of
three districts out there for you to get
involved in in using one and you can
also learn from them and just by using
Linux you're learning a lot how to use
the terminal and you're really getting
to know a lot of stuff that you really
need to know what hacking so learn
scripting a scripting language
learn about networks and how they work
and I mean Internet is everything you
need but if you want more information or
to learn maybe I can show you guys in
another video how I learned and the
kohake
so yeah that's the first question let's
move on to the next one right question 2
is what type of android games do I play
and what's my favorite Android game
so whatever games that play well right
now I hope they're a lot of games what I
basically play is a lot of intend o
emulators and the Super Nintendo
emulator is I like playing a lot of the
retro classic games like Mario and smash
smash brothers by Donkey Kong and games
like that so basically I have the
emulators installed on my phone and
that's what I have like apart from those
games I play a few other games on the
Play Store that are basically free I
really don't like games that have in-app
purchases because that just weighs the
whole experience of the game and I like
in that you can go from one point to
another just by playing the game and
upgrading it like that the other games
like link are maybe modern combat which
is Gameloft
a bit of FIFA games like that maybe also
some of the old Grand Theft Auto games
on Android so yeah that's basically
these type of games are like that man
right let's move on to thing all right
question number three is what is my name
well my name is Alexis that's my name in
case you didn't know that all right
question number four is what phone am I
currently using as my daily driver
but right now I'm using two folders my
daily driver but the main phone that I
use is the samsung galaxy s6 edge my
mother phone is decent not Samsung and
had the Samsung as my second phone my
second phone is a nexus 5x LG Nexus 5x
so yeah I really enjoy the Nexus devices
but right now my main advice is the
Samsung Galaxy s6 edge so question
number five is what's the most hyped
phone for me in 2016 so I really didn't
upgrade to the Samsung Galaxy s7 or s7
edge that's because I never I never saw
it as a as a major upgrade or something
that I really need because the only
thing that they added in terms of in
terms of the phone was basically its
ip68 water-resistant and dust resistant
and and they made the screen bigger and
even the battery bigger and they made
the process of slightly faster but right
now I'm not really enjoying the trend
Samsung is going on just you know
basically the innovation intended issue
is they make a new form like we upgrade
from the s5 to the s6 which is huge
they'll continue this now maybe I don't
know for how long but the phones are
just gonna be an upgrade in terms of
performance not anything innovative or
anything like that the phone that I'm
really looking forward to is the motors
that animal 2 xored force which is
already out town
and live in northern North America and
yeah happiness love America I'm waiting
for you to release in September
internationally so I can get my hands
burning and yeah I'll let you know how
that goes I'm gonna be able to do a
review on it if you guys want that but
yeah that's basically the fall I'm
looking most forward to is the motives
