this video I have a very very fun and
exciting video for you guys basically
we're going to be looking at the best
deep web or darknet search engines out
there so basically I've I've got about
four that I think are the best search
engines that you can get one of them
that you might want to include this
doctor go but it's not the best for the
deep for the deep web or the dark net
now the first one we're going to start
with is our Mia or am ia I don't know
you can pronounce it but basically this
is my personal favorite because of how
many results it turns up so let's say I
want to search about let's say let's say
a conspiracy theory so let me just let
me just type a conspiracy theory that's
just such a very very simple generic and
as you can see it's going to give it's
going to give the thing I like is it's
very well designed it it basically has a
very clean user interface
it displays the results in 0.05 seconds
all right it has statistics it has you
can basically use an I to P search which
what you really don't need to know what
it is right now
it basically then indexes them according
to to their relevancy and well whether
or not they are online and basically how
old they are as you know and as I've
mentioned in previous videos basically
sites on the Deep Web will usually find
sites that most of the search will not
work and are not active and if you are
the real challenge is finding sites that
are active so let's try the first one
and let's see what we can get out of
this one just to show that the results
are indeed active and the sites that
you'll find through this search engine
are the best
so basically we have the sports
conspiracy brainwash from birth by dr.
Marcus driver well some pretty
interesting stuff here nothing is soap
permeating in American culture sports we
exposed to competition based on physical
struggles for dominance
aka athletics oh well I'm really not
going to go into any of this but
basically this has been a Maya or a Mia
whatever you want to call it
and this is a very very good search
engine that I would recommend you really
I would really highly recommend this
urgent the second one on my list is
candle now candle is a very minimalistic
search engine as you can see it it's
basically a good inspiration from Google
and that's why using the different the
Google color scheme and basically has a
tagline saying no parentheses no boolean
operators no quotes just words so it's
basically telling you to just search for
whatever you want to you want to get so
let's try and search for let's try again
and search for conspiracy theory
conspiracy theory and let's see what it
returns all right so you can see it
basically giving it's basically giving
different different results as you can
see on this one we got different results
and on candle we got different results
so as you can see there are some
differences and it's going to basically
show results showing 20 out of 69 of 97
of 204 so basically it's indexed by in
pages now talking about the way it
displays it it has a back it has a black
field so that's very nice fun and easy
on the eyes
it also gives a description it gives a
nice description and as it basically has
an index as to when the disciples was up
so this is very very nice because it
actually gives the latest sights as
compared to a Maya that gives that sorts
by relevance but candle will sort by by
time by time that it was updated or
activated so let's click on this and
let's see what we get and hopefully this
link is still up or it has actually has
add some downtime all right so it
basically afforded us to intel exchange
where we have some conspiracy theory and
forum right here intellect inch by the
way is a very very popular forum on the
Deep Web I will make a separate video on
Intel exchange because it's a really
really good forum for you to basically
express how you feel really but that's
basically candle so candle a very very
good search engine and by the way this
all comes down to personal preference
really
everything is up to you and whatever you
deem comfortable for yourself the third
one is not not evil basically not evil
is a very simplistic search engine and
that basically gives you the ability to
index whatever you're searching in terms
of titles URLs or you can use both
alright so you can basically search for
four keywords so I'm going to basically
search for conspiracy theory I'm just
going to be using this just to show the
differences between the two set the
three or and other search engines that
we're going to get to in a few moments
so I'm going to make sure it's using
titles and I'm going to search and let's
see what results it turns up for us
alright so as you can see there's some
stuff that's kind of different here and
you'll find something maybe we have
something here in Russian and this
basically it doesn't in my opinion it
doesn't sort everything in a very neat
way or an intuitive way that people are
accustomed to especially when it comes
to search engines that would probably be
the the only down the only thing down
about this search engine it's called not
evil so let's actually try and open this
link right here and let's see what it
gives us it's in Russian so I'm guessing
it's going to be in Russian it's opening
an onion site it does give a last
response date that means when it was
last pinged active let's see what it
gives us here it's taking quite a while
to load probably a big page
all right so yeah as I said this is a
Russian website and it looks like a it
looks like it's a download website for I
think of film or something so really
nothing as you can see they give varied
results and again it all comes down to
what search engine will give you what
you want so that's basically it for not
evil by the way the links will be
attached to a way to a resource folder
in in in this section so you can
basically check these links and see them
for yourselves now going on to the
fourth
engine is grams now grams is basically a
search engine that will allow you to
search the dark web markets now I will
the next video is probably going to be
about the dark web or the Deep Web
markets and this will basically allow
you to index all of them so let's try
and see maybe something or what you
would expect to be sold on the dark web
markets for example and let's try a very
popular one cannabis let's search for
Graham search by the way talking about
the interface it is again it has
inspiration from Google and it has a
very nice logo here as you can see
basically giving an idea of what it's
all about really it's about basically
the markets that that deal with
narcotics and stuff like that again I
don't I don't encourage any of this or
condone any of this but again it's up to
you really whatever you want to do but
anyway let's basically give that a
search and let's see what it returns us
all right so it's written an advanced
search and then it gives you the amount
of time it took to search it has some
very cool statistics here that I'll get
to in a second so basically it's going
to highlight it's going I like this
these two search results which I'm
guessing or sponsored and we'll give you
the vendor B price in terms of Bitcoin
and the location in which you can in
which this thing this company or vendor
is located so 25 bottles of kannas een
I'm really not going to click on any of
these links because that's not the focus
of this video but you basically get the
idea
all right so grams is a is basically a
dark web market search engine and you
basically get the idea you can search
for anything on the dark web markets
pretty cool the last search engine in my
in this video is going to be torch and
we we basically took a very brief look
at torch in the previous video torches
is as simple as it gets
alright so basically it has these weird
air links over here the Tor warehouse
and basically what what I'll basically
look like advertisements here
so it's going to say hacking services
and really if you want to click on these
links it's the top to you really so
again let's search for conspiracy theory
alright let's give that a search and
it's returned a conspiracy theory right
here called the chemtrail conspiracy
theory I don't know whether you guys are
fans of conspiracy theories but this is
a very popular one most probably it's
going to be it's going to be from all
right so there we are as you can see
this is what I'm talking about the
search engine this is why I really don't
like touch because even though it has a
good fairly good user interface um you
can basically sort it by the last
modified date which we can actually try
right now and see if the results that it
gives us are good in any way and as you
can see we clicked on this link and it
told us that it does not exist so again
it's all about whether or not a search
engine can give you what you're looking
for in my opinion Armia is the best
search engine and I would recommend it
to you again the links will be in the
resources folder attached to this
section so that's basically it for this
video guys I hope you guys found value
in this video if you have any questions
just let me know in the Un a section of
the course thanks so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
