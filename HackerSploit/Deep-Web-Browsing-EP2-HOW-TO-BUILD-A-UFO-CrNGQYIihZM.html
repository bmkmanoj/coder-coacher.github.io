with another video and welcome to deep
web browsing episode 2 so a lot of you
guys have requested it and it's finally
here and without further ado let's get
started
alrighty guys so the first website here
is quite interesting and to be honest
that I've just found are just browsing
around and basically what it looks like
is it's a pizza website now this is
probably some of the weird stuff that
you'll see I wonder why you would you
would find a pizza website where you can
actually place a delivery for I mean
place an order for delivery this is
pretty weird actually
it doesn't make that much sense
basically alright so it looks like kind
of like a trick web site where let us
just see both index and if I click on
cheese only yeah it's gonna require you
to basically log in so I'm guessing this
is some type of secret forum that
requires a secret sign up on this pretty
pretty weird but it's actually a good
governor would ever suspect something
like this and you know who knows what
lurks behind basically this site as you
can see there's no register so basically
if we go and look into the frequently
asked question the FAQ you can basically
see right now that's why can't I
register it's possible the website
owners banned your IP address all right
so yeah in my opinion what I think this
website is is basically like a cover
website that's just there to hide
something I don't know what it could be
hiding but as you can see just they look
like forums and they just have fake
names like cheese only passed only looks
pretty ominous but you know who knows
what what could be lurking here
we only trade with V people we trust if
you don't have an account you'd find a
personalized it order yeah so pretty
weird it's definitely not for pizza in
my opinion I'd really doubt that this is
a website that has anything to do with
pizza yeah so that's basically it for
this side let's see what else I can dig
up all righty guys so the next site is a
pretty pretty weird site I mean it's
basically called zoophile web beause you
file web information for you files now
if you guys don't know what zoophile a
zoophile is or what basically zoophilia
is basically zoophilia is the act of
basically having sexual intercourse with
animals all right now that's pretty
disgusting and honestly it's just weird
you know the amount of stuff that you
find on the Deep Web or the dark web for
for this matter and that's pretty pretty
weird because as I said this thing the
reason it's red is because all of this
stuff actually exists in detail and um
well you might be asking yourself you
might be thinking yourself well that
means that there's someone actually
running this you know partially and this
is someone that you know may may just be
unable you know a very normal person and
this is basically what they're running
so it's pretty weird the psychic is
pretty simple again yeah I'm not going
to show you anything that's going to be
- well - disgusting obviously for the
YouTube basically just to make sure that
I don't get my video basically tagged
for anything offensive I'm just going to
breathe through what this site is I'm
not going to share any of these links as
well because I think that would be wrong
so basically disclaimer the author seems
no responsibility for any action
inspired by this guide or information
here
is supplied without liability too many
people know too less about you file so I
guide you whose failure definitions you
fill is that the essential love of
animals or love of animals including
sexuality between humans and animals so
again I correct my definition at the
beginning of this website one would have
basically mentioned um so basically both
definitions exclude all violence to
animals I don't think that makes it any
much better the fact that you actually
trying to have an intimate relationship
with an animal that's pretty disgusting
on its own I mean zoophilia is not to be
confused with cruelty to animals no
animal abuse every zoophile does never
harm an animal well you know whoopty-doo
that doesn't mean that that really
doesn't make the situation any better
I'm just going to skip skip
categorization basically practice in
general it's possible to do the same
with animals as without the human work
did you just forget about that I'm
really not going to mess around with
this because it's honestly to me it's
just something really really disgusting
and I'm just not going to go into any of
this at all so yeah that's basically it
for this site let's see what else we can
dig up alrighty guys so the next site we
have here is a pretty interesting site
actually it's one of probably I think
one of the best sites that have found in
terms of information so you know I've
been I've always said that the Deep Web
or the dark the dark web is basically
there's a plethora of website and it's
used mostly for illegal illegal
activities and that's really the
downfall because you you you tend to
find really really helpful and
informative sites like this one right
here called
security in a box now basically all
security in a box is basically security
in a box is a guy to digital security
for activists and human rights defenders
through the wall so basically if you are
new to digital security the tactics
guides cover the basic principles
including advice on how to use social
social networking platforms and mobile
phones more safely now this is what I'm
talking about
and this is the type of information that
needs that needs to basically reach a
lot more people than basically like the
site we just saw previously I mean this
is the stuff that we need to share that
I'm sure most of you guys on will like a
site like this because it basically has
to deal with technology and how to
secure yourself when online really so
basically if you look at the tactics
protect your device from Margo and
hackers keep your online communication
private renamed remained anonymous and
bypass censorship on the internet use
mobile phones as securely as possible to
this pretty interesting stuff any videos
let me try and check this on because
this is something I'm really interested
in because I feel like our mobile
devices and nowadays are they perform a
lot of stuff for us but at the same time
they're they're really really they
really make us all that more vulnerable
because you basically store everything
on your device from your bank account
details to your login information to
your contacts your messages your private
messages and your you know just a
plethora of your private stuff is on
your mobile device and I think stuff
like this should really be out there
when it comes to people trying to
protect what patron so basically you
have it's basically a very basically a
very very good good post right here
about mobile devices and security so
basically it is important to start with
understanding that mobile phones are
inherently insecure that's pretty much
obvious I think anyone who thinks that
their mobile device is secure really
needs to start questioning their their
beliefs because information sent from
mobile phone is vulnerable very obvious
there is no encryption only with
services now that you're seeing for
example what's up it's only now that
they've introduced end-to-end encryption
but that still isn't good enough
so basically information stored on
mobile phones is vulnerable again and
you're basically your files are quite
easily accessible phones are designed to
give out information about their
location I think that's pretty pretty
obvious most of I think all over the
devices all have something to do
location and most of the popular social
media apps or social networks for
example snapchat just very recently
introduced introduced via hope the only
location system where you can basically
track people the location and that's
crazy you know that's that's essentially
that's a monitoring tool like people who
are your followers can basically know
where you are and that's and the worst
part is that it was introduced very
passively and not a lot of people
actually knew that this exists and you
see very funny stories of people caught
cheating on their spouses and you get
the idea really and you know that your
location is very very secure and it's
something that and I mean anyone should
have em should have access to unless you
want them to yeah but basically a very
good site it has a lot of information
about things that I think would be quite
important for you and it has stuff like
for example a pit gain which is
basically a secure instant messaging
service I really really liked it and
also used it and it is very very secure
it comes in most of the Linux distros
but you basically have your mobile tools
which is pretty cool you have mobile
tools right here which gives you the
basically all tools that you can use
just to make sure that you're really
secure when you're on the when basically
communicating that's what use a mobile
device is for but it also has windows it
has Windows Mac Linux just incredible
the amount of information that you can
find in and also people using linear
basically Mac a lot of people hate Max
and Max are really good but I think
they're really good for a certain type
of people doing a certain type of job so
basically you have four windows you have
your basic Windows security anti-malware
your firewalls and stuff like that for
Linux you have the password managers
your Firefox add-ons just secure
browsing a plethora of information here
that you can really use to advantage so
awesome awesome site believe you can
just give this a search
then onion link obviously it's called
security in a box and yeah basically
maybe I can actually post the link on my
website just let me know if you guys
want the links to be posted and you guys
can check them out for sites that are
going to be helpful but that's basically
it for this site awesome site one of the
most helpful sites I've actually come
across in a long time so you guys should
you should basically check it out
alright guys so the next slide I've
actually found is pretty interesting and
I hope some of you or most of you guys
will be quite interested in this and
that's basically the exercise called UFO
FILES index now you guys might be asking
yourself well what do you think of this
side well basically this is a files
index basically the index of files
related to UFOs now you can see there
they're all basically zip files and you
have your file name your size your
description and your date so very well
organized the first thing basically you
have you all three secret operandi
alternative 0:03 some probably some
things you won't understand but you're
basically the Aztec recovery black
project hangar 18 and hangar 51
something related to 51 there area 51
you basically have three days of
blinding light government will blame
blah blah blah well that's how to build
a flying saucer
okay alright now those stuff is getting
interesting I mean this is the type of
information that I think everyone needs
you know maybe I want to build a flying
saucers so you know what um let me let
me actually just download this file so
let me just download it don't worry my
system is pretty secure so let me just
save this I think it's already
downloaded it is about all because I
think about a few kilobytes
I believe ya download it too
to files alright - and then it's open
this one let's open it alright so here
we are so basically it's a zip file
let's see what we have in in here let me
just extract it alright so basically
build dot UFO app and whoa alright so
basically this looks like actually a
complete guide so how to build of like
salsa after so many amateurs have failed
and si in speculative engineering by TB
Palicki alright so let's actually just
check some of these out this looks
pretty interesting you know this is
something that I'm really really curious
about so at the end of the 19th century
the most distinguished scientists and
engineers declared that no lone
combination of materials and locomotion
could be assembled into a practical
flying machine fifty years later another
generation of distinguished scientists
and engineers declared that it was
technologically infeasible for a rocket
ship to reach the moon nevertheless men
were getting off the ground and out into
space even while these words were
uttered alright so there's some pretty
pretty interesting introduction right
they're literally just blowing brewing
water out of a buck in terms of any
information that you had prior to
reading this about UFOs and space travel
so in the last the last half of the 20th
century when technology is advancing
faster than reports can reach the public
it is fashionable to hold the pronounced
pronouncements of yesterday's experts to
ridicule but there is something
anomalous about the consistency with
which imminent of authorities failed to
recognize technological advances even
while they are being made all right so
you must bear in mind that these men are
not given to making public
pronouncements in haste their
conclusions are reach of the exhaustive
calculations and proofs and they are
better informed about their subject than
anyone else alive but by and large
revolutionary advances in technology do
not contribute to the advantage of
established experts so they tend to
believe that the challenge cannot
possibly be realized
aha so some pretty interesting stuff
already we've got oh this is actually
quite a lot it has a lot of pages so we
have a book let me just check that out
we have about think about five pages
all right this so this looks like a
freaking interesting stuff right here
I'm not going to go through it if you
guys want to see me actually go through
this this manual or guide just comment
down below let's actually just read this
last part right here on the first page
the UFO phenomenon is a pretty privacy
in the annals of revolutionary
engineering on on one hand public
authorities deny the existence of flying
saucers and prove their existence to be
impossible this is just as wishing we
would expect from established experts
but on the other hand people who believe
that flying saucers exist have produced
findings that only tend to prove that
UFOs are technology
clear unfeasible infeasible by any known
combination of materials and locomotion
there is reason to suspect that people
who believe in the existence of UFOs do
not want to discover the technology
because it is not true in the believer
self-interest that a flying saucer be
within the capability of human
engineering the true believer wants to
believe that UFOs are of
extraterrestrial origin because he is he
is he or she is seeking some kind of
relief from death and taxes by an
alliance with Superman Gause I that make
sense I mean basically when when I think
if if you were to be asked whether you
believe in UFOs if you do believe in
UFOs you basically you put it down to
the fact that you know we may not be
alone in the universe and that's true I
mean we don't have evidence of that yet
but we know that
the universe is fast I mean it's huge
and there could be life out there but
for believers they don't really want to
believe or to discover they don't want
to know about the technology basically
that enabled space travel
interdimensional space travel they just
want to it's just for self of formation
that you know they just want something
interesting in their lives something
different in terms of in terms of
thinking and basically it says it
criterium not so basically this goes
through I think some basic in it gives
you some information about a flying
saucer
it gives I think some very good
information right here about the
principle principles of locomotion
regarding a flying saucer so pretty
interesting I mean if you guys want to
see me actually go through this we can
actually you know we can have an episode
where I actually go through this that's
pretty pretty interesting so that's I am
actually going to go through this but if
you guys want me to good to go through
it with you guys I can also do that
alright so pretty interesting this is
pretty cool we have some other stuff
right here stuff that really doesn't
make sense so you have a list of UFO
related books perpetual motion machines
alright that's pretty cool the truth
about Mars
ooh interesting stuff and you know the
funny thing is that their dates their
dates all before the 2008 the year 2000
excuse me
and you can basically see some of these
and more advanced dates with December
24th three days of blinding light anyway
pretty pretty cool website so basically
I hope you guys like this side let's
actually go to the next site
all righty guys the cyber the phone now
is basically called the hack lair now
new basically so quite it looks pretty
interesting it's basically a site for
learning Linux and so basically looks
very very well documented let's actually
get started and then let's see what it
actually contains um learn Linux before
we start if you know how to use Linux
this guy is not for you read about free
software I'm guessing this is a link
it's a very very well designed website I
must say this is something pretty cool
actually looks like I'm looking at an
old monitor but the focus here is
privacy security freedom and hacking if
that's what you want to learn about
we're good
what if I'm a gamer some of you may be
asking well running your games on Linux
will help you learn also valve hates
Windows and steamos hates windows and
steamos run with Debian Linux for
everything else use play on Linux right
so basically play on Linux for those of
you who don't know play on Earth is
basically a Linux distro I I think I'm
not sure but it's a Linux distro for
gaming I'm not I'm not exactly sure but
let me just check this out and confirm
it so it's going to redirect you to a
clear web website basically clean Linux
I'm guessing no actually play on Linux
is a allows you to run Windows games on
your Linux distro sorry about that
I actually got confused with another
Linux distro that has a very very
similar name play on Linux basically
allows you to run or emulate Windows
games on Linux so yeah you can actually
run that alright so learn to read
everything in the Linux world a world is
well documented that's very true I
always tell you guys to check out the
documentation I think every everything
in Linux is documented read first ask
questions later a long walk it is a long
journey you probably spend a few
weekends and some night setting things
up it can take up to a year before you
feel completely at home and master your
new operating system alright so before
using Linux you can prepare your
transition by using free software like
firefox thunderbird transmission gimp
VLC and clement n which is basically the
music player instead of proprietary
software so I agree fully with this
right here you can use firefox
thunderbird transmission gimp VLC and
commenting these are fantastic
alternatives to I think software that
you probably find for example Photoshop
a Clementine is a music player all right
so let's actually just try and complete
what this actually saying so stuck in
easy we start off with Ubuntu the
easiest way to learn is to install
Ubuntu for desktop not LTS stand for
that basically stands for long-term
support it is more stable so that's why
you want to get started so that's where
you want to get started so the terminal
this is where till next holds its power
that's very true the Linux is the home
the terminal is the home of basically
everything in Linux your first step
should be to learn how to install and
remove software with it there is nothing
like installing a favorite soft without
going to a clumsy wizard in terms of
legal use agreements I couldn't agree
more
use the terminal whenever you can I
wrote a guide for that alright so pretty
awesome we can check out his guide his
or her guide I'm not sure oh this is
awesome
these awesome guys you guys should
actually check this out man so we'll
actually get to that in a second
probably I can cover this in another
video but you guys can check it out for
yourself alright so going further a
Debian once you know how to to use a
boot properly you want to consider
learning Debian Ubuntu is based on
Debian so you won't get lost it can
require a bit of configuration to get it
working into your case but that's what
Linux is about freedom I love this
sentence right here that's what Linux is
about free
this I I think this this is probably is
going to be his this is just probably I
think one of the best sentences I've
ever read in fact best sentence of read
this year
that's what Linux is about freedom while
earning Debian is so important get use
back to rest hackers free software
developers and are kists and freedom
fighters it's super powerful lightweight
customizable reliable and totally free
like in freedom its back to the most
well-known Andrew Barr reliable software
free software which makes it super
secure also Linux distribution you need
are based on Debian I don't really know
that means and you basically once you're
good at Debian you want to take a look
at tales and Kali Linux Ted is an
amnestic system set for anonymity and
security can later kill the hacker stuff
and steamos is the game stuff so this
I've pretty much gone through tails OS
and candy minutes so I'm sure most of
you guys know pretty awesome stuff we
check out this site the reason I started
you can see there's a lot of the
information right here it's just too
much information and you guys can
basically just check it out and just
learn stuff mean how it is the terminal
pretty much it just simplifies it but
overall quite interesting site I mean
this is this is the type of information
that you want to just be checking out
when I'm actually browsing so pretty
awesome stuff that's basically for this
episode guys thank you so much for
watching if you have any suggestions or
questions or comments leave them down in
the comment section below
you can hit me up on my cake you can eat
me up on my social networks you can
leave your comments on my website I'll
leave some of the resources that we
actually found in this episode on my
website so you can check that out anyway
