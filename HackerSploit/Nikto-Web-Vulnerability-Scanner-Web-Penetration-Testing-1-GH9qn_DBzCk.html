with another video and welcome to the
web penetration testing series we were
going to be getting started with our
first video I know I've touched upon
WordPress scan and stuff like that but
this is now you know taking you through
the basics and moving your way up
alright so for those of you asking about
Hydra and the word list I will be
uploading the word list to my website
after upload this video as for hydra
hydra belongs to the cracking detracting
the cracking section which we'll be
getting to but you know that's really
focused on cracking services on ports
and credentials you know stuff like that
so it really doesn't come into play when
we're talking about web penetration
testing all right so in this video we're
going to be looking at nikto which is a
web vulnerability scanner or a web's
it's a website web service security
scanner and it is you know it's
fantastic for detecting vulnerabilities
on the server
alright now the thing I like about nikto
and I use it a lot in the professional
you know for professional projects it
really detects server miss configuration
now what do I mean you know most of the
time you know system administrators or
you know the people who actually set up
the website hosting they really don't
know what they're doing and this comes
you know in forms of leaving subdomains
wide open for people to you know just
find and furthermore exploit but you
know just finding random server miss
configuration like Miss configuring
ports
you know let's see something like the
the get and post commands or all of that
great stuff which you know might sound a
bit confusing to you if you're a
beginner now but when we'll be moving
along you know using tools like burp
suite will get all it will get into this
really really in-depth right so let's
get started now I'm going to be using
the web the WordPress the virtual
machine or the WordPress server that we
actually configured so I've reset it
again and it is using new credentials
that I am unaware of but the IP address
is still the same and
opened it up on my own mozilla firefox'
there we are that's the IP address
192.168.1.1 wait and it is indeed the
WordPress site that is being hosted on
the Debian server now what I'm gonna do
is as we move along I'm going to
actually login to the WordPress site and
I'm going to update the WordPress
version and the plugins to make it more
secure that way it becomes a little bit
more challenging alright but for now
we're going to be using we're going to
be looking at how to use nikto alright
to scan for any vulnerabilities that we
might find on the site so as you can see
I already have it unlocked to my
favorites here on my dock because I use
it quite a lot but to launch it it's
really very simple just open up your
terminal and just hit in nikto alright
and now what I'm gonna do is I'm just
gonna open up the help menu because it
is very very important here so that I
can explain what each of the commands
are art are and what they do and more
specifically the commands that we're
going to be looking at in this video
alright so let me just open that up and
as you can see we've got from the right
from the beginning we can see that it's
sorted really really well and this is
why I really like nikto now some of you
might be asking or you might have this
question in your mind well you showed us
about WordPress scan doesn't this just
do the exact same thing
well WordPress scan is only designed to
sniff out vulnerabilities on a wordpress
website the good thing about nectar is
it works on any web web server or
website for that matter and you know
once you know that it's really really
fun fantastic because it works on any
site or any web server as we've already
seen so let's look at what these
commands do now some of the most
important commands are the DB check
which checks for databases the format
which allows us to change the output
format
more specifically the hook the help the
help menu which is specified here which
is again is great because it gives you
help we then have the host very very
important allows you to select the host
which without this command you would not
be able to use nikto
pretty much all right you then have
means to list all the plugins you then
have the output which allows you to
output your results into a file very
very important if you're a penetration
tester to always have documentation of
all the scans you're performing you have
no SSL which disables using SSL the port
which you are going to be using in this
video we're going to be specifying to
use the default port which is put 80
which I'll show you how to specify you
can also change the port if you want to
which you know would make a lot of sense
unless you're performing some serious
scan that is more specialized you then
have your force SSL mode on the port
which is not that important you don't
come across that a lot and you can
update it and you can print the plug-in
and data based versions if you want to
alright so let's get started with the
comments that we're going to be using so
I'm just gonna clear this out and you're
gonna get started now so if we remember
correctly we're gonna use nikto and to
specify the host we use the head command
and after this I would use the I would
select the web the website address or
the domain for that matter or the IP
addresses I'm going to be doing now
so one ninety two point 168 whoops point
one point 108 and I've selected that i
use the command the h command which
means i'm using that's the host i know
how to specify the port which is the
only other comment on i'm going to be
using so we use the P and the we're
specifying the port which is port 80 and
let's hit enter and let's see what fun
abilities we can find here all right so
I'm going to hit enter and it's gonna
detect the server which is Apache which
we already know as we've looked at this
previously and there we are it's already
got the cross the cross site scripting
protection header is not defined that's
a very very huge vulnerability we'll be
looking at how to exploit all of these
the you know four abilities like
cross-site scripting using tools like
burp suite and you know file upload
vulnerabilities all of that good stuff
because a lot of you guys have been
asking me about bug bounty hunt
and how do I get started because you
know hacking on the web is a different
ballgame to be honest it's quite tricky
because every site is configured
differently
alright so it's returned the results and
you can look at all the vulnerabilities
that it was able to find out so the
wordpress script reveals the installed
version which is as you can see there
that looks like a CDE version cookie
WordPress so yeah there's not a lot of
important stuff that we were able to
gather from here again it would be much
more wise to scan a wordpress site with
wordpress scan but for other web sites
this is fantastic
so that is how to scan for
vulnerabilities that exist on a web
server in this case I work WordPress
site now let's look at one more command
which is the output command which is
very very important so we are going to
try and output this on the desktop so
I'm just going to change my directory to
my desktop so like so anime just clear
the terminal so we're going to use the
same command which is nikto H which is
the host one ninety two point one sixty
eight point one point one or eight we're
specifying the port which is port 80 and
now we have to specify the fact that we
are using the output comments so oh and
we specify the file name which we're
gonna say is let's see hmm
let's just call it results let's just
call it nikto results results always
good to name your your documentation
appropriately and now we want to specify
the file type which in this case we can
just say we use the command F capital F
to specify the file type the file
extension in this case I'm just gonna
select ext just to keep things basic and
I'm gonna hit enter it's gonna start the
scanning process and once the scanning
process is complete it's gonna save it's
actually saving the data right now in
real time as its performing the scan
alright so just give it a few seconds to
complete the scan and we'll be able to
see whether or not the information or
stored
in the file that we specified it to be
stored in all right we'll be looking at
all of these vulnerabilities as we move
along but the first thing is to
understand what we have got and how to
gather information about a web server or
web site and this is the basic you know
just getting started with it so very
very good to get accustomed to the tools
all right so as you can see it's
completed and if we just check the
desktop here we have the nikto results
there we are fantastic if I just open up
the file and it has stored all the
information very very important that you
store this information it acts as a good
way of of showing or it acts as
documentation and that is very important
especially for a penetration tester all
right so that is going to be it for
nikto we'll be moving along swiftly
after this and you know we'll be looking
at cross-site scripting how to use burp
suite all of the great stuff all right
so I want you guys to stay tuned for
that
so that's gonna be it for this video
