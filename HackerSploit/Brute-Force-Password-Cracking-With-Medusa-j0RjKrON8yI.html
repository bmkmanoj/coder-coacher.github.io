this video we're going to be looking at
password cracking with Medusa now you
might be asking yourself what exactly is
Medusa well Medusa really simply is a
very very similar tool to Hydra it is
lightweight and powerful now that's one
of the things I like about Medusa is
it's it's it's much more of a cleaner
you know login crack or password cracker
alright so the thing I like about it is
its multi-threaded which allows you do
you know scan multiple hosts at one time
now the great thing about this is it
works on many many services for example
FTP HTTP MySQL telnet you have your SSM
BNT you know multiple services that are
awesome if you if you know you're you're
trying to crack them now in this video
we're gonna be trying to crack the SSH
port now in the previous video and we
were using Hydra I showed you how it's
done the correct way now in order to
show you that you know tools like hydron
made user work in this video i'm going
to actually create a word list that
contains the login credentials for the
SSH port now why am i doing this the
reason I'm doing this is I'm going to
show you that indeed it can actually
crack these passwords okay so Medusa's
it is a really really simple tool to use
it may have a lot of commands that you
need to specify but in in the long run I
would prefer to use Medusa / Hydra now
Hydra is great for cracking you know
online portals and stuff like that for
example if you integrate it with burp
suite etc etcetera but for services like
FTP telnet MySQL your SSH it is a
fantastic tool as well alright so let's
get started with Medusa now by default
it is a pre-installed on Kali Linux and
you can just launch it by typing in
Medusa
alright so Medusa and once you type it
in you can see that we have the help
menu here that contains all the commands
that we are going to be using now by
default the commands that we're going to
be using is the H alright this allows us
to select our target hostname or IP
address the next command we'll be using
is we're going to specify the username
which as I said is root or MSF admin
alright so once you crack the SSH the
SSH service with Hydra you'll find that
the user name and the password are both
MSF admin ok now sorry so sorry for
telling you that but it is very very
important for me to show you how Medusa
works ok so these are probably the
commands you'll be using the most so
we're going to be using the H which
allows us to select our target hostname
or IP address or you can actually use a
file that contains target host name so
if you have just come straight from the
information gathering section of the
course and you gathered your hosts or
you added your hosts in in a in a text
document you can scan multiple hosts all
right so that that's what I really
really enjoy here you then have the
username to test against which we'll be
using you have the the file containing
usernames again awesome that we have
that option you have the passwords to
test the file containing the passwords
you have your file containing combo
entries which is also quite powerful to
use the other comment that we use we'll
be using is the c f-- DC command which
allows you again combo attacks you then
have your module which allows you to
select the module now the module
essentially means the service or the
port that you're trying to perform the
attack on so that's what that means
alright so getting now to performing the
attack on the SH port on our Metasploit
able to virtual machine again we just
need to get the local IP address which
is the same as the previous video 192
point one sixty eight point one point
one or two all right so the the cracking
process is slightly different now
because you have to specify a few things
so before we get to the actual cracking
process as I said instead of using the
word list that comes with Kali Linux I'm
going I've created my simple word list
here that contains the credentials
alright so it explicitly contains the
credentials now this may not seem like a
word list because it does contain the
exact credentials this will be more of a
dictionary attack but in reality it is
going to use the same technology behind
a behind using a word list way it's
going to test a
every combination okay so by default the
username for the SSH port is MSF admin
and the password is also a missive admin
I've just thrown the rest of these just
to make it you know more authentic okay
so that is going to be stored on my
desktop so let's get started with the
attack process all right so to launch it
we use Medusa now we select our host
which is H and that is the local IP
address of the Metasploit able to
virtual machine which is 192 point one
sixty eight point one point one or two
alright that is the IP address as simple
as that now we need to select the
username which in this case the username
we are testing for against is MSF admin
MSF admin like so that that is the
username that we are going to be using
now we need to select the password file
alright and that will be specified by
using the capital P command as we looked
at in the help menu and now we select
the directory which in this case is on
my desktop root desktop now by the way
you can use the the word list that come
already with kal UNIX or you can create
your own if that's what you're looking
for now by default I already told you I
know the credentials so it's not really
a cracking process but if you are
performing this on a real target or on a
real server or you're performing
penetration testing I would recommend
that you use the word lists that come
with Kali Linux for example The Rock
keyword lists all the the SQL map
alright so in this case we're just going
to be using the one I created just to
show you that the cracking process does
work right but it's going to go through
it as a word list alright it's not going
to use a dictionary attack
so root desktop and we're going to
select the the name of the word list
which is custom custom word list dot txt
alright and now we need to specify we
need to specify the module which can be
done by using the M so the module is SSH
and now we specify the end the end
command which allows us to select the
port which in this case is port 22 that
is the default port for all SSH
connections alright so once you're done
let me just go through the the command
or the entire sequence here so what
they're saying is we are saying Medusa
so start up Medusa initialize
Madusa we then use the h command to
specify our hosts now if you use a
capital H command you can specify a list
of hosts that you have saved in a txt
file you then have your u command which
selects your username a username your to
try against you then have your P comment
that selects the word list or the
password or the list that contains the
passwords that you want to test for
against now you can also select a
password that you want to test against
and that you would use the the the
lowercase P you then select the module
that you're going to be using which in
this case is SSH you then have a deport
that you're going to be using which is
port 22 which is the SSH port alright
and once we have we're done we can just
hit enter and it should start the
cracking process there we are just give
it a few seconds now as I said it's
going to go through it as a brute force
and it's going to use it as a word list
attack and as you can see by default it
went through all of them the
combinations that it could go through
and there we are username is MSF admin
and the password is MSF admin use Medusa
for password cracking more specifically
we were cracking the SSH service and as
you can see we got the default username
and password which is fantastic
alright so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
