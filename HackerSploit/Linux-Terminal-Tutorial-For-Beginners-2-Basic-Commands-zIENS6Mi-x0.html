with another video and we're going to be
picking off where we left off from which
is basically the UNIX terminal and how
to get really comfortable with it so in
this video we're gonna be looking at
some linux commands and hopefully
they'll make you much better Linux user
there are quite some good commands that
I found that are quite useful and what
I've found to be the best that you
should be knowing so open up your
terminal and let's get started so in the
previous video we talked about how to
customize the terminal to your liking in
terms of visuality and aesthetics but
now we're gonna get started with the
nitty-gritty so the first thing I think
that you should know is how to enter
root mode or the root or administrator
it's basically like having an
administrator privileges if you're used
to Windows so by default I'm actually in
the root user right now I have not
actually created a profile as you can
see I have not created a personal
profile with my name or anything like
that that if you did however it would if
you open the terminal you would not be
in the root directory so in order for
you to do that there are two ways you
can go about it while using it CSU which
is su or super user if you hit enter
it's going to take you into root if you
have a root password it's going to ask
you for your root password and once you
enter that it's going to take you into
root mode the other way of doing it is
sudo bash alright and if you hit that
again it's going to ask you for a
password if you had able password with
which I recommend you do and then you're
gonna take you into root no one more
command if you want to clear your
terminal up let's say you have a lot of
commands and you want to start you want
to start over just use the clear command
pretty simple right and that clears
everything for you all right now let's
get started so I'm currently in the root
directory but what if I didn't know that
like for many of you for example if
you're gonna be connecting to a Linux
server the only thing that you're gonna
have at your disposal is the terminal
and it's very essential that you know
how to
navigate the the file system the Linux
file systems and know how to check where
you are exactly so how would we do that
so right now let's say I wanted to check
what my current working directory was
and how would they do that we use the
PWD which means print working directory
pretty simple and if I hit enter it's
gonna tell me I'm in route all right
so at least I know I'm in route now now
let's say I want to change let's say
instead of route only move on to my
desktop right so what would I do
hmm let's see if I list all files in
route all right before we move further
let's say I want it to move into my
desktop how they do that so the command
for that is CD which literally
translates to change directory all right
pretty simple Linux the terminal
commands are really very simple
and as I said it gets really intuitive
user intuitive so strange directory and
let's talk this is case sensitive of
course the desktop is a very I like to
say that Linux takes the their file
structure very seriously so CD desktop
and it's going to take me to my desktop
so I'm currently now working on the
desktop what if I wanted to see the
files listed on my desktop right now I
currently have no files or folders so we
really won't get anything out of that
all right so let's say we wanted to
create a folder or a directory on the
desktop how do we go about doing that
well we would use the mkdir which
translates to make directory and we give
the directory a name so let's call it
folder 2 or 401 and as you can see it's
going to create a folder on your desktop
called 401 what if I wanted to get rid
of this folder what would I do
well for that I would use the RM dir and
I will give the folder that I want to
remove folder to all right but remember
oops excuse me it's actually for the one
rmdir
folder 1 but as I said remember let me
just clear the terminal we are creating
all of these directories and let's say
we created a directory like a week ago
and we don't remember what directories
exist on the desktop how do we display
what directories exist so let's say I
create another folder and I call it
folder 1 all right let's get follow on
and let's create another folder called
folder 3 folders 6055 for example so we
have this bunch of folders on the
desktop
how would we list whatever we have on
the desktop because remember this very
very in most situations you're not going
to get a graphical user interface to
your advantage or at your finger and
your fingertips so the command we used
is the LS command which translates to
lists all right so we ate that it's
gonna tell you it's going to display
both folders and files you have on your
desktop in addition the LS command also
has some parameters that can fine-tune
your display results so let's say we
wanted some more information about the
folders like we wanted to know the what
user created the folder at what time it
was created information like that so to
add a parameter we use the hyphen and L
right L is the parameter but to add a
parameter will be - the parameter we
will be using now is L which is gonna
show additional information about the
folders and files so let's hit enter and
as you can see it's going to tell you
that we have these are the permissions
all right so whether users able to read
write or edit modify or delete the files
or folders I'm pretty sure you guys are
familiar with permission file
permissions we then have the person who
created them in this case we know it's
route you have the time of creation and
the name all right so we also have
another LS another LS command that will
will allow us to fine-tune our results
again but this time this command is
going to allow us to view all the files
on the
stop whether or not they're hidden
literally everything that's on the
desktop and that is the LS a command
alright the LS a command will display
everything that you have on the desktop
or in the directory that you are
currently in so I'm going to hit enter
and as you can see it's going to display
everything we have nothing else really
so yeah it's not going to display it
alright so if we've actually talked
about quite a lot now now one really
important thing that we have to look at
firstly let me just get rid of some
folders on three and folder 504 55
alright we just remove that manually
directory folder 55 there we are
alright we can't clear that up so we
have talked about navigating with the
change directory but we have not talked
about moving backwards because we said
we can use the CD to navigate into a
directory and you know so so on and so
forth but what if we wanted to go
backwards right now we're on the desktop
what if you wanted to go backwards well
we use the CD but we space user space
and use two full stops all right that
will take you backwards and that takes
me back to my root as you can see and if
we list all files in root as you can see
it's going to tell you the files that
exist on on your on your root for inside
your root directory so again from here
you can browse into any other directory
that you want but let's go back into CD
desktop into desktop excuse me that was
actually quite weird CD desktop that
doesn't make any sense at all so CD
desktop alright so we've talked about
going back we've talked about changing
directory listing files printing the
working directory what else do we need
to look at we've talked about clear
alright one more thing I want to talk
about very
important as I said yeah they're gonna
be some in terminal editors text editors
that you you're gonna you have to learn
how to use them because as I said the
terminal is pretty much the only thing
you're gonna have at your disposal so
let me just create a small little
document I'm gonna save it on the
desktop all right
oh I can save it in folder one so let's
just let's just type some random stuff
let's say hello this is encrypted
encrypted file while we're in for with
my typing is about with information
about UFOs all right so I'm gonna save
this as a document on my desktop in for
the one I'm going to call this secret
all right just a stupid little name and
I'm going to save it now remember as I
said leaf pad which is what I use to
create the document is not going to work
you know if you're connecting to a
remote server or through SSH so it's
very important to use to know how to use
the inbuilt the inbuilt text editors all
right I'm not going to be covering that
in this lecture we'll look at the the
editors like Nano in the next lecture in
the next couple of lectures and we have
them which is very very useful but let's
look at how we can just display the
contents of a file just on the terminal
without any formatting or any stuff like
that so let's browse into the folder
that we saved that in which is folder
one when we save the document and if we
clear the terminal now and let's have a
look what's inside so we have secrets
all right pretty cool so the command we
use to display everything or to display
the contents of the file not really
formatted in a way that is respective to
the nature of the file we use the cat
command right the cat command and
secrets we use the tab button it'll
completed for us to cut secrets and as
you can see it displays whatever you
typed in that document as I said you
have other editors like nano alright
which you can open up and you can type
whatever you want let's say this is also
and my typing today encrypted and
encrypted document alright and to save
it out to print it to basically output
the file we use oh and we let's give it
a name let's call it encrypted
doc - and we might enter and it's I
wonder where it saved it actually that's
quite interesting oh yes it did save it
in folder - as you can see in cryptid
talk - now if you want to exit nano
don't worry about whatever I'm doing in
an O right now
this will get to using in a node in a
few other lectures so let's clear that
and if we list all the files in the
folder one right now you can see that we
have the encrypted talk - which I
created with nano and these secrets
which I created with leafpad which is a
GUI text editor so if I wanted to
display a document with Nano what would
I do I use nano which is a text editor
and I use these secrets let's say we
wanted to use secrets and as you can see
it's going to display it out pretty well
as well so it works quite well so I'm
going to exit that and let's see what
else we need to look into I know the
video is getting quite long now we just
move back to my desktop so what we need
to look into right now ah oh yeah so one
of the most important resources that
you'll have ever in Linux is the manual
Linux does come with a manual believe it
or not for those of you who are quite
skeptical of all the documentation
surrounding Linux Linux comes with a
full-on manual now you might be asking
well how to access this manual the great
thing is you can access it you can
access it
in your terminal so let's say you wanted
some you wanted to know about the copy
comb or the change directory command
alright so man and let's say you use the
copy command oops excuse me man and cp4
it let me just start that over man means
manual right so telling the terminal
opened the manual and the command I want
you to look into is CP as you can see
it's going to open up a manual and it's
going to give you all the information
about the copy command and you can go
through it and look you know this is how
I learned the next just going through
the man you are looking at the different
attributes you can use and I'm guessing
that the idea and it's quite simple you
can you can navigate the manual very
very simply we have got Nvidia graphics
drive available well I'm not going to
look into that for a while and it's very
simple you press H for help for help
excuse me and Q to quit so I'm gonna
quit the manual is one thing at your
advantage the other thing that you have
at your advantage is the help command so
let's say we can use let's use CP which
is copy I'll I'll be talking to you guys
about how to use the copy and the move
commands in the next lecture because
that becomes quite a lot of explaining
and you have to get the directories
right and blah blah blah
so CP and the next command is help which
is a universal command that will give
you help with any command that you have
as you can see it's given us everything
and I know I've used this before in
previous videos but I really didn't
explain that the help command is very
very very useful I mean it's it's
awesome so as you can see it's gonna
tell you it's gonna give you a lot of
the commands and what they do and you
get the idea it's a help command so
let's clear that up and yeah we've
actually talked about a lot of commands
in this video and there's still a lot
that we'll get into like as I said
copying you know compressing files the
works really so that's basically it for
this video guys I hope you found value
in this video if you enjoy the video or
you like
