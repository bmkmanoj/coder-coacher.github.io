with another video and welcome to Python
for ethical hacking in this video we're
going to be looking at how to use
dictionaries and dictionaries generally
so let's get started
now it's very very complicated I usually
find that people don't understand what
dictionaries are used for and let me
explain it very very simply it's really
as simple as the as a real dictionary
you have your word and it's the of your
definition but in the case of Python you
have your keys and your keys have the
values alright so let me just show you
this with an example it's really really
you understand these things better if
you work through an example so to start
off you give it a name the name could be
anything I'm just gonna call mine name
dick alright so a short form to for
dictionary so named dick pardon pardon
the pun there so named dick and that is
going to be equal to and now instead of
using these square brackets we use the
curly D curly braces alright so in here
we can start defining the keys and the
values and we do that by using the
single quotes first for the key alright
so everything has to be in single quotes
so we say now we can give an example so
let's use names alright and what we're
going to be doing in this program the
key will be the name and the value will
be a description of the person okay so
after that you you what you do is you
then use the colon and you then open up
your single quotes and then you give the
value so in this case I'm gonna say you
can see if the called hacker just a test
right there and then after that you
basically give a comma right and after
the comma what you do is you give
another key and value so we can use
another name like Ethan alright and we
can say Ethan is a spy we can just say
it's a spy and yeah that's basically a
good example now once you're done you
can basically get out of the curly
braces and
might be asking well what do we do now
how is this useful we'll see how all of
this comes into a more practical example
when we'll be working on our tools but
for now it's very very important just to
understand what's going on on a logic or
in on a logic basis so we have given the
dictionary and name and we've given our
keys and values in this case we are
going to be using names and the values
are going to be basically what those
people are doing or what they do right
all right now what if we wanted to print
out what if we just said something like
print we print out the dictionary so
name ticked all right and we save this
and run it right if we save this and run
it you can see it's just gonna display
everything as is so Alexis ethical
hacker Ethan is a spy all right but
that's really not helpful what if we
were to specify something additional so
what if we wanted to specify a specific
key in this case a name what we would do
is we oh we would open our square
brackets after the name of the
dictionary and we would say we would
give the name in this case it's gonna be
Alexis let's start off with that and if
we are to print this out to run it it's
gonna say ethical hacker so that's
pretty awesome and you can you basically
get an idea that this is used to match
in databases with names with emails so I
hope you guys understand that and it's
really really exciting know what what
what do you think we should really do
now I think we should incorporate a loop
to make this a little easier to make the
printing process of the output process a
lot better now we're going to be using
the for loop and this is a very very
good example to show you how loops
should work in a more practical way so
we're going to use the for loop alright
because it is the most efficient one and
then we're gonna say we're going to be
using the key DK for the key and the V
for the value all right and this is very
very common when you're using a
dictionary these are the standard
variable names
okay so k and V in name dict alright so
K and V for K we name the
essentially what we are doing now is you
want to use the functions we want to use
a function which I'll be making a video
on and the function we want to use is
the item dot items alright and the items
are simply going to be the the keys and
the values in this case we have two
Alexis and Ethan and the ethical is an
AK ethical hacker and a spy respectively
so what we're saying is we're saying for
K and V for key and value in this
dictionary get the items all right and
then we use our colon and we move on we
indent onwards and we say print let's
try something really very simple k + v
and that will just print out the your
key which is your name and your value
and this will print out all of them so
if we were to save and run this let's
see what do you get something really
interesting probably there we are so
it's going to say alexis is an ethical
hacker and Ethan is a spy
but there's something wrong it's really
not displaying it in a very user
friendly or accessible way so we have to
add something here now what we would do
is we would add let's add some a quote
just - let's add some concatenation just
to make it more readable so the values
are clearly readable so we've added a
space there and it's going to say alexis
is an ethical hacker we can add an is
here like so just to make it more
readable and it's going to say alexis is
ethical hacker is an ethical hacker we
should have added that so we can add
that right here an ethical hacker let's
run that again and Ethan is a spy but I
am sure you guys are getting the idea so
that's pretty pretty interesting and
that's how you use a dictionary so let's
just summarize what we've done so far
but before that I want to just show you
that we can add as many items in the
dictionary as many keys and values as we
wanted so let's add something else let's
add another name whoops let me get rid
of that let's add another name let's say
something like
Ronald all right and Ronald is he works
for McDonald for McDonald's for
McDonald's whoops like so
all right so Ronald work for works for
McDonald's and as you can see this is a
very very good example of why this isn't
working we're getting an error here and
that's because we should have used
double quotes but for this we're just
gonna have to close that in there whoops
let me just get rid of that and works
for McDonald's and close that up and if
we save this you're gonna see that it is
going to print out everything so it's
gonna say Ronald but the concatenation
does not work very well so so we'll just
get rid of that and if we run this now
now everything will probably make sense
she's gonna say Alexis at the kohaku
Ethan is a spy Ronald works for
McDonald's all right pretty pretty
awesome
and that's Dictionary is very very
simply so a dictionary starts off with
the dictionary name it has to be unique
obviously and that's going to be equal
to the items which in this case are
going to be stored in terms of keys and
values so your key is like in a
dictionary your word and the value is
the meaning or the definition so it's
really very very simple we then use the
for loop to display the keys and the
values in the name dictionary which is
Oliver which is the name of our
dictionary and we use the function dot
items to get the items in it and we then
printed out the variables in which we
stored the values of the key and the
value all right and pretty pretty
awesome it displayed everything all the
keys and values that we had and yeah
that's basically it for this video guys
