with another video and in this video
we're going to be continuing with the
Linux terminal basics so let's get
started so in the last two videos we've
covered a lot but now we have to cover a
bit more of some advanced stuff so let's
get started before we get started though
I want to tell you guys that I have
created a discord server so for any of
you who want to chat that is actually
pretty cool so you can go ahead and
check it out the link will be in the
description section so let's get started
so let's open up the terminal and some
of the commands I'm gonna be telling you
today are very very important so let's
get started now the first one that I
wanted to show you guys and probably I
think I left it out deliberately is the
touch command alright so if we create if
we use the touch command this is a
command that will allow us to create
multiple files recursively so let's see
what it does alright so touch help
alright if you open it up it will give
you all the parameters you can use but
let's actually try and use it so let me
just clear the terminal and let's say
touch well let's actually create a
desktop on the a folder on the desktop
so let me pause into my desktop like so
make directory let's call it folder
let's just call it folder CD folder and
we can clear that out and if you want to
create multiple files what we can do is
use the touch command so touch and let's
let's see test1 test2 test3
oops test 3 test 4 let's try to create
that and if we list all the files you
can see we have test1 test2 test3 and
test 4 so pretty awesome if we open it
with the GUI you can see that they're
just going to be files alright with no
specific extension so the changing the
extension will be up to you when saving
them out using any of the editors
alright let's talk about 5 ownerships
now so if we less
the files which we looked at how to do
in the previous video so let's look at
the let's look at some owner let's look
at some files ownership which is right
here so as you can see it's read write
read read all right so we don't have
full permissions so what if we wanted to
take we wanted to change ownership well
changing ownership from one user to
another how would we do that as you can
see right now we are currently a root we
have the area in the root user with the
root home group all right but I don't I
haven't created any other users so I
really can't demonstrate this but let me
show you how you would do this so if you
wanted to change the permissions if you
wanted to change the ownership of a file
what you do is use the CH phone all
right so that's the command you would
use and then you'd change the user name
to whatever you wanted for example I
created a user called Alexis and then
I'll use a colon and then I'll change it
to the home group so the home group
could be anything from whatever you set
it to be what an example could be Callie
all right and then you you select the
file that you wanted to change the
ownership of in this case let's try and
change it to one but this is not gonna
work because as you can see we don't
have user name and user group of Alexis
and Callie so let me just change it to
root right so CH phone it is already
root but I'm just showing you how to do
it so the username is root we use a
group is root and let's say we change
test2 and let's clear that out and we
never look LS l they're still gonna be
the owner of the file is going to be
root and of user group root now if you
one of the things that I've seen most of
you have been asking me is changing
permissions so a lot of you have been
asking me especially when running
scripts that there is an executable file
which has the extension dot s H but for
some reason I can't run it all right now
most of them are gonna be the scripts so
if I just check out what I have
downloads whoops
downloads then let me actually just
check what I have in my downloads folder
oh okay so I have one of these scripts
have the L script folder on my home
directory so if I go back and I look at
me of my home directory we have the L
script so let me browse into the L
script folder alright now if I list all
the files you'll see we have the install
dot SH but many of you are telling me
that this is not green alright so in the
terminal if your file is green it means
it can be open or can be executed we
know in Linux at an executable file
through the bash is dot SH extension so
some of you are telling me that it's not
working and the reason the reason why is
because the you do not have execute
permissions to run that file so the user
you are in does not have permissions to
execute that file so one way to look at
whether or not you had sufficient
permissions was to do the LS l all right
and if we looked at the Installer
SH file you can see that right now we
have the read write execute and and
basically make changes to if you look at
other files that are not highlighted in
green you can see you can read write and
you can only read you can only read the
contents of the file you cannot execute
or make changes all right so if you
wanted to make if you wanted to make a
file executable what you would do is
let's clear this out and let's go back
to the desktop and oops have to go back
home see he desktop let's go to the
desktop let's clear that out let's
control C clear that out let's make
another folder let's call this folder -
all right let's enter V bash folder
let's clear that out now I'm just gonna
use nano to create a file although we
could use another command alright then
let me introduce you guys to
I'm sure most of you guys know deco is
this just prints out something but in
addition I'm also going to show you how
to export whatever you've printed into a
file and then we'll change that file
into a bash file or an executable file
for that matter and we'll try and change
the permissions so that we can execute
it and then we'll execute it to show you
all right so echo this is how you just
print out something so hello world if we
just ran that it's gonna display out
hello world but now we want to print we
want to save this hello world into a
file so echo let's give it another thing
and let's say Linux rocks alright
and let's close that and now if you want
output yeah whatever you've displayed
into a file you use the angle bracket
alright so greater than and then we give
the file a name so let's call it bash
all right and if we do that and now if
we list whatever we have we have the
batch file now if we want to change this
into an executable file into and
basically be dot SH extension we have to
rename it how do you rename it well in
in Linux we use the MV which is move
with the move command and then we give
the file which is bash and we give the
file name that we want to rename it into
which would be bash dot SH alright so if
we do that as you can see we now have an
executable file but this is what I was
talking about if we look at the
permissions now oops well if we look at
the permissions now we can only read we
generally read and we can basically just
read the contents of the file now let me
explain what our our W on our means all
right so let's not off with our our is
readable Y if you see a ye means you can
write changes and X is an executable all
right so right now we have no X we
literally have no executable permissions
so we cannot execute this file let's try
and execute it anyway so the way to
execute a bash command or a script is
the or an executable file is by using a
and afford /i Mindy . and the Ford /
like so and then we give the file his
Bosch thought SH and if we do that he's
gonna say permission demand denied
because we do not have the permission to
execute this file so what do we do we
use the chmod command all right so the
chmod command and we are saying + X all
right now that's telling basically
changing the permission then allowing us
to execute the file and now we give the
name of the file which is bash and we
can auto complete that dot Sh and now if
we list the files as you can see path
bash dot as H is executable as it's
highlighted in green so let's try and
run it and let's see what it gives us
for some reason by lying on Linux blah
blah blah all right oh yeah I actually
made a serious blunder right here so let
me just edit the file bash dot Sh
for some reason it's it's obviously
gonna take this as a command so it's
very case sensitive that's one thing
about Linux the syntax is very important
all right so let's control ho and it's
control X and now let's try and run that
script hmm for some reason that's still
giving us the error let me just change
this to hello world I think I just
overcomplicated it so hello world all
right and control Oh control X now let's
try and run that mmm all right it's not
printing out anything but you get the
idea it's an executable file and if you
try to run an executable file that would
work now let's go back and let's see
what other commands we can try it out
what if you wanted to remove files some
of you guys commented in the previous
video that you wanted to know how to do
that and that is very important so now
if we try to see we have two folders on
the desktop here the folder and the bash
folder so to remove a file or to delete
a file by the way if you use this
command you cannot recover these files
you're basically deleting it permanently
so we use the RM
all right so the RM and then we give the
folder name which in this case in this
case is bash all right if we it that is
gonna tell you bash is a directory so
now we have to use some of the
parameters that RM comes with if you
guys are not familiar you can use the
help comment if you are still learning
or you can check out the manual alright
which is manual RM and it's going to
show you all the parameters and how to
use the RM command but I'm going to be
showing you how to do that so we're
using the RM command to remove the path
folder all right and all the files that
it contains inside because remember I
does contain files inside so we use the
R the R parameter and the and obviously
the folder name which in this case is
trash and if we check it out there we
are Bash is gone we no longer have that
let's also remove the folder right so
our R and we're getting rid of the
folder and there we are we have a clean
desktop so those are some of the most
important commands and it comes down to
creating files getting rid of files
changing ownerships
changing file permissions you know
executing executable files removing
files so those are very very important
comments that you'll probably be using a
lot on the way one of the most important
of these commands is the chmod command
or changing permissions there is one
chmod basically variable that you can
change which is the chmod which you want
to come to use a lot and that's the 777
all right now what this means is that
you're changing everything to global to
global permissions which means that this
is done for testing purposes it's not
very common and it's quite dangerous
because it changes everything to changes
every file or directory that you've
selected to be readable to be writable
you know to be edited to be executable
which is very dangerous so you you won't
come into using this but it does have it
uses it's quite an advanced command that
you will find yourself using that much
but it's quite important nonetheless now
that's basically gonna be it for this
terminal series in the next terminal
series we're going to be looking at
advanced commands and how to do a bit of
bash scripting so you can create your
own scripts and maybe look into a bit
into Python in Kali Linux and how you
can use that to create your very own
scripts
apart from that we're going to be
starting the Wireshark advanced series
we will be looking at some of the how to
utilize Wireshark has an advanced
network scanner and yeah that's
basically it so I hope you guys found
