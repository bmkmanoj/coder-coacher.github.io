with another video I know I haven't been
uploading on the channel and I have a
very very good reason for that and that
is that I'm not been feeling very well
over the phone the foster one week and
all supposed to upload a couple of
videos I have them already ready and
rendered and they're just going to be
uploading I would like to say thank you
for supporting me during this time when
I vlog and uploading the support on the
channel has been fantastic the channel
has grown quite a bit over the past few
weeks I'm now at 200 me 40 subscribers
and the comments will keep coming in and
I get a lot of questions and that's part
of why I wanted to address or to make
this video so what I will talk about in
this video is the comments that I've
been getting on my channel so I've been
getting a bit of questions that are a la
a lot of the questions coming in are
very very good and asking very genuine
questions and I'll be responding to it
while helping getting a few questions on
my kick and some in the comment section
asking me on how to hack different
social networks and how to get licenses
to programs now guys um I want you to
know and I think you know this already
but that is highly illegal and need
doing that may only help immunity that
would just make me an accessory to crime
this channel is not about blackhat
hacking it's very clearly written on the
cover photo or the cover picture or my
channel art that it is an ethical
hacking slash program slash tech channel
and I don't want it to be a black hat
channel we're all teaching you guys all
the illegal stuff I'm gonna be teaching
you a cycle hacking whatever you do with
that knowledge is up to you and I'm not
gonna be used as an accessory to any
crime I'm not gonna involve myself in
any of that
I've been giving it a good long think
and I want my channel to be perfectly
educational and have two other tech
related sources as well I don't want it
to have
illegal type of activity on my channel
and I just wanted to clear that out guys
I know mostly the channel is really
really keen on ethical hacking and I
understand that and a lot been the best
youtuber I have me haven't been
uploading consistently I know that has
been the problem of mine but I'm not
messing it and as I said I have a lot of
videos that are scheduled for upload
just take you and I hundred the single
very soon thank you for staying me
through this this time you guys are just
the best guys ever so thank you and stay
cool
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
