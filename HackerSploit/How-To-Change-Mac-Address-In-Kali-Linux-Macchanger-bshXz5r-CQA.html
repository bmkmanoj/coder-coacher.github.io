with another video and welcome back to
the ethical hacking course and in
today's video what I'm going to be
talking about is Mac changing or
changing your MAC address now you might
be asking yourself why is this important
why would I need to change my MAC
address
well basically changing your MAC address
will give you more privacy and will
protect your identity so in a way it's a
form of anonymity however a Mac changing
your MAC address will be effective only
usually it's very effective for local
area networks or Wi-Fi networks so just
your home network or your school network
for example it's really not powerful
when it comes to connecting yourself
over the internet and performing hacks
or performing scans like so
so let's basically get started I'm going
to explain as we go so like every every
video that we've gone through I'm going
to start from the terminal and we're
going to use a command called Mac
changer Mac changer and we're going to
say hell Mac change your help right so
this is going to open the manual for Mac
changer in the terminal so if we look at
the commands it's going to say we have
the help command pretty self-explanatory
we then have the version of the Mac
changer we then have to be show
commander which will basically show us
our current MAC address which is what I
want to get to right now so let's
actually let's let's run that command
Mac changer as alright and if I hit that
actually hold on what we have to do now
I forgot to tell you guys is we have to
check our our network interface devices
and you can you can find this by using
the ifconfig command like I've mentioned
in previous videos and what this will
basically do let me just resize this
this will basically show us our network
interface devices and you want to select
the current network interface device
that you're using and I'm using the
Ethernet 0 so just keep that in mind or
just copy whatever the name of the
internet or the
network interface a card that you're
using just copied I already know mine is
going to be Ethernet zero if you're
using Wi-Fi that's probably a LAN zero
so let's actually proceed to the next
step so I'm going to clear the terminal
and let's run the previous command which
is Mac's changer help so we can
basically have this as a reference point
and let's run the Mac Mac changer s oops
excuse me Mac changer Mac changer s and
then you want to use your network
interface device might need Ethernet
zero and I'm going to hit enter all
right so it's going to say your current
MAC address and your permanent pack
address no I want to point out one
important thing here many people mistake
MAC addresses for device MAC addresses
now let me explain this MAC address here
belongs to your network interface card
or your network card all right it does
not belong to the computer and I've got
comments saying of good comments saying
that this is your MAC address and people
can you know track you and stuff like
that that's my network MAC address this
is the MAC address that's displayed on
the network and that's what I was
getting to how is a MAC address actually
utilized on a network well a MAC address
will usually provide two things on a
network of a Wi-Fi network or a local
area network it will provide you the
identity of a machine via the network
interface card now let me explain that
in a MAC address the first three digits
right here as I've highlighted belong to
the manufacturer and if you do a quick
Google search of this this will turn up
a manufacturer's name so you can
actually find the build of the
manufacturer so that's one way of
identifying it the last three digits can
be changed to your will as I will get to
in a few moments
that's the the interest of this video
now how can a MAC address be used on a
network well let's say a systems
administrator wants to know the devices
on on the network you basically finds
the names of the devices with the MAC
address so it's really about
identification and it's this magnet
address does not belong to the device it
belongs to the network interface card in
the device that you're using so I just
wanted to clarify that so basically this
is my current Mac now if I want it to
change one I'm going to go down up into
the manual section here or the Help
section and we basically have the a
command which is mostly used most of the
time so it's going to set a random MAC
address so let's actually try that so
I'm going to say that's the a command
so let's actually try that so I'm going
to say Mac Mac changer I always get that
typing wrong Mac changer a and we're
going to select Ethernet 0 that's mine
it yours can be Wi-Fi as well no worries
there and I'm going to hit enter all
right and it's going to say the current
MAC address is DC and the permanent back
at this matches this one and it's going
to give you a new MAC address which is
this one right here and it actually
gives you information about the
manufacturer now we can basically just
confirm this by hitting Mac changer s
Ethernet 0 to confirm that indeed it has
changed and as you can see here the
current one is a new one and it's
different from the permanent MAC address
so it's really really really cool to see
that you can actually change your MAC
address and I'm going to explain why
this is usually very powerful on a Wi-Fi
network or a local area network all
right so let's say you're performing a
scan on your local area network right or
your Wi-Fi network if you wanted to
basically find the manufacturer of a
device because most of the time if you
perform scans is going to give you a
bunch of random Mac's and IPS and
basically to determine who who is using
that device you
basically find out the manufacturer of
the network interface card that's in the
device and from there you can actually
get more information but as I'm saying
I'm going to explain it an example so
let me explain how this is is really
really used so in University we really
had these these lectures and most of me
and my friends we would be interested in
basically networking and what we used to
do is used to jam then the connection to
the wireless projector in the lectures
so when the lecturer wanted to use the
projector or wanted to connect to the
projector he couldn't because we jammed
the connection to the project alright so
basically that would hinder the lectures
and really really just disturbed
everything and we did it because we
could and it was just a really stupid
thing we were doing for fun now the
essence of this is the lecturers thought
it was a problem and contacted the
systems administrators and they checked
it out and actually found out that it
was being jammed so they introduced Mac
filtering which is basically just
determining the more information about
the device using the MAC address all
right so basically what they would do is
if your MAC address was used to jam the
network the wireless projector they
would block your Mac MAC address so it
is it was a pretty pretty cool system
however we decided that we can actually
play or just return the favor on them so
what we actually did was um we scanned
the network and we got the MAC address
of the lecturer or the instructor of the
class and we copied the his MAC address
into our machines MAC address so we
actually had his MAC address and we
looked we were actually his machine on
the network so what we would do is we
would jam the wireless projector from
his MAC address and make the systems
administrator think that he is that his
device is
blocking the wireless projector and they
would therefore block his black address
and he had no access so as you can see
it's a really really powerful tool to
stay anonymous on a Wi-Fi network with
the you're performing scans or you know
packet inspection and start just
basically stuff like that so it's a
really really cool cool little tool you
musk in fact it's very very important I
would actually recommend learning it and
it's pretty pretty simple as you can see
here it will just probably take I'm
probably going to cover everything in
this video right now so if you want to
reset it to the permanent MAC address
what you would use is VP command and I'm
going to show you that right now so Mac
Mac ginger P and Ethernet zero and we're
gonna hit enter and if we check Mac
changer s internet zero it's going to
actually return it to the previous
permanent Mac so you actually know how
to change it to a random one and you can
change it back to the original one you
then actually have another command which
you can basically set you can basically
use the r command which will basically
set a fully just a fully random axial
change we manufacture kind and that's
the difference between the setting a
random vendor Mac of the same kind will
basically send that week the hardware
model or the manufacturer model the same
one but a different MAC address which is
not really powerful this one would be
more powerful using the r command but
you get the idea you then have the l
command which is also pretty cool this
is actually very very very important you
then have the l command which will
basically print the known vendors so
this is just basically a reference for
you to just use any random manufacturer
so let's actually try that all right
so Mac Mac changer I believe so
oops whoopsie-daisy excuse me guys all
right so it's going to print out the
first three digits as I mentioned that
determine the manufacturer and it's
going to give you the names of the
manufacturer so we have Samsung of
Compaq wave d-link Cisco and you get the
idea so you can get from here you can
basically copy and create your own MAC
address based on this and just leave the
other three digits random which is what
I'm getting to right now as you can see
there are a lot of manufacturers here
and actually have to just use the scroll
tool to just go back up here now to just
change it to whatever you want which I
would not recommend for beginners is the
EM command which you get the idea is
basically just using your own
combination and it's pretty
self-explanatory
but that's basically it guys this is one
of very important tools you must be
knowing just to make sure you're safe on
the Wi-Fi network and you can't actually
get detected doing whatever you're doing
so yeah that's pretty pretty awesome
guys I hope you this video helped you
guys or if you liked the video I want to
please leave a thumbs up down below if
you didn't like the video let me know in
