with another video and in this video I'm
basically going to be showing you the
top Linux distros for ethical hacking
and please do note that these are in my
personal opinion and are not ranked in
any order whatsoever so basically let's
get started the first one we're going to
be looking at is Kali Linux now this
will come as no surprise to most of you
because again Kali Linux is the
benchmark in term distributions
so if Kali Linux is based off you can
say the backtrack Linux for those of you
who have actually been in penetration
testing long enough to understand that
so basically it's a penetration it's one
of the most advanced penetration testing
distributions and the thing I like about
Kali Linux is that it has rolling
releases which means that it's going to
be updated frequently it has the largest
number of tools and the tools are
supported for Kali Linux so that means
if the tools updated they will get
updated with Kali Linux when you update
the destroy itself secondly it's rock
stable apart from a few issues with the
desktop environment I haven't had any
issues in terms of system stability and
stuff like that again
it has fantastic documentation and
training services that you can try out
for yourself you can also check out
their blog they have very very cool
videos and things that will help you
around basically getting around the
operating system so again one of the
reasons that I like it the most is it
has a huge arsenal of tools or scripts
for that matter that will just make your
user experience a whole lot better and
you really don't need to start
installing different stuff and really
honestly speaking the industry standard
is Kali Linux so this is basically I
think one of my favorite ethical hacking
or penetration testing distributions so
let's move on to the second one the
second one in my opinion would be parrot
OS now some of you might not have heard
of parrot OS but for those of you who
have been on my channel you know that
I've made a few videos on par to
and also a review by the way I will be
leaving a you can just check up this
video I will leave some cards taking you
to the reviews of these linux
distributions if you are interested in
checking them out so just the card
should be right above right in your
screen right now taking you to the
review
so basically Paradise has you have
different versions of bar 2's by the way
the link to the website will be in the
description section just a little
pointer so you have your security of
your home version you have your studio
and you have your air so as you can see
they'll give you a bit of information
about it but what we are focusing on is
the security so if we click on that
let's see what this is all about more
information and it's going to tell you
part security is a Linux distribution
designed with cloud pen testing and I
Internet of Things security in mind so
basically a part be details here is that
it's made for security privacy and
development pretty awesome stuff right
security includes a full arsenal of
security-oriented tools to perform
penetration tests security audits and
more so it basically provides you with
an arsenal of penetration testing tools
and scripts similar to Kali Linux but
this is where it really shines
it also contains privacy privacy tool so
you have part ways includes by default
it includes store I to be anon surf GPG
TCS Zulu krypter krypter krypter
basically encryption and cryptography
services pretty awesome this is
something that Kali Linux is not really
shine as well as parrot OS does now in
terms of it also includes a very very
cool thing which I will highly recommend
if you guys are looking for a legend X
distribution that really goes from
penetration testing to development this
is perfect for you so if you need a
comfortable environment with updated
frameworks and useful libraries already
installed prior to s will the measures
it includes a full development oriented
environment with some powerful editors
and IES pre-installed and many as
tools of installable from our repository
so it also basically has their own
repository for tools that will also get
updated so if you guys are interested in
a very very balanced well balanced that
the district for that basically moves
from penetration testing to cryptography
to development go ahead and check prior
to s in my opinion is one of the most
balanced and well polished linux
distributions around now the third one
is going to be back box linux now some
of you may have heard of it but it's
well it's not really popular operating
system it's very popular with people who
do a lot of Wi-Fi penetration testing so
again it has back boxes more than an
operating system it's a free open source
community project with aim to promote
the culture of security in IT
environment and give its contribution to
make it better and safe I'm not sure
whether that was typed incorrectly but
let's check out back bottlenecks because
that's the one that we want to look at
so back box index is a penetration
testing and security assessment oriented
Linux distribution providing networking
systems analysis toolkit it includes
some of the most commonly known and used
security and analysis tools aiming for
widespread for a widespread range of
goals from work application analysis to
networks analysis stress testing
sniffing vulnerability assessment etc
etc so basically it is it's built on one
two core so for those of you who are
already familiar with Ubuntu this will
be perfect for you it's fully
customizable and designed to be one of
the best penetration testing and
security distributions available now
again the review to this distro will
just pop up right above your screen on
the top right so make sure if you want
to check it out go ahead I made a video
on it now to be honest this is I would
like to call this a Ubuntu with the
tools that you'll be most likely be
using on other linux distros like for
example burp suite SQL map etc etc so it
has the most popular tools but doesn't
have everything so again this will
provide a bit of a balance between
Ubuntu which is a fantastic desktop and
laptop operating system on its own it's
really really well polished so it has a
1/2 and that means you'll be getting
updates in addition to that you have the
penetration testing tools so in my
opinion would I recommend this I would
recommend this for people who want just
a bit of both worlds really want maybe
more of a bun too and less of the
penetration testing side of things but
who appreciate the having the tools so
definitely go ahead and check this out
also very very viable and good option
now the fourth one and the last one in
my opinion is black our clinics know for
some reason a lot of people well it's
mainly a divided topic when it comes to
black our clinics because people will
many people will say that black our
clinics is the best compared to Kali
Linux and others will say Blackrock is
basically just it's just another
penetration testing distro I have
reviewed it again the review will be in
the top right in my opinion and
basically it is a fantastic penetration
testing distribution to be honest but it
is based on our clinics all right now
this is where the where I usually tell
people to to understand what they are
dealing with now the reason Blackrock
was created is basically if you ever
experienced a Linux distribution you
know that the be basically you switch
from Debian to fedora and Ark it's kind
of different in terms of navigating
yourself or moving around or just
basically using the operating system the
B terminal commands are slightly
different and that's where I tell people
Black Hawk Linux is good for people
already accustomed to our clinics that's
what it was created for it is created to
give people who are already familiar
with using Ark an option or an
alternative to Kali Linux because they
found it also quite weird
moving from Ark to a to Fedora or debian
based operating system so in essence as
you can see black our clinics is an
Oakland X based penetration testing
distribution for print pen testers and
security risk
the repository contains 1845 tools you
can install the tools individually or by
groups basically black our clinic is
compatible with existing arc installs
let me just stop you right there so
that's basically what I was trying to
point out you can already you can
install it on top of your arc
installation and will work perfectly now
if you wait and see the screenshot it
doesn't come with much of a desktop
environment so I in my opinion I would
not recommend this for beginners or
recommend this to people who are already
accustomed with our clinics firstly
secondly a person who is used to using
reduce to installing and customizing a
Linux distribution so if you're good
with Linux and you're you've been using
Linux for a while now and you know how
to install the disk the different
desktop environments this would would be
an option that you might want to check
out again you the review will be on the
top right of the screen I have made a
video on it and as you can see from the
screenshot it has all the tools you have
Metasploit as you can see you have your
cryptography it has a lot of stuff and
the thing I like about Blackhawk Linux
is that it's categorized really well the
tools it's a singular operating system
meaning that it's mainly going to be
focused on penetration testing it won't
work really well as a daily driver so to
speak for web browsing it would work but
it won't
it wouldn't work well so that's where I
would just throw out a bit of caution
right there if you're expecting a more
polished operating system you might want
to check out possibly
pirate OS so that's basically it guys
you can go ahead and check these the
websites in they will be linked in the
description section again the reviews
will also be linked throughout this
video so you can go and check them out
