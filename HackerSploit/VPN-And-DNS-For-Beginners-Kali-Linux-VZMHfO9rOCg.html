with another video and welcome back to
the ethical hacking course now before we
begin I want to just say that I'm back
now officially my channel is up and
running all my social media is all
running so we should be all good in
terms of communication and video uploads
so as I mentioned the sheduled will be
will still be the same we're going to
have the ethical hacking videos we're
gonna have Linux videos deep web videos
and also tutorials and videos that you
guys want to see so yeah thanks a lot
for the support you guys have been
fantastic supporting me through this
this really really hard period but
nonetheless you might as you might have
guessed from the title of the video this
video is going to be about VPNs and the
reason why I'm touching on VPNs is
because I've got a lot of comments
saying that using proxy James and the
anon surf script am i fully anonymous
and is my traffic really is it is it
different from where I am coming from
meaning have I routed it to another
countries to basically complete my
anonymity and the answer to that is not
fully this is where the DNS and VPN
settings come into play and that that's
why I'm going to actually explain this
because it's very important that you
understand how this works so basically
you're going to be using your default
DNS provided by your ISP and that means
that your traffic can be locked and can
be identifiable to the country that
you're browsing from so it is very
important that you change this and you
use a reputable source that perhaps does
not log your request and ensures an
anonymity which is why I'm going to say
make sure you select a very reputable
DNS provider or you could be just doing
something really really wrong yourself
and giving people access to what your
your traffic is or whatever you're
browsing but basically all this has to
do with is basically what DNS you're
using so to basically check what DNS
using we're going to use the
let's just check using this comment
right here so I'm actually going to cat
et Cie let's see if I remember this
I think it's resolved dot conf
I think that should be done all right so
so this is basically the network
management is saying that my name server
is 192 point one six eight point zero
point one now this will almost be quite
similar to what you will have if you
have not configured the DNS so if you
have this you your rest assured that
your traffic is being routed to your ISP
through a proxy you may be directing
your traffic to another country for
example I could be in France and I'm
using a proxy in Germany and it looks
like my traffic is coming from Germany
but when they check out the DNS settings
the DNS would still be in France I'll be
showing that it's coming from France
so it just defeats the whole purpose if
you don't actually change your DNS which
is what we're going to do right now so
we already know that I'm running my ISP
my ISPs DNS so what I'm going to do is
we're going to adjust you'll be nano
editor I'm not going to be using the
same editor because that requires its
own tutorial on how to use it the Nano
is quite simple for beginners so let's
stick with that so it is a DHCP and DHA
client calls alright alright so here is
the configuration file for the d-h plant
so basically we don't want to touch
anything here apart from what I tell you
to touch so we're just going to scroll
long you can use the scroll wheel on
your mouse or you can use the you can
use the arrows so you want to go down to
this line right here the prepend domain
name servers alright
in my previous classes I basically
mentioned that the hash the hash symbol
means that it's commented and it's not
active so we just want to get rid of the
hash symbol and prevent the domain names
of this or the domain name servers
excuse me which basically our DNS
we're going to delete this current 1v1
27 point zero point zero point one and
we're going to add our own so how do we
do this so basically for this for the
purpose of this video I'm going to be
using Open DNS you can basically just
Google Open DNS and it will be the first
one in the link or I'll put the link
down in the description and we basically
have some free DNS here like this one
these two IP addresses so I'm going to
be using these two name servers so let
me just copy them I'm going to copy the
first one and I'm just going to paste it
right there and I'm going to add a comma
after that and we're going to add the
second one it's very important that you
are the comma and let's copy that there
we are and let's paste that alright so
as far as the DNS is concerned we should
be good right here so all we have to do
now is hit control for to write the
changes hit enter and ctrl X to exit so
pretty pretty pretty cool now what we
have to do is we basically we have to
restart the network manager so so this
network manager restart alright and it's
going to be restarted and now we can
check what we did previously which is
basically what names of the currently
running resolve on barrier so basically
we're running through the first one
which will be the one that will be
routed through the 28.67 point 222 point
222 they're currently three named
service but 100% or 99% I should say all
your traffic will be going through this
top one and therefore you are now
completely clear naanum eyes there is
still a lot more to talk about which I
will get to in the second part of this
video but basically what I wanted to
explain in this video is why DNS and
even if you using proxies that's why
people ask me if I'm browsing the Deep
Web and I'm running through the Tor
proxy
the guaranteed you're not going to be
fully anonymous that's your your your
traffic may be anonymous but if someone
were to look up on it and decide to
target you they will find out eventually
that your dns points to the country
you're in unless you change it which is
exactly how I've shown you right now
which is what I'm getting a lot of you
guys maybe are reading different forums
on reddit and you know the lot really
but it's very important to understand
that you have to use a reputable DNS
providers the reason I'm saying this is
many many people set up DNS servers and
they promise they promise you different
things like they'll not tap your your
the Delord filter your his your
basically whatever you're doing really
your traffic and stuff like that
but in reality what they'll do is
basically be redirecting you to
advertisements and will basically be
logging whatever you're doing so what
I'm trying to say here in hindsight is
many of these other DNS servers the non
legitimate ones have been set up for
malicious intent and you guys know how
the current ransomware situation is if
okay it really hasn't affected Linux
that much but doesn't really matter it's
all about securing your system and
anonymizing yourself so basically which
is the most essential thing I think for
a pen tester or an ethical hacker but
that's basically it for this video guys
I hope this video helped you um if you
did please give a like down below if we
didn't help you or you didn't enjoy the
video let me know why in the comment
section below if you have any question
let me know on my social networks or hit
me up in the comment section or you can
you can contact me on my clique which is
always open and I'll most likely respond
to your question within two hours that's
what I guarantee now I have one more
announcement that I want to make it's
not really important but I have a
patreon page at the set up and before
you guys judge me I have set this up in
case or in the event that you want to
support me you you can do that if you
want to I'm not forcing anyone and I
not encouraging anyone to support me but
if you feel that you want to support me
in any way you can I'll be I'll be
really appreciative and pleased with
what you've decided to help me with as I
said I'm not doing this for any
financial gain I'm just trying to build
a community around ethical hacking and
basically training people the right way
but for those of you who feel that you
want to support me I I really I would
appreciate that and I thank you in
advance for that but if you don't want
to don't worry about that there's
nothing wrong with you if you don't want
to I understand most of you are in a
situation where you you money is not is
not your is basically it's not very
important to you at this point but
that's what I'm basically saying anyway
sorry for holding you guys are longer
than usual thanks so much for watching
this video and have a fantastic day
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
