with another video and in this video I
have finally done it I've you know
completed or published the hack exploit
app on the Google Play Store so you guys
can go and check it out
I know I haven't uploaded videos and
that's because I was actually just
fixing a lot of bugs with the app I
experienced a lot of issues a lot of
crashes but I've managed to sort it out
and as you can see it's published and
ready to go and somehow some of you guys
actually from the channel found the app
and already installed it so huge thumbs
up for that you left a very good rating
I appreciate that as you can see I
published it on the 19th which was the
day I was supposed to release it but we
I had a few issues with it crashing and
but now it's a rock stable I've just
updated it and it's working really
really great so you might be asking
yourself well what is this app going to
help me with well essentially everything
that you know any piece of content that
I'll be releasing through my website
through my channel any podcast any piece
of news related to hacking or tech news
all can be found within this application
so let me just open it up right now and
as you can see it's a very very simple
application and there you are I've
already loaded some of the articles and
that's probably why I should tell you
now this is what I was looking for an
article writer so that I can get you
know the latest news being published to
you guys on a daily basis and you know
so you guys are up to date with
everything so you can see that we have
I've updated some of the articles right
here like for example the Apple News
which was actually quite sad that they'd
lived a dilly slow down the older
iPhones um so yeah that's maybe
something you can check out as well so
it's a really very simple Apple the news
will be sorted right here and you can
also swipe from the left right there and
I'll give you the ability to bookmark a
specific article or a piece of news or
and in some information you can also
choose to share it or bookmark it just
like that right so if we swipe to the
left you have your categories right here
of course you have your news feed which
is the latest news you have the top
stories which
been viewed the most times and also
shared the most times you then have your
book mocked which is the news articles
that you have bookmarked for obviously
to read at a later time you then have
your categories right here so if I open
them up right now as you can see we have
hacking kali linux hacking scripts we
have tech and linux i'll be adding more
as we get more news and finally have
your simple settings which are just to
do with notifications and and getting up
push notifications through the latest
news all right so that's the application
i'm sure you guys may or maybe you want
to try it out so go ahead and try it out
and let me know what you guys think you
know I've really put a lot of time into
this and it's finally out and it's
working really really great and I'm
really happy that I can now give you
guys a mobile solution and don't worry
all of my latest videos will also be
posted here so for those of you who are
you know want to watch them through the
app you can really go ahead and do that
and I'll be adding a lot of more stuff
as we move along that will hopefully
make out you know our communication a
whole lot better and working on getting
a forum functionality added in alright
so that will give us the ability to
communicate with each other and answer
questions on the go and yeah so for
those of you guys asking why I haven't
uploaded any videos I'm really really
sorry but this was something that I just
had to fix and make sure was okay
because I wanted to release it this week
and I'm very very happy that I have
everything's working great so again you
can go ahead check it out the link will
be in the description and I just want to
say something else thank you so very
much for the support you know I don't
say it a lot but I really do mean it we
have surpassed the goal for this year in
terms of subscribers and also in terms
of how you guys have just supported me

asking so if you're interested just let
