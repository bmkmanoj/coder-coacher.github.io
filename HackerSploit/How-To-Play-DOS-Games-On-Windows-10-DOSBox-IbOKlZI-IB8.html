with another video and in this video I'm
gonna be showing you how to play DOS
games on your Windows computer so this
is very simple and by the way if you
guys don't know what does games are
those games are basically games that
used to run on the DOS operating system
or the ms-dos operating system as it was
most commonly known as now the reason
I'm doing this is because they were some
pretty pretty awesome games released
during the DOS era as I like to call it
and yeah so this is basically a method
on showing you how to run your favorite
DOS games on the latest operating system
even if it's not supported now I'm gonna
be using an application for this it's a
free program that you can download the
link will be in the description let's
contrast box just download it and set it
up and create the desktop shortcut on
obviously on the desktop app now once
it's done now you want to actually
download the DOS game that you want I
will leave the link in the description
that will take you to a website that
where you can download any DOS games
that you want so here I have one of my
favorite dos games which is dangerous
Dave now some of you may have heard it
some of you may have not but it's a
pretty cool game and I really enjoyed it
during my childhood so dangerous Dave
now you want to just extract it to its
own folder so so can you save now I
highly recommend that you do this on the
desktop so it doesn't ruin anything so
create a new folder and call it whatever
you want I'm gonna call it games just to
keep it nice and simple games like so
and I'm gonna move the dangerous Dave
folder into my games it's simple like
that on my games can come in this folder
so now what you want to do is open your
file explorer or your windows explorer
and as it's called and go to your C
Drive now the reason we're doing this is
to get the actual directory that we need
so open your C Drive and go to users and
go to your account that you're logged
into or the user account
mine is Alexi which is me and go to
desktop where your games folder is open
the games folder and open your game
folder
important that you do this so once you
have that you can open DOSBox it's gonna
give you this prompt obviously have you
don't worry
don't let this scare you anything it's
quite quite simple to start the game so
you can minimize the other window now
basically we're going to have to mount
this these folders to this directory so
it's very simple you wanna type mount C
space C colon backslash and you want to
open the users you want to type users we
are mounting that folder if you guys are
are aware on how to actually use the
prompt so users Lexi that's why your
account desktop dedication of the games
folder and games and then dangerous take
and you want to make sure you type them
as they are dangerous - Dave that's the
game on playback / and it's gonna say
local directory it's direct drive C's
Mountain now what you want to do is it C
: and it's gonna say C again now we have
to mount this folder again or if or
basically out of the unity to that
escaped dir will show the current
directories and if you see your game
Dave dot exe which should be here
they've got exe so that means you're in
the right place so basically what you
only have to do these these two steps
and you're good to go
and just hit territory to make sure that
you're in you collect folder then all
you have to do is hit the name of p exe
file which is dave dot exe and boom
there you go guys you can play all your
boss games that you build playing since
you know the dipti boss era and what
what a time that was so yeah I'm gonna
show you that it actually works and one
of my favorite games huh pretty pretty
awesome game play this game spend a lot
of hours on it but yeah that's basically
it you can click any DOS game from the
DOS era and yeah I hope this video
