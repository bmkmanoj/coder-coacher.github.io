with another video and in this video
we're going to be looking at net cat and
how to use it to perform a variety of
certain functions or tasks really so for
those of you don't know what net cat is
netcat is essentially almost like or a
Swiss Army knife of networking tools and
it's and allows us to perform a lot of
things like reverse shelves you know
port listening and that really comes
into play when you talk in the ethical
hacking field but irregardless
you know regardless of of the features
that it does allow you to use it's a
fantastic networking tool that can allow
you to communicate between you know two
or more computers and allows you to
perform a plethora of functions now what
I'm gonna be doing to illustrate this is
I'm gonna be running you know Windows
and Linux and I'm going to be
transferring information or
communicating between those two
operating systems so I already have
netcat downloaded on Windows as you can
see here the link will be in the
description for this download so make
sure you extract it and the netcat
executable is on your desktop alright
now once that's done again if you're
using Linux which probably you are
because this is where it really is quite
awesome
let me just unpin that so essentially on
linux netcat comes pre-installed but if
it doesn't come pre-installed you can
just install it using the app you know
you know you can just download it and
it'll be installed for you I'm running
this one up on to so essentially it's
really really very simple on how to run
it now before we actually get started
with communicating between the two we
will be using netcat to obviously
communicate between these two so we are
going to do it locally not I'm not going
to be using the IP addresses the actual
IP addresses to communicate but that is
an option and from there you can get an
idea of the power of this tool it's
quite different from secure shell
because again initiating you know
reverse shell with netcat is much easier
and again SSH is really not that awesome
it really is isn't I would say designed
to be used on Windows now of course we
were going to be trying to communicate
but before you get started with
communicating between the two to start
up netcat we can use the NC all right
now NCSD on linux is a bit of an older
version the new one is NCAT all right
now if I tend cat use again C is gonna
tell me it's not installed so it's gonna
give us a bit of an error there but
don't worry about that not you fight n
NC which is a net cat and I usually help
it's gonna give us the and let me just
do that again I think it's believe it's
help alright there we are so it's gonna
give us the information about how to use
net cat and this is very very useful
information one of the most important
commands we're going to be using is the
verbose option right here that allows us
to verbose output again I know what the
V stands for again we can be listening
we'll be using the airport quite a lot
to listen for inbound connections and
the we're going to be also using the P
for the specifying a specific port right
here so essentially you can just use the
help command right here and they'll give
you a good information about netcat and
how to use it but I'll be explaining
this as we go so the first thing we want
to do now is or I want to do is I want
to just open my command prompt because
this is how you have to initiate netcat
and I'm just gonna browse to where I
have the netcat executable stored which
is on my desktop alright so once I'm on
my desktop all I have to do is just NC
and I'm going to be using the options or
the commands now so I'm gonna say V for
verbose l to listen and
the port of course we those are these
just the options that I'm gonna be using
and I'm just gonna listen on a random
port like you know like something like
1200 I know that's that's just weird
using a random port but we can just go
ahead and use it or we can use the 1 3 3
7 ports but essentially if I do this
it's gonna listen on port 1200 now what
I can do now is I can get the IP address
for this Windows machine the local IP
address so that can be done by going to
IP config and looking up your adapter
now I already have the IP I already know
what it is so we can go back into Linux
and essentially what I can do now is
just hit NC and C and then obviously now
since we are connecting with you can
just verbose the output alright
so it basically displaying the
connection and whatever we are doing and
the IP which is 192.168.0.1 1 1 and the
port is 1200 right that's how we specify
it so if I hit enter it's going to say
connection to 1 in to 168 0 point 101 on
port 1200 is succeeded so it's using TCP
can also use UDP but let's look at
what's going on here now the first thing
you can realize is because we have not
initiated a reverse shell we can
actually just communicate directly to
these machines and let me show you so
let's say if I type something here like
I can type a message saying hello this
is a test this is a test message all
right something like that in a by 8
enter and it's not going to display
anything here because we are wavin
essentially connected to the Windows
machine but if we go back to the Windows
machine you can see it's gonna say hello
this is a test message so that's pretty
pretty awesome and you can see the
message and you can essentially just
communicate back and forth so you can
say this is we this is a message or I
can just say
hello it's me all right and if we go
back into the Linux machine you can see
it's gonna say hello it's me
now the most important thing now
obviously is to initiate a reverse shell
so let's actually go ahead and do that
so I'm just gonna clear this out I'm
gonna disconnect so I'm gonna stop and
the first we're going to be trying to
essentially get a reverse shell to the
Windows machine so what we can do now is
we can on the Windows machine is we can
just say NC
so again VLP listen to this port or on
the spot sorry and we specify our port
here and now before we get started I
just want to say we you can also use the
help command right here alright so as
simple as that and one more thing we're
going to be using is we're going to be
using the e command which L allows us to
invoke a program alright so it allow as
you can see the the what is written here
the documentation here is it saying in
inbound program to execute so this will
allow us to in both cases either you you
know execute a program on both sides so
in this case we're going to be trying to
invoke a reverse shell in this case
we're going to be trying to invoke CFD
when we reverse it or when we switch it
to Linux we're going to be trying to
invoke the shell but for now we're just
going to be invoking CMD so NC VLP
something as simple as that
and our port you can specify any open
port again that choice is yours and
we're going to be using the e option to
invoke a program in this case CMD dot
exe so you can actually see how robust
this is so once we hit enter oops I made
a mistake there sorry about that I
always seem to make really annoying
mistakes alright there we are so it's
listening on that pot now if we go back
to linux back here and now essentially
we await the Windows machine is
listening for a connection and now all
we have to do is connect and we'll be
able to use the command prompt because
we've initiated a reverse shell so what
we do
nc Vivi too verbose and the IP 168 point
zero point 111 and 112 hundred for the
port like so whoops excuse me let me
just get that and there we are as you
can see it's gonna say connection
succeeded and it's gonna invoke the CMB
and as you can see I'm have access to
the command prompt on that machine so
from me you can really really understand
the power of this and again we can just
run a plethora of stuff we can funny we
can see the directories on my desktop as
you can see we have a bunch of folders
there you can again you can create a
folder so test let's create a test
folder test and if we go back there as
you can see we it did create a test
folder so really this is awesome and
it's much much faster than using secure
shell but again as I said secure shell
is more is much more of a popular tool
when communicating between the index and
you know your Linux servers etc etc you
know for example the clients that you
have on Windows to connect to SSH or or
using SSH are like programs like putty
but that's besides the point
now again where you basically invoked a
reversal on the Windows machine so we
can run a lot of stuff but now let's try
and do it in the opposite way so I'm
gonna clear this and again on the
Windows machine it should have told us
that let me just get rid of this like so
and got rid of that folder let me clear
this out now we essentially have to
invoke a reversal on Linux so on Linux
essentially we're just reversing the
process so what we're going to do is
we're going to say NC and through NC
we're going to say e all right now we're
invoking all right so what we do is we
say NC and E we're going to say bin all
right so bin
SSH I believe or actually I am I using
the correct syntax here and see let me
try the first way which I remember quite
you know quite honestly which is VLP
because we are listening now on a port
obviously 137 if we just reverse the
process or we can use the 1200 port and
we use the e to invoke now we using the
shell so bin Sh
righty-right and invalid option e hmm
that's weird
and guess what if I use the newer
version of n cat would that help
no that would essentially mean I change
the syntax slightly and I use the bin SH
and I specify the port again so 1200 and
cat is not installed okay I have to
actually install the N map so this is
another thing order to ensure to show
you guys is essentially let me just get
that password entered with Linux
initiating a reverse shell or allowing
Windows to connect to Linux in this you
know in really a simplified form of
understanding what that means is that
will have to use the latest version of
netcat or Linux because again that gives
us a whole new set of features like you
know using SSH etc etc so what after we
just install nmap because i haven't
installed that yet on this virtual
machine and that could take a while
depending on the download size my
internet connection again is not the
best in the world but it should actually
just get this done really really quickly
now again of course the differences
between the newer and the older version
of n map or n or n cat are essentially
netcat are essentially the fact that one
of them is more optimized to be to use
reverse shells on both sides now what I
mean by this is
just clear this up and let me just show
you that it does work now so what I can
do is just say and caps e because we
invoke in the shell and SH like so VLP
and 1 1200 right there we are so as you
can see it's gonna say listening and now
what we can do is whoops I forgot I
forgot to get the IP address here so let
me just get that right now the local IP
address so I have config like so we
using my Ethernet which is the virtual
machine and if I just get it right now
there we are we're using the tu-160 2.1
28 alright let me just try and connect
back now
and now through netcat on windows we
essentially just think verbose and on
168th point-to-point 128 I believe was
the IP address and the port is 1200 and
hopefully it allows us to connect and
let's see if we got we established
connection there we are we did get a
connection and let me just see whether
we can do it there we are open - we have
got connection so let's try and run
something like Who am I and as you can
see you root so you name some simple
some simple bash commands and again we
can list all the files on the desktops
or CD desktop again we can now navigate
and we have this we have correctly
initiated a reverse shell LS nothing on
the desktop so LS oops and I say L
nothing else so yeah that's pretty much
it guys there's a lot to cover with
netcat and i'll be making other videos
regarding this but i just wanted to give
you guys an overview of how to use
netcat because again it is really really
useful and you will find yourself using
it quite a lot when trying to initiate
connections with multiple computers
with on the same network or you know
using the real IP addresses and
connecting to them remotely again many
people will complain or say that as I
say she is much better and that's true
it is but SSH is really a much more of
an exclusive tool while netcat is more
robust in terms of the functions it can
perform and the reverse shell
connections that you can perform and is
much more suited I would say for an
ethical hacker I would really really
encourage you to learn how to use netcat
because again it allows you to listen on
ports and again if if I was monitoring
traffic if I just initiated a connection
between a nas listening on a specific
port like let's say on the TCP ports I
could actually open up Wireshark and
monitor the packets that are being that
are incoming and outgoing a the DCP or
whatever the type of port we're
listening through again as I said it's a
very very advanced tool that can perform
a lot more functions that have just
Lenna
that I've showed more than I've shown
you today but we'll be getting to them
as we move along now we'll be moving
from Python or into the C++ series who
will be actually creating an advanced
key logger
which will be really really awesome so I
hope you guys excited and we'll be
moving a bit into more of an advanced
section of hacking now anyway guys
that's basically it for this video if
