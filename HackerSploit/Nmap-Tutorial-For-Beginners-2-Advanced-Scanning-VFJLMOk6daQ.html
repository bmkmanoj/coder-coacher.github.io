with another video and welcome to the
second in lab tutorial
I'm really sorry for the lake upload so
yeah let's get started so in this video
what I'm going to be showing you are a
few advanced and map commands and I'm
going to show you how to actually scan
and map and what to do with the results
and how to read the results
alright so obviously if you have
installed it on Linux you open your
terminal or on Windows open your command
prompt and you initialize in-lap so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to open the
help and lab help right because I just
want to show you guys something all
right
so as I mentioned in the previous video
the help command will basically give you
like all the options and some examples
all right so for this what so let's
actually scan something I'm so what I'm
going to do is go ahead and map that's
how you initialize the scan and what I'm
going to do is I'm gonna scan the in map
scanning domain the one they allow you
to use for educational purposes I'm just
going to scan it and the reason I'm
going to do this is I just want to show
you what results you get when you don't
use any options all right so let's scan
it and it will probably take a few
seconds regardless of your internet
connection and I'll explain why it takes
some time in a few seconds and let you
just finish the scan so basically what
it's going to do is it's going to start
scanning for open spots and you can see
it scanned for open spots now by default
nmap will scan a thousand ports all
right but it can go it can scan up to
about 6500 ports so by default it's
going to scan a thousand spots that's
why it took like 15 seconds as it says
here so it's going to stop the scan and
it's going to give you the latency which
is pretty okay and it's going to show
you the ports it's going to say it's
going to say you're not shown these are
the closed pods 996 that means 996 or a
thousand - 996 is four points that's how
many ports are actually open or filtered
now let me explain what that means so
Downey is going to give you all the
ports that are actually active right so
we have the 20
to port which is basically SSH you have
the 80 HTTP and we have anything and
echo these are really not very important
and are really not targeted that much
but in the state option here it's either
going to be open or filtered right now
none of this port is giving that state
of filtered now if you ever see filtered
what it means is that nmap cannot really
determine whether the port is open or
closed
so you really want to stay away from the
filtered state supports so basically it
scanned a thousand pots and given us all
that open and basically from here you
can select the port you want to attack
now in hacking terminology this is
really really poor or bad practice now
why am I saying that is because you
actually just wasting time scanning to
all the ports that you really don't need
so what what a hacker would do or a
penetration tester he would have the
specific services you would want to
attack for example if you wanted to
attack SSH he would target the 22 port
and I'm going to show you how to do that
right now how to target specific ports
and yeah and in addition to that I'm
going to show you how to save these scan
results now why am I saying or why is
this important really well it's because
if you're going to perform these massive
scans on big websites or IP or a large
amount of the IP range is very large
it's going to take time and it's going
to have a lot of a lot of data that is
going to retrieve from the scan right
and most usually this is a common
mistake with beginners usually perform a
scan and then they close the terminal by
mistake and all the scan results are
gone and the scan could have taken for
example a few hours and all that's going
on grain so it's always good practice to
just save every scan so you can refer to
it and you can look at the results you
got and it's just always a good practice
so let's actually start the scan but for
this I'm a I'm actually going to use my
subnet and my basic my my network subnet
my my Wi-Fi or my home network subnet so
how I'm going to do this is you need
your subnet IP which you can find by if
is config maria and once it opens is
config you want to go to the current
network interface that you are using so
if using Ethernet Ethernet zero would be
the option and we're using Wi-Fi that
would be the one so you in I'm currently
using Ethernet and what you want to do
is gonna scroll down to i net this lot
line right here now we will want to look
at net mask net mosque the basically
gives you the maximum range that that
the IP is go to so what my IP would be
is 192.168 point 1 point 0 to 255 now
let me illustrate this so we're actually
going to scan my subnet to see what
ports are open and I'm going to output
it to a to agreeable output let me just
write it let me write the command and
I'm going to explain as we go so again
to initialize use n map right and now
we're going to use a special type of
output called a graphical output which
is basically like a document but it just
sort the data out very very neatly or it
formats the data very neatly so I'm
gonna set output a small oh and a big G
alright excuse me so you want to add B -
small oh and big G that's gray pible
output now you want to enter the IP
range right so 192 168 that's mine sorry
168 point 1 point 0 to 255 so that's my
IP range right so for this example I'm
not going to target any specific port I
just want to show you first how to save
the results and what what results are
actually going to get so now you wanna
you wanna get some more information
above the scan I talked about this in
the previous video we're going to use
this verbose command which will
basically give us information about the
scan and it's just going to print out
all the data that's that's actually
being what's going on during the scan
however there is a second command that
will give us like everything that the
scan whatever is going on in the scan
and that's a double V which means double
bubble's so it's just giving you more
information after the double bubble's
you want to add a greater than sign like
we did in the previous video but we just
want one and we're going to select it
directly to save the graphical output
file so I'm going to select my desktop
which is at home my user name Alexis and
desktop and after that you want to give
it that we want to give the grabbable
output we want to give it a name we want
to give the file a name so let's I'm
going to call this results right and I'm
just going to hit enter and as you see
I'll get a results file here on the
desktop and it's going to finish the
scan now if I open the results file
we're going to get all the results so as
I mentioned it's going to start scanning
the ports it's going to scan a thousand
ports until it finds any open any open
ports so as you can give these all down
down down down all the ports go down
until we have it gets to the first dot
one where we have a basically grab for
21 which is TCP FTP and then you have
put a TV TV HTTP and we have we arrived
about three open so that's basically how
to output the results to a very neatly
arranged document which is the graphical
output as you can hear and it's actually
going to give you the time you perform
the scan so it's very good documentation
now if you want to target a specific
port what you're going to do is I'm just
going to leave that there and we're
going to going to save another graphical
output file what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna we're going to use the same
command alright you just hit the UP
button and when you're on the terminal
is gonna open the previous command you
entered and we're just going to enter
one little thing right here which is the
price and P which is the port and we're
going to say what 22 right and if we hit
enter it's gonna it's gonna say results
and I actually forgot to name the
results into another file but hopefully
it's merged
and as you can see it actually added to
these first ones we know in targeted for
222 so let's see if it actually go 22
there we are so it actually go 22 and
SSH is actually active and is going to
give you the time it's finished and how
long it took to scan so that's basically
how you output and how to basically scan
according to your specification there
are a lot of other commands which are
they going through I will be going
through a bit of the more important ones
but this is just it for this video I
want you guys to just practice with a
pause and saving it you can also try and
save it to a txt document and you'll see
the difference between the two otherwise
guys thanks for watching if this video
did help you leave a like if you enjoy
the video leave a like if you didn't
like the video dislike this video and
let me know in the comment section if
you have any comments hit me up on kik
the comment section my social networks
you can hit me up anywhere and I'll
always answer your questions otherwise
guys one more thing on the das Cruzes I
just want you guys to just share my
videos so it reaches a lot more people
than it actually does right now so we
can actually help more people because a
lot of people need this content and they
actually can get it and the reason I'm
creating this because I really want to
help people learn all of these things
and I'm doing it for free so I hope you
you guys can really help me out there
thank you for some a lot of the support
um and yeah guys thank you so much for
Qing and I'll see you in the next one
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
