with another video and welcome to the
bun 217 point 10 artful advic review and
I know I've taken a bit of time before I
made this review you guys know I'm a bit
of a when a bun do fan not because I use
it or well I use it quite a lot but it's
just been with me for a long time and I
feel that I have a connection with
Ubuntu because that's how I got started
with Lux but as I said I just wanted to
give this operating system quite a good
usage period before I give you my
verdict or my opinion again this is
still very early to tell you what I
think about this but you know my first
impressions are it's a very very
beautiful operating system very
simplistic very stable and again it's
using gnome so that's something new for
a lot of Ubuntu users they finally have
to start using the ignore desktop
environment which I said and I've said
many times is not half bad and if you've
been using Kali Linux it's pretty much
the same thing there's really not a lot
of changes made and I don't know why a
lot of people have been moaning about it
you know it's it's in the the correct
direction now water is heading in the
right direction after the complete mess
that they had with Ubuntu 17.04 I mean
that operating system was just in a
really really a weird place because you
really didn't know where it stood it has
two options in terms of desktop
environments and one is really stuck
should I learn the new one or should I
stick with the old one and now as you
can see one two seventeen point ten has
moved to be gnome which again as I said
is not bad it just takes a little bit of
getting used to
now if I just head over to the Ubuntu
website right here you can see that the
new features and changes that they have
currently stated on their website are
number one is using the ignored esque
top alright so if they are finally
retiring unity the unity desktop
environment alright so the its using a
different display server which again
this is I will really won't touch upon
it because it's not a bit
here it just has something to do with
much better driver support especially
for AMD drivers now new on-screen
keyboard again you know when to have
failed miserably when it came down to
implementing the touchscreen features
which is what they you know they were
trying to do with unity and again
canonical the company that maintains
want to really really had a problem when
they released a bun 217 points 0 for
because they were undergoing a lot of
changes and now you know it's I'm just
glad to see that they've got everything
under control in such a short period of
time but moving further onwards we have
the same user experience as you can see
here they've not changed any of the
themes the desktop layout shortcuts etc
etc the doc has remained the same it
allows you to have much more
customization the kernel is updated
which is always good you know for Linux
from a Linux point of view the upgrading
process from ubuntu 16.04 is seamless
and again they've changed the swap file
into a file that just expands
automatically similar to what you would
find on Windows with the virtual memory
file that again will automatically
increase or decrease according to the
amount of RAM you have installed on your
computer which is always good to see
that there's actually making changes to
the swap file so those are the changes
that they've made or they've stated on
their website now I've been using this
for about a good three days doing what I
would consider is medium to high on a
medium to why to high workload that
means I've been doing development a bit
of web development on it
I've mean well I tried to do web
development on it and it worked
perfectly so that's always good and you
know I was I was expecting that next I
tried to do be a bit of heavy
development like Android app development
and that also worked seamlessly
so until now everything looks to be
quite good now again you might be asking
what are the changes well the change is
the biggest
has come in the form of the gnome
desktop environment but before that
let's just take a minute to admire this
beautiful wallpaper which is supposed to
represent an aardvark for those of you
don't know tan aardvark is I recommend
you to google it it's quite an
interesting animal to be honest and this
is supposed to be the artful aardvark or
you know a little bit of mysticism there
again I'll encourage you to read up on
the aardvark and you'll get what I'm
talking about
so essentially let's just move away from
the wallpapers and let's look at the
changes that they've made to the you the
user experience so if we open up our
file manager as you can see nothing has
changed which they stated they are not
gonna change the way you would navigate
your files or navigate the system really
and you have your app launcher right
here which will again show you all the
applications and again this is just
classic gnome for those of you who are
used to gloom this will feel right at
home it's really very simple this shows
you all your applications and it's
sorted into frequent applications and
all applications all right so all
applications represent again all the
applications installed on your system
and frequent are your frequent
applications now as you can see it's
quite snappy and comes pre-installed
with all the goodies that you would
expect ability to be installed with
again Amazon has not left us yet it's
still there which is not the best of
things but you know what can you do
really it comes pre-installed with
LibreOffice which is awesome
you know it's I've said many times that
this is a very underrated office suite I
use it many many a times especially now
because I'm running this in a virtual
machine and the reason I'm saying that
is I use virtual machines a lot in my
line of work and that's because of how
convenient there and this is performing
fantastically on a virtual machine again
I'm using minimal resources what you'd
expect you know two gigabytes of RAM I'm
using two processors for my system again
you know with the much
more powerful machine you can probably
get a whole lot more performance now
coming back to RAM management again as
you can see the swap is about two
hundred three megabytes and the RAM
usage is a one point seven two free
right so that's looking pretty pretty
good now again cpu load is pretty pretty
good on idle but I do have the Mozilla
Firefox open one of the biggest changes
that they've made which a lot of people
have been moaning about again is these
settings right so if we open up the
settings menu right here you will see
something pretty pretty interesting and
it'll be quite different to be honest
again just bear with me if my system is
slightly slow again I said this is
because I'm running this on a virtual
machine as I just find it very very
convenient and it allows me to just you
know do my work in a much more
convenient way so as you can see now
it's gonna be quite different but again
they've designed it in a way that's very
user intuitive you have your search menu
right here or your search bar that
allows you to search for specific
settings all right so it's sorted into
network into display and accessibility
into accounts and into system power and
your network really so all to do with
your system and finally at the bottom
you have your details which gives you
details about the system alright no
going back as you can see we have Wi-Fi
Bluetooth I'm currently running Ethernet
of course I've bridged it through my
virtual machine but as you can see you
can change backgrounds and it does come
with a bunch of new wallpapers which are
pretty good to be honest but nothing has
caught my eye you know that much really
but overall pretty pretty good wallpaper
can't complain about that when it comes
to the dock there's been a lot of
changes here as you can see again if
you're familiar with Kali Linux this
will be pretty pretty cool you have your
hide the auto hide the dock which means
if I move that like so it hides it for
us pretty pretty cool if you have if
you're working with applications or
programs that require full screen or
would like to use the entire screen
that's awesome again you can change the
icon size I like having mine at about 44
that's about a good size right there I
restored all the settings to the default
because I wanted to give you guys a
vanilla look at this alright you can
also change the dock position you can
change it to the bottom or the right and
again the bottom is for people who are
really Windows esque
and maybe feel they need something
little closer to Windows again to the
right and to the bottom and to the left
a real pity that you can put it on the
top but I understand the reason why they
did that is because they want to have
the top bar as Rome likes it to be at
the very top nothing much in the other
settings
everything is just sorted into a much
more intuitive way I would like to say
because I got used to this really really
quickly and if I couldn't find something
that I wanted all I had to do is just
search for something right here so let's
say order to search for display oops
displays and as you can see it gives you
all the recommendations and if I click
on displays it's going to open it up and
let's say order to change my resolution
I can do it off they're talking about
changes in the display settings we have
nightlight which is something we saw
implemented by Windows 10 with the one
of the latest updates and that allows
you to essentially just make the delight
just turn off the blue light coming from
your screen making the screen a whole
lot less harmful to your eyes especially
at night because as some of you may know
or I'm assuming most of you guys who
have used use a computer more than
twelve zadeh computers emit a light
called blue light that interferes with
your sleep cycles and obviously will
prevent you from having I would say a
good night's sleep but that's besides
the point here so as I've said they have
not made a lot of changes the main
changes come in forms of these settings
and the desktop environment again when
it comes down to the Linux kernel
everything again is running on the Linux
kernel which also means the stability
relies on that in a specific way but
everything
seems to be running pretty pretty good I
haven't run into any errors I have
experienced a few performance hitches
here not because I'm running on virtual
machine just a few freezes but I'm still
to confirm if these are caused by the
virtualization or if I should install
this on a separate machine and see how
it runs on pretty mid-range hardware
again not a lot of changes if you look
at the website the changes all come to
the back and to the back end and again a
bit to the user experience which is what
they are trying to really really make
better so not a lot has changed and you
know it's still in development but the
release will be very very soon I believe
it is already released by now and it's
pretty pretty cool and in in a sense
they're just preparing for the latest
update which will be Ubuntu 18.04 and
they're working on editing the ignored s
top to fit their requirements but
looking at it right now for anyone who
is still you know on the fence about
Linux give open to a try I mean it can't
get any more user-friendly than this you
don't even have to use the terminal I
can just get rid of this right now you
don't have to that's what a Bunter was
designed to be it is designed to give
people Linux in a much more I would say
user friendly way because many people
especially have seen this many many
times and I know this is now going
off-topic but many students in
university would buy laptops for example
and the laptops would come pre-installed
with the punto and they would literally
just freak out like something you know
happen and they would be like I need
Microsoft Office or I you know I need to
write my Word documents or use Excel and
I'll just tell them to use Libre Office
there's nothing wrong with it you know
again it just comes to it down to the
fact that people are just scared of
trying new things and there's nothing
wrong with the software that comes
pre-installed it's Libre you know it's
open software that means you know it's
just so much better you know I mean just
give it a try guys yeah I know I'm
sounding like a real fanboy here for a
bun too but you know
this is just what got me started I
remember using Libre Office for school
assignments and it did it did well man I
mean and it's free it's free it's
absolutely free but you know enough of
the rant my friend my final verdict
again this is a very very early review
of the operating system is that it's a
very very stable operating system again
they've used the ignore desktop
environment which brings a whole new
level of stability and simplicity given
all of that I would say this is a
definite thumbs up and a definite go and
it you know it gets my certification as
a perfectly good distro and I'll
definitely definitely be using this now
for a lot of my projects coming up
anyway guys that's basically it for this
video a little bit of a different video
you know just mixing things up as you
guys know I love a bundle of Linux and I
just thought I'll give you guys a bit of
a you know a bit of my thoughts on the
new operating system or not the new
operating system but the update to
Auburn - and it's looking pretty good
