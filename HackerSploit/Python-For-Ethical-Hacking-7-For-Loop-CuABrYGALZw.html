with another video and welcome back to
Python for ethical hacking in this video
we're gonna be looking at loops in
Python and you might be asking yourself
like you usually do since you have a lot
of curiosity why are we looking at loops
and what are they well loops essentially
allows you to run a certain piece of
code or a statement under a certain set
of options or in this case circumstances
and it's really really very simple to
understand and it's best done with an
example with a practical example so
let's get started now to do this what
I'm gonna try and do is I'm gonna try
and print out a set of numbers using a
for loop and just bear with me I'm gonna
be using lists alright so let's start
off with a list of numbers alright so
I'm gonna be using again the variable
numbers is equal to and I hope we
remember how to create a list it's
really very very simple and then we're
gonna use numbers like let's use random
ages so 34 13 78 110 I believe is the
oldest person right now I believe I'm
not sure on that 67 and 86 alright so
yeah that's a good amount of ages and
now what if we wanted to usually the
most common problem or where the loop
comes in the most or is the best way of
explaining this is how would you display
all of these ages alright and I what I
mean what I mean is I don't expect you
to go and do this 0 and then what you do
is you put this print and know that is
really that would be pretty stupid and
would save would really just waste a lot
of time and if you do this if you're a
program when you do this this is just
considered absolute rubbish the real way
to do it is to use a for loop alright
and this is really very changed
so what we're going to be doing is we
are going to be using the for loop to
print out all the numbers with a single
line of code
all right a single line or more pardon
me because it could get along so the the
way we start is we use the for all right
so no after the four I'm pretty sure
some of you who have done programming
already understand where I'm going so
now we have to create a variable in
which we can store each of these numbers
in the list and then display them on
their own and then obviously we're going
to be looping through it so for in this
case I'm just going to create a variable
called n which means num which means
numbers but so for N in numbers all
right numbers being the variable this
variable or the list for n in the list
essentially what you're saying is use
the colon and then it'll take you to the
next line you then say print and and
that is just going to print each and
every number or value in the list from
the top to the bottom alright so if we
run this you're gonna see that it does
exactly that and there you are so let me
just move this to the let me just move
that back to the right hand side I feel
that it's much better there so as you
can see displayed everything from 34 to
86 in one single line of code in order
pretty cool right
I mean that is pretty cool and you can
see that this is really where it gets a
lot of fun it gets really really fun not
know what we can try and do is we can
try and display names or other types of
values in the list so let's create a
list of names and I know or let's create
something interesting let's use sports
all right so sports is equal to and now
the list to basically use strings or
words in a list you use the single quote
and then you give the name or the value
in this case we're going to be using
sports so let's start off with
football all right and after the course
who is the comma and then again single
quotes football tennis let's use one
more or two more
let's try golf and something like let's
just try polo right as simple as that
okay so we have a list now with
legitimate sports and we want to print
them out the same way so what we do we
say for s which is the variable that
will be storing each of them for s in
sports I want to print out print out s
right and as you'll see in a second it's
going to do just that so there we are
football tennis golf polo and we just
correct that right there like so and
that's pretty interesting now there are
a lot of things you can do in Python and
as I said we are going we are going
through Python step by step looking at
the most important things to understand
now one of the key things that you'll be
using in relation to any of the
conditional statements or relational
operations that you'll be performing are
going to be using the built in functions
that come with Python and one of the
interesting ones I remember learning
back in the day in Python was using the
length function which will allow you to
find the length of a string or a word so
let's try and find that out and how
would we do this alright so we are not
going to indent back to this first line
but instead we're gonna say print all
right because we also want to print out
the length of each of these words in
this case the sports the name of the
sports now the function that we use is
le n alright and you can see it's going
to give you the suggestion but in here
we can just specify le n and in here we
say s all right and essentially what
that is gonna do is after it's printed
the word it's gonna print out its length
all right so we can in here we can use a
bit of
how would I call it I've actually
forgotten what it's called
I really just tend to forget a lot of
things nowadays concatenation is the
name so we're going to say you're the
length is oops the length is and then
it's going to display the length awesome
let's print that out oops we got an
error here oh yeah and that is via
pardon me excuse me the problem is with
the concatenation so I'll explain what
why that's giving an error I actually
should have remembered that so there we
go so football is eight words tennis is
six coffees four and polo is four so
it's really really awesome to see that
you can implement functions with your
statements to make things a whole lot
easier to understand and it's just
really really awesome so that's
basically it for the for loop I hope you
