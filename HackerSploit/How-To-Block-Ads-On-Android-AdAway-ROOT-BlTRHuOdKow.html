with another video and we all know that
Android apps have a lot of integrated
advertisements and they just ruin the
whole experience of using an app in the
first place so in this video I'm going
to be showing you how you can disable
ads on your Android device so let's get
to this guys so first thing you want to
do is you want to make sure that your
Android device is rooted I know that
some of you guys have been saying that
you don't out root your phones I'm
making a tutorial on how to root your
phones and I'm also going to be making a
tutorial of this tutorial showing you
how to disable ads on Android without
root so yeah that's the first thing I
only get out there you have to be rooted
for this tutorial so basically once you
have root installed and you're ready to
go you want to just download the app in
the description and this app is called
f-droid which is basically a Google Play
alternative that has applications that
are not on the Google Play or that were
removed from the Google Play and more so
just download it and install it and once
you open it you just want to search for
an ad ad away and it was going to be the
first one as you can see already have it
installed just install it and open it or
run it and it's going to say checking
for updates first you have to grant it
super use access as you can see I just
did that and you just want to say
download files and apply ad blocking so
you're going to just do that the simple
as that just download the hosts and let
it apply the ad blocking
and so do you want to reboot to prevent
data loss make sure so basically and you
have to reboot your device and I'm not
on four for the full purpose of this
video I'm not going to reboot my right
now and there you go as you can see you
have ad blocking is enabled and
basically you won't have any ads in any
application so yeah guess that's how to
block Android ads on Android hope you
guys like this video if you did leave

want more videos from how to spoil it
