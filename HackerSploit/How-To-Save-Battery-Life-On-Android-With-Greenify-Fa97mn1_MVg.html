with another video and in this video I'm
going to be talking about saving battery
life on Android now we all know that's
been an issue with Android devices and
the phones are getting quicker it of
performance they're getting much clearer
in terms of the pitch of pictures that
they take cameras are getting better
screens are getting sharper but the
battery is always left behind and you
know you just can't get through today
with a with your battery life intact and
we find yourself just having a 10%
battery remaining and you have to plug
your phone in that's usually what I
always see and in this video I'm going
to be showing you how to get your
battery life back so without further ado
let's get to this so what you guys want
to do is head over to the Google Play
Store and download this app called
greenify so you can just search for it
Green Green if I like so and yeah it's
the first application that'll turn up
and it's it's free of charge on it works
with or without fruit and there you go
keep your device smooth and lasting as
the first day in a unique way
so yeah just open the app up and
basically what this app does is it
hibernates running applications apps
that are running in the background and
these applications can only be opened
when you open them and they're not going
to be running at the background you know
using all your power using your battery
life your precious battery life so it's
very simple to use this app what you
want to do is hit the options tab and go
into settings that's the first thing you
want to do now if your phone is rooted
you want to measure make sure you
selected root if your phone is not
rooted make sure you select none' rooted
it works just the same now don't don't
do not touch shallow hibernation and
aggressive dose that's for a later video
so yeah you're basically done here now
when it when it's in the home screen
what you want to do is hit the plus or
add app button and say show more apps
it's not going to show more apps and
what you want to do is it's going to
show you all this list of applications
that you have installed on your phone in
an alphabetical form as you can see and
just as you can see it besides an app to
the right of app it'll give a icon with
a cloud and this is basically telling
you that this app wakes up itself or
runs in the background now of course you
don't want to turn off or hibernate apps
that you're using like a widget app the
way I have here you basically want to
find an application that you don't
really use now one of them might be for
example Facebook which I already have
added like for example if you don't want
an app to run all you have to do is
click click on it and hit the write the
check button and it's going to add it to
the ellipse list of apps that you want
hibernate so once you have selected all
the apps that you want hibernate go back
and it's going to say and you wanna
refresh and it's going to show you all
of the applications that are currently
running in the background and that you
get hibernate so as you can see here it
has hibernated those already hibernated
and here these are these are apps that
are currently running so what you wanted
hit is the sleep or hibernate button
right here to the right and it's going
to say it's going to close them and all
the apps are going to be hibernated and
I have to say that this has really saved
me a lot of battery life it saves me up
to 20% of my device's battery life and
that's pretty amazing guys I would
highly recommend that you check this
application out and yeah let me know in
the comment section what you think if
this video did help you please leave a
like the video if you have any
suggestions or comments leave them in
the comment section below I will leave
the link to the to download this app in
the description so make sure you want to
download it and try it out it's really
really amazing so yeah guys have a
fantastic day peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
