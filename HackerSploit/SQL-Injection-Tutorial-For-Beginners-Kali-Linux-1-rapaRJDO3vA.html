with another video and welcome back to
the ethical hacking course and today I
have something really exciting for you
guys so we're actually done with with
scanning and basically anonymity the
anonymity section of the ethical hacking
course and now actually going into
performing the actual hacks or exploits
so this is the actual hacking section
and in today's video we're going to be
checking out SQL injection so I'm
actually going to show you how to set it
up and how to use SQL injection so you
might be asking yourself what is SQL
injection well basically SQL injection
as some of you may know it has the
abbreviation SQL and SQL is basically a
language that communicates with
databases I don't know with whether any
of you have actually done SQL
programming it's a very very simple
language but that's besides the point so
basically the idea behind SQL injection
is basically pulling a database in
pulling database info that exists behind
a web server so basically pulling a
database of a website behind the website
in the web server that will contain
information about the website for so for
example it can contain information like
usernames and passwords it Kinkaid can
contain the downloads the different
files that are up for downloads on the
website and basically just usernames and
passwords information about people who
log in there and the administrators and
etc etc you you you get the idea now
when talking about SQL injection it
obviously is an exploit that you a
hacker or or a pen tester would use to
to gather information from a database
and usually the most targeted
information are usernames and passwords
but nowadays the databases have usually
have had their usernames and passwords
encrypted so actually that infer that
information is usually not really
targeted by hackers nowadays really what
hackers would target would be for
example credit card information as
you've seen Sony and the PSN get hacked
and
the most valuable information is credit
card information and there was a simple
reason that the credit card information
is not encrypted all right for the
simple reason that company's encrypting
a credit card okay it depends on the
method of encryption but I'm not going
to go into that right now
but it's much easier just to keep the
credit card info the way it is because
if you convert a credit card it may
resemble another credit card number and
that may cause a mix-up but that's just
one of them so basically that's the
information that you really target now
you might be ask yourself why should I
use SQL injection well basically SQL
injection is as I said just getting the
database of a website and seeing what
you can gather from there so for most
cases you'll find that the username and
password section of the user names of
the users on that website will be
encrypted so other information you might
target from a user would be for example
if you can get access to those database
tables would be for example credit card
information date of birth stalls details
emails things that really really would
really help you in whatever you're doing
where they're performing a hack or just
of analysis um as I was saying usually
what's targeted is very critical
information like credit cards but you
cannot overlook that you might find
other information even about the website
and you might actually get for example
files that are not actually available to
download on the website but are actually
on the database so that's basically what
I wanted to explain about SQL injection
what it is how it's used how you can use
SQL injection for performing attack now
to actually demonstrate this first I
want to mention I just want to throw out
a disclaimer that it is highly illegal
to use the SQL injection exploit for the
simple reason that you are tampering
with the database if you have permission
then it's fine but you have to have
written permission from the owner of the
website or the administrator giving you
access to the database otherwise it's
highly illegal and I will not be held
responsible for any
that you do I feel really really bad
saying this but I have to throw it out
to protect myself so for the safety of
everyone watching this video especially
the younger audience I'm going to show
you how to set up a pen testing lab now
pen testing lab will allow us to
basically run all our basically to learn
ethical hacking in a safe way by
creating our own database and performing
exploits on that because we are the
owners and we can do whatever we want so
basically you can increase the
difficulty you can increase the
encryption and just test yourself out
and make yourself a better SQL injector
so to speak I don't know whether that
word exists but basically okay so let's
actually set up this pen testing lab
it's very very simple so what you want
to do is when going to your browser and
you want to search for a damn vulnerable
web application damn vulnerable web web
application so I will leave the link in
the description and what this is is
basically a damn vulnerable web
application as it says here it's
basically a PHP MySQL web application
that is damn vulnerable and as you can
see it's saying its main goals are to be
an aid for security professional to test
their skills and tools in a legal
environment so that's all you need
really so all you want to do is just hit
download it's native to Linux and it's
basically clean you can also use this on
Windows if you feel like but I don't
know why you do that but just download
it 1.8 megabyte is a zip file and once
you have it downloaded um I already have
you downloaded it's in my downloads
folder right here and haven't extracted
it yet because I wanted to show you guys
how it's done so let's open it with
archive manager hopefully you're on Kali
Linux if not it's the same process just
extract the folder into your downloads
section and it's going to extract it and
once it's done we have the dam1 world
web application master folder so we're
going to leave that for now we don't
really need to focus there so again open
your terminal this is heart of
everything that we're going to be doing
so in the terminal now we have we
actually have a a web folder the default
web folder for kali linux now
Laguna we have we actually have to go
into that folder and I'm just going to
explain something so CD a var WWWF or /
and okay now in this folder I'm just
going to check whether it has anything
if it has anything which it should if
you've just installed Kali Linux and you
haven't tampered with this folder yet it
should have a HTML folder just get rid
of it just delete it you can do that
either with the Nautilus or just open
your terminal in root and get rid of it
for a beginner I would recommend doing
it with Nautilus so Nautilus Nautilus
Nautilus is just basically a command
that will open a root File Explorer with
GUI interface so here we are just go to
your file system and you want to go into
your VAR folder and your www folder and
you have to make sure that it's empty so
if you find any other files just delete
them get rid of them so that's basically
no since it's not actually close the
edge I'm just going to open a terminal
and I'm going to enter my root and what
I'm going to do is I'm just going to go
to my downloads section where my file is
stored
vew a master file is stored and what
we're going to have to do make sure
you're in root you have root privileges
for this we're actually going to copy
the dvwa master folder into the VAR www
folder or our default web server for
Kali Linux so in order to do that we're
gonna have to say CP RV you don't really
need to know what are we mean you
already might know what V is these
forward posts but I'll explain what this
is later and you want to select your the
directly that the file a so form mine is
Alexis that's where I am right now
that's the user logged in as it made it
be different for you if you've created
your own user or it may just be route by
default downloads and we're going to
select the file name which is dvwa
master we're just going to copy to save
time and just paste it right there and
we're going to select the VAR
and www folder all right and it's going
to copy the folder there now that's
basically everything we needed to know
to do right now in this video but to
check it just use the Nautilus or you
can also use your normal file manager
without root but for beginners I went
using the Nautilus by the way when using
the Nautilus file manager if you're a
beginner please don't touch anything
apart from what I've told you this is at
a root level and that means you can edit
or change anything in the filesystem so
please don't play with anything right
here so far and www and it's actually
copied both of my downloads folder for
some reason actually oh I think I made a
mistake there but that's why I said just
check it and get rid of the Downloads
folder you can't delete with Nautilus
and you can edit basically just delete
that download folder and you have the
dvwa master so basically that's how
we're going to set up our web or
pentesting environment and that's
basically it for this video this is the
first video in SQL injection I just
wanted to explain the concept of SQL
injection and how to set up our pen
testing environment so in the next video
we're actually going to get started with
a few basic SQL injection exploits or
techniques so yeah guys I hope you guys
enjoy this video or you liked it if you
did please leave a thumbs up down below
if you didn't like the video let me know
in the comments section by the way if
you have any comments or any questions
