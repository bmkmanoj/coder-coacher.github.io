with another video and welcome back to
the ethical hacking course now a lot of
you may be asking yourselves where the
hell is this guy been why hasn't he
uploaded in like a week and what is he
doing right now
well actually I was actually recording
this video when the incident actually
happened and the incident is is that my
PC just crashed right in front of my
face as I was editing this video in
Adobe Premiere and a letter came to
found out that my hard drive has
actually failed and I actually just
bought it a few like one month to the
day that actually happened turns out
that my hard drive was a bad batch of
Western Digital drives one terabyte
drives the caveat black drives some of
you may know them they're very very good
drives and actually got it with a
warranty so I was able to get it
replaced but my data was still missing
and I actually asked the the Western
Digital customer support if they could
recover the data for me and they said
they couldn't so I actually had to take
things into my own hands and I tried
some data recovery tools and I was able
to recover a bit of the data but all my
video projects were gone and I had to
really literally start recording all
over again so that's basically why I
haven't uploaded in a week but I'm back
again and let's let's basically get into
today's video which is basically SQL
injection and we're going to be
continuing from the previous video the
previous video uploaded which was the
SQL injection that was the first
tutorial now here's the second tutorial
now in the previous video we were
basically setting up a pen testing
environment now that's one way I I could
have gone explaining SQL injection but I
actually have a better better way of
explaining a screen injection and it's
actually the way I learned SQL injection
and the way I really really grasped it
and that's by actually showing you a
real-life example we will be actually
using one of the SQL injection tools
provided in Kali Linux or any pentesting
distro of your choice and that is
basically SQL map right which you can
find under the database assessment tools
it's right here it's called SQL map and
the reason I'm using SQL map is because
in this area I'm not going to show you
how to inject any script to basically
steal any data from any website because
I want to just keep this literally very
very legal because I don't want any of
you to go into prison it's really not a
nice place I think you guys already know
that so we're going to stay we're going
to keep these tutorials pretty legal now
you might be asking yourself how old
earth are you gonna show us a real-life
example without a pen testing
environment well if you guys are
familiar with the vulnerability in
websites you probably have heard of the
PHP ID vulnerability in websites which
can basically be be utilized with search
engines like google dr go basically any
search engine that can index websites
now the PHP exploit is basically as
follows open the browser open up google
or any search engine and just hit PHP
question mark ib equals 1 now this is
basically on the index websites that are
vulnerable and whose databases are open
and can be indexed by search engines
right so I'm gonna enter and already
it's given us a few websites right here
now for the purpose of this video I went
through them before this video just to
to get ones that that will work and
where I can explain them to you so don't
do not be alarmed please do not be
alarmed by that I have done this before
this video so I can actually make this
video really informative and I don't get
into any hitches so I'm just it's going
to list a website's right here that are
really really not interesting like
dipinto electric guitars I don't know
whether anyone would buy a detail from
dipinto we then have ancient Rome pretty
interesting but wikipedia has more and
I'm not going to touch any any religious
topics in any of my videos because I
don't want that
to creep up onto me and make me look
like I I'm a biased human being I really
I really am NOT but anyway let's just
stay away from all of that garbage for
now so I'm going to try and use this
website right here this contemporary
Romanian writers I don't think anyone in
a thousand years has ever clicked on
that but we are going to click on it and
we are actually going to try and access
their database so I'm going to open it
in a new tab
right here and basically as you can see
it's vulnerable because it's using the
PHP IDs equals to one index file so
we're just going to copy this just copy
it and let's actually get crack let's
get cracking excuse me
so as with every cool command we start
in D terminal right so I've actually
made the text bigger so you guys can
actually read it more clearly how nice
of me and so to get started we're going
to use the SQL map dash 8 command which
will basically open the help menu as you
guys already know with most of the tools
on Kali Linux very very well documented
almost all of them are very very well
documented but as you can see with this
one we have a lot of lot of options here
none of them are really really important
given the real nature of an SQL
injection attack nowadays but I'm going
to explain SQL map with an example as I
stated up here so we actually just going
to get started right off the bat so SQL
map will basically start SQL map and
then we only is the - you command the -
you command basically allows you to
enter a URL or means URL I can show you
that right now so I can just find the -
you right here so URL the target URL the
URL that you are going to attack which
we already copied to our clipboard so
make sure you copy the site any site
that's vulnerable and you can choose it
from Google as we just did and I'm going
to paste that right there and the next
command is a double - DBS all right so
the DBS will basic
just scan for databases so basically
once I start this command it's going to
it's going to run on this website and
it's going to basically return any
information it has about the databases
and from there we can perform the SQL
injection the actual SQL injection now
you might be asking yourself isn't this
illegal well if you're just getting
information about the database that's
legal but actually manipulating the
database the information stored in the
database
that is illegal so for this video I'm
not going to change anything
on this website on their database I'm
just going to show you the databases
that they have which is legal because it
is actually being indexed by the search
engines and it's open to anyone if you
know how to search for it and as I've
shown you using the PHP exploit we can
easily find them on even a search engine
as cheesy as Google is so SQL map view
URLs the target URL we enter the URL
make sure it has the PHP question mark
ID equals one syntax and then be - - DBS
hit enter let's see what we did so it's
going to test connection and it looks
like the backend DBMS is MySQL so it's
actually found a database using MySQL
the MySQL language do you want to skip
palos to specific you know what yeah
let's just it yes for the remaining test
do you want to include all this for
MySQL extending provided level one and
risk yes all right so numbers going 80
yes and let let it just basically run so
it looks like it's found a database
MySQL database and let's see what
information it can actually return so I
probably take up two out there for a
minute or two depending on the site and
yeah let's actually see what it returns
all right so it's actually given us an
option right here saying the get permit
IDs vulnerable do you want to keep
testing others that's it yes let's say
as much information as you can get so
there we are
all right so very very informative stuff
right here it's basically got
information about it's gotten the tables
it got some table information from a
database I don't know if you guys are
familiar with MySQL but the basic format
is in tables and you get the idea so
it's basically given us a web server
operating system Linux Ubuntu standard
stuff web application technology Apache
PHP standard stuff actually that's
that's that's very good it's it's quite
updated actually considering the fact
that this website is vulnerable the
system's running behind it is they are
pretty updated up-to-date that's what I
mean and they've given us two databases
right here let me just expand this
window because nothing looks clear
anymore so we have information schema
and Romanian SVC now we've got
information but let's say we want some
more information right so we're going to
use the same comment but instead of DB s
we're going to use DB DBMS right or
let's say we've got an arrow over there
oh yes all right all right so basically
this doesn't have any DBMS exploit but
basically that's you get the idea of
using SQL map you basically just get
information about the databases and from
there you can perform the SQL injection
as you can see it has to to basically
two tables with information this is
probably just general information and
then you have your Romanian as we see
which looks like the actual content on
the website so that's basically it for
this video guys
SQL injection is really not it's not
really an important thing to master
because of its it's really really
lacking in popularity
popularity excuse me for my miss my
pronunciation right there but what I'm
trying to explain is as you can see very
very old and pointless websites will use
and release the older vulnerable systems
like PHP the PHP exploit I mean that the
PHP exploit can actually exploit and SQL
injection on any other website is much
harder than as they not have seen and it
actually requires its own its own series
of tutorials or actually its own course
that's how advanced it is I'm just going
to be touching on a few other other
methods of SQL injection but it's really
not an important topic and hopefully we
can get started on other stuff like
Hydra and social media and the social
media toolkit with basically targeting
social media or social networks so
that's it for this video guys I really
want to say thank you for the support
