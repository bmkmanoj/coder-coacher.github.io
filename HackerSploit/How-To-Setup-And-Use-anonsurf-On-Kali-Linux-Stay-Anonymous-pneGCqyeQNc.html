with another video and welcome back to
the ethical hacking course and I just
want to give you guys a little quick tip
here so quite a few of you guys have
actually told me in the comment section
in my previous video
regarding using proxy chains that it
gets really really complicated and that
you have to install the door service and
whatnot so I'm actually going to show
you an alternative to that and how to
anonymize your entire system using
proxies more specifically dito proxies
so for this you're basically just going
to need three terminal as I mentioned
below and you're going to have to
install a a program actually a
repository called annoncer for anonymous
serve so have the repos right here I
will put them in the description section
so the first thing you have to do is you
have to add the repository which is the
Anan announcers dot get from github
that's at that I already have it so it's
really pointless from my point of view
so the next step once it installed by as
I've said it's already installed on mine
so I just have to browse to the a non
self directory which you should do after
you've installed it so once it's
installed enter the following command CD
Kali - announcer and it's going to take
you into the directory and we want to
just list and I really don't need that
right now LS and we want to run the
installer data set or installer dog
shells file so after you've run that
just run this and it's going to install
it I'm just going to reinstall it on
mine and just let it complete and it
should actually just take a few seconds
and you're good
so let's actually just wait for this to
complete
all righty so once it's actually
finished installing which I had to do on
mind we're going to clear the terminal
and what you have to do is just I'm just
going to go back into my home directory
I'm going to clear that again you really
don't need to do that so basically how
to I'm just gonna anon anon surf
basically we have installed the
repositories and we are basically ready
to use it so unknown and non-self and
you and I'm just going to help command
just to basically show you guys how is
simple it is so basically to start it
you have the start/stop restart change
and the status were they turning so we
have the start sources start system-wide
anonymous tunneling underneath or proxy
so basically it's very similar to proxy
change as I demonstrated in the proxy
change video which will be linked in the
description and at the end of this video
so basically what this means is going to
anonymize your entire system with Ito
proxies and by restarting it you just
basically get a new identity as you guys
are pretty much I think you understand
that with tour every time you you can
basically change your identities and
what that means it will change the IP
and therefore change your identities as
for dns leaks I'm not quite sure whether
this really does work I haven't really
really tested that but it should work
using the tow proxies so have the
start/stop restart change you can change
the identity restarting tor as i
mentioned and this you can check the
status and you will show you your
country p so let's actually run this
pretty awesome stuff so I want a Moodle
reserved and non surf Swoopes and on
stuff and we're going to say start and
it's going to start all right once it
started what we're going to do is we're
going to say and normal status all right
and it's actually running so let's close
this terminal because that started a
process and we're going to just check
these stuff right now and on and also
help and let's check what our current IP
address is so my type II and it's taking
a few seconds to load it so there is
given us an IP we can't really actually
tell what IP or what country this
belongs to but we can check that right
now so in the same process I'm going to
also check for their DNS leaks so let's
let me just check for for DNS leaks am
gonna use DuckDuckGo let's see how fast
it will actually load it as I mentioned
sometimes we proxy dito proxies wil will
be kind of slow as you guys are already
used to and using the Deep Web bacteria
check for DNS leaks let's open that up
and there we are so it's saying from
Oslo Norway
that's the IP address we then have a
little let's check for some actual DNS
leaks and let's see that actually worked
to differentiate the IP from the DNS to
change that so this is basically going
to provide us almost 100% anonymity as
long as you stick to it as long as you
just keep on restarting the service so
let's see how long this takes it should
shouldn't take all that long
all right so I'm just going to check for
another one
right here because that one is taking a
whole lot of time oops I should have
actually known that Google would have
refused that
so let's actually just check from here
that's actually taking too long so let's
start let's see how far this site
actually takes to calculate the results
so the IP belongs to Norway Oslo Norway
in particular and basically that's how
you can actually do it for the other
services you have I to P which is really
not important right now
it's quite a nice outdated method but
basically we can actually just change
the identity so analysis change which
will basically whoops change and it's
going to change and it's forced to a
change to the nodes so we can actually
just check for DNS leaks one more time
through the duck taco search engine
because I don't want to go through a
bunch of CAPTCHAs and stuff like that so
again Paris France and let's actually
just test this as many times as we can
uh non-self change so it said France and
let's refresh this page let's see what
we get
again the proxies might slow it down
quite a bit but anyway let's just see
what we get
taking quite a bit of time on this one
let's just restart the process
announcers change
let's get an another one let's see what
we get another identity let's restart
the site again or actually let's just
restart it from the from the search
engine because it's probably using the
current cookies that it loaded so it's
actually giving us the same one that's
pretty weird
so what I think you should do is add-ons
restart let's restart it and it is going
to restart and let us actually try that
again now there we are so basically
restarting is more important or more
effective than changing the identity as
I had mentioned earlier in the video so
this is pretty much it guys that this is
basically an alternative to proxy chains
just making it a whole lot simpler
instead of going inside the proxy chains
or configuration file and starting the
door service so this basically in fact I
wouldn't I wouldn't mind using this when
I'm needed when I'm performing scans or
stuff like that
because it just makes it a whole lot
simple and easy and it's actually
working as you can see so that's it for
this video guys hope this video helped
you guys if you have any questions let
me know in the comment section hit me up
on kik hit me up on my social media I'm
always there to answer questions I
please make sure you hear this video in
case a few people who need this
information can actually get it again
guys thank you so much for the support
on the channel thank you for watching my
videos and have a fantastic day peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
