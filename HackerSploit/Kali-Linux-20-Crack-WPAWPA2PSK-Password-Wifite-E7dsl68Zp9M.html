with another video and in this video I'm
going to be showing you how you can hack
any we PA - or we PAP SK our Wi-Fi
password on Kali Linux using the white
fight command or tool so all you want to
do is open your terminal and hit y fight
simple as that and it's going to open
and it's going to start a monitoring on
your Wi-Fi adapter as you can see it's
scanning yeah just just give it a bit of
time to scan for networks and as you can
see here it scanned about three networks
but you can you can let it scan for as
long as you want and you'll get more so
capture enough packets and data on the
targets and when you're ready all you
have to do is it ctrl C alright it's
going to check for WS compatibility and
as you can see channel CH stands for the
channel the number is the number of that
of the Wi-Fi networks in order the ESS
ID is the name of the network the
encryption or en CR is the encryption
type power is the strength of the
connection that does it support WPS
that's WPS question mark as you can see
there is one that doesn't and you have
client clients or whether the fact that
it's a client or a server or a it's
giving out data so as you can see select
target numbers so all you have to select
is the the the internet connection that
you want to attack and when I hit for
for an example hit enter and it's going
to start a WPS pixie tag and it's going
to wait for a beacon and you can you can
let this run and once it gets a beacon
all you have to hit is ctrl C once
you've hit a ctrl C it's going to start
a WPS pin attack on the Wi-Fi network
you're trying to attack and as you can
see it's it's has given a zero of zero
success on the default time to live for
the time to live basically but you can
let this run as long as you want it is
coffees they're going to take a bit of
time especially with the pixi attack
again you can it ctrl C to go to the
next stage which is the brute force or
WP end
handshake was going to try a wait for a
handshake with the network and it's
going
at that as I said it's going to take a
bit of time but this is the basic girl
as you can see ascending 50th broadcast
cent there we are listening fine Jake so
gonna wait
once you're done with that your head
control-c and it's going to tell you
that's how you complete the attack and
as you can see do act 2 attacks
completed through out of two WPA attack
succeeded I have tried this and it does
work but the only thing you need when
trying to crack in network is patience
so yeah that's been how to crack any
Wi-Fi network on Kali Linux using why
fight they are the methods which I'll be
showcasing so we have stay tuned for
that if this video did help you please
give a like if you want more videos for
me subscribe and peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
