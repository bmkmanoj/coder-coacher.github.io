with another video and welcome to nmap
for beginners so this is going to be a
continuation in the ethical hacking
course now what is nmap well basically
an nmap is a footprinting tool or a
reconnaissance tool now I had already
explained this in the first class the
first ethical hacking class and this is
basically the first step of hacking
where you actually find information
about the target or the IP or the
website
so basically nmap is a footprinting tool
that gets more information about the the
target or the IP or the website for that
matter in my opinion lighting nmap is a
must-have for any pen testers or ethical
hackers or hackers for that matter
so basically nmap is available on almost
all the platforms all you have to do is
just go to the website and you can open
nmap here
it's nmap dot org that's their website
it's a free free software so you can go
and download it as you can see here
they're available for Linux Windows and
I believe Mac OS so if you actually on
map if you're actually on Mac I believe
it's there so you can actually install
it on Linux and windows because of the
most popular operating systems however
if you're using Kali Linux or pirate OS
like I am it already comes pre-installed
so the two ways you can go about
launching it on Windows I think you just
have to run the nmap command in the
command prompt same as with Linux but if
you're actually running a a penetration
and testing distro like parrot OS or
Linux om Kali Linux it's just in the
information gathering section which is
basically recording reconnaissance so we
have nmap right here and all you have to
do is open nmap and it's going to ask
you for your root password because it's
going to need elevated privileges so
that's one way of starting in Mac now
the second way of starting in map is
just by opening a terminal enter in your
root password or launching it in
administrator mode on Windows and you
just want to enter your password and
then I'm just going to clear the console
like so and I'm just going to enter nmap
and I'm going to enter the health health
option which you basically give me all
the options available with nmap now it's
going to look a bit overwhelming because
it's going to give you a lot of lot of
options you can just look at this as a
manual basically they're giving you the
different options that you can use for
your different methods of scanning so
just don't worry about anything just
scroll down all the way to the bottom
and look at where it says examples I'm
going to use these examples to guide you
to guide you in your in this tutorial so
firstly I want to just say something and
that is a very very very noisy scanner
now for the reason what I mean by this
is nmap is easily detectable by
firewalls and by servers so they
actually know that you're scanning them
so the real charm of using nmap is not
just scanning a server or a site or an
IP address for that matter it's how to
do it anonymously or very quietly so
that you're not detected I'm going to
get to that very very soon so just make
sure that you don't do anything illegal
I mean this is only for educational
purposes so yeah so let's get to the
next part alright you know as all saying
in the example section it's just going
to give you an example of what a basic
nmap run would look like you have your
nmap command which initializes and map
and any of your parameters that will
bring results depending on what you want
out of those results so you have your V
and a now before we get to that and map
basically gives you a free testing
scanning machine where they allow you to
scan their this scan me dot n map dot
org this web address error for
educational purposes so as you can see
here hello welcome to scan me dot n map
of org don't worry the website will be
in the description section if you're too
lazy to type that out
so as you can see we set up this machine
to help folks learn about an math panel
to be test and make sure that the nmap
installation or internet connection is
working properly you authorize to scan
this machine with nmap or the port
scanners
try not to hammer on the server too hard
a few scans in the day is fine but do
not scan under times a day or you decide
to test your SSH brute force password
cracking tool so basically they'll be
allowing you they're giving you
permission to scan this which is what I
was going to say you need written
permission to scan any IP address any
any website or any server for whatever
you do it's on you that's what I wanted
to just put out so we're going to use
this as an example during a be the nmap
tutorials so coming back here as you can
see they've given you an example
scan with the scan MoDOT nmap dot org
address so what does he mean well V
basically prints the version number or
the name of the of these of these
servers basically the address name all
right now the a basically prints the os
detection the version detection and
script scanning so basically the
operating system the version the
operating system itself and the
scheduled scan for scripts all right now
if we go down to the second one we have
a bit of a different command here just
ignore the FN for now I will get to that
in a future tutorial now as you can see
that is something a bit confusing we
have a very weird-looking IP
configuration well this is not really
unusual in fact what this mean is this
is a range of IP addresses now don't be
confused by this what this means is
basically you can pass a range of IP IP
addresses like from this IP address to
this IP address you want and map to scan
that they could be belonging to an
organization so you can basically do a
very powerful nmap scan on like multiple
IP addresses now before we move on I
just want to show you an example of what
I mean so what you want to do is open a
browser and I just want you to search
for this all right
I want you to search for major IP block
right let's go on only search for major
IP block with the ridge of search engine
and it's going to open the major IP
address blocks just click on that bye
near soft now this means is basically
these are the IP ranges in every country
all around the world so these are all
the IP address is registered to people
or to company so you can choose from
whatever country that you want to scan
from really anything it's up to you
right so we can just try trance let's
just drag France for example and give
you all the IPS and their ranges so as
you can see from this IP to this IP
belongs to orange s a and it has the
assigned date and the total amount of IP
addresses now this comes to be very
important authority to explain about
recognitions here if you have an IP
address you can really do a lot with it
and you can actually find a lot of
information related to that IP address
which is what I'm going to show you
right now so I'm just going to pick a
random IP address let's try let's try
this one here all right I'm just going
to copy it and I'm still on going it
copied there we are copying and I'm just
going to search for this is a very
important command this will basically
give us the info box work with this IP
belongs to who is all right so we're
going to say who is and we're going to
paste that there and we're going to
enter and it's going to open and make
search engine who the IP address belongs
to so we just can open the first site
that we get here so just open it and it
shouldn't take too long and it's going
to give you the it's going to give you
all the information about it so it's
going to tell you the country also the
time when Europe Paris so you know it's
in Paris it also has the longitude and
latitude coordinates so you can actually
get the location however with the with
the IP range addresses what they do we
basically be providers the internet
providers is they basically assign it to
a location and no more they don't have
like a specific address so usually the
location is about 90% accurate I will
get to your like location in the future
that's a bit of an advanced tutorial but
basically you can get information about
an IP using the who is the command which
brings me to the second part of what I
wanted to say about the who is an IP
addresses the search engines are your
best best best friend when it comes to
looking or incomes you reckon a sense of
foot printing you can really really use
them to advantage and as you can see it
given me the range here on this website
and it will give you the location and
the longitude and latitude and your
location and so on and so forth so you
get the idea don't worry the websites
that I've used here will be linked in
the description all right so let's just
head over back to nmap alright one more
command I wanted to show you that's
really not linked to end map but it's
also important for scanning or
reconnaissance is the nslookup
all right so nslookup is available on
Windows you don't need to install it
it's just part of the operating system
as it is on Linux you hit LS look up and
then you enter the de tar --get it can
be an IP address or a web the website so
I'm gonna copy this site we scan me site
because again I want to keep this as
legal as possible and I'm just going to
hit enter alright and it's going to give
me the address so as you can see this
allows you to actually get the address
of the website and you can do it and
vice versa so if I if I copied this
alright and I said yeah and s look up
and I pasted the address there hopefully
it will give me the name of the site
alright and as you can see here the name
is can me dot n map dot org all right
pretty awesome right now if I just want
to give you a quick tip with nslookup
let's say running a lot of scans and you
want to save them to a document or
to a file so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to own a save them on the desktop
right
so one a-10s lookup and we're going to
let's say we want to find the name of
the of this IP address gonna find what
who is registered to and then what you
want to do is you just want to use the
two greater than signs and you want to
give a name to a document that you want
to save it to in this case I'm going to
use a txt document and I'm going to save
it on my desktop because that's where I
open the terminal from although you
could change it to whatever directory or
in so I'm going to say a results dot txt
and I'm going to hit enter and it's
going to open a results dot txt as you
can see over here and if I open it it
will give me the scan results pretty
awesome and you can keep on sailing them
in here and it's just going to do it for
you automatically so this is basically
what I wanted to explain to you for the
first tutorial there's a lot of cell in
this tutorial and I just wanted all of
that to sink in and the next tutorial
I'm going to go through the advanced and
map commands but that's basically what I
wanted to tell you today basically what
we've gone through in to summarize is
we're going through what and map is the
nmap help commands it would be nmap the
end map what what is it call the
parameters mean when I was talking about
these parameters right here the V and da
and there's a lot of them here which
I'll go get to in a in another video
right after this one I just want you
guys to practice what I've shown you in
this video and just practice a bit of
reconnaissance and yeah you'll get it
you'll find it really really interesting
to see how much information you can dig
up from a lot of thing a lot of these
servers and IP addresses that's been it
guys I hope this video helped you and
you enjoyed it if you if it did help you
please leave a like if it didn't help
you you can dislike the video and let me
know in the comments section
alternatively if you have any question
hit me up in the comment section social
media and or kick I'm always there and
I'm ready to help you guys otherwise
we're going to
in you the exam stuff in the next video
