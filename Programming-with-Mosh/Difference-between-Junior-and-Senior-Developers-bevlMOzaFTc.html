shows we can ask me your questions on
anything technical or non-technical
topics and if I see the topic
interesting and valuable to others I
will include your question in my next
show so tonight's job is about junior
vs. senior developers one of my good
students Kyle from Melbourne has sent me
this question what is the difference
between the junior and a senior
developer so briefly Kyle has three
years of programming experience
including a year and half of university
study he's told me that in most
interviews he has attended employers
think that he's a junior developer but
when he got his current job he demoed
his previous work to his colleagues and
they thought he has implemented quite a
few advanced features so Kyle is
wondering what he should focus on to
become a real senior developer and
here's my response hi Kyle thanks for
sending your question I should say that
this is actually a pretty interesting
question and I'm going to get into a lot
of details in my response first of all
there are two ways to define what makes
a developer junior or senior job
agencies have their own criteria which
is often based on the number of years of
experience of course they have other
criteria based on your skill set but
they put a lot of weight on the number
of years now in my personal opinion
years of experience is not always a good
way to assess if a given candidate is a
senior developer or not I work with
developers with more than 10 years of
experience who were at the intermediate
level at best software industry as you
probably know is very fast pacing and if
you don't constantly learn new things
fast sooner or later you'll be behind
the game I've seen developers with 20
years of experience who are still using
Microsoft Access
so does 20 years of experience make such
a developer a senior developer not
really so I personally believe being a
senior developer depends on the skills
not the years of experience and the
skill set is subjective you ask 10
different senior developers what are the
skills that a senior developer should
have and chances are you will hear
different answer
but if you're interested to know my
answer I would say is senior developer
has experience with a wide range of
technologies often both on the front end
and the back end they have reasonable
understanding of design patterns or at
least they know the key ones so if
someone says abstract factoring or
builder pattern they know what they're
talking about they're exposed to no
sequel databases but not necessarily an
expert in the area they're familiar with
messaging tools and frameworks but again
not necessarily an expert they're able
to troubleshoot problems often faster
than junior developers but not
necessarily fast they can think of
different solutions to solve a problem
and they can explain the pros and cons
of each solution from different points
of view such as performance scalability
security maintainability and so on they
often write cleaner and more
maintainable code they should be able to
write a unit test for they code whether
before the production code which we call
test-driven development or TDD or after
these are my personal criteria to tell
if someone is a junior or senior
developer but I think these are fair
assumptions and if you ask 10 senior
developers most of them are going to
agree with most of the criteria I've
listed here no one is going to say no a
senior developer doesn't need to know
unit testing no one is going to say a
senior developer doesn't have to write
clean code now having said that I've
worked with senior consultants who fail
at taking these boxes and it really
surprises me how they end up getting
those titles but that aside to answer
your question what you should do to
become a senior developer I would say
there are two parts here one part is the
number of years which you get judged
upon and that's really out of your
control so don't worry about it instead
focus on what is under your control and
that's the skill set I talked about so
improve your coding skills learn to
write cleaner and more maintainable code
because I don't think anyone would
regard a developer who writes messy code
as a senior developer no matter how many
years of experience they have if you're
interested I have a course on udemy
called clean code look at the table of
content
and see if you know all the topics I
have covered if not I would suggest that
should be your starting point also spend
some time studying and practicing unit
testing that would certainly take you to
the next level and on the side get
yourself exposed to a wide range of
front and then back end tools and
frameworks if you want to be a
full-stack developer on the client make
sure you're pretty confident with HTML
CSS JavaScript jQuery and bootstrap
and I mean really really confident
because this is the absolute minimum you
should also be pretty confident in one
of the leading front-end frameworks like
angular or react on the back end if you
want to use Microsoft technologies you
should be pretty confident with a
southern MVC web api entity framework
and relational database at an absolute
minimum you should also be pretty
confident writing most queries in plane
sequel to get data out of your database
now on top of all this if I want to give
you a golden key I would say go and
build three different applications and
to end entirely by yourself pick any
kind of domain you're interested in and
build a real-world application if you
don't have any ideas look at the
applications around you any website you
visit any apps you use think of building
a simplified version of that application
when you build an application end-to-end
by yourself you will have a far deeper
understanding of all these technologies
and various challenges of putting them
together along the way when you join the
team most of the time there is some
legacy code sitting there and there's a
lot of magic happening in that code that
you have no idea about most of the time
you'll be working on little bits and
pieces here and there and to be frank
with you this stuff wouldn't really give
you the depth that you need as a senior
developer you would just learn how to
maintain existing applications and this
is not something to be proud of so in
your spare time build an application
end-to-end and deploy it to a sure yes
you would have to pay a little bit of
money for your subscription but trust me
that's not much and you can turn off the
service shortly after deployment so you
wouldn't have to pay any more money when
you go through all these different
phases of software development
cycle starting from the requirements and
eventually deploying working software
you would be completely different
developer so to recap on the client make
sure you're pretty confident with HTML
CSS JavaScript jQuery bootstrap and at
least one of the leading frameworks like
angular or react on the server if you're
going to use Microsoft technologies make
sure you're pretty confident with
asp.net MVC with API entity framework
and relational databases on top of all
this you should write really clean code
you should know your unit testing you
should know your design patterns then I
would say you're a senior developer not
just one thing since you're new to the
industry you may get intimidated by
different kinds of things you need to
know but trust me it's not that hard
when you build a real-world application
end to end you will deal with these
technologies all the time and after a
while they become like a piece of cake
so I hope I've answered your question
and I wish you all the best
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
