underscore methods that are supported by
backbone collections in this lecture
we're going to extend this topic with
more here you see an example of using
the add method that you learned in the
last lecture the add method by default
adds the given model at the end of the
collection but you can use its second
argument to specify the index at which
you would like to insert the model
this technique is useful if you want to
insert a model at the beginning of a
collection
note that we are not simply passing an
index we're passing a JSON object with a
property called at which specifies the
index apart from the add method
underscore also provides another method
to add models to a collection
you
if you're wondering about the difference
between the ad and push methods
basically the push method comes from
working with stacks if you're familiar
with stacks you know that stacks support
two basic operations push and pop push
always inserts an object on top of a
stack and pop takes out the object on
the top so the push and add methods
behave exactly the same by default but
with the add method you can specify an
index at which you would like to insert
an object
okay now let's see how we can search for
models in a collection
underscore provides two useful and
simple methods for searching collections
where and find where
you
both the wear and find where methods
take a hash of attributes you would like
to filter the collection by they check
these attributes against the attributes
of the models inside the collection for
equality now that in case of strings the
comparison is case-sensitive the
difference between the wear and find
where methods is that the where method
returns an array whereas the find where
returns only the first instance I know
the naming is a bit confusing and I wish
underscore developers call this method
first instead of find where
ok now let's see the result in chrome
there you go note that the result is an
array let's expand it
you
we can also add multiple filters in the
web method for example we can search for
any songs with the genre of jazz whose
title is song too
you
what if we want to find the songs with
the number of downloads greater than 100
we can use the where method for that the
web method simply does an equality check
between the attributes you pass and the
attributes of the models inside the
collection so to filter the collection
by some custom logic we should use the
filter method
you
the argument to the filter method is
interesting this is what we call a
predicate when we call the filter method
underscore i trace the collection and
for every model in the collection it
executes this predicate function the job
of this function is to check if the
given model has the criteria we are
looking for in this case you're checking
if the number of downloads is greater
than 100 the return value of this
function should be a true or false if
it's true underscore as this model in
the list of filtered models
one more useful underscore method that
is available in collections is a each
method which is used for iterating
collections let citrate our sons
collection and log every model to the
console
similar to the filter method the each
method expects a callback function that
will be executed at each iteration this
function receives the model in the
current iteration
so the add method allows us to specify
the index at which we would like to
insert a model inside a collection we
can also use the push method to insert a
model at the end of a collection the pop
method removes and returns the model at
the end of a collection we can search
collections by attributes using the
where or find where method both these
methods check the attributes we pass
against the attributes of the models
inside the collection for equality for
more complicated filtering we can use
the filter method and finally we can use
the each method to I to write
collections
owner score has a few more methods to
work with collections and arrays and
covering them all is beyond the scope of
this course you can always check the
underskirt documentation at
underscore.js org in the next lecture
will cover how to get collections from a
restful api on the server</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
