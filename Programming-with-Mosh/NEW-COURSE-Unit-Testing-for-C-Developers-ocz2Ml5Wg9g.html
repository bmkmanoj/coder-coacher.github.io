developers my name is Mohamad ani and I
have taught over 140,000 students around
the world chances are you've heard of
unit testing but you're not sure how
powerful it is or perhaps you've tried
it and it didn't work for you it's a
skill that every senior developer must
have unit tests help you get instant
feedback on your code to see if it
really works
this means we can catch bugs before you
release your software so ultimately you
will save time effort and money in this
course I'm going to take you on a
journey to master unit testing but in a
fraction of the time it took me I read
several books watch tons of videos and
tried various approaches to write unit
tests some failed some worked what you
find in this course is the result of
years of my experience packed with best
practices real-world examples and
exercises so by the end of watching this
course you'll be able to write great
unit tests that help you release better
quality software with less bugs more
specifically you'll learn what to test
and how tips and tricks to write clean
and reliable tests the pitfalls to avoid
how to refactor a legacy code into
loosely coupled and testable code all
about dependency injection and mocks and
much much more
so click the enroll button to get
instant lifetime access to the course
and here's my promise to you if you're
not satisfied ask for a refund within
the first 30 days all your money back no
questions asked
so you've got absolutely nothing to lose
it's a hundred percent risk-free I'm
really looking forward to sharing my
knowledge with you take care and happy
coding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
