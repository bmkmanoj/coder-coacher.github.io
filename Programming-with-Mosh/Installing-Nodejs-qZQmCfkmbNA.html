how to install note if you're on Windows
open up command prompt if you're on Mac
or Linux open up the terminal first
let's see if you already have node on
your machine or not so run note space -
- version you can see on this machine
I'm running node version 6.0 point three
this is an earlier version of node the
latest stable version is version eight
now on your machine chances are you may
not have known or you might have an
earlier version either way I want you to
install the latest version of node
so open up your browser and head over to
note J s org on this home page you can
see we have two versions for note one is
the latest stable version which is
recommended for most users at the time
of recording this video test version
eight point nine point one and there's
always a newer version which is
experimental and it might not be stable
so I want you to install the latest
stable version also take into account
that in the future when you're watching
this video chances are the latest stable
version might be newer if you're worried
that this course is going to get
outdated
don't worry because in this course we're
going to focus on the fundamentals so
I'm going to work with the core modules
of note these core modules are stable
they have been there for a long time so
the code that we're going to write in
this course will continue to work with
the future versions of Note once you
master the fundamentals you can always
learn about the new features that come
in every version by looking at the
change lock so let's not worry about the
fancy new features in node and focus on
the fundamentals so let's go ahead and
install the latest stable version
we can see here I get a package we run
it it's an installer take a look very
simple just continue continue
continue install you need to enter our
password and the installation is
complete it took only a few seconds so
now back in the terminal let's run node
- - version one more time you can see I
upgraded my node to version eight point
nine point one next we're going to build
our first node application
