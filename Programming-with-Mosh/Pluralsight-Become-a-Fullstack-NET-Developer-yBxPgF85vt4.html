published my Pluralsight course become a
full-stack dotnet developer did you know
that since then my course has been
ranking number one amongst more than
5,000 courses on flora site well more
accurately this course comes in three
parts and these parts are ranking number
one number 20 and number 38 according to
the author's report on flora site and if
you search on polar site you can see all
three parts a five-star rating
demand for full sec developers were
comfortable with both front-end and
back-end development is increasing
constantly and some companies only hire
full stack developers so if you want to
become a full stack developer or if you
already are one but want to take your
skills to the next level you got the
right course in front of you no need to
jump from one course or tutorial to
another in this series I take you on a
journey of building a real-world
application from A to Z we start with a
requirements document and build working
software with clean code clean
architecture and automated tests in an
agile iterative way this course is
packed with lots of techniques and if
you watch all the lectures and do the
exercises we can transition from a
junior level developer to a senior
developer what if you don't have a
Pluralsight subscription well I'm not
here to sell you a Pluralsight
subscription but did you know that it
costs you only $29 a month we can simply
take one month subscription to watch my
course and I promise you'll be
completely satisfied you spend only $29
to learn what has taken me years to
master is that too much I guarantee it's
not you invest $29 in developing new
skills that would help you get a better
job and earn way more money so if you
want to watch my Pluralsight course
become a full stack developer click on
the link in the video description I'm
looking forward to the day you contact
me and tell me how much you have learned
from this course now let me give you a
small preview of this course
hi welcome to become a full-stack dotnet
developer my name is Muhammad Ali and
I'm going to be our instructor over the
next few hours in this course you're
going to learn the core skills that
every full stack net developer must know
and you're going to learn all this as
part of building a real-world mini
social networking application using
asp.net MVC 5 and entity framework 6
whether you are a junior level developer
and want to learn a systematic approach
to build applications end-to-end or you
have more experience and want to
strengthen your front-end and back-end
development skills this course is for
you now let me give you a sneak peek of
what we're going to build we are going
to start with the default MVC project
template which looks pretty boring and
over a few iterations we're going to
turn this into a simple social
networking website for live music lovers
so musicians can sign up and list their
upcoming gigs and their followers can
see all the upcoming gigs on the home
page or search for them by artist genre
or location and then they can add their
favorite gigs to the calendar and here's
the interesting part
once the musician updates or cancels one
of your upcoming gigs users who are
attending that gig will see a
notification here on the navigation bar
when they log in as part of this we'll
be exploring a lot of front-end and
back-end development topics such as
bootstrap CSS usability entity framework
code first restful api is security
object oriented design
clean architecture automated testing and
much much more along the way i'm going
to share with you lots and lots of
shortcuts that i use on a daily basis to
write code fast and not only that i will
also show you how to refactor poorly
written code into clean maintainable and
elegant code that speaks and here's my
promise to you
if you watch all the videos in this
course and do the exercises by the end
of watching this course both your
front-end and back-end development
skills will be at the next level are you
ready let's get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
