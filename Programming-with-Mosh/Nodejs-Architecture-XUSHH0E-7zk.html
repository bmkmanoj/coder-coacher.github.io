note is a runtime environment for
executing JavaScript code but what is it
runtime environment really well before
node we use JavaScript only to build
applications and run inside of a browser
so every browser out there has what we
call a JavaScript engine that takes our
JavaScript code and converts it to code
that a computer can understand for
example Microsoft ed uses chakra Firefox
uses spider monkey and chrome uses v8
and is because of these varieties of
engines that sometimes JavaScript code
can behave differently in one browser or
another now a browser provides a runtime
environment for JavaScript code for
example you probably know that in
browsers we have the window or the
document object these objects allow us
to work with the environment in which
our code is running now up to 2009 the
only way to execute JavaScript code was
inside of a browser in 2009 Brian Dahl
the creator of node came up with a
brilliant idea he thought it would be
great to execute JavaScript outside of a
browser so he took Google's v8 engine
which is the fastest JavaScript engine
out there and embedded it inside a C++
program and called that program note so
similar to a browser note is a runtime
environment for JavaScript code it
contains a JavaScript engine that can
execute our JavaScript code but it also
has certain objects that provide an
environment for our JavaScript code but
these objects are different from the
environment objects we have in browsers
for example we don't have the document
object instead we have other objects
that give us more interesting
capabilities for example we can work
with the file system listen for requests
and a given port and so on we can't do
stuff like that inside of a browser
right so in essence node is a program
that includes the v8 JavaScript engine
plus some additional modules that give
us capabilities not available inside
browsers we can work with the file
system or the network and so on both
chrome and note share the same
JavaScript engine but they provide
different runtime environments for
JavaScript now I've seen people
conferring no to c-sharp or Ruby or some
other programming languages but this
comparisons are fundamentally wrong
because node is not a programming
language it's like comparing a car with
an apple by the same token note should
not be compared with frameworks such as
a spool of meth or rails or Django and
so on these are frameworks for building
web applications note is not a framework
it's a runtime environment for executing
JavaScript code next we're going to look
at how node works
hi guys it's mush here thank you for
watching my node tutorial I just wanted
to let you know that this video you've
been watching it's part of my complete
node course where you will learn
everything about node from the basic to
the advanced topics if you're serious
about learning node I highly recommend
you to enroll in my node course because
this is much faster than jumping from
one tutorial to another it saves you
time plus you're going to get a lot of
exercises that will prepare you for the
real work and also at the end of the
course you'll receive a certificate of
completion that you can provide your
current or future employer so if you
want to enroll click on the link in the
video description I hope to see you in
the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
