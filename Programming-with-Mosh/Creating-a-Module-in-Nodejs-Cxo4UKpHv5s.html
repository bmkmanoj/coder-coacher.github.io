this application so I'm gonna add a new
file logger dot J s let's imagine we're
going to create a module for login
messages and we're gonna reuse this
module in various parts of this
application or potentially in other
applications so loggernet j s now in
this module let's imagine that we're
going to use one of those remote logging
services for login our messages so there
are websites out there there provide
logging as a service they give us a URL
and we can send an HTTP request to that
URL to log messages in the cloud so here
I'm gonna declare a variable like URL
and set it to something like this HTTP
my lager dot io / lock and of course I'm
making this up it may not be a true
service out there but let's imagine in
this implementation we're going to send
an HTTP request to this endpoint to this
URL now we also need a function called
log that takes a message and in this
function we're going to send an HTTP
request however to keep things simple
here we just want to focus on the
modularity we don't want to get
distracted with all the details of
sending HTTP requests so for now I just
want to log this message on the console
so console that log message okay
now this variable and this log function
they're both scoped to this module
they're private they're not visible from
the outside however in after j/s which
is our main module we want to use this
logger module so we should be able to
access this log function we should be
able to call it from the app module so
we need to make this public we need to
make it visible from the outside
now in the last lecture you saw this
module object one of the properties we
have here is exports you can see this
property is set to an empty object
anything that we add to this object will
be exported from this module and it will
be available outside of this module so
back in our lager module I'm gonna set
module dot exports dot log so I'm adding
a method called log to this exports
object and simply setting it to this log
function we have defined here okay in
other words the object that we're
exporting here has a single method
called log now similarly
if you want to export this URL we could
do something like this so module that
exports that URL we set it to URL and of
course we could change the name that is
exported to the outside for example
internally we may call this variable URL
but when we export it we may call it
endpoint okay now in this case we don't
need to export this URL variable because
this is purely implementation detail so
in real world applications every module
might have several variables and
functions we only want to export a
subset of these members to the outside
because we want to keep this module easy
to use let me give you a metaphor think
of a DVD player a DVD player has a few
buttons on the outside and these are the
buttons or objects that we interact with
so these objects represent the public
interface of a DVD player okay but
inside the box there are lots of other
objects or complex objects we don't need
to know anything about these objects
their implementation data and they can
change significantly from one model to
another but what we see on the outside
is almost stable or static across
different models so in our logger module
this URL is implementation detail
modules don't need to know anything
about this they only need to call the
log function so we export these make it
public but keep the URL private so I'm
gonna delete this last line okay so
we're done with our logger module now we
need to load this module and use it
inside app j/s
hi guys its mosh here thank you for
watching my node tutorial I just wanted
to let you know that this video you've
been watching is part of my complete
note course where you will learn
everything about node from the basic to
the advanced topics if you're serious
about learning node I highly recommend
you to enroll in my node course because
this is much faster than jumping from
one tutorial to another it saves you
time plus you're going to get a lot of
exercises that will prepare you for the
real work and also at the end of the
course you'll receive a certificate of
completion that you can provide your
current or future employer so if you
want to enroll click on the link in the
video description I hope to see you in
the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
