first node application so I'm gonna
create a new folder call it first app
let's go to this folder now I'm going to
open this folder inside of Visual Studio
code which is my preferred code editor
so code period so this is Visual Studio
code or vs code it's a free powerful
editor but you can use any editors that
you prefer you can use sublime you can
use atom or any other editors so here in
this folder I'm gonna add in your file
app is in this file we can write regular
JavaScript just like the JavaScript that
we write for the browsers so I'm gonna
define a function say hello
that takes a parameter name and simply
logs a message on the console so hello
+ name and then we can call this
function like this Marsh now to execute
this code we're going to go back to the
terminal and run node and pass the name
of the file as an argument so app the
jas so node as I told you before is a
C++ program it includes Chrome's
v8 JavaScript engine so this app the J's
file that we're gonna pass to node node
is gonna give it to v8 for execution so
you can see we got hello Marsh on the
console now let me show you something so
back in vs code
I'm going to temporarily comment out
this line and do it console that log of
window let's see what happens so back in
the terminal let's run node app ajs you
got an exception window is not defined
so as I told you before a node we don't
have the window or document objects
these are part of the runtime
environment that we get with browsers in
node we have other objects to work with
files with the operating system with the
network and so on and that's what you're
gonna learn about in the next section I
hope you enjoyed this section and thank
you for watching hi guys it's mush here
thank you for watching my node tutorial
I just wanted to let you know that this
video you've been watching it's part of
my complete node course where you will
learn everything about node from the
basic to the advanced topics if you're
serious about learning node I highly
recommend you to enroll in my node
course because this is much faster than
jumping from one tutorial to another it
saves you time plus you're going to get
a lot of exercises that will prepare you
for the real work and also at the end of
the course you'll receive a certificate
of completion that you can provide your
current or future employer so if you
want to enroll click on the link in the
video description I hope to see you in
the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
