applications are highly scalable and
this is because of the non-blocking or
asynchronous nature of note what do you
mean by asynchronous let me give you a
metaphor imagine you go to a restaurant
the waiter comes to your table takes
your order and gives it to the kitchen
then they move on to serve another table
while the chef is preparing your meal so
the same person can serve many different
tables they don't have to wait for the
chef to cook one meal before they serve
another table this is what we call
non-blocking or asynchronous
architecture and this is how node
applications work the waiter is like a
thread allocated to handle a request so
a single thread is used to handle
multiple requests in contrast to
non-blocking or asynchronous
architecture we have blocking or
synchronous architecture let's see how
that works so back to our restaurant
example imagine you go to another
restaurant and in this restaurant a
waiter is allocated to you
they take your order and give it to the
kitchen now they are sitting in the
kitchen waiting for the chef to prepare
your meal at this time they are not
doing anything else they're just waiting
they're not going to take an order from
another table until your meal is ready
this is what we call blocking or
synchronous architecture and that's how
applications built with frameworks like
a speed net or rails work out of the box
so when we receive a request on the
server a thread is allocated to handle
that request as part of handling that
requests it is likely that we're going
to query a database and as you know
sometimes it may take a little while
until the result is ready when the
database is executing the query that
thread is sitting there waiting it can't
be used to serve another client so we
need a new thread to serve another
client imagine what would happen if we
have a large number of concurrent
clients at some point we're going to run
out of threads to serve these clients so
new clients have to wait until three
threads are available or if we don't
want
them to wait we need to add more
hardware so with this kind of
architecture we are not utilizing our
resources efficiently this is the
problem with blocking or synchronous
architecture and as I explained that's
how applications built with frameworks
like asp.net worked by default of course
in asp.net it is possible to use
asynchronous architecture but you will
have to do extra work for now in
contrast no the applications are
asynchronous by default so you don't
have to do anything extra in node we
have a single thread to handle all
requests linear request arrives that
single thread is used to handle that
request if you need to query a database
our thread doesn't have to wait for the
database to return the data while the
database is executing our query that
thread will be used to serve another
client when the database prepares the
result it puts a message in what we call
an event queue node is continuously
monitoring this queue in the background
when it finds an event in this queue it
will take it out and process it this
kind of architecture makes node ideal
for building applications that include a
lot of disk or network access we can
serve more clients without the need to
throw in more hardware and that's why no
the applications are highly scalable in
contrast node should not be used for CPU
intensive applications like a video
encoding or an image manipulation
service in this kind of applications we
have a lot of calculations that should
be done by CPU and few operations that
touch the file system or the network
since no the applications are single
threaded when performing the
calculations to serve one client other
clients have to wait and that's why note
should not be used or CPU intensive
applications it should only be used for
building data intensive and real-time
applications ok enough theory Nix I'm
gonna show you how to install node and
build your first node application
hi guys its mosh here thank you for
watching my know tutorial I just wanted
to let you know that this video you've
been watching it's part of my complete
note course where you will learn
everything about node from the basic to
the advanced topics if you're serious
about learning node I highly recommend
you to enroll in my node course because
this is much faster than jumping from
one tutorial to another it saves you
time plus you're going to get a lot of
exercises that will prepare you for the
real work and also at the end of the
course you'll receive a certificate of
completion that you can provide your
current or future employer so if you
want to enroll click on the link in the
video description I hope to see you in
the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
