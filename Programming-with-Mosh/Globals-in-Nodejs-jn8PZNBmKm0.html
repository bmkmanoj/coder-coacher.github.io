console that log function to lock
something on the console now this
console object is what we call a global
object so it's part of the global scope
which means we can access it anywhere in
any files we have a bunch of other
objects and functions that are also
globally available in node for example
we have set timeout which you have
probably seen before we use this to call
a function after a delay like one second
two second whatever so this is just part
of the standard JavaScript we can use
this on the client we can use this
inside of a browser or inside of node we
also have clear timeout similarly we
have set interval which we use to
repeatedly call a function after a given
delay we also have clear interval which
we use to stop that function from being
called repeatedly so these are the
global objects in JavaScript now he node
we have a couple other global objects
that you're going to learn about later
in this section now in browsers we have
this window object that represents our
global scope so all the variables and
functions that are defined globally we
can access them via this window object
so we can call window that console dot
log or simply just console dot lock the
JavaScript engine will prefix this
statement with window dot console dot
lock because that's where this object is
defined similarly all these other
functions you see here they belong to
the window object so we can call window
dot set timeout or call it directly by
the same token when we declare a
variable let's say message that variable
is also available via the window object
okay however in the last section I told
you that in node we don't have this
window object instead we have another
object called
global so all these functions and
objects we have here we can
access them by the global object so we
can do global that console dot log or
global that set timeout and so on of
course it's easier to use the shorthand
instead of prefix in them with this
global but one thing you need to know
about note is that these variables that
we define here they are not added to the
global object in other words if we do a
console dot log of global that message
we are going to see undefined on the
console so let me show you I'm going to
delete all the code here now back in the
terminal let's run node app is so we get
undefined in the console so as you can
see the variables and functions that we
defined here they are not added to the
global object they're only scoped to
this fire app dot j s so they are not
available outside of this file and this
is because note modular system that
you're going to learn about in the next
lecture
hi guys it's mash here thank you for
watching my node tutorial I just wanted
to let you know that this video you've
been watching it's part of my complete
note course where you will learn
everything about node from the basic to
the advanced topics if you're serious
about learning node I highly recommend
you to enroll in my node course because
this is much faster than jumping from
one tutorial to another it saves you
time plus you're going to get a lot of
exercises that will prepare you for the
real work and also at the end of the
course you'll receive a certificate of
completion then you can provide your
current or future employer so if you
want to enroll click on the link in the
video description I hope to see you in
the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
