models they're useful when you want to
work with a group of models building
collections is very easy and it's
similar to building models we simply
extend back bonded collection and
specify the type of models that the
collection can hold let's see this in
action
you
we can put objects in a collection in
two ways we can pass the initial array
of models when creating the collection
or we can call the add method on an
instantiated collection
you
the add method is provided by underscore
and is available in all background
collections underscore provides many
other methods that make working with
collections really easy we'll cover them
in a few minutes alright now let's go to
chrome and inspect our collection
no this property's here
these are the ones that are collection
inherited from the base backbone that
collection object every backbone
collection has lengths and models
property the length property returns the
number of models inside the collection
and the models property gives us direct
access to these models most often we use
the add or get methods to access a model
in the collection let's try them
the add method returns a model at the
given index here zero represents the
first model in the collection also note
that this model has the CID of c1 every
backbone model has two IDs one is a
persistent ID which is assigned by the
server and another one is the client ID
or CID which is assigned by backbone CID
is a temporary identifier that backbone
uses to keep track of objects
we can get a model from a collection by
its ID which is its persistent ID or CID
which is the client ID so another way
for us to get the same model here is
like this
we can also remove a model from a
collection by calling the remove method
the remove method expects a model so you
need to get the model by either its
index or its ID and then pass it to this
method
let's verify that the model is removed
bang-bang collections provide an easy
way to work with a group of models we
can create a collection type by
extending back bonded collection we can
add models to a collection but
instantiate a collection or by calling
the add method the length property
returns the number of models inside the
collection the add method returns the
model at the specified index the get
method returns the model specified by
its ID or see ID we can remove a model
from a collection by calling the remove
method all the methods we've covered in
this lecture are provided by underscore
in the next lecture we'll cover more of
underscore methods available in
collections thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
