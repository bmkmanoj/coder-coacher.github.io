in an angular 2 app components
directives routers and services let's
take a look at each of these building
blocks in more detail at the very core
we have components a component
encapsulate the template data and the
behavior of a view so it's more accurate
to call it a view component every
angular 2 app has at least one component
which we call the route component but in
the real world an application often
consists of tens or hundreds of
components for example imagine we want
to build an application like udemy we
can divide this page into three
components navigation bar sidebar and
courses so each component has the
template or HTML markup for the view as
well as data and logic behind that view
components can also contain other
components so in the list of courses we
can have multiple course components and
in each course component we can have
another component for rating that course
the benefit of this architectural style
is that it will help us break up a large
application with various complex views
into smaller more manageable components
or as I said view components plus we can
reuse these components in different
parts of an application or even in a
different application for example we can
reuse this rating component here in a
totally different application now you
might be saying look Marsh I understand
what you're saying about components but
what are these components really like in
the code a component is nothing but a
plain typescript class so just like
classes in other programming languages
it can have properties and methods these
properties hold the data for the view
and the methods implement the behavior
of the view like what should happen when
we click a button now if you have never
worked with angular before one thing
that may be new to you is that these
components are completely decoupled from
the document object model
or dumb in applications written with
plain JavaScript or jQuery we get a
reference to a Dom element in order to
modify it or handle its events in
angular we don't do that instead we use
binding so in the view we bind to the
properties and methods of our component
if there is a change in the value of a
property the Dom element bound to this
property will refresh automatically so
we can't and shouldn't get a reference
to that Dom element in order to update
it similarly to handle an event raised
from a Dom element like click we bind
that event to a method in our component
when the user clicks that element the
corresponding method in our component
will be called now in case you're
curious why these components are
decoupled from the Dom the reason is
that this makes our components unit
testable if you have a plain class that
is nothing but a bunch of properties and
methods we can easily unit test it
without having a document object model
now sometimes our components need to
talk to back-end api's to get or save
data to have good separation of concerns
in our applications we delegate any
logic that is not related to view to a
service so a service is just a plain
class that encapsulates any non user
interface logic like making HTTP calls
logging business rules and so on we have
another key player in angular apps and
that's a router which is purely
responsible for navigation so as the
user navigates from one page to another
it will figure out based on changes in
URL what component to present to the
user you will learn more about this in
the section titled building single page
apps and the last key player in angular
is a directive similar to components we
use directives to work with the Dom but
a directive unlike a component doesn't
have the template or HTML markup for
view we often use them to add behavior
to existing Dom elements for example we
can use a directive to make a text box
automatically grow when it receives
focus angular has a bunch of built-in
directives for common tasks like adding
or removing Dom elements adding classes
or styles to them repeating them but we
can also create our own custom
directives so this is the big picture as
you go through this course you will see
each of these building blocks in action
well hello
it's Maj here your angular 2 instructor
