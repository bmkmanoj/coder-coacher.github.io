an event we also want to send some data
about that event for example in our
lager module when we log a message
perhaps our remote login service will
generate an ID for that message perhaps
we want to return that ID to the client
or it may give us a URL to access that
log message directly so here when
raising an event we can add additional
arguments which we refer to as event
arguments so we can add an ID like one
and we can add a URL but as you can see
these magic values here are a little bit
confusing if you want to send multiple
values about an event it's a better
practice to encapsulate those values
inside an object so here we have an
object we give it a couple of properties
like ID we set it to ID of this message
that is logged and another property URL
like this
okay so we're referring to this object
as event argument now when registering a
listener here this callback function is
actual listener can also receive this
event argument so here we add a
parameter called org you can call it
anything the name doesn't matter but by
convention we often use arc or some
people use e to refer to the event or
event art whatever you prefer is
perfectly fine so here we have art now
let's log it on the console very simple
let's run this application so note okay
look listen are called and here's our
event arc and with this technique we can
pass data about the event that just
happened
now one last thing to make this code a
little bit simpler in es6 or equal
script six we have this feature called
arrow function with an arrow function we
can get rid of this function keyword so
here we have the arguments and after
that we have the body of that function
now to separate the two we use an arrow
and that's why we call this arrow
function you can see this syntax is a
little bit simpler and a lot of people
prefer to use arrow functions in es6 now
here's a simple exercise for you let's
imagine in our lager module just before
calling our remote service to log the
message we're going to raise an event
called logging and while raising this
event we also want to send some data and
it's the message that we're going to
lock so what I want you to do is to use
what you have learned in this lecture
and raise and handle is logging event
it's a very simple exercise I just want
you to get used to this syntax
hi guys its mosh here thank you for
watching my node tutorial I just wanted
to let you know that this video you've
been watching is part of my complete
note course where you will learn
everything about node from the basic to
the advanced topics if you're serious
about learning node I highly recommend
you to enroll in my node course because
this is much faster than jumping from
one tutorial to another it saves you
time plus you're going to get a lot of
exercises that will prepare you for the
real work and also at the end of the
course you'll receive a certificate of
completion that you can provide your
current or future employer so if you
want to enroll click on the link in the
video description I hope to see you in
the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
