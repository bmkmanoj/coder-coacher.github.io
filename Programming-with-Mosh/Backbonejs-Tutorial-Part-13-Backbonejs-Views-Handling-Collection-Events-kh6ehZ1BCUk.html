have the view subscribe to events raised
by the model in this lecture we're gonna
explore how to listen to collection
events this is often useful when models
are added to or removed from a
collection in situations like this you
will like the view to reflect the
changes automatically a good real-world
example of this is the conversation
exchange between you and another
Facebook user as you type a message and
press the enter the message appears on
the page immediately
I don't know how Facebook has
implemented this but if you want to
implement something like this with
backbone you need a collection of
messages every time you post a message
the message is added to the collection
the view is listening to the changes and
is notified that there is a new message
in the collection so it appends the
message to the conversation or think of
tweets as another example you post a
tweet and you immediately see that
appearing in the list of tweets alright
now that you have an understanding of
why and when we need to listen to
collection events let's see how we can
implement it with pack form here is the
code we wrote earlier in the lecture
passing data to views we are simply
passing a song's collection to our view
which renders each song separately
so here's our song model along with the
songs collection
here's a song view which renders one
song as an li element
and here's the songs view which
basically authorized the collection and
wraps each model with a song view
renders it and then appends it to its
dom element
and finally here's the instantiation of
our collection and the view
let's try it is in Chrome first
okay nothing special here yet let's see
what happens if I add a new song to this
collection
you
see the view is not refreshed and that's
because it's not listening to the
advance published by the collection so
let's go ahead and fix this
you
so here we're using the initialized
method to register a handler for the add
event of our collection this is similar
to what you learned in the last lecture
about responding to events raised by a
model all backbone connections trigger
events when items are added to or remove
from them so when a song is added to our
collection this method is called which
simply logs a message let's see if the
plumbing code is working first just baby
steps this is a great way to increase
your productivity and write code fast
instead of doing too many things at once
and facing an application that's not
working for a million reasons just write
a little bit of code test it and make
sure it works if it doesn't there is
only one reason which hopefully you can
identify immediately if you do too much
at once
it would be hard and time-consuming to
identify what is not working
okay let's add a new song to the
collection
note the message in the console this
verifies that the event handling code is
working so let's move on to the next
step
now instead of login a message we would
like to append the song to the list of
songs this is similar to a conversation
exchange on Facebook that I mentioned in
their introduction
you
when an object is added to a collection
the ativan is triggered the handler for
this event gets an argument which is the
object that was just added in this case
it refers to a song model so we simply
pass it to our song view which is
responsible for rendering a song and
then we use the jQuery append method to
append it to our list now let's try it
out
so I'm gonna add a song to our
collection
there you go the song was successfully
rendered on the page now let's take this
to the next level and make it a bit more
challenging we have implemented handling
of the add event but how about the
remove event if we remove a song from
the collection the view should be
notified and respond accordingly so
let's register a handler for the remove
event first
you
nothing new yet let's make sure that our
plumbing code is working and gain baby
steps
there you go so I removed the first song
from the collection and we got the song
removed message in the console but the
view is not refreshed now we need to
write some code to remove the
corresponding Dom element from the page
there is just one problem here there is
no way for us to identify which Dom
element to remove let's inspect the list
for each song we have an Li but there is
no association between these lis and the
songs they represent we need to give
each Li and ID so we can later use
jQuery to select a given Ally and remove
it from the Dom so let's go ahead and
implement this
you
here we are using the jQuery attribute
function to set the ID attribute of this
Dom element there is just one problem
here in the section on models I told you
that the ID property of a model
represents its persistent ID which is
generated by the server in this example
we don't have a persistent ID because we
didn't fetch our songs from a REST API
all our songs are manually created on
the client what we can resolve this by
manually assigning each model and ID as
if it was generated by the server
you
okay now let's test this bit before
moving to the next step
so I'm gonna inspect the element note
that now each Li has an ID which is the
idea of the song it refers to
okay now we need to modify our code such
that when a song is removed we find the
Associated li and remove it from the DOM
you
this code should be pretty familiar to
you we use dollar L to get the top Dom
element of the view then we use the
jQuery find method to find an Li with
the given ID and finally remove it there
is also a shorter way to write this code
every view has a dollar property which
allows us to select elements scoped to
the view
okay now let's test the result
so I'm gonna remove a song there you go
the first song was removed from the page
so to handle collection events we use
the on method to register handlers for
them
banking on collections raise an add
event when a model is added to them and
you remove event when a model is removed
in the next lecture we will see how we
can use templates to simplify rendering
of the views thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
