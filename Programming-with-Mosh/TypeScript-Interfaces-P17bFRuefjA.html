custom types in typescript so I'm gonna
start by declaring a function like draw
point so this function takes an x and a
y and simply draws it on the screen now
we don't want to worry about the actual
drawing algorithm we just want to focus
on the signature of this function now
this function is not too bad here we
have only two parameters but sometimes
when working with more complex concepts
we may end up with a function that has
so many parameters like this this is
really really bad and it's something you
should avoid at all times in those
situations it's very likely that a group
of these parameters maybe all of them
belong to a single concept as an example
think of a car a car has so many
different properties we don't want to
pass all those properties to a function
like drive car instead you want to
encapsulate them inside an object and
only pass that one object here so in
this example instead of passing x and y
here it's better to pass a point object
and then we can call this function like
this draw a point we give it an object
with two properties x and y so now our
function has a cleaner syntax however
there is a problem with this
implementation instead of a point object
I can pass a person object that has a
name property I know where here we are
getting a compile time error but we know
that this code is gonna break at runtime
because the algorithm in our drop point
function is expecting x and y properties
so what's the solution well let me
revert this back okay we've got x and y
so there are two solutions to solve this
problem one way is to use what we call
inline annotation so just like we can
annotate this parameter with the type
like number we can annotate it with a
custom type or a custom object so here
we add curly braces to indicate an
object this object is going to have a
property called X which is a number
and also another property called wine
which is again a number so this is what
we call inline annotation it works fine
for simple cases but the problem with
this as you can see is that this is a
little bit verbose also chances are
somewhere else we might have another
function that expects a point object we
don't want to repeat this object literal
in multiple places so in those cases a
better approach is to use an interface
if you worked with object-oriented
programming languages like C sharp and
Java you know the concept of interfaces
we have the same concept in typescript
if you have never worked with interfaces
let me show you how they work so on the
top I define an interface and I'm gonna
call this point curly braces then I add
X it's a number and Y is a number so
with this interface I'm defining the
shape of an object and then I can
simplify this declaration and set the
type of this parameter to point this is
much cleaner and we can also reuse this
in multiple places just one thing note
the naming convention I have used here
so because I'm introducing a custom type
I've used Pascal naming convention so
the first letter of every word in the
name of the interface should be
capitalized so here we have our per case
P not a lowercase P okay so when using
interfaces always use Pascal naming
convention hi thank you for watching my
