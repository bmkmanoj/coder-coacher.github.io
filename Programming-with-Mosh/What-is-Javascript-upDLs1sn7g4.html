to answer for frequently asked questions
about JavaScript
what is JavaScript what can you do with
it where does JavaScript code run and
what is the difference between
JavaScript and echo script so let's
start with the first question what is
JavaScript JavaScript is one of the most
popular and widely used programming
languages in the world right now it's
growing faster than any other
programming languages and big companies
like Netflix Walmart and PayPal build
internal applications around javascript
and here's the average salary of a
JavaScript developer in the United
States and it's only $2,000 a year so
it's a great opportunity to get a good
job out of learning JavaScript you can
work as a front-end developer or a
back-end developer for a full stack
developer who knows both the front end
and the back end now the second question
what can you do with JavaScript for a
long time
javascript was only used in browsers to
build interactive web pages some
developers refer to javascript as a toy
language but those days are gone because
of huge community support and
investments by large companies like
Facebook and Google these days you can
build full-blown web or mobile apps as
well as real time networking
applications like chats and video
streaming services command-line tools or
even games here's an example a third
question where does JavaScript code run
javascript was originally designed to
run only in browsers so every browser
has what we call a JavaScript engine
that can execute JavaScript code for
example the JavaScript engines in
firefox and chrome are SpiderMonkey and
v8 in 2009 a very clever engineer called
Ryan Dahl took the open-source
JavaScript engine in chrome and embedded
it inside a C++ program he called that
program node the node is a C++ program
that includes Google's v8 JavaScript
engine now with this we can run
JavaScript code out
of a browser so we can pass our
JavaScript code to node for execution
and this means with JavaScript we can
build the backend for our web and mobile
applications so in a nutshell JavaScript
code can be run inside of a browser or
in node browsers and node provide a
runtime environment for our JavaScript
code and finally the last question what
is the difference between JavaScript and
Eggman script well ECMO script is just a
specification javascript is a
programming language that confirms to
this specification so we have this
organization called a comma which is
responsible for defining standards they
take care of this Eggman script
specification the first version of
Eggman script was released in 1997 then
starting from 2015
ACMA has been working on annual releases
of a newest specification so in 2015
they released a kimono script 2015 which
is also called ECMO script version 6 or
es6 for short this specification defined
many new features for JavaScript alright
enough theory
let's see javascript in action so every
browser has a JavaScript engine and we
can easily write JavaScript code here
without any additional tools of course
this is not how we build real-world
applications but this is just for a
quick demo so open up Chrome right click
on an empty area and go to inspect now
this opens up chrome developer tools
here select the console tab this is our
JavaScript console and we can write any
valid JavaScript code here so type this
console dot log put a single code here
and then hello world another single code
to terminate close the parentheses and
add a semicolon at the end now as you go
through the course you're going to
understand exactly what all this means
for now don't worry about it so now I'll
press ENTER and you can see the hello
world message on the console we can also
write mathematical expressions here for
example two plus two we get four or we
can do something like this alert
practices single coat yo enter and
here's an alert in the next lecture I'm
going to talk about setting up your
development environment for writing
JavaScript code
well hello it's mahshar thank you for
watching my javascript tutorial I just
wanted to quickly let you know that this
tutorial is part of my complete
JavaScript course where you can learn
about all the essential concepts in
JavaScript the course is packed with
lots of exercises and solutions and by
the end of watching the course you will
also receive a certificate of completion
in case you're interested you can find a
link in the video description and if not
that's perfectly fine continue watching
as the next section is coming up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
