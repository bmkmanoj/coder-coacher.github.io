object with an initial coordinate now
what do you thin our program you want to
have this rule such that when we
initialize a point object we should not
be able to change the X or Y values with
this implementation I can always come
here and set point dot X to a different
value how can we avoid this sometimes we
need this feature in our programs
because it will make them more
predictable it reduces the chance for
bugs so how should we prevent the
coordinate of this point object to
change after it's initialized well in
object-oriented languages we have this
concept called
access modifiers an access modifier is
basically a keyword that we can apply to
a member of a class to control its
access from the outside so in typescript
we have three access modifiers public
private and protected public and private
are the most common and by default all
members are public let me show you what
I mean so here in our point class we
have three members right we have two
fields and one method so let me create a
pointer object and type point dot look
these are the members of the class and
because they are all public we can
access them here and that's why we can
see them in the intelligence however I
can go here and prefix this field with
the private key word now once we create
this point object if I type point dot
look X is not in the list it's not
accessible it's private so if we try to
set point at X 2 3 look we have a
compilation error in typescript it says
property X is private and only
accessible within class point now with
this technique I can go here and apply
the private keyword on the Y field as
well and now once I initialize a point
object I can no longer change is quite
innate I can only call the draw method
ok so this is why we
access modifiers to control access to
certain members of a class from the
outside you can apply these access
modifiers on field properties and
methods now by default if you don't set
an access modifier is assumed to be
public so here the draw method as you
know is public I can also add the public
keyword here but this is redundant it's
just making my code noisy so you don't
really need to add this it's better to
keep your code short and clean and use
the private access modifier only when
you need to next I'm gonna show you one
of my favorite features of typescript
around access modifiers hi thank you for
