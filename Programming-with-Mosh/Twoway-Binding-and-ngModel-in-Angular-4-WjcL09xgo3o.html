lecture it works what we could do better
what I don't like about this
implementation is passing this email
parameter or argument around in
object-oriented languages where we have
the concept of objects we shouldn't
really pass parameters around because an
object encapsulate some data and some
behavior so if an object or a class have
all the data it needs we don't have to
pass parameters around this kind of code
we have here is what we refer to as
procedural programming if the kind of
code we used to write 30 years ago
before we had object-oriented
programming languages so imagine if we
had a field here called email then we
wouldn't have to pass this email around
and here we could simply log this good
email so you can see our metal has no
parameters and this is cleaner easier to
read easier to understand and easier to
maintain also going back to the
definition of a component in angular
remember a component encapsulate the
data the logic and the HTML markup
behind a view here the email field is
used to encapsulate the data and the on
key op method represents the behavior or
the logic behind this view and of course
here is our HTML template now how do we
get here
well first of all we don't need this
template variable anymore so delete also
we're not going to pass that here so our
code is a little bit cleaner now now
earlier you learn about property binding
so we can bind the value property of
this input object in the Dom so this
email field right and now if I
initialize this let's say me at
example.com let me load this page the
input field should be populated with
this email address so look we've got me
at example.com however if I change this
to domain comm and press enter now in
the console look we got me at
example.com so how come
didn't get me at domain.com because with
property binding the direction of
binding is from the component to the
view so if the value of this email field
changes at some point in the future the
view will be notified and this input
field will be automatically updated now
what we need here is a slightly
different kind of binding we want a
binding that works in two ways from
component to the view and from the view
to the component so if you type
something in the input box we want this
email field to be updated let me show
you one way to implement this and of
course this is not the best way but I'm
going to show you a better way in just a
few seconds so with this value property
binding we have one direction from
component to the view for the other
direction we can modify this expression
here so instead of directly calling the
unque up method first we can set email
to dollar event dot target dot value
then semicolon and then call the unque
up method so what I want you to pay
attention to here is that for the value
of event binding you can write any
expression so here we have two
statements one for setting the email
field and the other to call the uncute
method now let's try this code SAVE back
in the browser so we've got me at
example.com and I'm going to change this
to domain comm now enter look in the
console we got me at domain.com
beautiful so with this implementation we
have two-way binding but as you can
imagine this is the kind of feature that
we may need frequently in a lot of
application we don't want to write all
this repetitive code is there a better
way of course there is in angular we
have a special syntax for implementing
two-way binding so let me duplicate this
line so you can see the difference
instead of using property binding on the
value of property we use the two-way
binding syntax which includes square
brackets and parentheses
now if this syntax is complicated or you
may forget it I give you a tip this is
called banana in a box so this is a
banana and this is a box so banana in a
box
now instead of value you bind to
ng-model what is this
well our Dom objects are input gum
object-- doesn't have a property called
ng model so this is something that
angular adds to this Dom object earlier
you saw ng for remember ng for is a
directive and we use directives to
manipulate the Dom so in angular we have
another built-in directive called
ng model that is used for implementing
two-way binding so this implementation
we have here is encapsulated in a
generic way inside a directive called ng
model and with this we don't have to
repeat this code every time so then we
can simplify this expression we can
delete this statement and in key opted
enter we simply call the on key op
method now look the second line is
obviously cleaner shorter and easier to
understand so here's the lesson whenever
you want to use two-way binding use the
banana in a box in tags and bind to the
ng model property now let's try this
save all right we got this error can't
bind to engine model since it is an
unknown property of input that's a
familiar error isn't it so basically our
input object doesn't have a property
called ng model it's something that
angular adds here but why are we getting
this error angular framework consists of
several different modules in every
module you have a bunch of building
blocks that are highly related you have
components directives and pipes and
these are highly related now not every
application needs all the modules in
angular because when you bring all these
modules you increase the code size so
this engine model directive is defined
in one of the modules called forms and
by default this is not imported into
your application
so if you want to use engine model or if
you want to build any kind of form you
need to explicitly import this module
how do we do that
very easy so let's go to app module with
command and P or control P we go to app
code module now look at this
ng module decorator here we have a
property called import that is set to an
array in this array we have browser
module browser module is one of the
built-in modules of angular and it
brings some features that almost every
browser application needs and here we
need to add another module the forms
module so on the top so look this is
where we are importing the browser
module let's import forms module from
add angular
/ forms so let's define in this library
and then we can import it into our main
app module so forms module save back in
the browser all right we've got me at
example.com and then I'm going to change
this to domain comm enter look at the
console and here's me at domain calm
