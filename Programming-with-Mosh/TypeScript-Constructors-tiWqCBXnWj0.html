from the last lecture I simply remove
the method get distance because we're
not going to use it later in this
section so here on the top we define a
point class and then below that we
initialize a point object now this code
is a little bit verbose because we have
three lines to create a point object and
put it in a valid State what if this
point object had a few other properties
that we had to initialize like this and
maybe a few more here
is there a cleaner way absolutely so let
me delete this first all right
in object-oriented programming languages
we have this concept called constructor
so every class can have a constructor
which is basically a method that is
called when we create an instance of
that class so let me show you how it
works in the class I'm gonna add a
method the name of this method is
constructor this is a reserved keyword
in typescript now this method can have
parameters so X which is a number and Y
which is also a number and then here in
this method we can initialize these
fields so what should we write here this
Delta X we set it to this X argument
that we get here and similarly this that
Y we set it to Y now look we got the
compilation error here because when
creating a new point object we need to
supply these values look at the error
supply parameters do not match any
signature of call target so here we need
to supply the values for X and y 1 and 2
and with this we can simplify this code
and get rid of these two extra lines and
here's the end result now what if
somewhere else in our program we don't
know the initial coordinate of a point
in other words what if I want to create
a point object without setting these
values is that possible yes absolutely
but it's a little bit different from how
you have seen that in other languages
like C sharp and Java in
sharp we can have multiple constructors
in typescript we can't so the solution
for this is to make these parameters
optional so here after X I add a
question mark and that makes X optional
and similarly Y should be optional as
well because once you make it parameter
optional all the other parameters on the
right side of that parameter should also
be optional this is a rule by typescript
and a lot of other programming languages
so now look we don't have a compilation
error when creating a point object
without initial values hi thank you for
