okay object initializers in the last
lecture we learned about constructors
you know that we use a constructor to
initialize an object and put it in an
early State in c-sharp there is also
another way to initialize an object and
that is using an object initializer an
object initializer is simply as syntax
or quickly initializing an object
without the need to call one of its
constructors what do you need that
simply to avoid creating multiple
constructors let me show you an example
imagine we have this person class with a
bunch of fields now this is a very
simple example we only have four fields
here in a real world application you
might have a few more fields now with
this class if you want to create
constructors for initializing various
fields we may end up with a class like
this
as you see here I have four constructors
the first one takes only an ID the
second one takes an ID and a first name
the third one takes an ID with first
name and last name and so on so you see
there are so many different combinations
and this is what we used to do in
c-sharp before object initializers were
introduced so as you see writing code
like that is messy and easily becomes
out of control so object initializer
came to solve this problem with an
object initializer we don't need any of
these constructors we can simply
initialize a person object like this
no these curly braces here I'm not
calling one of the constructors of the
person class
you see here is what we call object
initialization syntax so basically you
specify the name of properties and
assign them some initial value
note that behind a scene when you
initialize an object like this the
default or parameterless constructor is
going to be called and then any
properties you set here are going to be
initialized so with this way we can
reserve constructors for scenarios where
we really need to use them as I
explained in the last lecture so an
object cannot behave without being
passed some initial values
that's pretty much what you need to know
about object initialization syntax in
the next lecture we'll take a closer
look at our methods and their parameters
I hope you enjoyed this lecture and
thank you for watching
hi guys ma chere I hope you're having a
fantastic day or night wherever you are
in the world this tutorial you have been
watching is actually part of one of my C
sharp courses where you will learn
everything about classes interfaces and
object-oriented programming in case
you're interested to enroll in the full
course I've put the link for you in the
video description and if not that's
perfectly fine
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
