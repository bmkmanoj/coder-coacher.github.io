exciting interview with Mark price the
CEO of dev slopes company dev slopes
teaches people how to code on guided
learning paths they have a number of
high quality courses on iOS and Android
development mark has built over 50
mobile apps and he has worked with big
companies like IBM Logitech and Call of
Duty
so it's mark hi mark
a mush thanks thanks for having me thank
you for joining us so I'm really excited
to have you here because you are a
self-taught programmer and I have a lot
of students who are self-taught
programmers or want to become
programmers so I wanted to take your
advice I want to hear your story how did
you get started so tell me what's your
story how did you become interested in
programming yeah so it's actually a
really interesting story I became a
programmer without even knowing it
actually I worked at a drug testing
company where people would come in like
to our office and we would test them for
illegal drugs and sometimes we would
have like 3,000 people come in in one
day and we were filling out paperwork by
hand their names like having them do
signatures and a whole bunch of other
things every single time and and we
would spend like sometimes five minutes
per person and the line would be out the
door and down the street and it was
awful and so I was like I can't do this
anymore so I was looking online out like
what can I do there was no software and
so I heard about this thing called
Microsoft Access and I was like oh well
this looks like it might do what I need
and so I started building it out like
with the drag-and-drop and but I
couldn't get me where I needed to go so
I was like crap what do I do
and and then I learned that you could
customize things with something called
VBA Visual Basic for applications and I
was like I was like I'll just do that
and so I actually built out this entire
database which when it when it was done
it actually processed somebody in about
15 seconds and it would it would they
would put their thumbprint on a thumb
print reader it would sink to Microsoft
Access it would print out a label with
their name and information on a digital
signature and and then get him through
and so I did that and it was it was
amazing I didn't even know I was
programming at that point and then all
of a sudden people wanted to start
paying me to build the same system for
their drug testing companies I started
doing that and I was like what what is
this and so I started doing research and
stuff and like this is like programming
like oh this is really cool and and so
you know that's kind of where I got
started and never looked back since then
I was like back in 2007 2007 so you
never had this aspiration of becoming a
professional program you just naturally
ended up in that industry yeah his is
strange it's just what happened yeah Wow
Wow
that's awesome because what I when I was
a kid I always wanted to become a
programmer oh really
yeah opposite of your story so I used to
play a lot of video games and my dream
back then was to build a video game the
way I wanted it to look like you know
pictures from a kid I have never come
across someone who worked in a
completely different industry and then
gradually they found this passion for
programming and then at some point
becoming a professional programmer and
building like 50 apps so yeah great
achievement so how did you at what point
did you start to think about doing this
outside that drug testing company and
pursuing it as a career
yeah so what happened was I was so I was
doing that and I had talked with
somebody I knew who our company had paid
to build some solutions he was a.net
developer built out this entire
web-based solution so I asked him for
advice on paths or what I should do and
he gave me some advice like in his path
was like you know learn learn sequel
server and dotnet and all this stuff it
didn't really interest me all that much
but then the very that very year
Apple launched the App Store and that
could change everything because I saw
news articles where somebody made like a
fart hat made a million dollars and then
somebody made some other stupid app and
made a million dollars I was like oh my
gosh this is what I want to do I want to
make a million dollars and and so I just
started pumping out apps I started
learning like crazy just book after book
after book and like night and day I
remember I would work my full-time job
before I was able to quit like till like
6:00 p.m. and then from like 6:00 p.m.
to like midnight I'd be studying and
coding and studying and coding and you
know and so it was
the launch of the App Store that really
got me excited and motivated into the
future and you know from then on you
know that's that's all I've ever done is
is is basically engineered built apps
games everything in between and onward
enterprise stuff the whole time trying
to make my million dollars off off the
App Store mark what were your resources
you mentioned books did you take any
online courses did you attend any
classes any programs running by
universities or colleges there was
nothing man there was nothing at all
there was nothing it was it was all you
had available to you was books really at
all and so so yeah the the book that
really that really changed my life was
it was like like c-sharp 3.0
fundamentals by I think his name's Jack
Purdom I think and I read the book
through and it was like variables and
all these different things and I did it
was so hard to understand and so I
actually went right back and I went
through the whole book again this time I
was paying attention to every word
because I I've always been a speed
reader I've been into I have a business
type of mind not an analytical type of
mind and I'm more of a creative and so
III learned I was like oh my gosh with
programming you can't speed read you
can't skip words every detail matters
for the second time through the book I
read every word carefully like what does
this mean what does a variable mean like
what what is actually happening but you
know and once I did that things things
started to click and and make sense but
there was nothing of chatrooms I
couldn't I mean maybe I was just not
good at finding it but you know I might
go find it sometimes I find like an IRC
chatroom for something where somebody
might give me some advice here and there
but it was it was just so it was so hard
I had no friends doing this stuff and
the worst part though was when I finally
got my first job like this was before
boot camps and all these other things
started happening I remember like my
fellow engineer swallowed two CS degrees
they I mean they would make fun of me
they'd be like why are you here like you
didn't even you didn't even go to school
and they would actually say that to me
and I was like man what am I doing here
like so I started like having all these
doubts and stuff and but I was I was
keeping up with them I just maybe didn't
stands some of the things like one guy
made fun of me like it was my own boss
he made fun of me because I didn't know
what a what a Turing machine was I'd
never heard of Alan Turing and he
thought that was Ben's if he's like
everyone teaches that at universities
that's disgusts me that you don't know
what that is and I don't know I'm fixing
the bugs though isn't that cool and
anyway so like literally there was there
was nothing no help or anything it was
just it was me in the books in lots of
late nights I I love that passion and
determination because look I I have a
lot of students and there are
self-taught programmers so they take my
courses and sometimes they have
questions and due to high number of
students I'm not always able to answer
your questions I try to but it's like a
full-time job on its own and I need to
clone up myself so to get us in parallel
working to answer all these questions so
what is your advice how did you when you
had questions and you didn't have anyone
to help you how did you manage to get
through these obstacles and go to the
next step yeah I think there's a I think
there's a point where your brain wants
to tell you that you can't do this or
maybe you get fret everyone gets
pressured I got frustrated right it was
like I can't I can't figure this out but
like I literally didn't have anybody and
so I would tell myself I would say well
if other people are doing this like I
have to be able to get there like I know
I'm really mad right now I'm frustrated
but like if other people are doing this
I can do this like I would just tell
myself that because you know I see
people doing the things that I want to
do and I don't have the skills for it
yet but they're doing it so like I'm not
stupid you know I I tell myself that I'm
not dumb like I can learn I could figure
it out and and so you know that was
enough for me personally like at least
not to give up to say like I can't do
this because the thing I wanted to do I
couldn't do yet but I had to get there I
had to do it and so I remember I
remember like I would be posting like
crazy this I mean I'm not even sure
Stack Overflow was around at this time I
mean I'd be posting on random websites
and stuff and they weren't even iOS it
wasn't even iOS stuff it might have been
like a c-sharp or whatever but I was
like guys you know this is related to
maybe iOS or something like this but I'm
struggling here and they would actually
lend me their
even its though it's a different
programming language like I would start
to pick up bits and pieces like oh I
kind of understand that now and so like
you know so there was a few times when I
was able to post somewhere online but it
was just mostly reading much like
reading on forums and websites until I
found the answer
I just didn't stop I didn't stop until I
found the answer because I just I had a
goal I just I wanted to succeed and so
but I understand the frustration it
comes no matter what and you sometimes
you want to die like I remember
Objective C man going from C sharp to
Objective C as a brand new programmer
like because I started with C sharp you
know and when I hit Objective C I wanted
to die I was like I can't even read this
this is insane this is insane
whereas now it's so funny cuz I can
literally translate Swift to Objective C
on the fly like like an interpreter
interpreting a language for somebody I
can do that for Objective C now where's
before like I wanted to die so is lots
of searching and in reading so these
days we have so many resources and I
don't accept any excuses from anyone
saying that the right resources to learn
when I started programming we didn't
even have Google there was no Google
back then my program had the but I
started with C programming so the you
know pointers yeah stuff like the ice I
was awake 2 3 or 4 a.m. in the morning
looking at every spot in the memory
every bite yeah numbers writing on a
piece of paper making sure I've got the
right data in the right location in
memory nowadays you just go on Google
just copy/paste the error message you
get from your compiler or at one time
the first link is on Stack Overflow yeah
yeah well it's it's funny now too
because like that's we have a chat room
right and like we've had over a hundred
thousand students in this chatroom I
mean it's funny cuz they'll come in and
everyone's helping them and give me
answers and then they'll be like it'll
be like mark give me this answer right
now and I'll say well go check it out
and Stack Overflow here here's a good
thing to search yeah they like call me a
jerk or something and it's just funny
like I mean I'll figure out a way to
help them but my point is like I didn't
have anything I didn't have any of that
stuff and and now I
you know it's so over inundated that
like you know it's almost people want
stuff delivered I got their fingertips
like for all the answers and stuff yeah
and but none of that existed none of
that existed even just like you know
seven years ago it was so it's just
funny mark I'm curious about something
you you started in a drug testing
company and then you pursued programming
as some kind of like a side job and then
eventually as a career a lot of people
in the same boat their challenge is when
they apply for a job on their resume
they don't have enough work experience
and a lot of companies say you should
have minimum one year or two year
experience what is your advice for
people like that so it can be tough I'm
the first job I mean I'll admit the
first job is this is the hardest job my
first job was the hardest job I had been
Pro so I had been programming for six
months before I I started applying to
like full-time jobs to do this and and I
applied to about probably and at keep in
mind this but at this point like I was
really I loved the game side of things
so I was doing a lot with games so I
wanted to become a game developer so I
applied to like 30 companies and then
one company like in Arizona and I was I
was in Utah at the time so that's this
drive is like a 10 hour drive away they
responded to me and and like I said I
said I was I was not an expert I said
you know I was a junior to intermediate
level even though I was probably more
like at the sucky level but that's what
I said in the resume because I believed
I believed that I could be the person
that they wanted me to be like III
didn't I didn't feel like I was lying to
anybody I felt like I could be the
person that they wanted me to be because
because sometimes when you're in the
situation you'll do what you got to do
to get the job done and so I I drove
down there I drove ten hours and they
thought I lived locally in Arizona
because like they were looking for local
candidates and I didn't want to tell
them I'm in Utah so I drove down there
like can you be there can you be here
like tomorrow I was like I was like sure
no no problem
and so I drove this 10 hours and I
loaded up all these they weren't pod I
guess they're podcast but there was
there was these these audio things for
like programming but it was like really
like high levels
stuff like like the most expert level of
computer science theory things like that
that you know I found them unlike some
universities I was listening to that the
whole way and my wife was at least I was
having her read read out of some iPhone
development books and stuff for me on
the way down like just trying to prep
for this and when I got there you know I
had already been rejected a bunch of
times keep that in mind all the like
this is like my 30th job application
right and so I go down there and I was
just like I was hoping I was praying I
was like just let me let me have an
interview where I can just show my
skills like and and so I go there and
they had this game idea and they said
okay mark we're gonna give you six hours
we're gonna leave you alone let's see
how far you get I was like oh my gosh
thank you so much and so I built out
this game it was in unity3d
and they hired me they hired me and once
you're in you're in
I got so good so fast cuz I had to build
out this thing all by myself I was the
only only game programmer there everyone
else was artists and and and anyway my
point is I applied to like 30 jobs I
finally got into one and they liked me
they liked my personality a lot that has
a big a lot of people think it's all
about the code it's not all about the
code okay like like a lot of people
actually would rather hire somebody with
a personality and ability to learn over
a guy who's a big jerk who's really
smart like I said that is very very true
so they liked me a lot and I got in and
that's there was no look jobs were easy
after that point but that first one
that's that's how I got it
so mark from everything you have told me
in in this interview I see a pattern I
don't want to ask a question and I I
think I know the answer ahead of time
but I want to hear it from you and then
I will tell my audience if my guess was
right or not so if you have one golden
advice for people who want to pursue
programming professionally what would it
be it would it would be that you have to
like literally an investor invest your
life into it so you know I mean I've
students mocchi of students in and you
kind of see these these patterns but the
students that that succeed that I work
with that go to work at places like
Google and such these are the guys that
are just killing themselves or they're
they're losing sleep they're losing
their sleep they are working their butts
off
and then I get the other people who are
like well mark I'm learning but you know
I've got a family I've got you know I've
got kids and it's really hard I got to
support them and luckily I'm able to say
this without being a jerk but so did I I
had I had two kids when I was learning I
had a full-time job and I literally I
had never really had caffeine in my life
until that point in time like I didn't
because what I end up starting having to
do is get up Austin edition staying up
late I would get up before I am 40 or
straight I got up at 4:00 a.m. to study
because I just wasn't I wasn't getting
where I needed to be I was scared of
losing my job and all these different
things and so I literally started
drinking like energy drinks to give me
the sum of something has to be
sacrificed whether it's your sleep or
it's your time with your family which
which I didn't want to give that up and
so for me it was the sleep and if if
you're not willing to sacrifice then
you're gonna make really slow progress
so that'd be my advice is you you you
code every single day study every single
day and there has to be sacrificed in
there if you do it casually everyone
else is gonna is gonna win the race
they're gonna get the job that you don't
get you know that's been my experience
at least yeah so what I wanted to say is
what I see in you is determination with
determination anyone can get anything
whether that's programming or anything
else I have a t-shirt that has three
things four things here it says code
teak eat teak sleep cross repeat yeah
yeah wow very inspirational so mark tell
us about your coding school dev slopes
yeah so I was teaching at a boot camp so
I I I was working at an engineering
company where next door was a boot camp
when the boot camp started getting real
hot and exciting and these teachers
these engineers were teaching and they
were just were so bad like these poor
like they'd come on and I was watching
him the engineer he was teaching he's
got like all these shortcuts on his
keyboard he's typing away he's like just
do this and this and this he's pressing
tab and like all this magics happening
on the screen and I'm like dude I was
like dude stop you gotta stop and I was
like I went to the CEO I was like this
is not gonna work this is people are not
gonna come to your school this is crazy
and says let me teach they didn't know
me like let me teach like let me they
didn't know
my skills or anything like that let me
teach and so I taught and my classes
were the highest attended classes with
the highest the highest job placement
rates
um because I just kind of understood the
pain like I went through that pain
myself and so I was like this is great
and and then I was like well I want to
make this online I can reach so much
more people and it was kind of this this
really fun project-based YouTube style
way of learning and I approached the CEO
and I said hey let's do this online too
and they told me no he's like I just you
know he told me there's no future and
like online education which I thought
was real funny and so I was like fine
and so I had this idea of creating a
company that could teach people how to
code but I wanted to make sure that I
wasn't crazy and that it would work and
so I I took my very first course which
was iOS 9 and and I built it out the way
that I wanted to on this guided learning
path and then I put on you to me and it
became the fastest growing iOS internet
or iOS 9 course on the Internet
and then everything changed from there
and so we started building out I started
building out tons of courses than I am I
reinvested all the money back into
employees and growing the company and
now you know we have over two hundred
and thirty thousand students across
multiple channels and and we are
literally furthest company when is that
we you said in September of 2015 so in
two years in just over two years you
have reached over 200,000 students yeah
yeah and it's been amazing it's it's
been really cool we have we just have a
really tight-knit community of
especially on the mobile side of
developers chat rooms that we do live
streams a whole bunch of other cool
things like that and it's it's it's very
it's a very fun exciting type of
community and and it's growing and and
I'm passionate about it because it's
it's really fun helping people succeed
you know an infinite amount of like
success stories that just keep on coming
it's it's really cool all right I do a
lot of salsa dancing and the other night
I was out in a salsa club in LA and
before before I got there I was on the
street and somebody said hi to me and my
girlfriend said
I went into club and then he he said
your Marsh
aren't you I said yeah he said man you
helped me get a job so he watched my
Dameron form of course and that is so
awesome better to see him I said let's
take a picture together
I haven't actually put that on Twitter
yet forgot about it so it's amazing to
see how we help people and get go from
one job to another I had a guy sending
me an email saying he was a security
guard and then by watching my c-sharp
course as he got his first junior
programmer job so that's so awesome it
was great yeah yeah that's great mark
you said you have some kind of promotion
going on for your coding school what is
I
yeah so what's really cool is like two
years ago when when I got the actual
company started with employees we did a
Kickstarter and it was actually the
highest funded software project on
Kickstarter ever we raised two hundred
thousand dollars and we at the time we
sucked at marketing like it literally
had a lot of energy around it and you
know we gave basically we didn't have
the platform built yet we have this
platform we actually can learn to code
on the platform interactive and stuff
for iOS Mac TV OS Windows Android and
but it none of it had been built yet and
so we offered lifetime access to all of
our current courses which were on you to
me at the time and all of our future
courses so that was two years ago and so
for like two years straight my students
have been begging me please please
please can you do lifetime access one
more time just one more time we love you
this is amazing and so we finally
decided to do we've been prepping it the
last few months and then just November
first we launched it and we're basically
offering lifetime access every course we
have right now we have we have about 45
to 50 courses right now every course we
have right now in every future course we
will ever make you get access to you
make a one-time payment and you get
access to everything all those future
features as well - and access to our
private slack room where we give you
one-on-one help we have video chat and
and all those things so this this goes
till November 31st and then it's gone
has gone forever is a guest one-time
thing a lot of excitement and we just
actually
they added a stretch goal to where it's
been going really well and so we had a
goal worth 150 new people get it and
think we're at like almost 20 now we're
giving everybody an Amazon echo dot with
a three hour a three hour Alexa training
course which I'm excited about as well
too so so that's the promotion and it's
it's something really fun and exciting
we didn't we didn't do it for us we did
it for them
just it's we just have you know you you
would know Mashti we just had this these
fans like these these people who just
love what we're doing and teaching and
feel committed because we were able to
help them and and so so that's what it
is that's and that's going on at dead
slopes calm slash lifetime - access
lifetime awesome awesome well thank you
very much for joining us today we really
enjoyed hearing your story and your
advice about how to start from zero and
go to zero
yeah thank you thanks for having me
awesome thank you Mark and have a great
day
