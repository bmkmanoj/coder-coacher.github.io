of my absolute favorite topics
in this section I'm going to talk about
what is an interface how to declare and
implement interfaces and then I will
explain how interfaces improve the
testability and extensibility of your
application
so what is an interface an interface is
a language construct that is similar to
class in terms of syntax but it's
fundamentally different let's take a
look at the syntax first
so here is how we can declare an
interface
instead of using the class keyword we
use the interface keyword and note that
in dotnet all interfaces start with the
letter I so wherever you see a type that
starts with I that represents an
interface it's a convention
but unlike classes interfaces do not
have implementation so you see here we
have a method called calculate that is
simply a declaration it doesn't have a
body it doesn't have curly braces
also note that interface members do not
have access modifiers so here we don't
have public private protected whatever
now you may wonder why do we need to
construct like that well in simple terms
interfaces are used to build loosely
coupled applications that is an
application whose components are not
tightly related to each other
which means making a change in one of
these components is easier and has less
or zero impact on other components
let me use an analogy think of the
concept of a restaurant and a chef we
can say a restaurant needs a chef with
certain capabilities by that definition
we can fill that role with anyone anyone
who has those capabilities can fill the
role of the chef for that restaurant so
the dependency between the restaurant
and the chef is loose
if something happens to that chef like
he gets seek or it decides to move on to
a different job we can fill that role
with someone else now in contrary if we
said a restaurant needs John as a chef
that means we are very dependent on John
if something happens to John if he
decides to not to come to work and the
restaurant is in trouble so this is a
definition of a tightly coupled
dependency the restaurant is tightly
coupled tightly related tightly
dependent on John now I use this analogy
to explain that when building software
we want for classes or our components to
be loosely related or dependent on each
other so if we decide to make a change
in one of these classes it has minimal
or zero impact in other classes
take a look at this picture here we have
two classes order processor and tax
calculator in this UML diagram you see a
dependency as demonstrated here between
order processor and tax calculator
in c-sharp terms that means order
processor has a filled or a property
that is of type tax calculator
now this is an example of tight coupling
between oral processor and tax
calculator if we make it change to these
tax calculator here it may affect order
processor and subsequently any of the
classes that depend on order processor
now we use interfaces to reduce this
coupling how well we can change this
picture to something like this
so instead of order processor being
dependent on tax calculator is going to
be dependent on an interface that is I
tax calculator
an interface as you saw earlier is
simply a declaration it's not a concrete
class it doesn't have code its methods
do not have a body
so as long as we keep that interface the
way it is as in like we are not gonna
remove any of its methods or change its
parameters it's not going to have any
impact on the order processor
now if we decide to change the algorithm
for calculation of tax we can create
different classes that implement this
interface here and that would have
absolutely no impact on order processor
if that concept is new to you don't
worry about it I'm going to show you
exactly how it works in code interfaces
are extremely powerful and once you
really understand them you're gonna fall
in love with them
of this section I'm going to explain how
interfaces help improving the
testability and extensibility of your
application so thank you for watching
and I'll see you in the next lecture
hi guys Marsh here I hope you're having
a fantastic day or night wherever you
are in the world this tutorial you have
been watching is actually part of one of
my C sharp courses where you will learn
everything about classes interfaces and
object-oriented programming in case
you're interested to enroll in the full
course I've put the link for you in the
video description and if not that's
perfectly fine
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
