my favorite part of this section so in
this section I'm going to show you a
performance problem I have created in
this application and then I will show
you how we can detect and fix this if
you want to follow the steps I'm doing
you can download this application from
the supplementary materials of this
lecture so when you extract the zip file
you want to npm install and then ng surf
so this is the same application we've
been working with in this section with a
few minor changes we've got this title
here and a new button to change the
title also in the list of movies now we
have 10,000 movies I deliberately added
a lot of objects to pronounce the
performance problem so you can see and
all these ones you see here are
properties of each movie object you will
see that in a second so let's go to app
component previously we initialize the
movie stills right here but I move that
in the constructor in a loop so we
create 10,000 movie objects and push
them into our array but each movie
object used to have only one property
which was title now we have 10
additional properties here so prop 1 to
prop 10 and I just set their value to 1
and if we go to the template for the
movie component you can see I'm
rendering all these additional
properties in a span again I have
deliberately done this to pronounce the
performance problem so let's see what's
going on here when I click this button
change title it's going to take several
seconds until the hello world title is
updated let's have a look look the
button still in the push state it's blue
and we are waiting and waiting and
waiting finally the title is updated so
it was really really slow so when you
have problems like that in your
application the first thing you need to
do is profiling
so we open up Chrome developer tools go
to the profiles tab
make sure the first option is selected
record JavaScript CPU profile and now we
start profiling record now we can get
back here and click our button to update
the title ok it's taking forever just
like before
alright done now back to our profiler
you've stopped profiling now in this
list make sure you have selective
heavy-bottomed off and then sort this
list by total time in a descending order
here we can see the total time spent for
various functions in our application a
lot of what you see here is internals of
angular that we don't really need to
worry about you want to focus on the
parts that are about our implementation
so for example they've got all these
functions like zone tasks that invokes
zone that run tasks and so on these are
internals of angular and zone J's
library but we don't have to worry about
it now if you scroll down
you see this log function with a total
time of 6,000 milliseconds allocated to
it this is our console log so a lot of
times we throw these console logs into
code and we have no idea that they can
have a negative impact on the
performance of our application in this
case if you look at movie components you
can see we're calling console log in ng
do check which is called pretty
frequently so this is very very
dangerous the first thing I'm going to
do is to comment this out now log aside
let's look at other stuff happening here
so once again we go from top of the list
look at every function if it's about the
internals of an angular we ignore it
otherwise you want to take a closer look
at it so you scroll down here
first thing that catches my eye is this
function here underlined vo underline
app component underline how's that
detect changes diagnosis detect changes
here so let me zoom out
okay hopefully you can see now but the
font is a little bit too small so app
component host detect changes and the
total time for this function is about
8,000 milliseconds so this tells me that
the View for app component has a
performance problem all right let's go
to app start component on HTML what do
we have here we have a binding
expression to render the title and we
have a reference to the movies component
now let's take a look at a template for
the movies component so movies that HTML
again here we have a reference to
another component the movie component so
back in apps that component on HTML
basically we have a subtree here we have
this movies component which includes
10,000 more component instances and this
is exactly the source of our problem why
do we have to go through all this change
detection when we are only updating the
title of app component we haven't
modified anything about movies but as I
explained before the default change
detection strategy looks at the template
for every component in our component
tree look at all this binding
expressions get all the properties used
there and compare they're all value with
the new value we don't want all this to
happen when you're only changing the
title of the app component so I believe
we can solve this problem by using the
unpretty
under movies component this way if the
input to this component in this case
this movies object is not modified if
you still the same reference angular is
not going to run change detection and
this component and all its children
which includes ten thousand movies so
let's go to the movies component movies
the TF
you can see the change detection is set
to default so whether we had this line
or not it didn't make a difference I'm
going to change this to on push now we
should make sure that the movies objects
that we pass through this component is
an immutable object so change detection
works properly so we go back to app
components
these are movies object which is just a
plain array I'm going to use an
immutable list from immutable library so
instead of pushing this objects directly
into this movies field I'm going to push
them into this temporary array I've
declared here now at the end of this
constructor we can set this movies field
to a list and initialize it with this
movies array you have a compilation
error because the type of this movies is
a plain JavaScript array so I'm going to
remove this I have to clarify something
earlier in this section when you're
working with this click handler we use
the unpressed strategy and the movie
component but in this application that I
have attached to this lecture I have
removed the unpressed rata G on the
movie component so I was assuming that
all components are using the default
change detection strategy in this
application because the source of the
issue is on the change detection of this
movies component I only applied the
unrestrained this component itself that
any of these children not the movie
component that's not really required all
right now with these simple changes
let's test the application again
so I'm going to click this button and
the title is updated immediately see the
difference
previously it took several seconds now
let's go back to Chrome developer tools
I'm going to do another profiling
session so record back here click the
button and stop the profiling session
now
compare the results this time I'm gonna
sort by function
now in this list let's scroll down we
want to look at functions that start
with underlined view so here we have
underlined view underlined add component
we only have two functions that match
this pattern the full name of this
function as you saw earlier is
underlined view underline app component
does detect changes note the total time
spent on this function eight
milliseconds this is after the
optimization now let's go back to our
first profile find the same function and
look at the total time so profile one
once again we're gonna sort by function
scroll down look it's got so many
functions that match the pattern
underline view underline app component
underline view under the movie component
and underline you underline movies
components
so you can see our change detection is
going a lot deeper in our component tree
it's not just at the app component level
now that is like look at the total time
spend unchanged the texture in app
component it's almost eight thousand
milliseconds and we reduce that to how
many milliseconds eight milliseconds so
in your applications if you have
performance problems that are related to
detecting changes this is how you find
and fix them now one last thing before
we finish this lecture in this lecture I
started by looking at the template for
app components I notice that here we are
referencing the movies components then I
had to look at the template for movies
component and see if they're using other
components there you can imagine this
can be tedious and complex in a larger
real world application so let me show
you a tool that helps you visualize your
component tree and this is very useful
when you want to decide where to apply
the unput strategy so in google search
for augury Chrome extension this is a
great tool for debugging angular apps
built by R + L dot IO so simply add this
to your Chrome and once you restart it
you get a new tab in chrome developer
tools so back here when I open up the
chrome developer tools you'll see I have
a new tab
here augury
but here on the left
opponent tree so we've got app component
on the top under that we've got movies
component and 10,000 movie components
