node is the HTTP module that we use for
creating networking applications for
example we can create a web server that
listens for HTTP requests on a given
port and with this we can easily create
a back-end service for our client
applications like a web application that
we build with react or angular or a
mobile application running on a mobile
device so once again back in the note
documentation and the list of modules we
can find this HTTP module in this module
you can see various classes like HTTP
that agent HTTP that client request and
so on each of this classes has a bunch
of properties methods and events so back
in vs code let's load the HTTP module so
constant HTTP we set it to require HTTP
okay now here we can call HTTP dot
create server this is one of the
functions defined in this module and
with this we can create a web server so
let's store the result in a server
object now what is interesting is that
this server is an event emitter so it
has all the capabilities of event
emitter that you saw earlier in this
section so look server dot we have the
on method or add listener or omit and so
on also if you look at the documentation
for the HTTP module on this page you can
see HTTP that's server class here the
documentation says that this class
inherits from net dot server so this is
another class defined in the net module
let's have a look now here the
documentation says that net the server
is an event emitter so that's why I said
a bunch of nodes core functionality is
based on if an emitter
so back to our server object now we can
call server that listen and give it a
port let's say port 3000 now following
that I'm gonna add a console deadlock
saying listening on port 3000 okay now
when we run this application this server
will listen on port 3000 as I told you
before every time there is a new
connection or new request this server
raises an event so we can use the own
method to handle that event so before
listening we run a register a listener
or a handler so server dot on the name
of the event is connection then you can
find in the documentation so you don't
have to memorize any of these stuff okay
and the second argument is a callback
function or the actual listener as you
can see in the tool tip here is listener
is a function with one argument that is
socket of type socket class and it
returns void so here we have the arrow
function syntax in es6 so let's add an
error function that takes a socket and
goes to this code block now here we can
simply log something on the console new
connection now back in the terminal
let's run this application you can see
we're listening on port 3,000 now back
in the browser let's head over to
localhost port 3000 and now if you look
in the terminal you can see we have a
new connection here so you can see this
server object raises different kinds of
events that you can respond to now in
real world applications we are not going
to respond to the connection event to
build an HTTP service this is very low
level so let's delete this what we
commonly do is we pass a callback
function to this create server method so
function this function takes two
parameter
request and response or we can use the
error function syntax so we remove the
function keyword and add this fat arrow
here now in this function instead of
working with a socket we can work with
the actual request or response objects
so we can check if request that URL
equals slash then we can send something
to the client for example response dot
write hello world and then we end the
response okay now back in the terminal
we can exit here by pressing ctrl + C
and then run the application again okay
we're still listening on port 3000 let's
refresh this page so we got hello world
on the home page now if you want to
build a back-end service for our web or
mobile applications we need to handle
various routes here for example we can
have another if block if requested URL
equals slash API slash courses perhaps
here we want to return the list of
courses from the database so we would do
something like this response dot right
now here we want to return an array of
objects using JSON so we use JSON dot
stringify and give it an array of
objects now for simplicity here we don't
have to worry about the database or
complex objects let's just return an
array of numbers 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 so we pass this
to json dot stringify which will convert
this array into a string using JSON
syntax and then we'll write it to the
response and finally response good end
now back in the terminal we need to stop
this process again and run it one more
time now in the future I will show you
how we can automate this so every time
we make a simple change to our
application we don't have to restart it
so now back in the browser if we go to
slash API slash courses we get an array
with three numbers so as you see
building a web server we know it is very
easy now in the real world we are not
going to use this HTTP module to build a
back-end service for our application the
reason for this is because as you can
see here as we add more routes this code
gets more complex because we add all of
them in a linear way inside this
callback function so instead we use a
framework called Express which gives our
application a clean structure to handle
various routes internally the Express
framework is built on top of the HTTP
module in node
hi guys it's mash here thank you for
watching my know tutorial I just wanted
to let you know that this video you've
been watching is part of my complete
note course where you will learn
everything about node from the basic to
the advanced topics if you're serious
about learning node I highly recommend
you to enroll in my node course because
this is much faster than jumping from
one tutorial to another it saves you
time plus you're going to get a lot of
exercises that will prepare you for the
real work and also at the end of the
course you'll receive a certificate of
completion that you can provide your
current or future employer so if you
want to enroll click on the link in the
video description I hope to see you in
the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
