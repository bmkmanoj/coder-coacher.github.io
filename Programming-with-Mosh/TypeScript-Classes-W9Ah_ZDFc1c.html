interface to define the shape of a point
object but there is a problem with this
implementation in object-oriented
programming languages we have this
concept called cohesion which basically
means things that are related should be
part of one unit they should go together
this is what we call cohesion now back
to this example on the top we have used
an interface to define the shape of a
point object and below that we have a
standalone function and this is where we
have violated the cohesion principle so
the concept of drawing a point is highly
related to the structure of a point it
should not be a separate function now if
you're going to build a utility library
for working with points chances are
you're going to create another function
like get distance that calculates the
distance between two points so point a
of type point and point B of type point
and this goes to is code block again we
have violated the cohesion principle we
have two functions hanging in the air
separate from the point object since
these concepts are highly related they
should be part of one unit in
object-oriented languages we call that
unit a class so a class groups
properties and functions that are highly
related now in this implementation
unfortunately we cannot move these two
functions inside our interface because
interfaces are purely for declarations
they cannot include any implementation
in other words we cannot have the
algorithm for calculating the distance
between two points or drawing a point
inside this interface what we can do
instead is to add a function here a
function declaration so we're gonna have
a draw function that takes no parameters
and returns void which means it doesn't
return anything now you might be asking
why don't we have this point parameter
here because if all these
members X Y and draw are part of one
unit we don't need to pass x and y as
parameters to the draw function this
function can directly access these
properties x and y in the same unit so
we don't need this parameter here now in
interfaces as I said we cannot have
implementation we can only have the
signature of a function so with this
interface you're telling typescript
compiler that our point objects should
have two properties x and y and a
function called draw the implementation
of that is somewhere else so what should
we do now
to apply the cohesion principle here we
need to use a class instead of an
interface so on the top I'm going to
change the type to class and here I'm
gonna replace its comma with semicolon
so our point class has three members the
first two members are what we call
fields that we use for storing data and
the third member is a function now here
in this class we can have the actual
implementation of this draw function so
we can simply define it like this draw
and then add all that logic for drawing
a point now similarly we can have
another function get distance that
returns the distance between this point
and another point like this again all
that logic will end up here now with
this restructuring you can see that
everything about a point is in one unit
in one class so we have the coordinate
which includes x and y and two functions
draw and get distance now in
object-oriented programming terms we
refer to these members as fields and to
these functions as methods so when a
function is part of a class we call it a
method alright now with this new
implementation we don't want these two
functions hanging in the air so delete
this is a much better structure also
you're not gonna call draw a point like
this anymore so here's our point class
in the next lecture I'm gonna show you
how to create an object of this type and
call the draw method
