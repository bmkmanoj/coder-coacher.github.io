application for an imaginary organic
shop so here on the home page we have
master detail we can select a category
and see all the products in that
category you can add a product to our
shopping cart change the quantity and
the number of items in a shopping cart
gets updated in real time and here's our
shopping cart again here we can change
the quantity for each item and the total
price as well as the total number of
items in the shopping cart get updated
immediately if I open another tab and
add another product to our shopping cart
what we have on the shopping cart tab
gets updated automatically without me
having to refresh the page so all the
data we show to the user is in sync
everywhere in the application and this
is the beauty of a real-time application
now let's check out here we have a
shipping form and the summary of all the
products in our shopping cart and again
this summary gets updated as soon as I
make a change or a shopping cart in
another tab once we place this order it
will be visible to our admins so I'm an
admin user and I have this menu here
manage orders here we can see all the
orders in the application other users
will not see this page here so here we
have authentication and authorization as
an admin I can also manage the products
so here we have all the crud operations
we can quickly search for a product
you can sort the data resize the columns
or navigate to a different page these
are the patterns that you see in a lot
of real-world applications and in this
course you're going to learn how to
implement these patterns in your
applications
