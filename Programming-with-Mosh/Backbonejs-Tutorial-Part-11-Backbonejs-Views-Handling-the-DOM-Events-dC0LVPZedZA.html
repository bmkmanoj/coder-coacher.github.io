lecture in this section backbone videos
have two major responsibilities they
render the content and respond to events
raised by the Dom element or the model
so far you have seen how we can render
content using backbone views in this
lecture I'm going to show you how to
respond to advanced raised by the Dom
elements here we've got a basic view
called song view with the render method
that simply writes the title of the song
on the page let's say we would like to
add a bottom next to each song to give
the user the ability to listen to that
song we're going to call this listen
button so let's go ahead and make this
change in our render method
you
now let's create a handler for the click
event of this button
you
to handle events raised by the Dom
elements we use the events property
which is a hash of event names and their
associated handlers this is a clean and
declarative way to register handlers for
events here I'm telling backbone that if
something is click inside this view the
unclick method should be called which
currently logs a message to the console
ok now let's try it out
you
so this was the simplest way to handle
Dom events now let's take these to the
next level let's add another button next
to the listen button
you
I gave this part in a class because I
want to distinguish the click event
raised by the listen button from the
bookmark button so now we can declare a
click event specific for any element
with the bookmark class
note that we can use jQuery selectors to
filter elements that trigger the event
we could use an ID or attribute selector
here as well basically any selector that
you use when handling events with jQuery
works here
okay now let's see what happens
you
see what happened when I click the
bookmark button both are click handlers
were executed didn't we assign a
separate handler to the bookmark button
yes but this is completely expected
behavior let me explain what happened
here in our event hash both these click
events apply to the bookmark button
the first one is generic and applies to
any elements inside the views Dom
element the second one is specific to
the bookmark button so what happened
here is that both these event handlers
were attached to our bookmark button
this is one of the issues that you often
encounter when building real-world
applications there are two ways to
resolve this one is we can give our
generic click event a class to make it
specific to the listen button just like
how we did with the bookmark button this
is actually a good practice because your
code will end up being more consistent
and maintainable but there are times
that you would need a generic handler
for some reason in situations like this
we would like the event to be only
handled by one specific handler and not
propagated to other handlers so let me
show you how we can fix this
you
the ER argument is a standard jQuery
event which has a method called stop
propagation which we can use to stop the
event from being dispatched to any other
handlers in the chain
okay now let's try it again
so everything is working now as expected
so to handle dummy events we register
handlers for them in the events hash of
the view we can use jQuery selectors to
filter the elements that trigger the
given event in the next lecture we will
see how we can listen to the changes in
the model state this is useful when you
would like to refresh the view when the
model state changes thank you for
