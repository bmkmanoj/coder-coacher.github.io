application which most often you do
you'll need a persistent framework with
the persistence framework you'll be able
to load your objects from or save them
to a database now you can write this
persistence framework yourself using
plain a development classes like sequel
connection sequel command and sequel
data reader or you can use an existing
persistence framework but writing a
persistence framework from scratch is
very costly you'll have to write a lot
of stored procedures read the data using
a detachment objects and manually map
your data with tables and records to the
domain objects in your application and
this is where and the framework shines
and the framework is essentially a
persistence framework that frees you
from all this dirty work you no longer
have to write through procedures well in
most cases or manage database
connections or manually map the database
tables and records to your domain
objects entity framework takes care of
all of these for you and that's what I'm
going to teach you in this course in
this section I'm going to introduce you
to various course flows to build a model
using editing framework and then I'm
going to show you a demo of data base
pairs and code for so you get an idea of
the process just to let you know this
section is purely an introduction to
these workflows over the next few
sections I will cover each workflow in
detail so let's get started
in this section I'm going to show you
any defame work in action so you can
quickly get an idea of what it is like
to build a data access layer using any
framework as part of this section I'm
going to introduce you to various
workflows when using entity framework
that is database first code first and
model first by the end of this section
you will have a high-level understanding
of entity frameworks and then from next
section onwards we'll be covering the
details so let's get started
so there are three workflows to build a
domain model using any framework
database first code first and model
first we database first of course we
start through the database so we design
our tables using visual designers and
then have entity framework generate the
domain classes based on the database
this is the traditional approach that a
lot of developers have been doing for
years with code first
of course we start with the code so we
simply create our domain classes and
then have entity framework generate the
database for us this approach was
introduced in more recent years and is
still new to many developers and finally
we have the model first approach with
this approach we use a visual designer
in visual studio to model our classes
and their associations some kind of UML
diagram then based on this diagram and
the framework will generate the domain
classes and the database for us I
personally am NOT a fan of this approach
and I'm not going to explore it in this
course mainly because the visual
designer for modeling classes is very
poor and to be honest I have hardly seen
anyone building software that way so our
two main choices here are database first
and Costra now over the next two
lectures I will show you each of these
workflows in action and then I will give
you some guidelines about their
strengths and weaknesses of each
approach hi guys maash here thank you
for watching my video I just wanted to
let you know that this video you've been
watching it's part of my complete entity
framework course on udemy in this course
over almost 7 hours you will learn how
to use any framework to build a data
access layer for your applications I'm
going to teach you how to build a domain
model using both the database first and
the code first workflow you're going to
learn about code first migrations to
upgrade or downgrade your database
you're going to learn how to override
codes for conventions using data
annotations and fluent API you're going
to learn how to query data using link
both using query syntax and extension
methods I'm also going to talk about
eager loading lazy
loading and explicit loading you're
going to learn how to add update and
remove objects and along the way I'll
also talk about some of the best
practices when using anything works as
well as additional tools that help you
profile and troubleshoot your
applications if you're interested you
can get this course with a discount
using the link in the video description
all the best and have a great day
okay in this lecture I'm going to show
you database first work flow in action
sometimes start with creating a simple
table and then I will have entity
framework generate a domain class based
on that table so let's get started
so here in sequel server management
studio I've got a database called
database first demo I'm going to create
a new table I'm going to use this table
for storing posts in a block
okay I'm back on the table is ready now
here's the tricky part of database first
approach we have this database here
locally but in order to bring a
different database like a test database
or a production database to this version
we need a mechanism there are tools out
there that can compare to databases and
bring them to the same version but in my
experience they are not always reliable
and can sometimes cause issues due to
dependency between tables and records
and more reliable flexible but
unfortunately more manual approach is to
create a change script every time we
make a change to our database then we
can store these change scripts somewhere
in the repository and run them on any
database to bring them to the current
version so in this demo I'm going to go
with that approach so I'm going to
create a change script here and
or these and here's a sequence number
and a description okay and finally I'm
going to save this table okay so the
table is ready in my database let's
refresh beautiful now I'm going to go to
visual studio create a new project and
import this database and into tables
into my projects okay so start with a
new project
I'm going to speak to a console
application for now because we don't
want to get distracted by the complexity
of web applications or WPF applications
so let's just keep it simple and focus
on entity framework database first demo
with a new project the first step is to
install energy framework and to do that
we use package manager console so tools
NuGet package manager
manager comfo
so we run install package entity
framework
beautiful so here I got added Fame work
version 6.1.3 now we go to solution
Explorer right-click the project add new
item a deal dot map edit a data model so
this is going to be our conceptual model
that represents the mapping between the
database tables and our domain classes
so I'm going to give it a name like
block model
and in this video I'm going to use
energy framework designer from database
because I already have a database next
and here we need to specify a connection
to our database so Microsoft sequel
server continue okay here's my database
test the connection beautiful ok next
so at this point entity framework looks
at our database and discovers the tables
views stirred procedures and functions
we have there so currently we only have
tables and here's my table so I'm going
to take all of this and leave the rest
as is finish
you get the security warning about
running this template can potentially
harm your computer don't worry about it
so just click do not show this message
again because Visual Studio is trying to
run a template to generate some code
I'll show you that in a second
okay here's our entity data model which
is stored in a file with the EDM X
extension and here you see a class
called post which is exactly like the
table I created earlier let's go to
solution Explorer okay let's expand
block model EDM X what you see here is
all designer generated code there are
two parts that are important here one is
the first one block model but context at
T T so T T stands for T for template
it's a way to generate code based on a
template if the expand is we see the
actual generated code so here's a Fisher
PLAs that entity framework generated for
me and this class derives from dbcontext
DB context is a class that's an
abstraction over the database so it
provides a simple API to load the data
from or save it to the database now I
scroll down a little bit
look we have a property of type DB set
called posts a DB set represents a table
in the database so because in our
database we have a table called posts
here we have a DB set of type post
called
posts now this post class you see here
is a game generated code so back to
solution Explorer
the
the context template so here's the
template and the code that you just saw
this DB context was generated based on
this template now let's take a look at
the other template plug model template
so here's the template code and if we
expand this we see the post class look
it has four properties based on the
columns are currently having the
database so the key thing here is we
started with a database we created our
table and then we import that into our
entity data model every time I want to
make a change in my model I start with
the database and then I come back to my
admx file or entity data model and
refresh it and at this point entity
framework will update my domain classes
as you see here so here's the database
first workflow okay now let me show you
how we can use a DB context to work with
the database and this applies to both
database first and code first so I'm
going to close all the windows here okay
then I go to program
here I'm going to create an instance of
our dbcontext class which is called
database first model entities now I'm
going to create a new post and
initialize it here now in a real world
application most often will use an
identity column so we don't have to
specify an ID here but for now it
doesn't matter because I just want to
show you the boy flow and finally I'm
going to add this post to our DB set and
save the changes so context just post
the ad so we add it to the DB set and at
this point changes our own in the memory
nothing is committed to the database yet
so context object changes that's it now
let's run the application
done so as easy as that
note that ID
have to write a stored procedure I did
not have to work with a do dotnet
classes like sequel connection and
sequel command and the framework took
care of all of this for me now let's
verify that it worked
so I'm going to go to management studio
and let's take a look at our table there
you go
we got its record in the database now
reading data from database is as easy as
what you saw and that's what I'm going
to cover later in this course
so this was database first workflow in
action in the next lecture I'm going to
show you code first and then I will do a
comparison between the two
okay in this lecture I'm going to show
you the code first workflow in action so
here in Visual Studio I'm going to
create a new console application and
call it code first demo okay now similar
to last lecture we need to install
entity framework so tools NuGet package
manager and package manager console
install package entity framework
beautiful okay now back to the program
now with code first
of course we start with the code so I'm
not going to go to management studio and
create a new database instead I'm going
to create a new class called post so
this post class looks exactly like the
one that any framework generated for me
as part of database / support flow but
in this lecture I created it by hand now
in companion for this class I also need
a DB context remember TB context it's an
abstraction over the database that we
use to load or save data
basically all we have to do here is to
create a class that derives from
dbcontext and expose one or more DB set
in this case DB set of post next we need
to specify the connection string to the
database so we go to app config
and here I create the connection strings
element and add a new connection string
I'm going to call this the same name as
my dbcontext so blog DB context and the
actual connection of string is in this
case I'm using sequel Express you might
be using a different engine so you
create a connection string that works
for you so initial catalog is the
database name and integrated security
means I'm using Windows authentication
now one more element we need to add to
this connection string and that is
provider name which should be system
that data the particular client this is
required to work with code first okay
next I'm going to go to package manager
console we need to enable
first migration so this is a command
that we run only once for the lifetime
of a project so enable migrations
the code first migrations enabled for
project code first demo beautiful now
out of these few steps I have done so
far
installing edited framework adding the
connection string and enabling
migrations are steps that we do only
once that's it
every time we want to make it change in
our model we start with the code so in
this case for example we create a new
class like post or modify an existing
class the possibilities are endless now
every time we make a change to our model
we need to create a migration so we go
to package manager console and use the
command add migration and here we need
to specify a name that represents the
kind of change we have made in this
example I created the post class
let's see what happened so I go to
solution Explorer look we've got a new
folder called migrations and inside this
folder we've got two files the first one
is my migration note that it has a
date/time stamp and a description and
this is very similar to the migration
script that we created manually last
time remember I had to create a change
script this is exactly the same process
but in a more automated fashion let's
see what's inside this file so
interestingly we don't have any sequel
code here it is playing c-sharp code
this class create post derive from DV
migration and it has two methods up and
down so the first one is used to upgrade
database and the second one is used to
downgrade database so with code first
migrations we can take any database and
take it to any version whether that
version is higher or lower and this is
very powerful if you're maintaining
different versions of an application
this is going to be your best friend now
let's see what's happening inside the up
method so there is a call to this method
create table it tries to create a table
called post with these columns so ID
which is an integer it's not not able
and its identity state published in a
daytime and it's not malleable and we
have two more columns title and body
they both are string and finally here
there is a call to primary key method
which specifies that the ID column
should be set as primary key so the
interesting thing here is entity
framework uses convention over
configuration so when it looks at our
model in this case our post class based
on the name and type of our properties
it can figure out how the database
should look like for example it knows
that ID is typically used
or the primary key and often it's an
identity column so it automatically
added these expressions here so we
created a code first migration the next
step is to run it when you run it energy
framework looks at the database it takes
the current version which I will show
you later
and then figures out what migrations
need to run on the database to bring it
up to date then it gets these migration
classes and converts them to sequel code
and runs it on the database so to run
the migration we go back to package
manager console and run update database
so in this example it realized that this
is the only migration that needs to be
run on the database and of course we ran
it so let's see the result I'm going to
go back to management studio refresh the
databases and here we have code first
demo so I did not have to come here and
manually create this database I just
focused on my code which is much more
fun for us developers so let's expand
this
look we've got two tables here on the
line migration history which is used
internally by added framework to figure
out what migrations have been run on
this database and we also have this
Post's table
with these columns which looks exactly
like the one we created in the database
first demo
so as you saw with the code first
workflow we simply focus on our code and
let Edit framework take care of
generating or migrating the database for
us every time we want to make a change
to the database again we start with the
code create a migration run it and the
database will be updated so this is the
process in the next lecture I'm going to
give you a comparison of database first
and code first
so database verse or code first well in
my opinion that comes back to you and
your preferences anything you want to do
is possible with both code first and
database first there are a number of
misconceptions I've heard in the
community especially on the Stack
Overflow for example some developers say
database first gives you more control
over the database but this is actually
not true at all with code first you have
full control over the database even if
the kind of change you want to make but
nothing to do with your code let's say
you want to create a trigger or modify
the query behind a view or maybe create
or remove a stored procedure you can do
all of these with code first and I will
show you later in the course I've also
heard some people say that code first is
good for greenfield projects and if you
have an existing database you should use
database first again this is not right
at all because you can reverse engineer
your existing database to create a code
first model and then use code first
migrations for any subsequent changes
afterwards I will show you all of these
techniques later in the course so here's
the question again database first or
code first again to re-emphasize you can
do anything with either of these
workflows but in my opinion there are a
few advantages to using code for us
first you get full versioning of your
database you can bring your database to
any version with running only one
command and this is extremely helpful if
you are maintaining different versions
of an application without clothes first
you either have to manually take care of
versioning or use a tool like red gates
source control but that's pretty
expensive with code first you get these
for free another advantage is
productivity it's much faster to write
code then use the mouse and a table
designer we are programmers we are not
designers if you are used to visual
designers and wizards and clicking and
clicking I highly recommend you to
change your approach and start to use
your keyboard more if you want to be
successful
successful programmers use their
keyboard they don't use the mouse often
anyway code first helps you get things
done more quickly of course there is a
bit of learning curve at the beginning
and you may run into a number of
problems early on but trust me all this
will disappear after a while and you're
never going to switch back I have used
code first in many projects and even in
production I'm not being very happy with
it the only thing is where you work you
might have a legacy database deployment
tool and for that reason you may not be
able to use code first because there are
certain steps you need to follow to
update the database and everyone in the
team has been doing it for a number of
years and maybe they are too lazy to
change their approach then you have to
use database for it if that's the case
you have no choice but if you have a
chance to change the system and
influence your team to adopt code first
that's great go for it
or at least give it a try don't just
stick to the old ways of doing things
because some people say that's a better
way always try different approaches and
see what works for you so in this course
I'm going to teach you both database
first and code first so you can see the
differences try them yourself and pick
one that works better for you so in the
next section we'll be looking at details
of database first workflow I hope you
