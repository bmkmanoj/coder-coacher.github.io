Facebook groups called a speedo pet and
it immediately got my attention because
I can see quite a few number of problems
here so in this video I'm going to show
you how to fix these problems and how to
write cleaner more maintainable more
robust and testable code
I'm guessing this code is for a web form
that might potentially look something
like this
don't worry about this stuff happening
here I'm guessing on that web form we
should have a text box where the user
types the name of a book and a button
which I'm guessing when it's clicked it
will display a message saying the book
is in the stock or not I actually didn't
see the web form all I saw was this code
behind file here so let's read this code
line by line and see exactly what's
happening here before we can start
improving it first we are declaring a
quantity setting it to zero next we are
declaring a secret connection and then a
data reader finally a query which is
trying to select the quantity of a book
from book detail table and it's
filtering that based on the book name
which is entered into the text box
finally we are instantiating a sequel
command opening the connection to the
database executing the command and
reading the result in the reader we
access the first column which should be
an in 32 or an integer which represents
the quantity if the quantity is zero we
display a message saying book is not in
the stock otherwise we display a message
saying book is issued which I'm not
quite sure what it means and finally we
close the data reader and the connection
so the first problem I say in this code
is poor naming convention look at this
bottom one here what does one mean how
is it different from button two or
button three I can tell without looking
at all the code
and figuring out what does one represent
so I'm guessing if that's our button one
that's trying to check the quantity or
availability of a product in the stock
it would be much better if we name this
button something like instead of button
one BTN check quantity it's more
meaningful now I click this button here
to show the events and see it
automatically renamed that method which
is oops going to work I don't know let's
double click that okay so I'm going to
move all of this code here into this
method and get rid of this so now
instead of saying button one click we
have BTN check availability click which
is very meaningful same for this a QT y
here now it's kind of obvious that it's
quantity but a QT Y is not a very
beautiful and meaningful name for
variable Y a quantity Y not just
quantity and instead of QT y writing the
actual word quantity it would be much
cleaner so I'm going to rename that but
see how I rename these I'm not going to
go and rename it like this why because
see these are references to that
variable and if I manually rename it
here I have to go here copy this and
then paste it here and who knows how
many references you have here this is
very slow and really not how a good
coder renames variables
a better way is you use the refactor
rename command of visual studio so in
visual studio
if you press ctrl R and R you're going
to get a dialog box which actually is
not appearing here because I've got a
plug-in installed called resharper but
even if you don't have resharpen you can
still use visual studio to rename
variables basically when you use that
dialog box you rename a variable and
visual studio automatically renamed
all the references to that variable so
you don't have to manually rename each
one now here with resharper you see this
little box here and resharper tries to
find a good name but in this case it's
not intelligent enough to suggest the
name quantity it's interesting in 32
which is not really a good variable name
so I'm going to go ahead and just rename
that and inter see it automatically
updated the quantity variable here so
remember ctrl R and R I believe another
shortcut in visual studio is f2 so try
it and you'll love it similarly this
cien cien is not a good variable name
try to avoid acronyms and use full
meaningful names for your variables so
I'm going to rename this again ctrl R
and R and see this time resharper
realize that this is for a single
connection and the variable names is
suggesting is connection or a sequel
connection my preference is a shorter
variable name so I'm just going to
select the first one and resharper
automatically updated all the references
to that variable here same here what
does dr1 represent how is it different
from dr - i don't know so let's just
rename that to reader okay and here s
again s is not a good variable name this
is a query right so let's just rename
this to query and instead of CMD 1 I'm
going to use command there you go
and that's it I think yeah the code is
kind of more readable now there's just
one more issue here and that's textbox 3
again as a reader of this code when I
look at this I don't know what's the
difference between textbox 3 and textbox
to or if there is a textbox to on the
form at all so I have to look at the
whole code to figure out that textbox 3
is where the user types in the name of a
book so it would be much better if we
this to txd book name instead of textbox
3 so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to again use resharper and rename that
to txt book name press Enter resharper
automatically realize that that object
is used somewhere else in this file
default.aspx designer which is the code
that Visual Studio automatically
generates for each of your web forms so
I've selected that is selected by
default and I'm going to let be sharp
red to rename that for me now let's save
everything if I go to that designer file
here you see that resharper
automatically renamed this for me that's
why I say always use Visual Studio or
resharper for renaming your variables
let's go to default and this is the
textbox I select the properties here and
here here it's not renamed I don't know
why resharper cannot rename the objects
on a webform like this so I have to
manually change that to txt book name
alright all good get back to our code
behind next problem I see is this reader
is declared here but then it's used here
it's best to declare a variable closer
or closest to where it's being used this
reduces the noise in your code see as a
developer reading this code I see you're
telling me that okay we have quantity we
have connection we have a reader and
then you kind of forget this to move on
and go somewhere else then you talk
about query and then command and
connection open so what happened to the
reader see it kind of creates a mental
disconnect it would be much better if I
move this line of code here just where
we need the sequel reader but declare it
and use it straight away and see the
court is also one line shorter alright
another thing we can do here
is using the VAR keyword in C sharp with
var you can write cleaner and shorter
code let me show you how it works so
here instead of using C code connection
I can just use the keyword var and the
benefit of that is C with this I'm
saying signal connection connection is
new cycle connection so I'm repeating
this word twice here all right we can
just use var to write less code and it's
cleaner and less noisy same here we are
saying cycle command and again new cycle
command so one is enough to have it here
and we can use var here and same for
reader see the code is getting cleaner
with every step okay another problem I
see is this last line here connection
that closed even though the writer of
this code had good intention and they
wanted to make sure that the connection
to the database would be closed at the
end but unfortunately this code is not
very robust why well see we open the
connection here and then here we are
trying to read something from the
database now if something goes wrong in
between for any reason for example maybe
there was a bug in your query or maybe
the value that was returned it wasn't an
integer
you know anything can go wrong in that
case if something is wrong an exception
will be thrown which means anything
after this line will not be executed so
there is no way to guarantee that the
connection will be closed how we can
resolve this we use try finally block
let me show you how it works so what I'm
going to do is once the connection is
open I can define a try finally bad
means type in try F this is a code
snippet so you write a little bit of
code and then let Visual Studio generate
more code for you so try F and then
press tab see it automatically creates a
try finally block for you
I have a course on udemy called visual
studio tips and tricks or double your
coding speed where I cover a lot of tips
on how to write code faster and if
you're interested you can look at more
code snippets and other ways to write
code faster so let's move on I'm going
to move all of this stuff here into the
try block and then I want to make sure
that the reader and connection are
closed no matter what and that's the
intention of the finally so if an
exemption is thrown here no matter what
this finally block will always be
executed all right now we have an error
here reader because reader is defined in
this try block but we are using it in
the finally the problem is when we
define it here in the try the scope is
applicable only here so it has no
meaning and also in that block which
means we have to take this line out of
the try block so I'm going to put it
here alright let's look at the next
problem in this code look at this bit
here we are trying to construct a
dynamic sequel query based on what the
user put in the text box this is very
dangerous because there is a security
attack called
sequel injection which basically means a
hacker can go and type in some weird
text in your text boxes and that would
translate to some query that will be
executed on your database let me show
you what I mean by that imagine if I go
into text box and type in something like
this so ignore this comment bit here
just look at this bit I'm writing
so if I type exactly this into the text
box see what is going to happen
well this code is trying to concatenate
this string with what comes from the
text box right so let's just simulate
that here I'm going to copy this bit
here and then I'm going to copy what the
hacker puts in the text box and finally
um this bit here so another actually I
can don't worry about it I don't want to
confuse you here but just for
demonstration see with that input in the
text box the query will end up looking
something like this
so we're selecting quantity from book
detail table where book name is empty
string or one is one well one is one is
always true which means this query will
be somehow executed don't worry about
what it's returned but here is a tricky
part with semicolon we can batch queries
which means this would be also executed
on your database which means if the
hacker puts that string in the text box
they can easily drop one of your tables
using a similar technique they can go
ahead and write a query that would
create an administrator account on your
database something like this inserting
two members or users you know with some
values blah blah blah now they it also
requires a little bit of intelligence
and guessing the scheme of your database
I'm not a hacking expert but I know
there are ways for them to even extract
the scheme of your database know exactly
what you what tables you have what
columns you have and based on that they
can construct a query that will take
that will give them the complete control
of your application and potentially your
server depending on the permissions so
the lesson here is never ever ever trust
what the
user puts in a text box and based on
that just go ahead and create a query
the way to resolve this is to use
parameterised queries which means
instead of concatenating strings here
we're going to change our query to
something more kind of static which
would be like this so this is a
parameter that is prefixed with the @
sign so what the user puts in them text
box will end up being as a parameter
here and this is the actual query so
nothing else will be executed on the
database so if I go and put some weird
string here that will go here and when
sequel server runs that query it doesn't
see this text as yet another query so
this is an actual query that will be
executed now in order to use parameter S
queries the first thing you need to do
is define a parameter in your query and
then you need to add that parameter in
your command object so here after I
define my command I'm going to go ahead
and say command the parameters that add
now the parameters to the add method you
can define a parameter name the DB type
and size and column or I would say this
is the best overload so you pass a
sequel parameter object so here I'm
going to create a sequel parameter
object and give it a name the name
should be exactly what I put here book
name and a value which would be what we
put into the text box so that was txd
book name the text right so with this we
can get rid of our sequel injection
attack and our code will be more secure
let me get rid of this command comments
here okay let's see another way to
improve this code see this method here
between check availability is doing too
many things is trying to access the
database here and read the quantity and
then it's trying to show M
message to the user this bit accessing
the database should not be the
responsibility of a method in your code
behind file your code behind file
belongs to your web form this web form
and the web form is in the presentation
layer of your software which is what the
user sees this bit here is about data
access so data access code should not be
in the presentation layer so what I'm
going to do is first of all I'm going to
move all of this code into a separate
method just to show you a step by step
refactoring technique so basically what
we need is a method that gets as a
parameter or argument the name of a book
and then go into database and return the
quantity right that code should not know
nothing about what is going to be
displayed in the user interface like
this response to write all it needs to
know is how to get the data from the
database and so let me go ahead here
when I declare it as private and I
wanted to return the quantity which been
which would be an integer and I'm going
to call this method get product quantity
from stock as it sorry stock and as the
parameter I'm going to define a string
which is book name and C I'm creating
methods that have meaningful names and
meaningful parameters anyone looking at
this code can immediately tell what this
method is doing without going and
reading every line of this method and
that's the key
you should read code that is meaningful
like a like a story like a newspaper
like a book you don't have to a
developer does not have to read every
line of your code to know what's
happening so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to kind of well copy everything
here into this method now this method as
I said is about data access so it
should not know anything about writing
something on the web form so basically
once we read the quantity it did we
don't need to know anything else finally
we close the reader and the connection
and just return the quantity right so
let's review again this method creates a
connection query command opens the
connection risk the data from the
database and return it it has one single
responsibility it's not doing too many
things then I can go ahead and refactor
this code and instead of going to the
database and doing everything here I can
ask this method to get the data for me
and then if the quantity is zero I can
just display this message otherwise this
message so let's do that I'm going to
define a var quantity and ask this
method get product quantity from stock
and then just pass the ticks t book name
the text and at this point we've got the
quantity it's either zero or not if it's
zero we're going to display this message
otherwise this message and we can get
rid of everything else here so let me
clean up is cold see now this method is
much cleaner it has only a few lines of
code and its responsibility is purely to
display a proper message to the user and
this code has also few lines of code
well it's a little bit more than my
personal tastes and I will show you
shortly how we can even make this a
little bit shorter but it has only one
single responsibility and that is to get
the data from the database okay let's
look at this code again this query we
can just grab this and put that here
where it's used because this is the only
place we have used that query and we
don't necessarily need to store it in a
separate very
so just put that here and get rid of
this extra variable here all right I
don't things we can do to improve this
code is this hard-coded connection
string here it's not a good thing
why because if the connection string
changes we have to go here and change it
here and recompile the application now
you might wonder when the connection
string changes well it's quite possible
that in real-world scenarios you have a
development server a test server and a
production server and each of these
servers require a different connection
string
you cannot recompile your application
every time you want to deploy to one of
these servers so a better way is to use
a configuration file where you can store
the connection strings for each
environment and then your source code
would just read the data from the
configuration file in the case of this
web forms application we're going to
store the connection string in web
config so I'm going to open up web
config here under here at the beginning
just after configuration and config
sections you see this connection strings
so I can define a connection string here
use the add give you the name let's call
it I don't know
book store for example store and the
value sorry the connection string would
be exactly what we put here so I'm going
to cut that and paste that here now this
is just an XML doesn't require
compilation and when we deployed this
application to each environment but it's
dev test or production we will have a
separate web config for that environment
and the application code will be exactly
the same now how can we read the data
from connection string we use the
configuration manager class like this so
I type in configuration manager now I'm
using resharper and resharper
automatically knows that this class is
in a namespace called system that
configuration so I can just hit enter
and resharper automatically at
that namespace here for me if you are
not using resharper you probably have to
type it here and Visual Studio doesn't
recognize that then you right-click and
there will be some menu on the top here
that is called resolve namespace
something like that I strongly recommend
you to install resharper because it
makes your coding a lot easier alright
let's go ahead so configuration manager
is a class I'm going to go to app sorry
- connection strings and this has an
indexer I can specify the name of my
connection string which is in this case
bookstore and that returns a connection
string object which is equivalent to
this object here so that object has a
property called connection string which
is the actual string here so in order to
get that we come back here we get the
connection string object and then we
access the connection string property so
this is what we'll put here in the
sequel connection I would argue that it
would be also cleaner to instead of
writing this raw query here you use a
stored procedure for example you would
have a stored procedure called get
quantity which gets an input which is
the name of the book and returns the
quantity I'm going to leave that
exercise to you because I want to talk
about more fundamental issues in this
course so let's see what else we can do
to improve this code one thing that just
got my attention is this book name we
declared it what we never used it how do
I know well resharper is kind of graying
out this for me look this is white and
this is gray which makes me think this
is never used so when I look here at the
parameter I can see that it's still
using the txt book name I don't want
this method to be dependent on that text
box because shortly I will show you that
I'm going to move this somewhere else so
let's just use book name here and see
now it became white earlier I told you
that
the data access code should not be in
the presentation layer which means this
code does not belong to this code behind
file for this webpage what we can do is
to move this to a separate class let's
say we're going to create a class called
stock that would be responsible for
getting this doc or updating the stock
from the database now there are various
ways to model that and create layers for
your application but it's going to
beyond the scope of this video because
this code is I think for beginner level
dotnet developer and I don't want to
confuse you with too much complexity so
what I would suggest is at a minimum go
to your project here right click add a
new folder call it maybe services so
here I'm going to create a new class add
so add a class I'm going to call this
stock service and then I'm going to move
this code here into that class let me
also show you a quick shortcut here see
I can go and use the mouse to select
this and cut and paste or there is a
quicker way so anywhere here I can press
ctrl + M twice the method gets collapsed
now I can press ctrl X and then I can
press ctrl + tab and this shows all the
open windows in my visual studio project
so I'm going to go to stock service and
then I'll come here and then control V
to paste the code right it's much easier
when you use your keyboard again in my
visual studio course on udemy I talked
about all these things so if you want to
learn how to write code fast you can
take my course and get a lot out of it
now when I paste this code
resharper is automatically detecting
that mystical connection here is in the
system that data the C code client
namespace which is
not added here so I'm just going to
click this or press alt and enter as the
resharper suggests so there you go
and similarly configuration manager is
in system that configuration namespace
which does not exist here again I'd rely
on resharper to automatically fix this
for me so the shortcut is Alt + Enter
there you go
which means now I can go back to my code
behind file again I'm going to use ctrl
+ tab go here see this class is much
cleaner now now this method does not
exist in this class anymore and it's in
our stock service so we need a reference
to the stock service so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to create a private
field here stock service give it a
meaningful name now private fields will
always be prefixed with an underscore
and Siri sharp rate is automatically
suggesting three names for me I'm
thinking stock service is more
meaningful in this case and then in the
constructor of this class we can
initialize this field and finally here
we can use that reference stock service
get product quantity from stock it's
still complaining okay because that
method was originally declared as
private and now resharper is telling
cannot start it's visual studio that is
complaining it says cannot access
private method get product quantity from
stock here so I'm going to go back to my
stock service and change that to public
now control tab back here the problem is
resolved also another thing that got my
attention is this method here is a
little bit too long for my taste I would
like it to be a little bit shorter see
we are using stock service so it's
obvious that we're dealing with the
stock
so it would be more so it'll be cleaner
if we just name this method get product
quantity instead of get product quantity
from stock right now how can we rename
this I told you earlier control R and R
again so control R and R and then I'm
going to go ahead and get rid of this
extra two words get product quantity and
guess what resharper automatically
renames it here as well as in the stock
service where we define the method and
another tip I show you is look at these
namespaces here
the first two are gray which means they
are not used as well as the last two now
with visual studio you can right-click
this and go organize using and select
remove and sort which cleans up your
code or you can install a plug-in called
vs commands which automatically cleans
up your code whenever you save your code
file so in this case if I press ctrl + S
to save this code file see it
automatically removes that I don't even
have to touch my mouse
okay I think this code is almost ok
let's get back to our code behind file
see the intention of this code is very
clear now
instead of having button 1 or text box
free or seeing all the details of
connection and comment I can immediately
see this button when clicked it tries to
check availability it goes to stock
servers which gets the product quantity
from the database and returns it here if
it's zero this is the message we display
otherwise this is the message I don't
care how the stock service gets the
product quantity from the database it's
the implementation detail of that
service if there is a bug in that code I
can just go here click this and press
f12 to jump to that method and then read
the details of this method so the lesson
is your code should be clean such that a
reader looks at a method name like this
and knowing what's happening
without going and looking at every line
of that method similar here see we tend
check availability I don't really
necessarily need to look at this detail
I can just look at the method name and
say okay this is checking the
availability of the product okay that's
it for this video I hope you enjoyed it
and if you like me to review your code
please contact me I'm more than happy to
help you thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
