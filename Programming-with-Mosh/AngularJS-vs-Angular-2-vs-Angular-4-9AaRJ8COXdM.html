what's the difference between angularjs
angular 2 and angular for and how did we
jump from angular 2 to angular 4 well
angularjs was introduced in 2010 as a
JavaScript framework for building client
applications soon it gained popularity
an angular team started adding new
features to the core but the framework
was not designed with the needs of
today's applications in mind plus it was
overly complex so angular team decided
to rewrite the original framework using
typescript and as a result angular 2
came out in mid 2016 this new version is
entirely different from angular 1 to the
extent that you can think of it as a
completely different framework now this
made a lot of developers unhappy because
they had a lot of applications built
with angular 1 with each application
over a few thousand lines of code that
had to be rewritten but overall I
personally like the direction that
angular team took and how they rebuilt
angular with typescript this is a much
better framework it's a lot cleaner and
it's a lot easier to understand and to
work with now after a few minor upgrades
to angular 2 something strange happened
we were up to angular 2.3 and then all
of a sudden and your 4 came out so a lot
of developers including myself wondered
what happened to angular 3 we thought we
made something really big here but
unlike angular 2 angular 4 was not a new
framework with a lot of breaking changes
in fact it wasn't even a major upgrade
so let me explain what happened
angular consists of a few different
libraries that are distributed as
separate node packages via NPM for
example we have the core library that we
use in every application we have angular
compiler we have angular HTTP for
calling HTTP services we have angular
router for adding navigation to
applications and a few other libraries
now all these libraries were version the
same except the router library
so in order to align these versions and
avoid confusion in the future angular
team decided to go straight to angular
version 4 so in a sense angular 4 is not
a major upgrade to angular 2 and you can
think of it as angular 2.4 as simple as
that
now after all this confusion in the
community about angular versions the
team decided to drop the version suffix
and simply call the framework angular so
now we have two kinds of angular we have
angularjs which is the first generation
of angular written in JavaScript and
it's going to die sooner or later and we
also have angular which refers to
angular 2 or later in our discussions in
our articles and whenever we want to
talk about angular 2 or later we should
really use the word angular like I'm
gonna angular developer instead of I'm
gonna angular 2 developer or I'm an
angular 4 developer C it's really weird
we should use versions only when we need
to talk about a specific release for
example when we want to upgrade angular
4 to angular 5 then everybody knows what
is the scope of this upgrade and what
are the potential breaking changes that
can impact an application so this is all
about angular version history hi thank
