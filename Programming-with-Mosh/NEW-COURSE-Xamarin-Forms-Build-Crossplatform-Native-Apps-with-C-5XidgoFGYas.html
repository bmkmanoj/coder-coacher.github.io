build native mobile apps with c-sharp my
name is Ollie and I work here at udemy
on the data analytics team I've got an
amazing course for you called xamarin
forms by one of our most popular
instructors he has over 30,000 students
and ten courses Mohamed ani what can we
do to be maash so once you tell our
students about your new course I alley
thank you for having me here so if you
want to build an app for iOS you need to
know objective-c or Swift and similarly
if you want to build an app for Android
you need to know Java so not only do you
have to learn different programming
languages but you also have to learn
different API is exposed by each of
these platforms and that's exactly where
xamarin forms comes into the picture
so with xamarin forms you use your
existing c-sharp skills to build apps
for different platforms you code it once
and you simply build or deploy it to
different platforms so in this course
over seven and a half hours I'm going to
teach you how to build beautiful user
interfaces work with images build forms
and setting pages present data in
beautiful interactive lists store data
on the mobile device call backend
services and implement nvvm architecture
pattern if you have taken any of my
courses before you know there are very
hands-on and pragmatic so throughout the
course I have used plenty of real-world
examples and in each section you will
find a few exercises that would help you
master what you learned in that section
so much were the piu requisites for your
course how much c-sharp experience
should I have before I enroll well this
course is for developers who have been
programmed with the c-sharp for at least
three months
ideally six months you should know
concepts such as classes interfaces
events delegate and lambda expressions
and if not I've got courses on udemy
like c-sharp intermediate or c-sharp at
mass where I have covered this concept
in detail thanks much for joining us
here so if you want to use your existing
c-sharp skills and build native apps for
android iOS and windows enroll now and
you can get started building your first
app in less than 15 minutes just like
you I'm a self-taught programmer and
I've been working in the industry as a
professional software engineer for the
past
fifteen years are you ready to get
started let's go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
