model to create our custom model types
we can use the extend method to further
create sub model types here I've got a
model called animal with a method called
walk that logs a message to the console
let's go ahead and create a new model
type that in Hertz from the animal
you
with this our dog model now it hurts all
the capabilities of the animal so we can
call the walk method on the dog which
would log a message to the console
let's verify this in Chrome
there you go we didn't define the walk
method on the dog but the code was
inherited from the base model type we
can also override methods in a base
class let's see how it works
with this code if we call the walk
method on the dog the implementation
inside the dark class will be executed
let's try it out in Chrome
this verifies that the walk method in
the dark class overrode the one of its
base class you might ask what if you
want to call the walk method in the base
class in c-sharp or Java we do this with
the keyword base or super unfortunately
JavaScript doesn't provide an easy way
to do this but this is still possible
let me show you how it works
you
basically you need to access the
prototype of the base class and then
call the target method using the apply
method
okay now if the test is out in chrome we
shall see two messages one from the walk
method in the animal and the other from
the dog
so we can use the extend method to
further extend the inheritance hierarchy
all the capabilities of a base class
will be inherited by the child classes
so far you have learned how to create an
instant she ate mussels and how to get
instead their attributes most backbone
applications that use models often need
to get the models from a persistent
store on the server in the next lecture
will cover how to synchronize our models
with a persistent store on the server
