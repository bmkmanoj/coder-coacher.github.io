how to get information about the current
operating system so back in no
documentation in the list of modules if
you scroll down you can see it's OS
module let's have a quick look here so
these are the methods that are available
in this module for example we have free
mem which returns the amount of free
memory on this machine we also have
total mem which is the total memory we
can get information about the current
user we can get the uptime of this
machine and so on so let's use a couple
of these methods here so if you scroll
down you can see this is how we load
this OS module just like loading other
modules we call the require function and
store the result in a constant called OS
or anything
so back in vs code I'm gonna delete all
the code here and define a new constant
OS and study to require OS now we can
call total mem method
or free mem or other methods so let me
declare a variable and store the result
here
and similarly for the free memory free
memory and finally let's lock these
values on the console so console dot log
single code we add total memory and
append this total memory here now we can
simplify this expression by using a
template string which is available in
more recent versions of JavaScript that
we refer to as es6 or ES 2015 which is
short for ACMA script 6 or 2015 that's
the specification that defines what
features are available in JavaScript so
every year akima defines new features
that should be added to JavaScript and
as you know different browsers implement
different set of these features but the
v8 engine that we have inside of node
that's pretty up-to-date and it
implements a lot of new features of
JavaScript that is defined in Eggman
script so in Eggman script six or eight
most script 2015 we have a feature
called template string which helps us
build a string without concatenations
let me show you how that works so
console dot log now instead of a single
quote we use the backtick character
backtick is the character before number
one on your keyboard so here we add some
static text like total memory now we
want to add something here dynamically
so we use dollar sign and curly braces
to add a placeholder for an argument in
this case our argument is this total
memory variable so we can see with a
template string we don't have
concatenation okay now I'm gonna
duplicate this line and change total to
free and here let's add free memory okay
now we don't need this first console log
we're done with this let's go back to
the terminal
and run this app
so note app but Jas and you can see the
total and free memory on my machine now
what is interesting here is that before
note we could not get this kind of
information using javascript javascript
used to run only inside of a browser and
we could only work with the window or
document objects we couldn't get
information about the operating system
but when using node or javascript code
is executed outside of a browser or as
some people say on the server with this
we can get information about the
operating system we can work with files
we can work with the network for example
we can build a web server that listens
for HTTP requests on a given port and
I'm gonna show you all this later in
this section
hi guys its mosh here thank you for
watching my know tutorial I just wanted
to let you know that this video you've
been watching it's part of my complete
note course where you will learn
everything about node from the basic to
the advanced topics if you're serious
about learning node I highly recommend
you to enroll in my node course because
this is much faster than jumping from
one tutorial to another it saves you
time plus you're going to get a lot of
exercises that will prepare you for the
real work and also at the end of the
course you'll receive a certificate of
completion that you can provide your
current or future employer so if you
want to enroll click on the link in the
video description I hope to see you in
the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
