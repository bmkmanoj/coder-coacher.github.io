in the client-side JavaScript that we
run inside of browsers when we declare a
variable or a function that is added to
the global scope for example when we
define a function like say hello that
function is added to the global scope
and it's available via the window object
now there is a problem with this
behavior in a real world application we
often split our javascript code into
multiple files so it is possible that we
have two files and in both these files
we define this function say hello with
the exact same name because this
function is added to the global scope
when we define this function in another
file that new definition is going to
overwrite the previous definition so
this is the problem with the global
scope so in order to build reliable and
maintainable applications we should
avoid defining variables and functions
in the global scope instead we need
modularity we need to create small
building blocks or modules where we
define our variables and functions so
two variables or two functions with the
same name don't overwrite another
variable or function defined somewhere
else
they're encapsulated inside of that
module now at the core of node we have
this concept called module so every file
in a node application is considered a
module the variables and functions were
defined in that file or that module are
scoped to that file in object-oriented
programming terms we say there are
private they are not available outside
that container outside that module if
you want to use a variable or a function
defined in a module outside that module
you need to explicitly export it and
make it public and we're going to look
at that in the next lecture so what I
want you to take away from this lecture
is that every node application has at
least one file or one module which we
call the main module so in this case is
after Jas is our main module now let me
show you this module so I'm going to
delete all this code here and do
console that log of module
now this module object here may appear
to be global so you may think we can
access it while the global object like
global that console but actually this is
not a global object it appears to be
global but it's not global and you will
find out why very soon so let's just
lock this module object and see what we
see in the console back in the terminal
node app the jas so you can see we have
an object module it's a JSON object with
these key value pairs so we have ID
every module has an ID or a unique
identifier we have exports parent file
name which is the complete pass to that
file loaded which is a boolean that
determines if this module is loaded or
not we have children and pads now for
now don't worry about these properties
as we go through this section you will
gradually become familiar with these
properties so in node every file is a
module and the variables and functions
defined in that file are scoped to that
module they are not available outside of
that module in the next lecture you're
going to learn how to create and load a
module
hi guys its mosh here thank you for
watching my node tutorial I just wanted
to let you know that this video you've
been watching is part of my complete
note course where you will learn
everything about node from the basic to
the advanced topics if you're serious
about learning node I highly recommend
you to enroll in my node course because
this is much faster than jumping from
one tutorial to another it saves you
time plus you're going to get a lot of
exercises that will prepare you for the
real work and also at the end of the
course you'll receive a certificate of
completion that you can provide your
current or future employer so if you
want to enroll click on the link in the
video description I hope to see you in
the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
