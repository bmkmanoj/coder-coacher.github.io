in ode we have a few useful modules that
are built into the core of node with
these modules we can work with files
with the operating system with a network
and so on so let's have a quick look at
this built in modules head over to node
J s org then go to Docs on the left side
go to version eight point nine point
three that's the current stable release
chances are by the time you're watching
this video this version might be
different so that doesn't really matter
just pick that version now hearing the
table of contents you can see the
built-in modules of course not
everything you see here is a module for
example we have console which is our
console object we have buffer which
we're going to learn about in the future
in this course again that's a global
object but you can see that this is a
fairly short list and some of the items
in this list are built in modules in No
so just that you can see there are not
many modules built into node
I'm gonna highlight a few very useful
modules that you should be aware of for
example we have file system to work with
files we have HTTP that you're going to
learn about later in this section so
with this we can create web servers that
listen for HTTP requests we have OS to
work with the operating system we have
path which gives us a bunch of utility
functions for working with paths we have
process that gives us information about
the current process we have query
strings which is very useful in building
HTTP services we have a stream which
allows us to work with streams of data
again you're going to learn about this
in the future and a bunch of other
modules now in this lecture we're going
to look at is past module so on the
documentation you can see all the
functions defined in this module
we're going to use the parse method now
if you scroll down you can see how you
can use this module so I've seen the
required function before we call the
module using the require function get
the result which is an object and store
it in a constant so back in vs code in
app Jas let's call require and as the
argument use path now the argument that
we gave to this require function no it
assumes that this is a built in module
if there is no built in module by the
name specified here then node looks for
the existence of a relative path to a
file in this application so if we have
period / or period period / whatever
then node assumes that this is a file in
this application now in this case we're
going to load the building path module
and store it in a constant called pass
so this is an object with a bunch of
useful methods the method we're going to
use is the parse method so I'm gonna
give it is underline underline file name
which is one of the arguments and the
module wrapper function that you saw in
the last lecture so let's call this and
store the result in pass object and then
finally log it on the console has object
now back in the terminal let's run this
application
this is the past object it has a few
useful properties we have root we have D
which specifies the path to the folder
containing this file here's the name of
the file after Jas here's the extension
and here's the name of the file without
the extension so if you want to work
with paths it's much easier to use the
path module as opposed to working with
strings in the next lecture we're going
to look at another built-in module that
gives us information about the operating
system
hi guys its mosh here thank you for
watching my know tutorial I just wanted
to let you know that this video you've
been watching it's part of my complete
note course where you will learn
everything about node from the basic to
the advanced topics if you're serious
about learning node I highly recommend
you to enroll in my node course because
this is much faster than jumping from
one tutorial to another it saves you
time plus you're going to get a lot of
exercises that will prepare you for the
real work and also at the end of the
course you'll receive a certificate of
completion that you can provide your
current or future employer so if you
want to enroll click on the link in the
video description I hope to see you in
the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
