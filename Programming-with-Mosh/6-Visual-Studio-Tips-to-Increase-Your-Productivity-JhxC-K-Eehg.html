features of Visual Studio that is
unfortunately hardly ever used basically
you put bookmarks in various parts of
the code to remind you that you need to
get back there and do something this is
often very useful when you're focusing
on a task but you see a problem
somewhere else in the code you don't
want to get distracted from the original
task at hand
so you just leave a bookmark there and
get back to your original task later you
can look at all your bookmarks and get
back to do whatever you wanted to do
let's see this in action imagine you're
in the middle of a task and you spot
something here in method one you don't
want to get distracted so you leave a
bookmark here by pressing ctrl and K
twice
note this little icon here this
represents a bookmark
to see all your bookmarks press ctrl + W
as in short for window and then B as in
short for bookmark
note that the bookmark I just created is
listed here
you can double-click it and change its
name to something more meaningful like
requires refactoring I know what you're
thinking you're probably saying Marsh
didn't you advise me not to use the
mouse while programming yes I did say
that
to be honest with you at the time of
recording this video I don't know a way
to rename a bookmark without using the
mouse hopefully one day when I figure it
out I'll update this video and teach you
and everyone else how to do it
note that you can remove a bookmark by
selecting it here and then clicking the
delete icon here
but you can also remove it in the code
position the cursor on the line where
you have a bookmark and then press ctrl
K twice
code snippets are one of the coolest
features of Visual Studio that can speed
up your coding a lot let's see this in
action here I've got a class called code
snippet examples let's say we want to
create a constructor for this class most
developers do it this way
here is a faster way of doing that using
a
snippin
did you see how faster it is so how does
this work
there's
and reserved keywords that you can use
to automatically insert a ready-made
code snippet into your code in this case
I use the keyword seat or as in short
for constructor and then press the tab
let's try again
I didn't have to manually type the name
of a class for the constructor method
all I typed was seat or it's very easy
now let's create an Auto implemented
property here called first name this is
how developers who don't use code
snippets do this
you can do this faster using a code
snippet just type prop and then press
the tab
note that the type is highlighted is
ready for you to specify the data type
of this property we type in a string and
then press the tab again now the focus
is on the name of the property let's
give it a name
as you see some code snippets require
parameters in this case the name and
type of a property are the parameters
that we have to manually specify with
the last example for a constructor we
don't have to specify any parameters
when you need to specify parameters you
hit the tab to move to the next
parameter here is another code snippet
if you need to create a property with
full get and set methods you type in
prop full
note that Visual Studio created a
private field and a public property here
here is another example let's say we
want to type console the right line in
the constructor here we can do so by
typing C W as in short for
console.writeline
and then press the tab there you go
isn't it great here is another one let's
say in this class we would like to
implement the equals method we can do
this by typing equals and pressing the
tab
there you go Visual Studio created two
methods for us equals and get hash code
you can go ahead and customize these
methods according to your needs
here is another useful one
right a try/catch block use try like
this
or we can use try F if you want to
create a try finally block
another useful code snippet is for let's
try it
or we can use for our for a for loop
that decrements the loop variable after
each iteration
here is another useful one let's create
a list of strings and call it names
let's say we want to iterate over this
list using a 4h block so we type in four
each and press tab
because I created the for each block
near the names variable Visual Studio
detected that I may want to iterate over
this collection so I don't have to
manually specify the name of the
collection or the loop variable just
press tab to commit the code snippet
you can also use while or do code
snippets for loops let's try it
you
here I've got a piece of code that is
not properly formatted as you see we can
go ahead and clean it up a little like
this so we select these few lines here
then press the tab key to move them one
tap stop to the right
we can press shift and tab to move them
one tap stop to the left
there is also faster and better way to
clean up this code you can select
everything here using ctrl + a and then
press ctrl K and then ctrl F it
automatically formats the entire
selection
it's a very useful shortcut to know and
I use it all the time but let me show
you even a faster and easier way to
clean up your code let me revert back
the code to its original dirtiest date
first
note these few namespaces here as you
see they are not used that's why they're
grayed out also the code is not
formatted properly I can fix all of
these issues with only one shortcut ctrl
+ S which is for saving the file see
what happened all those unused
namespaces are removed and my code is
perfectly formatted so how did this
happen this is because I've installed an
extension to Visual Studio that is
called productivity power tools to get
productivity power tools open up your
browser and search for productivity
power tools in Google
you'll find this page on Visual Studio
gallery click the download button here
this will download a vsi X file which is
basically an extension to Visual Studio
just double click it and it will install
automatically it's very easy
have to restart visual studio after
installation once you got the
productivity power tools and go to tools
and then options
here's select productivity power tools
and then power commands general
note these two checkboxes here format
document unsaved and remove and sortie
usings unsaved by enabling these options
your code is automatically cleaned up
every time you save it I think they're
enabled by default anyway but it's worth
double-checking
here I've got a few tabs open as you see
program that CS is the active tab let's
say we want to open sample that CS tab
I've seen a lot of developers use the
mouse to change tabs here but again as a
programmer you should rely on your
keyboard the less you switch between the
keyboard and the mouse the faster you'll
be at coding so how can we switch to
sample that CS tab here without touching
the mouse just press ctrl + tab to cycle
through the open windows like this
or you can press ctrl shift and tap to
go backward
here is another way to do this you can
press ctrl + f6 to go to the next tab
control shift and f6 to go to the
previous staff
isn't it great it's much easier and
faster than using the mouse now let's
look at some ways to close tabs if you
want to close the current tab press ctrl
+ f4 it's gone
see
let me share another two
take with you that's going to increase
your productivity significantly when I
work I always focus on only one task at
a time each task is a small piece of
work that I can finish within 40 minutes
or less
that usually requires very few files or
tabs to have open and visual studio
there are a couple of great benefits to
this first it helps you get focus by
reducing distractions you should only
have the files open that you really need
to work on
the second benefit is that it makes it
easier to switch between tabs imagine if
you had 10 or more tabs open here every
time you press ctrl + tab you see lots
of items to cycle through this wastes a
lot of time and energy so I highly
recommend you to have only very few tabs
open that you really need
after you finish each task clean up your
workspace by closing all the open tabs a
fast way to do this is to press Alt W&amp;amp;L
now you may ask how can I open files for
my next task without going to solution
Explorer the answer is to press control
and coma this brings up the navigate
dialog which is extremely helpful
with this dialogue you can type the name
of a file a class or even a method and
quickly open that in Visual Studio
there's no need to grab the mouse and
open the file by solution Explorer
let me type method to here as you see it
shows all the places where I have a
method by the name of method two
now we can hit the tab key to move focus
to the results and then use up-and-down
arrows to select an item then we press
enter and there you go
visual studio open the file and even put
the cursor right at the beginning of the
method
let's open the navigate dialog again so
I press control and coma
a type program as you see we have two
items in the results the first one
represents the class while the second
one represents the actual file isn't it
great
imagine how much time you would waste if
you had to use the mouse to expand and
collapse folders in the solution
Explorer to find a file especially the
larger your project the harder it gets
to find a file in solution Explorer as
you saw if you know the name of a file
is much faster to look it up here so
next time you switch the mouse to open a
file very solution Explorer or close a
tab remember that you can do the same
with keyboard and save yourself lots of
time and here's one more trick for this
lecture you're going to love this
press shift alt and enter this takes you
to the full screen view of the current
tab it's much easier to focus on this
tab without any distractions to exit the
full screen view just use the same
shortcut shift alt and enter
sometimes when you are dealing with long
blocks of code it's better to collapse
the blocks you are not interested in so
you can focus on a small part of the
code take a look at this code let's say
we want to work on method 1 as you see
method 2 is long method and is
distracting we can put our cursor
anywhere in the method or on the
declaration line and press ctrl + M
twice see what happened it's much easier
to focus on method 1 now later if you
want to expand method 2 you can use the
same shortcut to expand it
like this
note that you can apply this shortcut at
any level for example we can put the
cursor here near the Declaration of the
class and collapse the entire class
or even the namespace
let's say in this class we would like to
create a private field of type code
inspector and initialize it from the
constructor typically this is how most
developers write this code without using
resharper
you
okay now let's see the resharper way
so we just declare the private field
first
okay now note this blue underlined here
whenever resharper sees something in
your code that can be improved
it underlines it like that
if you put the cursor here where the
underline is we also get this icon on
the left side
a yellow bulb is like a warning in this
case because we declare this private
field but never used it or initialize it
resharper is wondering why when it is in
the first place maybe something is
missing so so at this point we can
activate resharper's commands using alt
and enter this is what I call a golden
shortcut you're going to see me using
this shortcut over and over and over
alright so now let's take a look at what
we can do with this
resharper is suggesting three things we
can do to improve this code we can
initialize it from the constructor we
can remove it because it's not used
anywhere or we can comment it out in
this case we want to initialize this
from the constructor so let's select the
first item there you go
so our private field is initialized from
the constructor this is much faster than
manually writing this code
we could also write this code by
starting from the constructor first and
then having resharper create and
initialize a private field for us let me
show you how it works first we create a
constructor using the seat or code
snippet remember this I told you this in
that code snippets lecture
okay now we define an argument for this
constructor we just type CI as in short
for code inspector this is the camel
humps that I told you earlier then ctrl
+ space for resharper to suggest the
name
and now alton enter to activate the
refactoring commands and select the
first one
when you do this a few times you're
gonna get really fast at it and you'll
do it without even thinking about it let
me show you how I do this
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
