talk about value and reference types in
JavaScript now if you're familiar with
this concept or your c-sharp developer
feel free to skip this lecture and move
on to the next lecture so in JavaScript
we have two types of variables we have
value types like strings numbers
billions null and undefined and
reference types which include objects
arrays and functions so here is an
example when we declare a variable like
X and set it to a string like Apple the
part of computer's memory is allocated
for X variable let's imagine the address
of this location in memory is 1 1 1 so X
will be a label for this memory location
and at that location we have to string
Apple now let's see how many where
allocation is different for reference
types so here we set X to an object
instead of a string an object of
reference types when this line is
executed similar as before a part of
computer's memory is allocated for the X
variable and let's imagine the address
of this memory location is 1 1 1
but our object is not stored in this
memory location it's stored somewhere
else and let's imagine the address of
this target memory location is 2 2 2 so
our X variable which is a label for
memory location 1 1 1 will hold the
address of the target memory location so
X is pointing or referencing a different
memory location and that's why we call
them reference types now in case you're
curious why memory allocation is
different between value and reference
types the reason is that we use value
types for simple values like numbers
strings boolean's and so on we don't
need much memory for this kind of values
in contrast we use objects and arrays
for storing complex values we need more
memory that's why in terms of memory
allocation we have two different types
of memory we have stack memory which is
used for storing simple values or value
types
heap memory she's used for storing
larger complex objects now there are
three facts you need to know about value
types and reference types the first one
is that value types are immutable which
means you cannot mutate them you cannot
change them once you initialize them
they're always the same here is an
example so let's declare X and set it to
Apple now if we call one of these string
methods like to uppercase this method
will return a new string which is
completely different from our original
string so here's our uppercase Apple but
if we print X we still have the original
lowercase Apple so the original value is
not modified that's why we call value
types immutable in contrast if X was an
object with the title property Apple now
we can directly modify this title
property here and make it uppercase now
if it print X on the console you can see
the original object is modified so we no
longer have the lowercase Apple in other
words we can mutate or change reference
types now the second fact about value
types is that they're compared by value
what do I mean by that well let's
imagine X is Apple and I also have Y
which is Apple now if we compare x and y
the result is true so even though x and
y are in two different parts of the
memory because their value types they're
compared by the value they're holding in
this case Apple in contrast reference
types are compared by their references
and that means if X is an object with
title property set to Apple and Y is
also another object with the exact same
property
if we compare them we get false because
x and y are reference types and when we
compare them the references are compared
in other words x is referencing this
object at this location two to two
whereas Y is referencing this other
object at location 3 3 3 so when we
compare an X on Y it's like we're
comparing 2 to 2 with 3 3 3 and of
course they're different so this is the
second fact about value types on
reference types and the third one is
that value types are copied by value
what do I mean by that well one more
time let's imagine X is Apple now if we
declare Y and set it to X because X is a
value type a copy of X's value is taken
and stored in Y so now x and y are two
independent variables in the memory in
contrast if X is an object with the
title property set to Apple and Y is
another variable and we set this to X
now both x and y are referencing or
pointing to the same object in memory
and that means if I change this object
via X reference so X dot title let's
update this now this change is visible
through the other reference so if I
print Y look have an object with title
set to orange so a value type is copied
by its value whereas a reference type is
copied by its reference
hey thank you for watching my youtube
video my name is Mohammad Ani and I'm a
full-stack developer applause I know sir
and in udemy instructor with about 14
courses at the time of recording this
video so I've got lots of courses on
both front end and back end development
including C sharp and ADA framework a
splendid MVC angular architecture unit
testing and so on this video watch is
actually part of my angular course on
udemy that you can get with a discount
using the link in the video description
and if you want to see my other courses
simply head over to program with mass
comm slash courses you can also
