expect is not the page or view itself
instead it's the object that is
responsible for rendering the content of
the view as well as responding to any
events raised from there
for example clicks drag and drops press
keys and so on so backbone views are
more like controllers in the classic MVC
terms every view has a reference to a
Dom element and is responsible for
rendering the content of this element as
well as responding to any events raised
from it let's go ahead and create our
first view
you
creating views is similar to creating
models and collections we use the extend
method to extend back upon that view
let's see what's going on here the
render method is where we implement the
rendering logic this dollar L is a case
jQuery object that contains the views
Dom element we are using the jquery HTML
method to display a hello world message
on the view the convention returned a
reference to the view at the end of the
render method
this helps chaining method calls as
you'll see shortly
now let's declare an instance of the
view
you
when instantiate in the view were
specifying Dom element to which this
view should attach to we are doing this
by setting the L property to a jQuery
selector string in this case we are
telling our view that there is an HTML
element with the ID of container in our
HTML markup this view will be
responsible for rendering the content
inside the container as well as
responding to any events raised from it
now let's go to our main that HTML and
create this element
you
okay now let's try it in Chrome there
you go
we got the hello world message let's
inspect the view object
not the difference between the
Elle and dollar L properties
the L property is a jQuery selector that
references the Dom element that this
view owns the dollar L property is a
case jQuery object that contains this
Dom element
it's faster to use this case jQuery
object when we need to reference the Dom
element or any of his children as
opposed to constructing a jQuery object
using the selector every time all right
now let's go and make it tiny change to
our code I'm going to remove the
initialization of the L property let's
refresh the page and see what happens
the hello word message is gone but let
me show you something interesting we're
going to inspect the view again
okay let's expand a dollar or property
note that this property has initialized
is referencing a div this means that if
you don't specify the Dom element when
instantiating a view backbone
automatically creates one for the view
but this Dom element is in the memory
it's not inserted in the HTML markup and
that's the reason we don't see the hello
world message here let's go ahead and
fix this
you
so we are using the jQuery selector to
get the container element and then we
use the HTML method to insert the views
Dom element inside the container let's
try it out there you go
so the lesson is every view has a Dom
element at all times if you specify a
Dom element that exists on the page the
view attaches itself to it otherwise the
view will create a Dom element this Dom
element is by default an empty div let
me show this to you
so let's inspect this element here now
the div here we can overwrite the
default and tell the view to create a
different kind of HTML element let's see
how it works
we can use the tag name property to
specify the type of HTML element to be
created
we can also give it a class
or even an ID
all righty HTML attributes
you
now let's see the result
you
note that this time we have a span with
the idea of one two three four with the
class song and it also has an html5 data
attribute
one last thing before we finish this
lecture
earlier I told you we should return a
reference to the view at the end of the
render method I told you this is used
for chaining method calls let me clarify
what I meant by not using this technique
we can combine these two lines here into
something like this
because the return value from the render
method is a reference to the song view
object we can directly access its dollar
L property you often see these in
backbone code examples
so to create a view we extend back on
that view and implement the render
method every view has a reference to a
Dom element and is responsible for
rendering anything inside that element
are responding to events raised from
there
we can specify the element but
instantiate interview using a jQuery
selector if we don't specify the element
backbone we'll create one for view this
element is in the memory and we need to
manually insert it on the page we can
customize the Dom element that backbone
creates for the view using the tag name
class name ID and attributes properties
okay so you have seen the basic
structure of a view but backbone views
are usually but not always used along
with backbone models in this example
when our view was rendered we saw a
static hello world message in the next
lecture I will show you how you can pass
a model to a view this way we can render
the view based on the values of the
model's attributes thank you for
