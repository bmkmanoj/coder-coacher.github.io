concept of events in fact a lot of nodes
core functionality is based on this
concept of events an event is basically
a signal that indicates that something
has happened in our application for
example in node we have a class called
HTTP that we can use to build a web
server so we listen on a given port and
every time we receive a request on that
port that HTTP class raises an event now
our job is to respond to that event
which basically involves reading that
request and returning the right response
so as you go through node documentation
you can see that several classes in node
raises different kinds of events and in
your code you might be interested to
respond to those events so in this
lecture I'm gonna show you how to work
with the events module now back in notes
documentation once again in the list of
modules you can see here we have this
events module so in this module we have
one class that is called event emitter
it's one of the core building blocks of
node and a lot of classes are based on
this event emitter so let's see how we
can work with this event emitter
I can be asked Oh first let's load the
events module so require events now here
when we call the require function we get
the event emitter class so constant
event emitter note that here in terms of
the naming the first letter of every
word is uppercase this is a convention
that indicates that this event emitter
is a class it's not a function it's not
a simple value it's a class a class is
container for properties and functions
which we call methods so in this event
emitter class
we have these metals that you see here
in the documentation so a class is a
container for a bunch of related methods
and properties now here in order to use
this event emitter first we need to
create an instance of this class so
constant emitter we set this to new
event emitter so here this emitter is an
object in case you don't know the
difference between a class and an object
let me give you a metaphor a class is
like human and an object is like an
actual person like John Mary and so on
so a class defines the properties and
behavior of a concept like a human but
an object is an actual instance of that
class okay
so here this first event emitter is a
class it's a blueprint it defines what
an event emitter can do but this second
emitter is an actual object this is the
one that we're going to use in our
application so this emitter has a bunch
of methods look these are all the metals
that you saw in the documentation
now even though here we have more than
ten metals most of the time we use only
two of these methods one is m8 that we
use to raise an event the first time I
saw this method it didn't make sense to
me because English is my second language
and I didn't know what m8 means so if
you're in the same boat ma it basically
means making a noise or produce
something in this case we're making a
noise in our application
we're signaling that an event has
happened okay so that's the meaning of
Emmett here we pass an argument that is
the name of the event let's say message
locked
in the future we're going to extend our
lager module and every time we log a
message we're going to raise an event
called message locked okay now if you
run this application nothing is going to
happen let me show you back in the
terminal node fjs look nothing happened
because we have raised an event here but
nowhere in our application we have
registered a listener that is interested
in that event a listener is a function
that will be called when that event is
raised
okay so let's register a listener that
will be called when the message log
event is raised so register a listener
so emitter dot look here we have this
method add listener but we have an alias
for this that we use more often that is
on if you're worked with jQuery you have
seen this before so on or add listener
they're exactly the same but quit often
we use the on method now this method
takes two arguments the first one is the
name of the event in this case message
locked and the second one is a callback
function or the actual listener so here
we pass a function and this function
will be called when that event is raised
okay now for now I just want to lock a
message in the console so console let's
say listener called like this now let's
run this application so node FJ yes and
we got this message listener called so
this indicates that when we raise this
event
function or listener was caught okay and
of course the order is important here if
you register this listener after calling
the Emmett method nothing would have
happened because when we call the Emmett
method this ammeter iterates over all
the registered listeners and calls them
synchronously okay so this is the basic
of raising events and handling them
using the eve an emitter class
hi guys its mosh here thank you for
watching my know tutorial I just wanted
to let you know that this video you've
been watching it's part of my complete
note course where you will learn
everything about node from the basic to
the advanced topics if you're serious
about learning node I highly recommend
you to enroll in my node course because
this is much faster than jumping from
one tutorial to another it saves you
time plus you're going to get a lot of
exercises that will prepare you for the
real work and also at the end of the
course you'll receive a certificate of
completion that you can provide your
current or future employer so if you
want to enroll click on the link in the
video description I hope to see you in
the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
