cross-platform runtime environment for
executing JavaScript code outside of a
browser quite often we use no to build
back-end services also called api's or
application programming interfaces these
are the services that power our client
applications like a web app running
inside of a web browser or mobile app
running on a mobile device these client
apps are simply what the user sees and
interacts with they're just the surface
they need to talk to some services
sitting on the server or in the cloud to
store data send emails or push
notifications kick off workflows and so
on node is ideal for building highly
scalable data intensive and real-time
back-end services that power our client
applications now you might ask but mosh
there are other tools and frameworks out
there for building back-end services
such as a spirit med rails Django and so
on so what's so special about no well
note is easy to get started and can be
used for prototyping and agile
development but it can also be used for
building super fast and highly scalable
services it's used in production by
large companies such as PayPal uber
Netflix Walmart and so on in fact at
PayPal that rebuilt one of their Java
and spring based applications using node
and it found that the node application
was built twice as fast with fewer
people in 33% fewer lines of code and
40% fewer files and more importantly
they double the number of requests
served per second while decreasing the
average response time by 35% so node is
an excellent choice for building highly
scalable services another reason for
using note is that in node applications
we use JavaScript so if you're a
front-end developer and know JavaScript
you can reuse your JavaScript skills and
- a full-stack developer and get a
better job with better pay you don't
have to learn a new programming language
also because you can use JavaScript both
on the front end and on the back end
your source code will be cleaner and
more consistent so you will use the same
naming conventions the same tools and
the same best practices and finally
another reason for using node is that it
has the largest ecosystem of open source
libraries available to you so for pretty
much any features or building blocks you
want to add your application there is
some free open source library out there
that you can use so you don't have to
build this building blocks from scratch
and instead you can focus on the core of
your application next we're going to
look at the architecture of node hi guys
it's maj here thank you for watching my
node tutorial I just wanted to let you
know that this video you've been
watching is part of my complete node
course where you will learn everything
about node from the basic to the
advanced topics if you're serious about
learning node I highly recommend you to
enroll in my node course because this is
much faster than jumping from one
tutorial to another it saves you time
plus you're going to get a lot of
exercises that will prepare you for the
real world
and also at the end of the course you'll
receive a certificate of completion that
you can provide your current or future
employer so if you want to enroll click
on the link in the video description I
hope to see you in the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
