honey
I teach monkeys shark net forces a
framework and some into the courses I
decided three years ago but I knew about
unity lock before in fact my version was
March last but if I pronounce his last
name property he's here what I came to
his page my facebook guys like he had he
had like five thousand students at the
price of this course was like underdogs
and I said wow this guy's making music
dollars it's just one port and I didn't
the whole discourses are sold at $10 or
$20 I wanted to do that for a long time
but working full time I saw engineer it
was really hard when I came home with a
letter to support user course until I
decided to quit my job and decide not to
look for a new job and crazy my first
view of the course so I spent about
three weeks to create one hour or
constantly hardly made on the dollar
fifty fifty dollars and then I go into
the motherboard where six hours which
took me about six weeks of production
and that was one of the on-demand
courses engine is hot topics in it and
that course also see themselves with
like hundred dollars an event and then I
good fortune job and they said if you're
going to start in three weeks and I
thought okay when I win the point I'm
going to do it but I want to do that
home watch TV so I ended up printing my
third course I was very Sharma advanced
course and I started to learn about the
thousand dollars month that's okay this
is working all my expectation was but
five hundred extra cash at one nothing
more oh it's like I want to become a
millionaire I knew that he doesn't just
wanted to $500
extra and I open to reach money goal and
then I discovered my passion for
teaching I never really looked formation
- platform is just getting feedback from
my students about what you want to learn
from me and I cooked a lot of courses
and then they organically group I took
up on history and wanted me to share I
used to leave in Melbourne Australia and
I just moved to LA about two months ago
and one night I was out salsa dancing
and people described to a bit of land
and they know the taste it was acid one
person thank you and then he wanted next
person so after at least dances what do
they need the guys happen at the
shoulder like who wanted to ask his work
that he said are you watched having
dying and I don't think I'm there
because I was wearing - had different
look from what you see my Egypt again he
said my monitor students I'm taking a
lot of your courses so he was a person
and I ever met in person I think the
last night
yeah so in my course every section and
another section I have big practice
which is a coding exercise I quit
portion answer is according exercise
they have to build something I'm hoping
that you can tweak 30 minutes now
something that they noticed I have two
days with readeth and become
disappointed and I also show the
solution myself how I started that
project how I'm thinking throughout this
journey how I change my code every
factory and make it better
these are some tips along the way like
some shortcuts to write code faster
something more interesting that this
solution I showed them the how and why
and then I also upload the code to
github
some people love diesel the others don't
like it they like attachment of these
website I try to cater for different
kinds of audiences how many relax and
ease into the universe's how many so
each course I have an average size about
10 to 15 sections of what exposed at
least a section sometimes too
in fact I've asked my students in my
service what do you think what my
teaching what do you think I can improve
and I still get a lot of feedback we
need more exercise it went something
like what two things every section they
want more I think they are happen so
tightly on top of all of the action
engine is rhythm art because I have with
the time to say everyone evolution
throughout the day and part of you want
to create more content those people who
are funny people learn more but at the
same time I have to slow down and get
quick more exercise
that is more out
YouTube I had zero subscribers I started
there just like everyone else I never
thought I could have 30,000 subscribers
but I write pretty quickly all we have
to do is upload really good quality
videos don't even really think involved
I want to keep the good quality one for
my query which is show an introduction
for two minutes it's like an
advertisement people are not going to
get your course sure as much content as
one as you can eat generous like my
YouTube we deserve one hours of respond
half hour and they concerned a lot from
that they don't have to come on and go
to my course but those who are more
passionate they're going educated to
learn I present maintain it video
description or coupon in terms of
something wanted to add the previous
question when a lot of poverty reports I
don't want announcement YouTube about
two months or if they in a month or two
months I'm going to publish this course
so I give them heads up as a lot of
people start to get excited about that
but it is closer about a week before
I've done another announcement sometimes
it's a short simple media that I take
with my phone and then when the courses
release I send coupons annotated is
valid for three four days and then after
I take these medias off my youtube
channel because I don't like you to do
sales EE just for special occasion
this is actually a good question because
both Max and I we created our course
from scratch to discuss an update for
these guys making the ice does remain
sometimes if there are dramatic changes
you really have to create a course from
scratch because in my case I tried to
patch the course and that is important I
try to add supplementary use of unity
and also some PDS attached send to
specific nature take the heuristic
tactical changes some people love this
is perfect the relatively complex and
that's why it is rewriting the course
from scratch so I don't have a specific
formula that works for everyone
but leader good things are happening
that you can try here so options are
patching the videos or and supplementary
materials very formula PDF or video for
restricting the course from scratch over
these out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
