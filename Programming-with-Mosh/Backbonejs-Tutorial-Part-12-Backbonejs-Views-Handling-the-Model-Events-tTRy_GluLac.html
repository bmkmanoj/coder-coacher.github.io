instances of a muddled state changing in
real time
take Facebook for example have you
noticed that when someone comments on
your post or likes it you would
immediately see the result you don't
have to refresh the page to see the
changes so how does this work there are
two common ways to implement something
like this one way is to repeatedly ask
the server if the state of a model is
changed but this can be costly as the
application grows there is another way
which is called push or push
notifications in which the server
notifies every client that's interested
to know about the changes either way the
model that's residing on the client
inside the user's browser is updated at
this point we need to refresh the view
based on the content of the model let's
see this in action
here I've got a basic view that renders
the title of a song as well as the
number of users listening to it now
let's say this in Chrome
so no one is currently listening to this
song now I'm going to use the console to
simulate a situation where the number of
listeners changes so I'm going to update
the state of the model by setting the
listeners attribute
note that the view is not refreshed so
we need to make the view listen to the
changes in the model and update itself
accordingly so let's go ahead and
implement this
you
you have already seen the initialized
method before it's called when we
instantiate a backbone object here we
are using the on method to register a
handler for the change event of the
model all backbone models publish a
change event whenever one of their
attributes is changed earlier I told you
that backbone models store attributes in
a hash which is the reason why we have
to use the get and set methods to work
with the attributes of models backbone
developers have used this technique so
that they can keep track of changes in
the attributes and publish events if you
set the attributes directly on a model
keeping track of changes would be hard
or impossible so here we are registering
the render method as the callback when
the change event is triggered the third
parameter is to set the context we need
to set the context to the view itself
when the render method is called
otherwise the context would be set to
the model now let's see if it's working
so currently no one is listening to this
song
now is set the number of listeners
behind scene
there you go the view updated
immediately now food for thought you
don't always have to call the render
method when the model state changes even
though this is quite common sometimes
you may want to display a message
somewhere else or apply some CSS class
to an element to highlight some fact to
the user in that case you would create a
separate callback function like
unmodeled change
you
so to handle model events we use the on
method to register handlers for them
backbone models raise a change event
when the state of a model is changed in
the next lecture will cover how to
respond to the events raised by backbone
