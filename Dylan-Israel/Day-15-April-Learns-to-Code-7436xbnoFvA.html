okay alright so let's start let's start
over we having our technical issues so
what what what coding were you able to
get done today I just read some stuff
okay so you haven't been able to get to
it yet today but you're going to okay
Milo Milo alright so what we're gonna
continue doing today
sorry looks like you just don't were
with him haha I did I'm about to do it
again if he jumps back up here alright
so what we're gonna do today baby is
we're gonna continue going over HTML now
you've worked with it and we might even
get to I think yeah we'll get to some
other stuff but that the idea behind
this is I want you to be educated on
everything that's going on with the
language you said hey I don't how do I
go and find out that these things even
exist and this is going to be one way
that we do it so in the meantime my goal
is for you to finish up your portfolio
you gotta have all the skills you need
at this point you just got work on it so
hopefully today or tomorrow is that is
that too much of a so how about by the
end of the weekend that will be your due
date or else you'll be ashamed I'm going
to walk around the house and every time
we start this I'm going to go shame
shame shame
so because um this is day 14 I want to
say and hi David thanks for coming and
what we're going to so let's see by
Sunday will be twenty days you can
finish it in twenty
by day 20 all right what so Sunday will
be almost 20 days I've been working on
for 20 days but day 20 you can do that
all right so we're saying by Sunday
you'll have it done make me a guarantee
I do because we need to get you we need
to get you moving forward you bomb
behind my schedule here is what I'm
trying to say well you never made a

show you you want me to show you what
the schedule is right now
well I'll show you let's bring up the
calendar so today is the 9th it doesn't
count you don't have anything written
I'm showing you right now what I have in
my head this is this is bull here
there we go hey James um so we are here
on the 9th so what I want you to do is
buy ideally I want you done by Friday
Friday
I want you we us to be refactoring your
project that's what I want to do Friday
okay that gives you tonight tomorrow and
Thursday that's three days to finish up
when you basically just have to add your
own info and rework what you have so in
three days your your task is to finish
that up on Friday what I'm going to do
is I'm going to refactor oh my gift
we're going to go through let me say hey
this is where you can improve this is
what you can change and this is what you
did well this is what you did back
that's what we're going to do Friday so
exactly this David yang says here if you
said if your goal is to finish one
section of the portfolio over the next
three days you'll be done so Friday's
refactoring today tomorrow and Thursday
what we're going to be doing is we're
going to be doing exactly what we're
doing here where I go over things and
you're putting it in the back of your
memory saying hey this is a thing I
don't remember what it's called I know
it's a thing let me go find n w3 schools
and we're going out through HTML there's
a lot more HTML we're going to go
through CSS and JavaScript and by the
time that hits that should be Friday and
then Saturday on your own hours you're
going to be I'm going to show you how to
use a text editor
set that up right I'm going to take
what's on your code pin and I'm going to
move it to a text editor and then you're
going to do it on your own as well and
I'm going to introduce you to the
concept of git and we're going to go and
do that that and I'm going to explain
you it to you and then by that Monday
we're going to have you do your very
first commit we're gonna have you make a
github which is important that is that
is again huh you have them good and
we're going to have you actually use it
and commit to it and things like that so
that is that is what the next full week
of work is
so but to maintain that which would be
into these no we I want you so by the
twelfth next three days you work what
you finished your portfolio the twelfth
I review it on the life livestream we I
explained you how to refactor and I
might even show you if there's time how
to transfer to exit exit if not we
transfer to a text editor and I'm also
going to have you start whiteboarding
things out on Saturday and Sunday
logically we'll give you small
algorithms and you're going to try and
solve them I'm giving you hints and
things like that but that's after we do
get I'm going to talk to you about get
what it is
what's version control is used for and
how it's used and then we're going to
have you start actually the things that
you're working on we're going to
actually put it on your your get page
and we're going to have you put it on
your your earlier your github account
those are the things we're going to come
to so we're picking up pace here but
first you have to finish the portfolio
page okay
what's man
you need some coffee
what's the problem my hair baby you look
like you're dying that's not what I mean
you know it ice ichael so um I think we
did this section images let's jump into
tables that's where we're at so tables
you actually really good tables right so
well you understand the bulk of it I was
very impressed by the fact they included
a table in your tribute page you told me
that tables were easy uh I mean if you
understand the concept it's easy
um yeah so everything you're learning is
new I don't expect any of it to be easy
for you okay what I do expect is for you
to pay attention for an hour every day
and for you to finish your portfolio by
Friday that's what I expect and if you
need me to ask me a question once or
twice today when you get stuck I'm happy
to do that I've already thrown you off
one it's like guys I'm super serious
over here I came to protect mom on
everybody everyone knows you're cute and
fluffy and adorable but you got to go
like super reflection I wonder if
there's something wrong no it's just
you're just in denial there's no reason
for a cat to all of a sudden just become
super duper affectionate like he's he
he's been acting like if he doesn't sit
in your lap he is going to die okay
well that's not normal um all right so
start off tables with the table tag
right you have your table rail in this
case a table head tag and a of your
table data tag and your table row as
well all that's
review you can add a border to a table
and remember that you can nest these
things that this is different than the
he uh he's not sick he just loves me and
I mean he's sick
alright and now um so we have our table
we can set we can apply the same CSS all
three of these by just putting a comma
between them right what does this border
collapse thing let's check this out real
quick
Porter collapse
ah I see so this is a cool property I
didn't know this existed let's say you
didn't want to have border around the
whole thing like remember we're having
those - issues because we didn't set
Porter collapse to collapse see what it
removes it brings it all in together but
that's because they have a one pig's
portal or set in place that's the pixels
for the line how long that's supposed to
be remember the borders are going around
so if we made it 5 pixels there we go
like that you don't notice as as much
right
so um we also know about how to left
align things border spacing as well is
important if you want things to be
spaced out more
but this as this is a good point is that
you can't have collapse borders and have
borders facing because they're two
opposite things
all right you have the table we got call
spam what's call strand do again it's
like taking the head and putting it with
all the table data that you have yeah so
we'd expect based off how many calls
fans we have it takes up in this case
two spaces instead of one good the same
thing with roasts man takes up two rows
instead of one the difference between
row span and husband
so Rose so columns are vertical or
horizontal so you'll see here that this
one has a row span of two so it's twice
as high vertically in case anyone wanted
to know Bill Gates is five number
apparently schools that has it all right
so here we have a caption
you can add in there's a caption tag
such thing as a heading tag at the end
the day but you can add this outside of
the table room to decide if you want to
don't really sort that special style we
don't need to worry about that that ok
cool so that's tables basically
everything you should know caption is to
define the table caption the heading
essentially lists now remember a ordered
list an unordered list dots verses
numbered so it depends on the situation
that you want to use and you've nest
those in a ul for unordered in a well
for ordered by default you have a dot
there's also other types of styling for
that you can make your own custom one as
well but there's yeah it's list style -
type so let's go ahead and show an
example of one right now which one do
you want to see do you want to see
circle or square as well as none so
let's say you don't want the dots
it's list I'll - type minute just don't
start in here whereas a circle or square
see those well you'd have to style it
but seeing elsewhere right now we're not
styling it that's not the point of
today's lesson it's a circle example as
well you don't know how to do you I
would have to look it up that's the real
reason there's the thing you have to
learn about development is that you're
not gonna memorize everything but I know
I could bet my life on it that I could
at at most an hour I can do your life my
life that I could I'm gonna go get the
knife for your finish it to the test
uh yeah so uh
what is this so ordered it shown the
type attribute of the oil tag defines
the type of a list item marker
right
try and understand it once I got I don't
know what this is
so it starts from whatever you like
middle lower case next time uh I don't
know don't worry about this for now I
have to look into that a little bit more
let me actually copy this and I'll throw
it up and I get some contacts later
contacts Tyler
this is kind of cool so I like doing the
solar a lot of stupid that no one
actually uses so you have a description
list description list is a list of turns
with the description for each you have
your deals and then your DTS so here's a
and then and then our D D which is tag
that describes a sure
so the DL is the container the
description listed DT is a tag that
defines it and then a DV describes each
term I couldn't tell you why one way is
better than the other but that's a thing
I guess this long traces for
dictionaries so this shows you how you
can bring it all together to create a
horizontal list that that that you would
use for like your your menu so here we
have a you see list-style:none see how
it doesn't have the dots right let's
just start putting together the CSS then
it has no margin no padding
overflow:hidden background color but and
then we float them to the left and then
you do some other stuff and on hover
pseudo-class but this is a common way
that one might create a
like
alright chapter summary float:left
display:inline I remember when you
struggle with Talan yeah the first time
the very first time you meant to make a
menu I babyish I sure would things every
day this never gets easier you just get
harder things stuff that's hard it gets
easier and then you move on to harder
things that's all software it works ok
so block level elements so a block level
elements always starts on a new line
unless you have some CSS that changes
that and it takes up a full width so
takes up full width of what you need
that using Bach of almonds no I was
definitely saying block level element um
so there's inline elements do not start
up and only take us much width as
necessary now keep that in mind this is
really important in understanding block
level versus inline elements there's
something I get confused on from
actually I was messing around with that
this is Cooper going over this because I
am I'm really confused with block okay
so block elements things like headings
you ever notice how when you put an h1
tag in everything goes away it's on its
own line and there's nothing that's in
its space okay so let's let's look at
anything Oh we'll look at some examples
here basically a block level element
says hey I'm taking up the entire
hundred percent of with unless you tell
me not to in the CSS and I'm starting on
the new line so if I'm on this line and
I put a heading tag dropping down the
line and it's my now this block
level element in line element doesn't
take up it only takes up as much with as
it needs and it doesn't start on a new
line so you could have a anchor tag be
next to an anchor tag and it'll be on
the same line
but you can't have an h-1b next to an h2
on the same line they're both going to
take up the whole width because they
since they're taking it all up by
default so that's and it what about it
you say display:block is uh well
display:block means you're saying keep
assignment as a block element but by
default like divs for instance our block
elements so here if we were to go ahead
and unless we nested it but if we were
go go here ahead and create a div here
all right better yeah let's do an h1 so
we credit h1 tag is our heading tag
right and we'll put test and then we'll
create another h1 tag and we'll put test
- because headings are block elements
when we run this you see they're on
different lines and we can't actually
put anything in here it's not just cuz
there's some other in here it's
going to show it below it because our
this is a block level element it's
taking up this entire block that's
what's going on while the inline
elements like an examples of this would
be span which is like a div except in
line down limit it's a container but you
don't want it to be a block on this
whose span anchor tag an image
alright so grouping tags you have div
and you have span and there will be more
down than that as well when we get to
html5 we're covering all the basics of
HTML the class attribute so we already
talked about classes you know everything
about that weight CSS classes
you don't know how to classes not
applauses
that's all it's telling you this classes
and what they can do um I hear what's
banned on note so what is the span we
just were talking about and then the dot
note is a class so when it's a span so
you don't have to put span inside the
brackets for it to be spanned I know I
should put say that one time
so CI a-- has font size yes so you don't
have to do that first ban you can just
put it right in front uh no because if
we wanted it to be span comedy note it
would be form spans and notes what this
is saying is that when it is a span and
it has a class note make the font size
120% in color red so let's see I wanna
see at my squash sneaker
okay next section iframes so iframes are
used to display a web page within a web
page so you'll see here this is an
example of an iframe where this is I'm
actual web page that's displaying within
our overall web page that's cool um why
you may do this you don't really see
this all too often I've done it at work
- we haven't joined our applications
together yet but we wanted to look like
it did so we put a iframe in there and
it looked like it did ah not the best
example but that's one way and the way
it works you just have an iframe tag you
pass in the the source is where it's
located and that's it
and then of course you can set the width
and the height and all that sort of
stuff in the CSS or it's better doing
the CSS in here what is that like it
depends on what the pages so like right
here this is an example of a web page as
well such as Sun this is importing a
what more section
and border:none we're to get rid of that
you see it has a border my default has a
border but you probably don't want that
on looks janky I like the jiggy look
alright so let's see here the target you
can also trigger it so say we have an
iframe and it has a name this name is
gonna be so cool for my portfolio ya
little thing there and then they can
just click blank and then my portfolio
like example project that you shows up
right there yeah uh it's in what you're
talking about you'll do with JavaScript
and we'll make it very cool this would
be kind of strange way of doing it but
you can do this basic stuff with an
iframe and using target and name so name
and then the target that triggers the
name okay and all it's basically doing
is it'll have a default iframe and then
when you click target it's taking the
href that's in here and it's targeting
this name this variable almost and we're
resetting this for where the variable is
hmm now there are variables in HTML but
that's about as close as you'll get cool
so now we're talking about HTML
Javascript it's JavaScript but it's jut
it's just JavaScript at the end day
I don't know why they called
html/javascript I say Java screwed what
it all it is is it's showing you how to
do in line so you can do some things in
your HTML you can do some javascript in
HTML I guess that's what their point is
is that not good practice that usually
one son I don't say it's bad practice
but when you're when you're working with
with angular and and Express and and
reaction all these sorts of libraries
you'll be using their libraries but this
is a straight vanilla Jas stuff so what
this is saying so buttons have
attributes as well a lot of them and one
of the more common ones is on click so
this is saying on click document dot get
element by ID so this is this is what
I'm going to refer to as vanilla
Jas or vanilla JavaScript this is it's
JavaScript and pure its form before it's
been corrupted or changed it's a vanilla
bean yes so now we're moving into the
JavaScript stuff now this is JavaScript
that works in the Dom or the document
object model and what that basically
means is your HTML tags is the document
and we're changing the shape of
something in the HTML and so what this
is saying is hey the type of this button
is button don't worry about that but on
click meaning when we click this go
ahead and get the element here and then
change it to today's date this date
function is a JavaScript library and if
you call the date function and remember
functions denoted by by the parentheses
we'll go ahead and create the Tate and
time for our rat and you see the ID demo
get element by ID we're saying somewhere
on here on the document or on our web
page we want to get the ID demo mixin so
much.what it where is
right here CID is equal to down where is
it getting that information on click
when we click the button it's getting
the information it doesn't get it tell
them so the library dictates where it's
going wrong no there's no library the
doctor because that's that's JavaScript
this is a JavaScript function okay I
misunderstood then so the document is
our page get element by ID get element
by ID is the function that that allows
us to get an elements ID and the inner
HTML is text set the text of it so when
we click that what we're saying is go
ahead this first part is go and find the
demo ID somewhere on this webpage an ID
right here so it finds this that's this
first part right here it finds this and
then we're saying hey and this will make
more sensitive foot tests right here
I'll show you real quick so the that
what's in here the inner HTML is test
that's what the inner it that's the text
of it enter HTML so essentially what's
in between the two tags and what we're
doing is we're saying set that to
today's date so when we click this when
we click this it's going to go ahead and
replace it it's not going to add to it
or we're overriding the value so this is
one way of doing some basic vanilla
javascript in HTML little bean
vanilla vanilla JavaScript so another
thing that we can do is we can use a
script tag now you normally won't do
this but it's not bad to do it either so
you can create this script tag and with
the script tag is saying is hey between
this tag and this tag we have some
JavaScript that we're going to write or
otherwise it's not going to work now we
are able to it works in the HTML like it
what like we're doing for certain cases
but here we are setting the value to
hello JavaScript nothing's here right
but we're saying hey somewhere in our
webpage go find the ID demo and set
what's in it - hello JavaScript and the
script tag allows us to write the
JavaScript in between there
all right
so they talk about that you can also do
CSS changes this way so somewhere in our
webpage get the ID demo and dot style
saying target the style and the specific
way that we want to target the style is
setting the font size equal to 25 px and
here we're writing a function
Remer function stores our code so that
we can call it as many times as we want
and we're saying on our button on click
run our function so now instead of us
having to put all that into here all
we're doing is calling a function we
defined and when we click it it's going
to change this so all the stuff reminds
me of those like crackdown webpages are
like spamming and oh no this is
just showing you things that are part of
the library but let's say when you click
a button you want to turn green as you
check the box this could be one way that
you could do that or you want to show
your portfolio items right another way
that you can do that JavaScript is where
all the logic comes in but if you think
it you do it with JavaScript
if you it's if it's not telling it if
you're not telling it to always do
something you can make a rainbow with
Java is good yes so it's an interesting
question but Reading Rainbow
hey bricks welcome welcome hi bricks so
another thing that you can do is and
you'll learn this as you go and this is
a good example light on light off light
on light off light on light off and so
all we're doing here is worship we're
switching an image do you know what's it
like that what all that all that's
happening here is we're switching an
image based off some some logic and and
so we're saying look on click call the
light function passing was this called
again sure so the P
when we pass in something to a a
function P starts as a P it's not a
variable it's similar but not exactly
you can't pass a variable in here but
you passing it into a function means
that it is a parameter parameter that's
right so what's happening here is
remember our logic back in JavaScript
now is we're creating our function light
and we're saying hey our parameter what
we're calling SW here if it's equal to
zero when we call this function go ahead
and set the pick to the bulb all if it's
equal to one or else go ahead and set to
light a light bulb on so when we click
light on it's equal to one thus it sets
it to this image
if we click light off which is equal to
zero it sets it to the bulb off image oh
that's like the ones in years yeah David
make a double rainbow yeah hello Sun my
to-do list now I like the Reading
Rainbow is this him
yeah can can you remove me from the call
list please thank you all right so we're
taking our if statements and our else
statements and word are you right I've
been sick of those guys calling me so
rude they're just tongues doing their
job all right so I'm so you'll see here
that the way that we said it is we're
setting the variable pick and then we
are after this logic runs we are sitting
that you're Milo nice we're good but
we're getting the element by ID this is
how we find what we're looking for
yeah why does different why's it running
off of binary numbers it doesn't matter
what it's running off is just how it got
set up okay um typically you could do
true you could do false yeah I was
wondering anything you do boolean yeah
you do anything you'd you could put
hello world goodbye world as long as you
set up your logic to work off that okay
um one in zero zero is usually true one
is false
usually that goes wrong service also one
is true don't have it backwards
yeah well light on is true so I guess
one is true and zero is false I got back
it doesn't matter man look it up III I
 this up at work the other day
where I thought things are zero and one
week ago we could do some quick logic
we're right here let's go over nice time
after there's some other time we should
go over a logic
what do you mean this is all logic oh
you mean like there's something special
called logic yeah it sounds fancy
yeah all right come on everybody you've
worn daddy down up-up skin new whale oh
all right so but you see you see now uh
yeah so if we here I'll show you right
now so if we put ten in here and we put
100 or 11 in here and we change our
logic so that this is 10 we'd run it and
so 10 would be oh wait a second why
isn't that working oh my god I got it
backwards that's why so uh you'll see
light on I just messed this I've just I
sawed off these my mistake I started
over so 10 is bulb off and see it works
just fine it doesn't matter what you can
put it and we could just put in a test
and we could put in fire and we'll say
if is equal to test we want the bold to
be off run this and we go light on light
off light on light off so all that's
happening there is we are evaluating
very big what we're evaluating the the
function we're evaluating the parameter
that's coming in that's through the the
click event the on click event so that
makes sense yeah and the way you already
know about if statements and else
statements now you may have had trouble
putting this together because you're
knew this but this is what's called Dom
manipulation we're manipulating what's
in the document yeah is called Dom
manipulation document object model
manipulation mmm such a closet
video so all right uh
the no script tag is for straight path
welcome welcome
so the no script tag is for when your
browser doesn't support JavaScript which
is pretty rare nowadays so you don't
really need to worry too much about it
but because almost all browsers enable
JavaScript but back in the day server
our client-side rendering which is
JavaScript is JavaScript runs
client-side and and a lot of people that
back your Rebecca days when people are
really paranoid about the Internet
well like don't people talk on chats and
and they didn't they definitely didn't
stream video of themselves at their
 house and no all right well they
were all right I closed all pass so
we're talking a little bit about it so
remember we were talking about absolute
paths and their relative paths so there
are some things in here that will that
will
so they're there like this depending on
where the slashes and what you have in
here it will go your path is different I
guess so I'm trying to say so if it's if
it is in this case picture jpg and
there's no slash what that saying is if
it's in the same folder and I'll give
you an example let's bring up a folder
and we'll do I don't know images I'll do
this alright so here we are so if it
doesn't have a slash and this is where
the picture is located right save this
to for five stickers what that means is
that it's in here it's in the same
folder right it's in the same location
now if it does have a slash and it has a
slash picture jpg what that means is
it's in the next folder and so oh yeah
yeah so the images folder is here but
pictures dot jpg is in the images folder
now um excuse me I have that backwards
it is in the root level where it's at so
you've put a slash there it goes to the
root level which is where the document
goes here in the dot dot slash picture
JPEG it means it's one level behind
don't dunk me you'll play with that
you'll get it don't don't sweat that
that's something that you'll just test
it out and say this don't work and
say this don't work oh I get it now
don't sweat it um so but you know what
we talked about the importance of not
doing absolute fall fast so because your
images and your links will always break
because you're gonna develop locally and
then you'll put it somewhere else
oh we're deciding that yeah okay so not
only local look on only when you're
sending it out through a new website
well if you just do everything on a
relative path everything would work
always which is why you do it and you
only use absolutes if it's going to a
site that you're not all okay all right
I think that's what I just said you said
something what I meant to say all right
so we've talked about the head before in
the HTML document you have the style tag
as well the link tag which is how you
link your style sheet add the meta
element tag which is tops talks about
what character set is use and also lets
you put other data as well mainly you'll
just see meta charset utf-8 you don't
really need to worry about this usually
browsers will handle this but there are
some CSS benefits to doing this sort of
stuff as well I'm going to tell you
what's good CSI or once SEO what's good
SEO from bad SEO but there are there are
there is some something to that
so the meta is
a CEO thing
I'm sorry saying what I know I don't -
all right so you can also set the
viewport this is a little beyond you
right now but essentially if you don't
this is part of responsive design
if libraries and things like that do
exist you definitely need to do this
so this is what it looks like without
the viewport this is what looks with
like with the view part when you pull up
on your phone essentially you're just
trying to get you set a scale as well as
what width that you want that set to on
the device Center center don't worry too
much about that we've already talked
about how to get an ID and then set the
HTML of it the inner HTML is this
okay so
you can use the base URL so sit look at
this so see how this is html5 jiff here
see that the full path is w3schools icon
flash images slash html5 jiff but
because we set up base here in the head
this is pretty cool and I know this we
can actually just put html5 here because
we're saying hey assume that this is the
path for it okay cool omitting a channel
you can also omit this stuff you don't
have to have it in there in html5 anyhow
that D still needs a dog type so we
don't it we don't need the HTML tag we
don't need the body or the head tag you
can omit that stuff if you want I
wouldn't it just looks strange looks
like code pen yeah a little bit
oh I think it's a good place to start
stop before we move on to layout because
there's a lot this stuff I want to slow
down for everything else we've gone over
we tell you we showed a little bit about
the how to make that the harder concept
that that we got into today was you got
to see a little bit of how you would
manipulate your web page dynamically
with a zoom and with in JavaScript
JavaScript everything you've done before
then has been dealing with static
content content that's not changing on
your web page right for the most part
you can hover over something in the CSS
changes but that's actually stack as
well for the most part because we will
say it's dynamic but for the most part
everything you've done is static
JavaScript lets everything be unique
customizable and it could be anything
where it looks like the light bulbs
turning on - hey we wasn't really on oh
but you get the idea
how much time you put in coding every
day baby mm-hmm today just this so far
but she's going to put in another two to
three hours today yeah so usually I'll
put in between two hours two and a half
hours four hours so on average I would
say about two and a half hours oh really
does that count my hour above average
now it doesn't so three and a half hours
with the hour that we spend on here
above average for and when I'm doing
really great and I'm just on point nine
hours bitches hmm so I keep it PG so I
say sorry Rev I don't think great stars
liked my joke okay it's okay
my sister would have said the same thing
to me any other questions guys girls
people I like people
it's very inclusive uh how much time do
I put into coding daily well I'm a paid
developer so at least eight hours I put
in about 45 hours a week at work and
then I put in about this last month has
been a little strange because I've hurt
my hand I had surgery on it's getting
better now so I just started typing
again but typically if you count the
hour I'm doing with April seven days a
week
that's another seven that's 52 on the
weekends I usually put about we say
about tenth of the weekend five and five
well if you don't count YouTube
I'm full-time salaried developer after
the portfolio's built what is April
building next she's doing the algorithm
section
not counting the github we're talking
we're gonna have her move off code pin
and go into a text editor I'm gonna show
her the ins and the outs of a text
editor and so we're gonna do a couple
more projects after I get down with the
poor fellow
so after no portfolio are going to
refactor my clothes and then we're going
to move it there there's gonna be
another project within that project so
it's gonna be maybe like another week or
so with the portfolio page but yeah
after that we'll go into algorithms
thank you straight path yeah so I'm a
full-time developer um I wish I was
full-time freelance but uh maybe one day
I have a great job right now I could
never leave it for the what freelance
sketchiness there is in the world um
after portfolio is built I'm going to
have her transition to a text editor
show her than see outs and then I'm
going to explain the concept of git and
github and have her start committing her
stuff on there and when that is done
because that's probably a day to two
days of stuff and mind you I planned
that being Saturday and Sunday she is
going to refactor her code and do the
commits with that but then we are
jumping into the algorithms where she is
going to crash and burn as most people
do oh oh that's a movie crash and burn
with the
but she's really famous I can't recall
me well then I usually I totally grab
that that's the the game plan thus far
um I think it's three days finished
portfolio from where she's at um
hackers yeah yeah what did I just walk
into
she's my light zone of course yesterday
there's lots of dusters ago this is just
she just me being tired um is she gonna
host her for fully on the github page I
don't know I probably will have her
actually I'll probably just get her a oh
I'll probably just get her her own
website it's you know $5 for URL and
then five dollars a month for hosting
maybe I'll just have her throw it up on
mine probably not though it'll look more
official have with her having her own
that also gives her some something to
play around with which allows her to -
um we call it to remind me turn down
those settings on night book now
and I bust lose it it hackers uh
Vegas kind of movie ever really I love
that it inspired me oh I know it's
not funny but it was very inspiring -
like a 12 year old
a mile
miles the unsung here at least chucko
terrace he's like dude I've been able to
hang out with you guys
for a hundred days now
you know well has been in like super
chill mode we're just normally in shale
but now is like super child buddy
nightbot is killing it uh one thing guys
is make sure you join the Facebook group
ok code Tech and caffeine the link is in
the description below if you wanna
support me you can at patreon.com slash
coding tutorials 360 ok give you some
feedback on your portfolio sure man
this looks similar to my portfolio
all right so
um let's see what's going on here we'll
discuss a few things I used to be
straight path I used to be I don't know
if I have any more I'm sure if I went
back to my notes and recapped on a bunch
of the designs that I've done I'd be
able to get back into it all right so I
like that you have the responsive menu
with the with the the hover effects
hover effects are always nice and
definitely have to have um I like that
you plate that's a basic root
requirement now like the hover of course
um yeah bootstraps fine uh you can
always go back and make something better
uh one thing I would do is I'd probably
remove there's so much there's so much
space on here just cut it out make it a
little bit shorter let's see does this
go to
it goes to new page that's cool let's go
down a little bit
cool it jumps down you got a nice little
round picture a little about me nice
images uh just go to something
maybe have a tribute page yeah what's
this his own portfolio issue maybe not
have your portfolio page why that's what
I was gonna do Leon your portfolio page
unless it's going on another place it's
alright um your contact info that's good
free code can a nice little quote oh
yeah man I mean there's just a lot of
empty space I'd be my 1 main concern but
in terms of you know a nice rough first
project I like the pictures how come I
don't have pictures is this bootstrap
uh no no bootstrap is in pictures
bootstrap is like these buttons this
menu probably some of this seats uh the
font here is nice I like that you look
at some of this code uh yeah I can
there's nothing for CSS and HTML there's
not really anything to look at what's
the time it's right there changing the
editor yeah I mean you want me to
critique him you tell him how to
refactor this code make it better
understand uh okay well first and
foremost if we're going to do the real
critique you should have this non code
bin so the second thing is that if you
are going to use code fin you don't need
to have the body tag head tag HTML tag
all that stuff can be done in here
outside make it a little bit less messy
oh let's see here
tell you that up
one thing you could also do is I don't
really like the font color here why I
don't know it something about it looks
it looks too much like you accidentally
forgot that it was a link um and it's
looking like the hover effects cool if
you want to you want to add some Flair
you can add color your icons also it's
just a matter of just depends what you
want to do right
TIFF classic container
ah I don't think you need this you have
this class about idea about it's just
like an extra div you can actually
combine these two divs and it should
work just fine so it's like you're
saying less code is better good yeah
let's see through and this BR these to
be ours this is like I get what you want
to do you don't want it to have this
right here does the nav bar work yeah
does I tested it earlier these to be
ours
what you really should be doing instead
of getting this down is writing some CSS
up to push the HR alright just push the
h2 away that's what you should be doing
you shouldn't be throwing BR tags in
here well I get some padding in there be
excited about it too when you do it oh
hey
same thing with this BR this is this
would look really bad to someone who's
looking through your code to see you do
this because what it basically says is
that hey I'm having issues with CSS when
they see something like that at least
that's the that's the whole point of it
right here anyhow um so see
title target --blank alts oh that's good
hey buddy but do the roads I encourage
everyone to get familiar with the
bootstrap column grid system one thing I
would say here is if you're going to use
bootstrap you might want to actually
everything in here is calm and take up
12 and maybe you actually want to float
think something to the right or so
taking up the whole thing with a take up
the whole row maybe you want to have
such things that are not taking up so
much all right I guess actually because
it's almost like it's not responsive is
what I'm trying to say oh what he's
trying to say is this is a designer's
point of view this is the terminology
for it this is what I did learn is that
there's white space and black space and
when someone is looking at your
portfolio it's not about just the
technique anymore it's about your layout
so you have to make your layout
appealing while making your code work so
that's when it comes with the web
development but at the same time you
also have to be when you're making your
portfolio page you have to be aware of
the aesthetic that you're going to put
into your code so that it looks you know
like legit code even though it's not
that movie deal yeah but on oh man good
job I know I know it's hard getting this
done especially when you're new you see
me trying to push April to get her son
in the next yeah Congrats for you so
super jelly over here I have no jelly I
have no doubt that you worked hard on it
but uh I like the code the code is nice
is it nice yeah yeah I mean it's my
perspective it looks nice I like that I
like they eat I like to use the footer
tag here this is really cool um so I uh
good job man keep up the good work and
hopefully you'll get it up and 15 days
in it she's giving solid advice that's
how we do it man
oh hey you know what that's just be
closed oh my goodness did you do this
yes s yourself because there is a whole
lot of stuff you went above and beyond
for getting things to be responsive not
responsive but working all browsers um
get on yeah look at that
April makes design come - I told you she
can post on my channel man I don't know
so yeah I took a lot of designer classes
I actually have it like a design
portfolio and if my favorite topic is
black and white space that's my favorite
topic that I can go on and on in days
about black and white space and how it
takes you know 30 seconds or less for an
eye to see the difference between a
black and white space and how
aesthetically appealing you can make it
just by using those two elements within
each other it's it's incredible it
really is anyways but uh alright guys
that that's our hour today I'm going to
go do something else I guess I'm good
gonna do um thank you to Dennis for
giving this opportunity to call my code
I know it's a little intimidating
putting it out there and you know um
yeah because it you know we work hard
and sometimes and you asked for
constructive feedback you putting
yourself out there and it's it's same
thing with YouTube for Dillons
constructive feedback that's very
courageous I don't even do that and and
forced so
Hey yeah but thank you for doing that I
wish everyone the the best of luck in
their own coding adventures and as
always thank you for watching don't
forget to comment like subscribe and
share and show these videos let's make
this don't what don't you you know make
let's make this channel grow guys one
last question all right Eddie well I'll
answer this what resources did I use to
get through the algorithms intermediate
and advanced um so I basically just went
through the soap exactly what we did
right now in HTML here we're going to do
in the JavaScript section where we're
going to we're going to basically before
you can know how to solve an algorithm
once you get past the basic the basic
isn't too bad you use the whiteboards
have a video talking about how to get
better at solving algorithms but the
other thing is you have to know what's
already built in JavaScript to make it
easier on yourself so when I decided I
was going to learn free code camp I went
through all of this piece by piece
exactly what we saw with that April and
I doing and we've been doing this two
days now basically and we're only two
layouts and we have a whole mess other
things to go so I encourage you to go
through piece by piece until you
remember hey I can do this and then you
take oh what is that thing that was in
JavaScript
maybe it'd be helpful so that you at
least know it's possible and then when
you need it at least you know where to
go to go get it yeah um but also
whiteboarding drawing it out see
following your logic and seeing okay
this iteration means that this value is
for this iteration now on the second one
means it's seven three and then
following your own logic until you see
oh this is where it's broken because
you'll have a rough idea how to
implement it but it you'll usually have
a couple kinks in it and until you can
see the kinks and it's hard when you're
just getting started you're going to
need actually draw it out and that's why
I encourage you to do all right
that's the last question I'm not I'm
closing chat now
even looking if anything else saw so uh
it's on the screen damn it uh thank you
for watching guys join the Facebook
group Co Tech and caffeine some big
announcements coming pretty soon that
are gonna be there as well and mines
will be blown computers as well um if
you want to support me a can i patreon
that's always dope and uh I'll see you
guys next time remember guys code long
and prosper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
