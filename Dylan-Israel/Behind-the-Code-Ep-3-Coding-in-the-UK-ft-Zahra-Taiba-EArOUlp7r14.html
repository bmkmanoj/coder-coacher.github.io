who is a developer at Bloomberg in
London in you know the UK so I thought
it was pretty cool that she was actually
stepped up last minute she had like five
minutes notice because our developer we
were gonna interview unfortunately was
sick so I asked if any but I knew would
step up and she did so thank you to her
for doing that it's really really cool
we're going to talk about her job
internships we can talk about going to
hackathons she's also a an admin for
hackathon hackers which has 45 thousand
members on facebook we talked about that
and we talked a little bit about the the
female perspective being in a
male-dominated workplace is I think it's
really important to get a different
perspective on things but I hope you
guys enjoy this and thank you to her
again for stepping up in our time of
need but uh enjoy I know I had a good
time talking with her code everything ok
so good hey there's nothing when two
developers come together we can't
accomplish malla oh thank you so much
for stepping in last minute like this
wards and unfortunately our guest for
the day basically forgot it because
you've been sick all week i guess and so
can I dips ended about five minutes
before we supposed to go live and so I
was trying to find a developer I
appreciate you so much taking the time
no worries I'm always just talking about
anyway ok I know oh all this developers
are lurking on line one way or the other
right yep uh would you mind introducing
yourself to a few people and maybe
talking a little bit about a your
current job or experience and software
no my name's ora I am a software
developer based in London I work for
Bloomberg I'm actually a new grad so I
started work in august and i work in
their mobile team so i work on the iOS
up for customers and i also do some
place in
ja accepted I'm doing recently and I
also admin hack upon hackers and pack
bond hackers Europe which eats up the
rest of my spare time but yeah that's
essentially what you're fine you're
doing nice yeah so um for the gut for
you guys soon you don't know I I I
constantly am preaching about like invit
diving into coding whether it be meetups
but one of the other great thing said I
parsley am a part of is a Facebook group
so like hackathon hackers is uh what she
was just talking about coding newbies is
another one I'm a part of and I think
free code camp Los Angeles but the the
hackathon hackers has what like 45,000
people that's a lot of people waiting to
be accepted well it's an interesting
junk yeah nice yeah and that that's one
of those things that I think is pretty
cool when you put something like that on
your resume where it's like a you know I
like that like that shows that you're
committed to the kind of the software
grind yeah um I kind of fell into the
hole tech community outside of work and
university thing a couple years ago I
started off and attending backbone and
then just gradually working my way up to
organizing one and then just kind of
admitting a group of 45,000 people who
like hack ball so that was that was
interesting yeah nice now I what do you
mean you kind of felt you just went to a
hackathon it was like yo man I think I
like this yeah basically and so I was in
my second year of university or college
as you have it and we in the UK we do
three year bachelor's well then fall I
went there after a year of uni having
heard of some other people go to these
like hack fun event things and thought
hey maybe I should try without you know
can hurt I went and then I kind of
didn't stop attending but like the next
year or so I went to a ridiculous number
looking back but yeah and essentially
from there attended a few more started
volunteering other
peoples and then ended up running one in
collaboration with another unit at
wiring so that I was quite fun nice No
so you say you're working in iOS do you
have any have you actually worked on any
of your own sort of like side project
apps or anything like that I have in the
past and by not so much these days and a
dream video training but before that I
just I do a lot of experimentation I'm
very bad with slide project so you never
quite finished them however there is why
my wife during past it was an Android
app which is actually how I sort of fell
into my job and it was so essentially in
UK and surgeons who are in training have
to block all their training into this
national database and essentially that
was only one up available and it wasn't
let's say very user friendly so I went
along and partnered up with the doctor
from the NHS to work on that and then
they took me up and yeah it was thinking
um so I see here that you were a
software in turn development intern at
Bloomberg and then it looks like you got
hired with the same company a little
while later is their kind of a story
along with that her I did I mean so it's
quite funny the first hackable know I
went to was actually in their offices
completely independently of that I
applied okay I came to my office I love
it I bet you ran I think a really cool
hi and yeah what just went through the
process got that job and ended up in a
really great team in mobile team I
really enjoyed it and arch during the
internship Noah yeah we'd love you to
come back and actually um it's not quite
that simple either so I was actually
meant to be doing a four year degree but
then so I was going to do a masters but
then in my third year I was like you
know what I felt like I was learning a
lot more
on the job then I was at University I
figured i'll just leave with the
bachelors I'll just go back to work and
I was like retaining that kinda like
yeah sure Here I am and I do feel like
I'm learning a lot more yeah they there
that's one of the things I always tell
people it's like there's always this
like oh man I just want to live that
digital Nomad lifestyle but you really
learned so much being in a workplace
that you have to kind of work yourself
up to that you're not just gonna
graduate and then before you know it
you're just gonna be yeah man I'm just a
freelance developer never stepped a day
in an office it doesn't necessarily work
like that exactly like a look at when
you're at university or self-teaching
essentially when you're at university
you're mainly self-teaching when it
comes to software development which is a
big thing that led to me leaving
slightly early but the thing is you
don't realize how much you're missing
out on in terms of people's experience
in terms of like learning about clean
code how to structure code properly how
to work that scale all of these things
like it's a lot less likely you'll have
someone looking over your code and
giving you pointers and things like that
then it is when you're at work face I uh
absolutely yeah I see that you have a BS
in computing what is is that different
than like computer science what what is
that what does that sort of feel
computing it's hadna cool thing
basically because i was on computer
science course essentially it's like a
real technical detail I didn't do a
dissertation as part of my third year
instead I just did research so if you
don't do Asian they'll give you a
computing degree world you can be
science degree although I would argue
research is possibly more scientific
than building enough and writing a long
essay about it there we go yeah i'm not
i'm not one for formal education I kind
of think that it has its pitfalls but
it's part of the world we live in
unfortunately at times yeah what is the
software scene like because uh I've
never been to the London are the UK is
it is there a big like software tech
community
London as a very big star sock community
actually I say working much company but
yeah that's like in terms as much
companies we don't have quite as many
situated in the UK so the startup scene
is really driving obviously and London
is like basically the financial center
of Europe for the time being we'll see
how that goes in a year or two thanks
Theresa May yeah but so a lot of
startups around here are focused on
fintech and a lot of the world's like
most or well Europe's at least most
well-known and financial startups are
based in you in London that's quite cool
and it's very easy to network will find
out more about lot cool companies yeah I
see that you may need a coat the coding
curriculum you made a textbook you want
talk about that a little bit it was in a
textbook so this was een of us project
actually which was really awesome it was
a great thing for them to include so
essentially in the UK and when i started
my degree no one was really studying
coding until they got to unjust free
university yes so like um hold 16 17
years old unless they took it unless
they somehow decided to take in had it
available at their school at like 15
which was the earlier spreading so we
didn't really have the benefit of
knowing anything about computer science
or coding as we were getting older when
we were in our younger years so like
primary school and stuff like that so
you recently the government decided
everyone should learn how to code when
they're in school and they're quite
young I'm not sure how old they are but
it's sort of like 11-12 from that age
sorted I'll if not a bit younger so it's
actually mandatory now for them to teach
this at every school in the country so
we put together and some materials for
some things to be able to
landings um outside of using a computer
so teaching and computational thinking
and just some Python syntax as well to
go along with that and essentially guide
them through and get them to the stage
where they could code a simple game of
hangman and like you sauce off and
you're thinking okay literally how am I
gonna teach hope without a computer this
is nothing but you just think about it
and there's so much to compute science
into coding that just doesn't involve
actually writing things in your terminal
in your text editor and running them
there's just an entire way of thinking
but you realize doesn't necessarily come
naturally okays that make them we would
want to do that ironically my first talk
was basically about how I used to hide
under a desk and not want to speak
publicly and then when I got into hack
phones that actually helped me out more
so that's one of the things about going
to computing event some things like that
you get to talk to people about things
you know about your that you're
passionate about and that takes away a
lot of the fear or the nervousness the
more might have about public speaking so
that's just a great way again speaking
if you want go to meet ups present
something to people that you've worked
um oh and it'll be a lot easier than
doing it otherwise nice no um I'm very
glad to hear that they're making all the
children and the UK for the most part
learning how to code like it or at least
be introduced to it um youth as a female
in a primarily male dominated employment
it's like in the United States it's like
nine it's like ninety percent min ten
percent females that kind of the same in
the UK when it comes to developers and
the kind of software environments i
would say so i think is like 20 then
maybe i'm not sure i'd enemy stats but
that's what it feels like that yeah i
mean
i doing I don't hey big issue with being
female in this industry and I'm not sure
how different it is between the UK and
us that most people are extremely
respectful and it just doesn't make
difference yeah occasional be that one
thing where it's like wait but um
otherwise it's not really being too much
of an issue for me okay oh yeah cuz I
was um I have a very unique standpoint
cuz to me I've I've it's like it we only
work with like men like because we're a
small team we have about four developers
and like I always wonder like and we're
saying sometimes think inappropriate
things that if if we had other of you
know other other genders in there i'm
wondering like I wonder how that would
change the dynamic but it in the real
work place you need to be have
necessarily equal but if I always wonder
like how it is from the other side right
like how because if I was if I was a if
I was in a different industry primarily
female-dominated I try to think like
what would it be if like I i walked in i
was just like a like what you guys
talking about like certain nights any
sort of things were as a cuz i have no
idea what it's like to be and I you know
a gender dominated field anything that
kind of stands out or nothing at all
Irene for me is quite funny because um
since I was like when I was between 11-3
was 11 or 10 11 to 18 I was actually in
an all-girls school they then they then
one I started University and they were
like a hundred 100 of us and then
they're like 10 girls maximum and it was
like but it just didn't just didn't feel
that way I know that a lot of um women
may or may not be comfortable obviously
I can't generalize I'm one woman like I
can't be for all of us oh yes one uh um
in my experience it didn't make too much
a difference yeah I'm glad to hear that
because it I always I want to ask the
question cuz obviously I you know I'm
coming from the other side of the coin
and I want I would like to know I could
could you tell me about the circuit sort
of going to an all-girls school do you
think there's any benefit or any
detriment or anything about that I I
mean I can't really remember being at
home school too much but i think the
research and stuff says this is me
completely going up my memory right now
opal joints like anything wrong is very
likely but i feel that a lot of research
suggests that when girls are in all the
girls schools they still a lot more
comfortable and speaking up especially
in science classes and i think that's
something that could impact on it i mean
so my year group at school was quite
small there are about thirty six of us
and i was one of two girls taking
physics at the end of school when we
were 17 essentially so i honestly can't
say it's not like a cure-all have like a
gospel that obviously like a lot of
girls with doing biology at school
actually more than half of the year were
doing a balls-up but you know it's also
just the culture of what you put forward
so i didn't actually know what computer
science was until I was about 17 I'll
actually didn't know i didn't think
about it if you ask me what it was I
feel like I don't you don't know I can't
even if gibeon giving you the stereotype
herbs like guys in a basement you know
creating away what tied the vine yeah I
literally didn't know that's all I just
never thought about it either and that's
a big book or I think on women wanting
you enter the industry just not
necessarily that they have this
stereotype but just because it's not a
career option that was presented to them
necessarily or and they don't have the
idea what that is but hopefully like as
we talked about earlier especially in
the UK
I'm introducing it oh yeah the
curriculum will hopefully help out yeah
and I I do I hope they follow a similar
path in the United States unfortunately
 move so slow here but i would i
would love to see is even even my
audience like my audience 89% male
eleven percent female and it's like we
need to get everyone involved because we
need as many good developers as we can
have and just introducing people to the
field you know software is probably one
of the safest industries to get into in
general and it's just like we're half
the market of developers isn't
necessarily being targeted in the united
states so i'm glad to hear that the kind
of change in that up in the UK um when
talking about like air and interview
process that you went through add you
know any sort of software jobs did they
focus a lot on data structures or
algorithms Ernie any like what was what
was happening in your interview process
yeah data structures and algorithms are
like the biggest section I'll focus on
um it really depends between companies
but I found with like larger companies
it's very much you just get the
technical question and you have to
explain it but even then it's like such
a split in some cases they'll be like
testing a few different areas with
smaller questions and then in another
company they'll like throw a massive
problem at you which basically requires
you to have that knowledge and put in
contacts whereas with smaller companies
and startups I found there was very much
more they wanted you to send them your
code and like show them how you
structured it and putting challenges
where you build something not
necessarily Oh solve this problem but
build this product that can do this
thing essentially if you see ya um so we
actually have a subscriber who's from
the UK in here right now and he wants to
know where when you were going to
hackathons up if you if you still go or
don't go um where can he find sort of
hackathons and meetups
or where did you at least find your
hackathons and meetups okay so I mainly
I don't actually remember who I found
the that's when I ever went to but
I don't know if you've heard of majorly
hacking i have i have actually what it's
like um the official a colleague in the
US and europe in mexico and various
other places around the world but
essentially they have quite a selection
and i know a lot of the organizers of
those and there are all of the country
now so if you go to I think it's LH dot
io / EU it might be searching anything
yeah so if you go there um there are
events running throughout the university
season 3 right University goer and there
are also other Facebook groups such as
hack from hackers Europe which will have
ones of anyone who wants to attend as
well um so yeah I mean I admin that so
shameless self-promotion some respect
but also meetup com is quite good for
these things as like the hackathons and
jams group I think that's what I cool
it's called basically online communities
are the best way blend these things
really special thanks to our sponsor dev
mountain if you're interested in coding
boot camp why don't you check them out
where they include housing alongside
their tuition so you can get up go and
immerse yourself in the environment if
you want to support me go over to
