who is a developer at Bloomberg in
London in you know the UK so I thought
it was pretty cool that she was actually
stepped up last minute she had like five
minutes notice because our developer we
were gonna interview unfortunately it
was sick so I asked if anyone I knew
would step up and she did so thank you
to her for doing that it's really really
cool we're gonna talk about her job
internships we're gonna talk about going
to hackathons she's also a an admin for
hackathon hackers which has 45,000
members on Facebook we talked about that
and we talked a little bit about the the
female perspective being in a
male-dominated workplace is I think it's
really important to get a different
perspective on things but I hope you
guys enjoy this and thank you to her
again for stepping up in our time of
need but enjoy I know I had a good time
talking with her code everything okay
there's nothing when two developers come
together we can't accomplish oh thank
you so much for stepping in last minute
like this and unfortunately our our
guest for the day basically forgot it
because you've been sick all week I
guess and so can I dip set it about five
minutes before we supposed to go live
and so I was trying to find a developer
I appreciate you so much taking the time
I know all this developers are lurking
online one way or the other right yep Oh
would you mind introducing yourself to a
few people and maybe talking a little
bit about your current job or experience
and software my name's Sarah I am a
software developer based in London I
work for Bloomberg I'm actually a new
grad so I started work in August and I
work in their mobile team so I work on
the iOS app for customers and I also do
some Python the jar
excessive doing really I'm not
I also admin hack upon hackers and
hackathon hackers Europe which it's not
the rest of my spare time I'm doing nice
yeah so um for the guy for you guys who
don't know I I I constantly am preaching
about like invit diving into codeine
whether it be meetups but one of the
other great thing said I partially am a
part of is Facebook group so like
hackathon hackers as what she was just
talking about coding newbies is another
one I'm a part of and I think free code
camp Los Angeles but the the hackathon
hackers has what like 45,000 people so
there's a lot of people waiting to be
nice yeah and that that's one of those
things that I think is pretty cool when
you put something like that on your
resume where it's like a you know I like
that like that shows that you're
committed to the kind of the software
grind yeah I kind of fell into the whole
tech community outside of work and
university thing a couple years ago I
started off and attending a hack fun and
then just gradually working my way up to
organizing one and then just kind of
admitting a group of 45,000 people who
like hackathon so that was interesting
yeah nice now I what do you mean you
kind of felt you just went to a
hackathon and was like yo man I think I
like this yeah basically and so I was in
my second year of university college as
you have it and we I'm in the UK we do
three-year bachelor's rather than four I
went there after a year of uni having
heard of some other people go to these
like hackathon event things and thought
hey maybe I should try one out you know
couldn't hurt
I went and then I kind of didn't stop
attending like the next year or so I
went to a ridiculous number looking back
but yeah and essentially from there
attended a few more started volunteering
at other
fools and then ended up running one in
collaboration with another uni at my own
so that was quite fun nice now
so yeah you say you're working in iOS do
you have any have you actually worked on
any of your own sort of like side
project apps or anything like that I
have in the past and sorry not so much
these days and I've been video training
but before that I just I do a lot of
experimentation I'm very bad with my
project so you never quite finished then
however there is why my work during past
it was an Android app which is actually
how I sort of fell into my job and it
was so essentially in UK and surgeons
who are in training have to log their
training into this national database and
essentially that was only one up
available and it wasn't let's say very
user friendly so I went along and
partnered up with the doctor from the
NHS to work on that and then they took
so I see here that you were a software
intern development intern at Bloomberg
and then it looks like you got hired
with the same company a little while
later is there kind of a story along
with that her I did I mean so it's quite
funny the first a couple I went to was
actually in their offices completely
independently of that I applied okay I
love it thank you Ron I think what just
went through the process got that job
ended up in a really great team in the
mobile team I really enjoyed that
I just arch during the internship no
yeah we'd love you to come back and
actually um it's not quite that simple
either so I was actually meant to be
doing a four year degree but then so I
was going to do a master's but then in
my third year I was like you know what I
felt like I was learning a lot more
on the job then I was at university I
figured I'll just leave with the
bachelors and I'll just go back to work
and I was like waiting back here and I
do feel like I'm learning a lot more
yeah I think there that's one of the
things I always tell people it's like
there's always this like oh man I just
want to live that digital nomad
lifestyle but you really learned so much
being in a workplace that you have to
kind of work yourself up to that you're
not just gonna graduate and then before
you know it you're just gonna be yeah
man I'm just a freelance developer never
slept a day in an office it doesn't
necessarily work like that exactly like
when you're at university or self
teaching essentially when you're at
university you're mainly self teaching
when it comes to software development
which is a big thing that led to me
leaving slightly early but the thing is
you don't realize how much you're
missing out on in terms of people's
experience in terms of like learning
about clean code how to structure your
code properly how to work that scale all
of these things like it's a lot less
likely you'll have someone looking over
your code and giving you pointers and
things like that then it is when you're
at the workplace I yeah I see that you
have a BS in computing what is is that
different than like computer science
what what is that what does that sort of
feel computing it's happening cool thing
basically because I was on computer
science course essentially it's like a
real technical detail I didn't do a
dissertation as far my third year
instead I just did research so if you
don't do they'll give you a computing
degree Rob you can be a science degree
although I would argue research is
possibly more scientific than building
enough and writing a long essay about it
there we go yeah I'm not I'm not one for
formal education I I kind of think that
it has its pitfalls but it's part of the
world we live in unfortunately at times
yeah what does the software seem like
because I I've never been to London or
the UK is it is there a big like
software tech community
as a very big startup community actually
I say working yeah that's like in terms
of much companies we don't have quite as
many situated in the UK so we the
startup scene is really driving
obviously and London is like basically
the financial center of Europe for the
time being we'll see how that goes and I
like your - thanks Theresa May yeah but
so a lot of startups around here I'm
focused on FinTech and a lot of the
world's like most or well Europe's at
least most well-known and financial
startups are based in in London that's
quite cool and it's very easy to network
we'll find out more about lots cool
companies yeah I see that you may need a
code the coding curriculum in a textbook
we'll talk about that a little bit it
was in a textbook so this was university
project actually which was really
awesome it was a great thing for them to
include so essentially in the UK and
when I started my degree no one was
really studying coding until they got to
unjust pre-university yes so like um 16
17 years old unless they took it unless
they somehow decided to take in had it
available at their school at like 15
which was the earlier reading so we
didn't really have the benefit of
knowing anything about computer science
or coding as we were getting older when
we were in our younger years so like
primary school and stuff like that so
you recently the government decided
everyone should learn how to code when
they're in school and they're quite
young I'm not sure how old they are
it's sort of like eleven twelve from
that age sorted not a bit younger so
it's actually mandatory now for them to
teach this at every school in the
country so we put together and some
materials some things to be able to
and outside of using a computer so
teaching and computational thinking and
just some Python syntax as well to go
along with that and essentially just
guide them through and get them to the
stage where they could code a simple
game of hangman and like you sauce off
and you're thinking okay literally how
am I gonna teach without a computer this
is nothing but think about it and
there's so much to computer science into
coding that just doesn't involve
actually writing things in your terminal
in your text editor and running them
there's just an entire way of thinking
but you realize doesn't necessarily come
naturally that main thing we would want
to do that ironically my first talk was
basically about how I used to hide under
a desk and might want to speak publicly
and then when I go into a cons that
actually helped me out more so that's
one of the things about going to
computing events and things like that
you get to talk to people about things
you know about your that you're
passionate about and that takes away a
lot of the fair or the nervousness the
more might have about public speaking so
that's just a great way again speaking
if you want go to meetups present
something to people that you've worked
and it'll be a lot easier than doing it
otherwise nice no I'm I'm very glad here
that they're making all the children in
the UK for the most part learning how to
code like it or at least be introduced
to it um youth as a as a female in a
primarily male-dominated employment is
like in the United States it's like 9
it's like 90 percent men 10 percent
females that kind of the same in the UK
when it comes to developers and the kind
of software environments I would say
said I think is like 20 then maybe gosh
I don't have any stats but that's what
it feels like but yeah I mean
I don't I don't a big issue with being
female in this industry and I'm not sure
how different is between the UK in the
u.s. that most people are extremely
respectful and it just doesn't make
difference yeah occasional about one
thing where it's like wait
but um otherwise it's not really being
too much of an issue for me yeah cuz I
always I have a very unique standpoint
cuz to me I've it's like a we only work
with like men like cuz we're a small
team we have about four developers and
like I always wonder like and we're
saying sometimes think inappropriate
things that if if we had other you know
other other genders in there I was
wondering like I wonder how that would
change the dynamic but it in the real
workplace you need to be have
necessarily equal but if I always wonder
like how it is from the other side right
like how because if I was if I was a if
I was in a different industry primarily
female dominated I try to think like
what would it be if like I walked in and
I was just like hey like what you guys
talking about like sir any sort of
things for as a cuz I have no idea what
it's like to be and I you know a gender
dominated field anything that kind of
stands out or nothing at all I mean for
me is quite funny because um since I was
like when I was between eleven there was
a eleven or ten eleven to eighteen I was
actually in an all-girls school they
then they don't start University and
there were like a hundred a hundred of
us and then oh like ten girls maximum
and it was like but it just didn't just
didn't feel that way I know that a lot
of um women may or may not be
comfortable obviously I can't generalize
I'm like I can't be for all of us
oh yeah definitely um in my experience
it didn't make him
two difference yeah I'm glad to hear
that because it I always I want to ask
the question because obviously I you
know I'm coming from the other side of
the coin and I would like to know could
could you tell me about the circuit sort
of going to an all-girls school do you
think there's any benefit or any
detriment or anything about that I mean
I can't really remember being at primary
school too much but I think the research
and stuff says this is me completely
going up in memory right now I apologize
like any mom is very likely but I feel
that a lot of the research suggests that
when girls are in all-girls schools
they've still a lot more comfortable and
speaking up especially in science
classes and I think that's something
that could impact on it I mean so my
year group at school was quite small
there are about thirty-six of us and I
was one of two girls taking physics beer
and school when we were 17 essentially
so I honestly can't say it's not like a
cure-all like all that obviously like a
lot of girls with doing biology at
school actually more than half of the
year were doing advanced not you know
it's also just the culture of what you
put forward so I didn't actually know
what complete science was until I was
about 17 I literally didn't know I
didn't think about it if you asked me
what it was I'd be like you don't know I
can't even if give you giving you the
stereotype that herbs like guys in a
basement you know I literally didn't
know that's all I just never thought
about it either
and that's a big book I think on women
wanting you enter the industry just not
necessarily that they have this
stereotype but just because it's not a
career option that was presented to them
necessarily or and they don't have the
idea what that is but hopefully like as
we talked about earlier especially in
the UK
I'm introducing it in the curriculum oh
I can help out yeah and I I do
I hope they follow a similar path in the
United States unfortunately moves
so slow here but uh I would I would love
to see because even even my audience
like my audience eighty-nine percent man
eleven percent female and it's like we
need to get everyone involved because we
need as many good developers as we can
have and just introducing people to the
field you know software is probably one
of the safest industries to get into in
general and it's just like we're half
the market of developers isn't
necessarily being targeted in the United
States so I'm I'm glad to hear that the
kind of change in that up in the UK um
when talking about like an interview
process that you went through at you
know any sort of software jokes did they
focus a lot on data structures or
algorithms ernie any like what was what
what's happening in your interview
process yeah data structures and
algorithms are like the biggest section
I'll focus on um it really depends
between companies but I found with like
larger companies it's very much you just
get the technical question and you have
to explain it but even then there's like
such a split in some cases they'll be
like testing a few different areas with
smaller questions and then in another
company they'll like throw a massive
problem at you which basically requires
you to have that knowledge and put in
contacts whereas with smaller companies
and startups I found there was very much
more they wanted you to send them your
code and like show them how you
structured it and putting challenges
where you build something not
necessarily I solve this problem that
build this product that can do this
thing essentially if you see yeah so we
actually have a subscriber who's from
the UK in here right now and he wants to
know where when you were going to
hackathons of if you if you still go or
don't go where can he find sort of
hackathons and meetups
or where did you at least find your
hackathons and meetups okay so I mainly
I don't actually remember away bound
that's when I ever went to but I don't
know if you've heard of majorly hacking
I have I have actually yeah it's like um
official colleague in the US and Europe
and Mexico and various other places
around the world but essentially they
have quite a selection and I know a lot
of the organizers of those and there are
all over the country now so if you go to
I think it's NH dot IO /eu it might be
such a yeah yeah so if you go there um
there are events running throughout the
university season 3 right a university
goer there are also other Facebook
groups such as hack bomb hackers Europe
which will have ones of anyone who wants
to attend as well so yeah I mean I admin
that so shameless self-promotion
some respect but also meetup.com is
quite good for these things there's like
the hackathons and jams group I think
that's what it cool it's called
basically online communities the best
way to find these things really special
thanks to our sponsor dev Mountain if
you're interested in coding boot camp
why don't you check them out where they
include housing alongside their tuition
so you can get up go and immerse
yourself in the environment if you want
