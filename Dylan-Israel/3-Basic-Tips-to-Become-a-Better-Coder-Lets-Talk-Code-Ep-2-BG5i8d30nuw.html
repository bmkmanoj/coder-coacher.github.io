questions and comments dying dying to
know where I get all my cool gaming
shirts but that's a different story what
we're going to talk about today is how
to become a better programmer when
you're just starting out how to really
say look I understand the code that I'm
writing and the or that you're writing
but I can't seem to break it down
mentally how to get to that next level
as a programmer so I could solve
problems how it can become easier for me
to learn so that's what we're going to
be talking about today and the first
thing that I highly suggest you I've had
every every mentor I have ever had every
teacher every professor ever ever every
boss always suggest visualizing the
process what is it that I'm trying to do
so in the case of let's repeat a string
so many times don't start writing the
code out take out a pen and paper or
whiteboard whiteboards are amazing i
highly suggest you in a white board and
start drawing it out be like okay draw a
word say hello world and i want it two
times hello world hello world how do i
get to that process and draw it out and
maybe you need to just write hello world
x 2 equals hello world hello world okay
that's a place to start and from that
visualization the juices will get
turning and you'll start figuring it out
it will help every time every time I ask
for a problem half the time as for help
for a problem half the time by the time
I'm done asking and keep on trying to
phrase it correctly and it helps me to
visualize it I figured it out I'm like
oh never mind and this can have this
will help you become the next level of
how do I figure a problem out just by
drawing it out word for word doesn't
have to be in code just draw out
logically and then try to figure out
each a little bit how to get there so
the next thing is documentation and what
I mean by that is all these great
programming languages Java JavaScript
Python Ruby C++ all of them they all
help have amazing documentation some
better than others but if you're trying
to code something with an array you need
to know what you can do with an array in
that language you need to know what
there's built-in because you may be
spending all this time trying to grow
something or build something that may or
may be already be built in it's already
function of method and you just need to
go ahead and and ask and read through
just don't scan the code read through
and fully understand what the
documentation does and what it can do
for you use it to your advantage there's
no shame in not writing someday if
there's already built in into the
library that's what it's all about right
the most efficient code you can invest
code and coat that works and last but
not least comments comment everything I
mean that if there's a variable comment
if there's an if statement comment if
there's a for loop coming if you're
creating new object comment comment what
it does and why it's needed so this is a
count variable in this int keeps track
of count for this for loop de terminator
this wallet determinate and then you
know while this is true keep on
concatenating the string keep on adding
the string on to the end and comment
everything not necessarily because
you're going to forget this moment but
when you go back months from now a year
from now even a week from now you're
going to be trying to remember what is
what are these hundred lines of code do
I don't fully remember and you're gonna
spend most your time scanning your code
going step by step aside just reading
the comments the comments need to be
there so that if you were to print out
your program you can organize the
comments to a way where you can
understand how this program would work
and these are the three tips that are
really going to make your life easier as
a programmer easier to learn it easier
to get better so visualize it draw it
out just so do it you're gonna draw it
out look at it second documentation
understand it see what it does and make
sure you don't make it harder on
yourself I bring tons of codes that I
haven't looked at the documentation and
realized oh my god just spent two hours
writing something that I could have put
just math max or something along those
lines and finally the comments because
you're going to be reusing your code
over your programming career and you're
going to need stuff that's going to
repeat and why put yourself through all
that stress and all that irritation
especially when you're working with
groups of people they need to understand
what it does because they may be working
on a separate part of the project
because coding is not just a single man
job it's a multi man job and you need to
be able to work well with others and
comments really help to make
easier so as always guys I hope you
enjoyed this video I hope it kind of
expanded your horizons on three basic
things that you should already be doing
if you're not definitely implement these
into your programming regimen and as
always don't forget to like the video
subscribe that really helps me on the
tongue and leave me some comments and
constructive criticism always appreciate
it so I'll see you guys in the next
video thanks for watching the video
don't forget to Like and subscribe that
helps me out a ton and I appreciate all
the comments that I get and all the
questions I get in the comments and I'm
happy to answer them so keep them coming
and i'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
