just finished our first section HTML and
CSS and now we're going to use
responsive design and show how to do
better styling so here we are responsive
design with bootstrap were going to be
doing 10 examples so in here um we are
going to give our div element so let's
say we want to add boots we want to add
the bootstrap CSS link to it so you want
to do that in the header or so it looks
like we don't have the header here but
this is where the header would be
typically so oops
so I guess so we've now imported
bootstrap from this link what else get
started and that's all HTML in a div
element so here we this is all we want
to give a div with a class 2 container -
fluid and then don't forget with our div
we have to close it as well so slush tip
alright so there is that so we created
our div and we imported the bootstrap
file and I apologize if my voice sounds
a little weird or if I cough I am
actually sick right now so I'm just
really doped up on cough medicine right
now so I'm good enough to do this for
the next hour so anyhow just I apologize
for that ahead of time
phryges blue sharp all we need it was
add this image responsive class so what
are we going to do you should have total
two images so this SRC so we want to add
a new one we want to add a new image
similar to what we have here so
where is our image right here so we're
gonna add another one here and we're
gonna say image class equals IMG -
responsive and then we're gonna give it
SRC the source is equal to this actually
I don't think we need that / so you can
see right here that this is now our new
image cool so h2 element should be
centered by applying the class text off
center so we want to Center it looks
like our cats photo app so it's got some
nice styling but it's not centered so I
can look better so what are we gonna do
here we're just going to go and we're
gonna do this class as well I believe
color text center sir I don't think
there's a coma just a space there we go
so text agency right there it applies
read text class and applies text slash
Center not bad at all
so we're gonna create a like button it
looks like where do we want to put this
oh let's do it let's do it above the
forum so we'll create a button we'll
give it the class equal to VTN and then
we'll give it the text like we'll close
our button so there's our like button
pretty cool
so now we're going to talk about block
level elements and inline elements so
inline I'm always so bad with the inline
in and block elements so practice makes
perfect let's both get better at this
your button should have the class button
dot button - block so let's change that
Oh
so they won't
there we go so I just miss
misinterpreting what they wanted so we
added the button block class as well
I kept I'm trying to put it as it was in
the style sheet but that was my mistake
button primary so button primary is I've
worked with bootstrap a little so I'm
not going into this I mean but button
primary is a blue button they kind of
have buttons for canceling and
succeeding and so let's see button your
button should still have the button and
button - black so we're gonna have
button - primary BAM there it is
so bun - block takes up the full width
right here and then button as primary
turns it blue
cool cool call-out optional actions with
button info so where do we want to put
this let's put it below our like button
so oh we want to create a button what do
we know about this button so this button
is gonna be called info we're gonna have
have the words info so when we do that
see there's our button text what else do
we want so we want to give it the button
class and watch now we're gonna say
button class is equal to a button so you
see it changes a little bit so
automatically it just got some
border-radius and changes then we're
gonna change it a button - block we're
just gonna make it take up a full thing
and I think that's all I wanted us to do
all right so now there's another class
called BTN - info and let's see what
happens so now it changes the color to
be an info color info related color I
suppose is probably the best way of
putting it cool so we also want to
create a new button called delete and
we'll just keep putting these with the
info rather delete so
and then we close their button cool so
now we'll take that one away should have
the class button in button - block so
we're gonna give it some styling class
is equal to VTN and BTN - block so now
it's going to be a little more curved
and it's going to be across the whole
thing and now we're gonna say danger
button - danger let's say oops sorry
guys I hit ctrl safe all the time but
you can see right here the danger one is
read primary and then info
I hear buttons should all be nicer than
the same div element called
all right so now we're gonna be messing
around with responsive design bootstrap
works on a twelve grid system this is a
great image to look at real quick so for
instance 12 4 &amp;amp; 8 is 12 and then we
could have you know 12 of these across
we could have 6 &amp;amp; 6 and what happens is
based on the column we're gonna have
rows and based on how many pixels out
that's gonna restock your site that's
basically what's going on here
but just be aware that we're working
with the number 12 that's basically all
you have to know and it gets a lot
simpler so what we want to do right here
is nest in a div with the class we have
to tell it's a row so that bootstrap
will use the proper CSS right and we're
going to close our div right here and so
this is a row and what else do we want
to do buttons should all be nested see
if they want us to do this actually like
this I don't think they do but that
would be very interesting if they did
oops
sorry guys
I wonder if I supposed to put all the
buttons there let's try this there we go
yeah I wanted the submit button as well
so what we did oh you know what we
messed up this whole thing so let's uh
what we want to do is actually follow
what I think they want us to do here so
we're going to put all our buttons
together so this control X is going to
change our image a little bit and then
outside the form will do like this so
let's see what happens we were in test
all right cool
so now all our buttons are at the bottom
- our submit is part of the form it's
not technically a button it's a button
but in our case we're just gonna ignore
it like it's not alright so what is the
issue that it's giving us here do we
need one more div
I don't know dad I mess everything up
alright control-z is our friend right
now
so we'll actually just pull this div
class row and we'll throw it right below
this div and I'll cover everything so
not the best thing to do but hey it's
gonna work so with it we should be
nested each of your bootstrap buttons
should be nested with its own column -
extra small so the first thing is the
column we're gonna messing with columns
then next comes to size and next comes
the amount of rows that each one's going
to take up so we have three buttons here
so each one is going to need a div with
the class equal to what what is our
class it's a column it's extra small and
it takes up four spots so and then we
need to end it and so in theory what's
going on here is we're now giving a
third instead of a specific and amount
or a percentage it's going to it's going
to change percentages it's going to stay
the same percentage regardless of the
amount of pixels so that's what's going
on here in the style sheet so there's
that so this is going to take up a third
and then our final one is going to take
up a third of space as well once we
change that and we need to give it a
slash close if if class equals call gosh
excess that's four / div and now our
three divs right here are all taking up
the same amount of space and spaced
evenly so that's what's going on there
make sure each Jeff has a closing tag
oops so apparently we were to stake
somewhere so show me where this div is
there we go
sorry so we forgot to close our div so
there we go
took a little longer but hey we're all
learning and I believe this is our tenth
one so after this we'll take a quick
break insert a new video sir hm
element should no longer have the class
read all right so let's get rid of this
so we don't want the red text and if you
know check our work real quick cool
should now have the class text - primary
so we want to give this a text - primary
color so it's blue very nice
paragraph elements should no longer use
the font mono space
all right we want to get rid of this so
we're like hey we want we want it to
look different cool
smaller image removes this class smaller
image we're moving smaller image so not
just bigger image oops
remove it from the top image rather so
image' SRC it goes
oh there's that and then add the image
response of class of top image so
instead here for our image we want to
and the class img' 8 + - response oh god
I was struggling to find that line of
code I should just normally I put all my
all my HTML on one lines most always
there we go and that was our tenant took
us about 14 minutes plus we got a little
hung up there in the next video we'll
continue doing this and as always guys
