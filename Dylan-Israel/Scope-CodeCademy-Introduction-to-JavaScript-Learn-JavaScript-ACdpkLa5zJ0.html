in freak oh oh my good we are back in
coke Adam II doing introduction to
JavaScript on the functions of the scope
section scope let's go ahead and get
started now what is scope if you're new
to programming
what scope is is essentially where
things work and why there's different
levels of scope global scope would be an
example of something that worked
throughout any sort of document then you
have you have local scope which is like
just within these brackets and then
varying degrees of scopes within there
so it's really important to understand
scope and how nesting works and things
like that because it's a it's a building
block of almost any object oriented
programming language and programming in
general just go ahead and get started by
creating a variable here called laundry
room and we're gonna set it equal to the
string basement we're also gonna go
ahead and create another variable called
male room and this is gonna be equal to
room 1a so we've just created two
variables we haven't done anything with
them yet it looks like they want us to
console dot log it out so we're gonna go
ahead and console log out the vet the
we're gonna get catenate the strings
together a bit and then we're gonna put
in our laundry room variable here these
are all within the same scope right now
chances are it's gonna show us how
things will not work because they're in
the same scope or there it will
everything is going to work however if
they were gonna be in different scopes
chances are that they probably wouldn't
work just going to run this you'll see
everything works
as expected cool now we're gonna go
ahead and write a function before the
console dot log for the last exercise
all right so we're gonna create a
function and in this function we're
gonna have we're gonna name it my my
apartment and then let's go to run this
inside the function we're gonna write a
variable so we're gonna create a local
variable now this variable is only used
within the scope of the my apartment
function so that's that's what we're
gonna be looking at here it's we're
gonna call this mailbox number and we're
gonna go ahead and set it equal to the
string of box 3 and also if you're lucky
enough to have an in unit luxury where
you can go ahead and set laundry room to
in you think so because laundry room is
in our outside of this scope well we're
able to use it within so the way scope
works is outside variables you can use
within certain scopes or in nested
scopes now when you go outside those
scopes say you have local variables you
can't then send those outside so outside
can come in but inside can't come out
it's basically the easiest way to do it
so because we already have laundry-room
defined in our global scope or our
outside scope we're gonna go ahead and
just reset the value when this function
is called you'll be doing this quite a
lot when resetting variables and things
like that so inside the function we want
to go ahead and console just a save time
I'm gonna go ahead and copy pasta this
in here run that now let's trace to the
mailbox outside the function so let's go
ahead and get rid of I think I want to
secure this so now what we're gonna do
is we're gonna go ahead
and call the function console dot log
mailbox number and you'll see that this
will not work because we haven't called
the function and it's in its local scope
you'll see we'll get a reference err
here so nothing this display although
should have something here refers here
that's right
so if we want to get the console dot log
what we can do here is just call the my
apartment function and that should work
as well and then there we get you'll
notice that we had the undefined now
that's being displayed everything's
working just fine you had to find I
think must affirm the last exercise
let's just make sure Oh interesting so
for some reason they just want to do the
other way okay cool
just go on write the my apartment
function and move the variables with
Department building information the
global scopes of that line twenty can
run so we can go ahead
and just cut all this out because these
are local variables we want to make this
global which all we have to do is go
ahead and bring it outside the scope of
this function and everything should work
just fine now if you wanted to see real
quick what it was gonna look like before
we run it it looks like it's not going
to display anything actually
unfortunately I wish you would actually
display that these things are undefined
but it's not going to
okay so that was scope the real thing
that you need to understand is that if
you get reference errors it's because
your scope is wrong when you're using it
scope is basically the idea that some
things are accessible within while the
things that are within aren't
necessarily accessible on the outside so
you're gonna have to learn about global
scope which is accessible everywhere
essentially but oftentimes in
programming you don't want things to be
on the global scope level because it's
bad code so just kind of understand that
as you're doing nested things where your
variables are able to be accessed and
it's a it's a fairly simple concept but
an important one in programming so as
always guys thanks for watching don't
forget to Like subscribe and share the
video if you know someone who would like
who needs some help and especially
thanks to you who support me on patreon
it's appreciated a ton and it keeps this
channel going I appreciate it and I'll
see you guys in the next video thanks
for watching thanks for watching the
video special thanks to our sponsor dev
Mountain definitely check them out at
dev Mountain comm if you're looking for
a boot camp that's in front-end
development iOS or UX go ahead and give
them a shot tuition includes housing so
you can get up and go and fully immerse
yourself in the program as always thanks
for watching I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
