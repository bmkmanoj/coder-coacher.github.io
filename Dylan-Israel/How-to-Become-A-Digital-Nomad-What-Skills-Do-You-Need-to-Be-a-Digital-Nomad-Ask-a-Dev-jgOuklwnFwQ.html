what is the digital nomad and more
importantly how you can become one what
skills are you need what strategies are
you gonna need to employ and of course
more than anything else you're gonna
need to work hard to achieve all this
sort of stuff you gotta hustle
I forgot this firm is pretty cool and
we're gonna talk about all that and more
before we get started one of the reasons
that I want to become a digital Nomad I
liked it being one in the short period
of time was the adventure the travel
right so if you're interested in
traveling and adventuring as part of
your digital Nomad lifestyle there's a
Humble Bundle going on right now there's
link in the description you helped me
out to show you some of the stuff about
around the world so maybe when that part
of your life comes and you can't travel
and work and do all this cool stuff
you'll have some ideas about what
festivals to get where the best spicy
foods are you know the museum the 50
museums street art and of course the
global beer tour and much more guys so
check that out
alright now digital Nomad what is
digital Nomad at the end of day would
that right that what it basically comes
down to is that you make money through a
computer that's what it comes down to
and when you can do that through the
computer and through the internet
something like a software developer or a
digital marketer somebody who
essentially can do their work anywhere
in the world and a lot of benefits come
with that if you're in a different time
zone for instance let's say you're in a
different mix using country in the
effort for example where maybe you can
get a higher rate than you normally
would so now you're making a ton of
money based off of where you live right
you know if you live in the middle of
Iowa and you're getting paid a $200,000
salary a hundred thousand dollar salary
you're living like a king you're making
a hundred thousand San Francisco you
might be sleeping in your car right so
it all depends right but a digital nomad
and a it's just somebody can do their
job pretty much anywhere you know you
could be in a pool on a laptop answering
emails coding out projects and things
like that and that's that's why I
digital Nomad is and that's why it's so
cool cuz you can get up and go right you
can engineer truth Matt Trent he's a if
you're not remember
generally is a career channel when the
largest on YouTube about 250,000
subscribers and he's basically been a
digital Nomad for the last year and a
half of his life he goes to the
Philippines travels island to island
puts up a video or two a week and that's
his life and he gets paid very well to
do that now in this case is that he's a
youtuber but let's talk about some jobs
they're a little more practical right
not that to say that you can't do
YouTube to be a digital nomad because
you definitely can but that that's a
longer process in my point of view not
everybody wants to do that right so what
sort of skills do you need to be a
digital nomad well you need digital
skills right you need skills that
incorporate you making money and not
having to be there and the most obvious
ones that come to mind our software
development web development you know I
can I could pretty much get up and go
anywhere I'll give you a perfect example
tomorrow and Friday I'm working from
home because we have a giant hurricane
coming to Florida and they want us to be
able to work room was that Intel does it
tell I have to get up him um no I just
bring my computer here and now I'm
working from home and I could do this
pretty much anywhere in the world right
if I if I got up at left I drove 10
hours that way today start working
tomorrow in the morning they'd have no
idea because I'm just doing my typical
job right so software development is the
perfect one a digital marketing is
another great one a lot of companies are
really diving into this whole
understanding that not only do we have
to have a website we have to promote our
website way to promote our goods and you
know that is a massive field that hasn't
really been taken over yet because it's
a new field it's something that people
are still getting familiar with I was
talking with my parents the other day
saying yeah you know I'm doing this
affiliate stuff just like the Humble
Bundle for instance just talking about
it stuff that I think relates and
they're like what the hell is affiliate
marketing right so it's it's a young its
what the point I'm bringing that up now
that is that my parents are all that
don't don't know about computers
but really it's a newer it's a newer
trend that maybe a lot of people even
even my age are younger I'm about to
turn 30 really aren't familiar to
familiar with that's a great way to get
started so other skills video editing if
you can edit video
again there's really no reason that you
have to be there maybe you have to be on
set sometimes for to record but
depending on the video editing skills
it's that's another thing writing it all
these sort of things that involves a
computer which nowadays a lot of all the
good jobs do right let's let's say all
of them but for the sets of digital
marketing these are all high-paying jobs
maybe not so much video editing and
writing that that depends on how good of
a writer and how good a Video Editor you
are but again you don't really need to
make that much money if you're traveling
the world depending on where you're
traveling if let's say you can bring in
$2,000 a month you could travel a lot of
places on $2,000 a month and still live
relatively nicely I know that Matt in
his travels filthy and stained and $15
you know a night places or and sometimes
$30 a night places and they're very nice
looking and he's able to basically
travel on two thousand twenty five
hundred dollars throughout the
Philippines and in a nicer area so those
are the type of jobs that you're gonna
need to go and develop and the skills
that you're gonna need to work on now
there's another thing that we we haven't
touched on and those aren't the only
ones but those are sort of the main ones
right the the software the the video
editing any any skill that you need to
use a computer for and have the access
to the Internet you pretty much to this
goes for other things like accounting
right you don't necessarily need to see
your accountant but if your accountant
and your you have a client base you
already have you already have customers
that you know all you're gonna have two
guys send me your taxes send me this so
there's a lot of different fields that
maybe are outside of that software realm
which is where I specialize that can fit
into this into this mold a big a big
type of field that's happening right now
sort of a e assistant right which is
kind of crazy angry you're my assistant
and I don't actually I maybe I don't
even see you we just webcam chat you
know and go from there or tutoring
online you know something I've done in
the past where I've tutored individuals
over the Internet and if you have enough
clients these are all ways that you can
support yourself now I think software is
the best way because that's the one of
the ways you'll make the the largest
amount of money down the road now one
thing that's really important is
having a sort of nest egg for your to be
a digital Nomad I want to mean by that
just have money saved up and don't just
save money invest money weren't Warren
Buffett has a nice quote that I'm gonna
misquote right now it says if you're not
having your money make money for you
while you sleep you'll be working till
the day you die something along those
lines and it's pretty true right
so what what a lot what I would like to
do is for the next five years I plan to
work on-site because I want to learn as
much as possible but I also want to make
as much money as possible and I want to
save as much money as possible and what
I'm doing is I'm saving a percentage of
my income that I'm not not saving but
I'm investing a percentage of my income
with the hopes that eventually I can
residually make more money from the
money that I'm investing that save me so
in these five years I'm hoping that I'll
residually make enough to pay for that
thousand dollars of expenses that I
might do while I'm traveling or 1,500 to
2,000 or you know what maybe five years
some I'm just not even interested I just
want to settle down buy house and pop
out some little Dylan's whatever
whatever it is right no little Dylan's
coming soon but the point the point
being that investing your money I
personally think it's a very crucial
thing that you need to do if you are
trying to set up a plan because a lot of
stuff in life we all want it to happen
now right if you're watching this video
I think damn Dylan I really want to be a
digital marketer I really want to be a
software developer because I want to
travel the world and I want to be able
to support myself on that and I I hear
you man everybody wants their there
their goals and their dreams and all
that sort of stuff today and I'm not
saying you can't get it today but
chances are you're gonna have to put in
some work before you're there and if you
gave yourself a five-year goal right now
so five years I'm going from zero to
traveling the world and working you can
accomplish it I've no doubt about it
start saving 50% of your income you say
oh that's crazy man who can say 50% of
income I say 50 percent of my income
live below your means have no debt the
debt you do have get a lower interest
rate first thing you need to do is pay
off all your debt get it all paid off
every single dollar stop spending money
on stupid
my shirts that are $10 or less you got
it everyone has their own money-saving
take the exam in that but start saving
your money lower your cost of living
don't buy a $40,000 car buy $10,000 car
you know all these sort of basic things
right but save money invest money first
eliminate your expenses and then have
that money that you're in the next five
years help pay for your trip traveling
and hopefully you'll get enough saved
that maybe you're making five hundred
thousand dollars a month and you can do
that if you invest your money or you you
get creative right get a side hustle my
think my side muscles you to write this
is gonna be something that's going to
help meet that has helped me so that can
save that fifty percent right because
that's a lot of money and it's a lot lot
to save but get a skill save money with
those skills and with your side hustle
prepare yourself financially and with
the skill set that transitions you from
a in person worker to a digital worker
now there's gonna be some trade-offs
right that go along with that which is
life so give yourself a five-year period
it's gonna be very hard for you to get a
high-paying software developer job
straight from zero experience to remote
right a lot of employers they still want
to show up to the office but no give
yourself five years experience in the
field and you've worked hard you've
saved your money you'll find you'll find
a role that maybe pace a little bit less
but now you have the freedom travel the
world and I'm well I'm sure you're
willing to get paid five thousand
dollars less or whatever is there ten
thousand dollars less so that you can
have the freedom of not having going to
work and you'll save money that way as
well and not having to have rent and you
know all these other stuff that goes
along with it so if you want to be a
digital nomad sit down write figure out
what it's going to cost you and and do
it and I and at the same time you can
save money and they just get up and go
for a year my brother my brother is
exactly that my brother saved for all
through Community College all through
college about twenty thousand dollars
working as a delivery driver and he's
traveling he's on digital nomad but he's
essentially a traveling nomad at this
point but what his whole plan was I'm
gonna say
as much money as I can while I'm in
college when I graduate I'm gonna go
travel Asia and I'm gonna go travel
South America off of all this money they
did he just got done traveling Asia for
about nine months
and he's down in South America right now
traveling for about another six so he's
gonna off that 20 grand travel for about
a year and a half now
that's not depending on where you go 20
grand so I'm gonna get you a year and a
half but him he's you know he's staying
in hostels he's cooking all this er
stuff to make his money last now my plan
that I'm trying to feed you is in a year
and a half have have a income stream set
up that you're bringing in 20 grand a
year so that your you know your nest egg
and everything isn't getting eaten away
so that you saw something left over for
when you come back and you have skills
that are making you money that you say
you know maybe I'll work 20 hours while
I travel or 40 hours maybe you don't
want to do that get it down to ten you
know don't be unreasonable still make it
a part of your life be that digital part
of no man you don't have to do my
brother where he just doesn't want to
work okay so that's okay too though
everyone's path is different so
summarize if you want to be a digital
nomad first get this get a skill set
that place of that right if you're a
nurse which is a great field to get into
not a lot of digital right because you
have to be there with the the person
right that you're helping you can't
connect over the Internet we like a yeah
yeah just go ahead and stick the needle
into your arm and draw your own blood it
doesn't work like that right so get a
skill set software video editing YouTube
a lot of different avenues if it
involves a computer and you can you can
make money through it good way a good
way to tell if it's a good skill save
money and invest money with that so that
it not only grows but maybe when you
leave it can actually help fund your
trip without you up you know so you're
20 30 40 50 100 grand whatever it is you
saved in those five years that you've
planned this you can go and still have
something when you come back if you come
back right and and just execute it and
be willing to flex enter and and change
your path slightly but surely but always
work towards it and hustle hustle hustle
hustle

everything that is worth doing is hard
and requires a lot of effort and energy
