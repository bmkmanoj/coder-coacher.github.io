guys we are back in code Kadim II they
have a new HTML and CSS course out
called learn HTML and CSS part one
making the assumption there will be a
part two probably a little bit harder
and more in-depth just got done doing a
little bit of angular studying and
needed a bit of a breather I haven't
done this section yet but I shouldn't
have a problem working through it so
let's go ahead and jump right into part
one HTML fundamental structure now
chances are you're probably very new to
HTML HTML is really the building blocks
of websites it's where everything goes
you're going to note need to know HTML
to be a web developer as you move
forward
it stands for hypertext markup language
it's basically especially used with
everything that's the gist of it when it
comes to a website so there's no way
around it so be prepared to know a
channel in an out CSS is the styling
this may be swapped out for something
else that's CSS based at its core but
you may hear things like sass or less or
other styling languages but CSS is for
styling hTML is for the light content
now let's go ahead and jump right in so
what we're going to do here we have this
example website it's obviously very
beautiful we didn't even do anything
with it
so we're looking for the h1 tags oh they
don't have one in here so in the ER here
this so this h1 is a heading tag that's
why this font is so big we're going to
go ahead and change the content of this
heading tag and we're going to go ahead
and
the channel name coding tutorials 360
now when we run this you'll notice that
our content here has changed now there's
a little bit of a mumbo jumbo here this
doctype HTML it's basically just what
you put at the top of the document to
state that it is an HTML document it's
required for everything so you just have
to kind of memorize that so we'll do
that like so exclamation point doc type
HTML and you won't use this for anything
else it's always going to be the first
line of your code so with HTML starts
and it states the HTML is of this type
basically it's just start that at the
first line that's all you really have to
know so yeah see right here will tell
you plans on using the HTML in the
document so that's all that's saying is
hey we're going to use HTML now when
we're actually going to do the HTML we
have to include the HTML tags let me
jump down to this directions here so
this is basically where all our HTML is
going to go all our HTML is contained
within here and you're going to need to
do this now grand you're not going to
see any change we're really just setting
it up at this point whatever night
shelter HTML and then we'll go ahead and
close the HTML document as well it's
going to run that
there we go now it gives us this nice um
this nice breakdown let's go ahead and
go over it so what we have here this
whole thing is the element so this is a
paragraph tag and there are certain
things that go along with para so most
tags have an opening tag and a closing
tag start the paragraph here and the
paragraph here that's basically the
entire element now that's not for
everything as of html5 which I believe
this is covering html5 so but for most
things they'll have a closing tag and
then you have the content of that tag
within here or of multiple tags because
you're gonna have tags within tags so
let's go ahead and move forward so now
that we have the basics of our document
set up we have something called a head
tag now what is a head tag use for a
head tag has a opening tag and a closing
tag the head tag is really to store all
of the resources you're going to be
using so you may be making close to CSS
files JavaScript files you may be
importing fonts you may be importing
other files um you may be adding a few
things like an icon for your webpage
that like a little square icon next to
the heading you may add a title or a
name a title for the browser bar tab for
the tab the name of the tab that's
really what the head is for it's really
nothing that's going to display on the
page but may be used on the page
so the title is an example as I was
saying right here so the title tag you
can only you only need one of these
because you can only have one title for
your page similar to like look at our
gmail here it has inbox - my email that
is your title that's the title that
we're talking about so we'll go ahead
and what's it doesn't want us to put
anything we'll go ahead and do HTML -
coding tutorials look a little shorthand
this CT 360 let's go ahead and run that
and you'll see right here they give us a
nice example you'll see we have a blank
icon here so chances are we're going to
be learning that probably coming up but
this is what we just set in our HTML so
we have our they don't have it on here
for every reason
this is also referred to as the
boilerplate code
the reason they they talk about they
even bring that up is later on you may
actually be using custom integrations
that will that will be doing this whole
header section for you in a different
format but that's that's way too
advanced for right now now the next
section that we have is a body tag what
is a body tag the body tag is all of
your HTML content for the most part goes
within the body it's where everything is
kind of contained and it's a the built
in element of the HTML like the HTML
framework I guess when this so we're
going to go ahead and add the body here
now it doesn't have to go all in the
body but that's the general general rule
of thumb so what did we learn in our
first section here learning HTML CSS we
learned that you need to declare the
doctype so it knows that it's going to
be HTML we learned that we have to have
an HTML opening tag in HTML closing tag
fro that contains all our HTML we
learned that the heading section is for
various resources to be called and to
set a few things such as the title we
learn the title and then we learn the
body where the bulk of the visible HTML
code goes so I hope you guys found this
helpful don't forget to Like subscribe
and share and a special thanks to you
who support me on patreon I'll see you
guys in the next video thanks for
watching
alright guys so I just did an outro and
apparently we're not done with this
final section my bad and so we will
instead skip the outro at that point but
we will go ahead and get started here so
we're going to declare the doctype like
so we'll do it step-by-step
run it we then need to state that we're
doing it that
we're going to be putting some HTML tags
in here like so go ahead and run that so
basically this is where our HTML we're
learning this setup right now we're
gonna have a header you always have a
head this is where all our resources go
for the most part you can also do things
like setting the title well we'll go
ahead we'll get ahead of it we're going
to set the title as well and we'll put
some stuff like what's my title my title
at work is web engineers oh there we got
a little pun and then finally we'll go
ahead and add some body tags outside of
the head the body does not go within the
head because this is where our content
will be going just in case we get a word
thing and then we're going to go ahead
and put a h1 tag a heading tag an h1
tags tool anywhere from h1 to h6 by
default h1 is the largest then gets
smaller and smaller and smaller and then
we'll go ahead and put in the content
for this hello world and it's going to
run that one more time there we go
and now we are done so we'll skip an
outro since I'm going to leave it in the
video thanks for watching see you guys
