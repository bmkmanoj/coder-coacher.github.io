quite often and it's important question
is what do you actually do you know we
get that you write code your front-end
developer but what does that entail in
the workplace what are some of the
things that hey we you know I'm a you're
not gonna know that is kind of a common
practice or kind of a way of doing
things or you know basically what is
what is your average day like as a
developer it changes on a day to day
basis but I'm not sure I do my best to
kind of explain to you what I actually
do as a front-end developer on a daily
basis hey guys I just want to do a quick
shout out to our boys at dev Mountain
who have been supporting the channel for
quite a long time is appreciated so if
you're looking for a coding boot camp
they provide housing they also have
after our classes online classes I
definitely would encourage you if you're
interested in that doing the in-person
full-time living in a apartment together
with a bunch of other people who are
striving to be developers I think it's a
cool experience something I would
personally love to do that mountain hook
me up no but I hopefully if you're
interested check them out deb mancom
just won't start by saying that if
you're interested in the brody even
coach shirt there's a link in the
description below you helped me out in
the process and helped me pay for school
so it's a good cost anyhow
so what do i do as a front-end developer
on a daily basis well as I mentioned it
kind of changes based on the day of the
week and what priorities are so let's
try and give a general overview well for
one most workplaces I've worked at
actually all workplaces I've worked at
have been an agile environment and what
that basically means is that everything
is moving at all the time and things are
constantly in flux and that you're
trying to be adaptive is a nice way of
putting it and so we had an agile
environment you have things called
stand-ups which are essentially a daily
meet-up where everyone typically is
standing hence the name stand up you're
basically talking about what it is that
you're working on what you what what
have you worked on what are you going to
work on and if you need any help right
the no one wants you to twiddle your
thumbs for hours on end if
somebody's already worked in the
application you're working in or if
you've attempted something and you're
unable to solve it it's your chance to
sort of reach out and say hey maybe I
can maybe I need additional details so I
tell my project manager or maybe I want
the business requirements to be a little
bit more clear so I reach out to my
business analyst and I say hey can you
follow up on this you know what is the
acceptance criteria what is the this the
acceptance criteria being things that
what how do I know when I'm done with
this project right and in the
documentation it should have something
some acceptance criteria what are there
additional user stories meaning as a
user I want I want to be able to log in
with my fingerprint because sometimes
I'm an idiot and I forget my password
right so you know do we need additional
user stories do we need additional
tickets and it's kind of your quick
stand up to sort of go through that very
briefly very very briefly maybe
typically I'm on a team about five to
six people and they're 15 minutes in
total not like 15 minutes for me 15
minutes and told us you have about 90
seconds to two minutes of pop and you
move on right so it's kind of your
chance to just let everyone know what
you're up to if you need any help and
move forward and you'll do that pretty
much daily right and then and then you
go back to your desk or wherever it is
you're working and you'll you'll start
working on the tickets right where those
user stories have been assigned and
groomed meaning refined and start
knocking out these tickets that
sometimes they'll be bug fixes sometimes
there will be features additional
features and sometimes they'll just be
greenfield development where you're
building stuff from scratch right you're
starting a brand new angular spa and and
you get to have a lot of sort of leeway
with it and kind of the my experience
with it is when it's more of an internal
application and a lot of us will be
building a lot of crud apps and most
front-end roles if you're working for a
company you'll be building in-house
tools law
time it changes bye-bye company by
company basis obviously but if you're
working for a company that isn't trying
to sell software a lot of it is building
in-house tools and that's what I'd build
a lot of I build a lot of credit
applications create retrieve update
delete write the the rest sort of
applications that would allow an
in-house user to do something like maybe
they want to have a report admin tool or
maybe they want to have a link generator
that they can generate custom links that
will redirect them to other pages and
it's shorter or something whatever it is
right you're it's your job to do that
and oftentimes you let me use your story
that will have about as much of an
explanation as I've just given and what
ends up happening is you as a developer
you kind of have some leeway they're
like well I know what the objective is
right and this this is not at every
company but this kind of my general day
I would say and I've worked at three
companies three software companies now
and I had one company who had fantastic
documentation where it would go into
details and as into how many parameters
functions would have and things like
that it's kinda it's kind of nuts and
the other the other two companies a
little bit more leeway a little bit more
here is a paragraph for an entire spa
now make it work
Dylan all right and and that's fine I
have no problem either way it's kind of
it's kind of funny that way and to be
honest and I think that's more common of
what you're gonna be seeing they say a
lot of times when you when you're
dealing with project managers and
business analysts nine times out of ten
they don't have a developer background
nine times I tend they've never coded a
day in their life and it's kind of hard
to ask the right questions as a
developer so you know we'll use the
report admin tool we're building a admin
tool so that we can create custom
reports right
as a developer I start thinking about
things that are needed that I would ask
if I was gathering the requirements do
that need to be answered part of that is
there's a big difference between
creating the database
and and the data model and on the front
end you know we can move stuff around a
little bit easier but it still kind of
sucks it went when the when the
objective changes so when you're in a
situation where I and I think you'll be
in the situation more often than not
where the requirements are briefed the
acceptance criteria is brief
or non-existent and that gives you a
little bit of leeway and it's nice
because if you get to sort of be the
creator at the end of the day where
you're saying okay if I was building you
know said report admin tool what would
it be that I would add and how would I
deliver this because maybe they they
just said look I want to be able to
create a report as a title it has
permissions and it has the data and then
you're thinking okay well I can deliver
that and with a look and how am I going
to deliver it is up to me at the end of
the day and maybe I can even throw out a
couple suggestions say you know I'm
already in here I was thinking that we
could add these dynamic filters or
something like that where now we're in
the query string that we're passing in
we have this additional one that's that
allows us to take that data set and
automatically in the URL
maybe filter the data down by a date
parameter that we passed in and in the
query string or something right and but
the idea being that you have a general
objective and it's your idea your job to
deliver that objective
however you see fit most of the time and
so that's a lot of what I do is I build
these tools and I I maintain them and I
work with other people other developers
fronting the backend and oftentimes I
found myself as a front-end developer
and it's just something I was a
comfortable saying early on but as a
front-end specifically front-end
developer typically you will be able to
deliver things pretty quickly in my
opinion compared to maybe back-end and
so what ends up happening is when
working on projects as a front-end
developer the backend holds the front up
the front-end never holds the back end
up what I mean by that is the backends
job is to
deliver data and create services for the
front-end to consume as a front-end
developer I have to consume those API
endpoints I have to go and use those get
that data and it's part of for me I
don't work on tickets anymore and I
wasn't super comfortable saying this but
it's kind of a I one of the things you
have to get over being a developer is
stepping outside your comfort zone and
being okay being assertive when you know
you're in the right right and so it's
not not to say that you can't listen to
other people's points of view or
anything like that
but you you have to be okay saying hey
this is a bad waste of my time let's
we're gonna change our process a little
bit and so the reason I bring that up
because I think it's crucial and I think
a lot of front-end devs when they get
started will just build what they can
and then wait for the service that gets
delivered a week later and then you got
to jump into this project that's been
sort of mangled because the data
structures changed and all the sort of
stuff so typically what I like to do is
I like to wait for the service to be
complete or semi complete and then go
and fin end and then start the front end
because the back end can go and make
their their postman calls or whatever it
is to test their own service and they
have Jenkins it so that when it's done
you'll be able to view it and whatnot
but uh that they're never waiting on the
front ends the front end that is waiting
on the back end not to say that like
back in developers they're lazy or
anything like that that's just that's
just the process right so the other
thing that I do on a daily basis as I'm
writing that is I write unit tests I do
test-driven development so what that
basically means is you write tests as
you code and you test your code that way
so as you're going to write a function
before you even write the function or
immediately after is really usually how
it goes you write tests that will test
the logic so that if something changes
as you're building out your spa you'll
be notified because you have your tests
running on another monitor or whatever
that says hey you know only 50 out of 51
tests pass why did that one test fail
it's because your logic change where
maybe here you're expecting a numbering
you got a string or whatever it may be
and the value changed and type change or
and now your your whole logic is broken
and that's to help you as well as when
people go in to make updates to your
features to your spas that they don't
have to you know they're not gonna know
it as well as you are there's so many
moving parts in any sort of major major
team I'm on a team of about thirty
people not on my like dedicated team but
there's about thirty developers actual
people writing code at the company that
I work at so you can imagine where
there's code bases I haven't touched
haven't heard of you know so imagine you
have to jump into that you want to you
want to not only be able to read through
the code make sure it's very readable
but you also want tests to sort of say
okay well let's make sure I didn't break
anything when I went here and changed it
and they're not gonna catch everything
but it does help
another thing that's that's pretty
common that a lot of people don't don't
um don't necessarily think about or is a
pull request pull requests are probably
my favorite part my favorite part but
one of my more favorite parts of being a
developer so what is a pull request well
pull requests really just refers to oh
that's a bad drink um looks like a
vitamin packet not very good so a pull
request refers to essentially you've
completed a feature completed your code
you know your ticket that we got from
from the PM and the VA all right cool
you know I finished this feature now
let's go ahead and submit my code for a
pull request where and everyone's
everyone's workplace is going to be
different some places won't even do it
and what it basically means is we're
going to review Dillon's code we're
gonna go through it and it's gonna show
okay well Dillon change these four
hundred lines of code highlight it for
us in whatever tool you're using then
we're gonna say all right well I see you
did it this way are you sure this is
what you meant to do or hey did you know
that this is a better way of doing the
same thing and that's one of the reasons
I like that even though it's kind of
frustrating right you worked on these
tickets and you want to get them out a
lot of times in those deadlines all I
saw
the reason that I like that is that as
an opportunity for you to grow right not
only when your code gets reviewed do you
get educated but when you're reviewing
other people's code you get to become
more familiar with the code base as well
as better and better
coding better practices we're like oh
you know what it is right where instead
of me doing a four loop here it'd be
much cleaner if I just use the spread
operator or something whatever it is and
you learn from those people who have
more years experience or even less years
experience we're just better developers
right they they are doing something in a
cooler and better way it could be
something very very small right I
remember being in college doing code
reviews and and not like an official
like job code review but we were
essentially reviewing other people's
code and I had never seen a ternary
operator and I've been using them ever
since and it could be it could happen in
anything you got to be very open to it
it's a great way for you for your code
to for you to grow as a developer but
the main point behind is to make sure
that you don't submit bootleg ass busted
code and that you know you're gonna say
okay well this is how I would have done
it some things are suggestions some
things are like yo man this is not gonna
work I don't know how it you even
submitted this hopefully you you review
your code before you submit it right but
that that's a major part of my day I do
pull requests every single day it's a
great way to to learn it's a great way
to get more familiar with the codebase I
suppose to see what other people are
working on right and that's I mean
that's really what I do on a daily basis
I do PRS I do testing I kind of
communicate sometimes you have to go and
and work on other teams and sometimes
you get projects assigned and and
sometimes you are you know my boss came
up to me the other day and and said he
came up to me to my desk like a week ago
is like a you feeling overwhelmed yet so
no man I'm good he's like you want to be
overwhelmed and then before you know you
have a project assigned to you right
that has a one-week deadline or whatever
it is and and sometimes it's sometime
everything's very smooth and crazy and
sometimes it's hectic because you know
someone above you said hey there's this
event going on and we want to get
something out we understand this three
weeks can you make it happen and
everybody as a developer I can do it I
got no problem I'll deliver and because
most of the time we we like to say in a
perfect world it will take one week in
an unperfect world it will take three
weeks and so what happens is you have
two weeks of time and then oftentimes
there's hiccups along the way in
development but the what I guess my the
reason I share that is I want to I want
you guys to understand that your days
are going to change it's going to be
sort of a headband flow of smooth crazy
dull but your days are going to used to
be willing to understand that you're
working for a company things are
changing because at the end of the day
they're the same thing they're just
people making decisions who are going to
decide what you're working on and what's
important and what's not important and
how how big of a deal it is and so be
ready for that is it something that I
enjoy
I enjoyed the chaos right I'm not a very
structured individuals one of the
reasons I didn't do very well in school
so I enjoyed the chaos - sort of like
the world is burning let's put the fires
out right now and it's a little boring
when the world isn't burning not saying
I go out and light fires but I I'm happy
to put them out and do my part
so that's kind of my day on a daily
basis is I communicate with my team what
it is I'm working on if I need any help
I build things I fix things and then I I
help provide insight on certain things
when asked for and then I I I do pull
requests testing all that stuff and I
help help out the other developers help
out QA right so you have Quality
Assurance who you have to send your co2
and they're they're the ones so they it
goes through the pull request and then
it goes to QA and on a testing
environment or something like that and
they say okay let's see if I can break
Dillon's code no but it's their job to
make sure that we the developer
have done our testing we've done our own
internal review and now it's the pull
request be like hey did you think about
doing this and safari 1 what if all the
safari 1 users not but sometimes it'll
be some testing and and they may try
some use cases you didn't think of which
is their job and then you might have to
go back and fix that but yeah so that's
basically what I do on a daily basis if
I had to sum it up into one big I guess
17 minute video I hope you guys enjoyed
the video as always thank you for
watching if you're interested in getting
abroad you even coat shirt the link is
in the description I appreciate you all
don't forget to support me on patreon
all that good stuff like subscribe share
is a child's been grown a little bit but
nice so I appreciate that guys so I'll
see you next time bye hey baby what do
you think I do every day at work I guess
if you're looking for a fun little
project to do I have my very first
course out called learn angular by
projects part 1 where we build a
personal portfolio it's about three
hours of content it's one project so I
can teach you everything and angular by
any means but it's a great way to get
your feet wet and go ahead and check the
