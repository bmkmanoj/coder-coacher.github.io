happy Saturday to those you who are like
Saturday in every part of the world
right now but uh how's everybody doing
so this is our weekly live stream where
I like to answer questions maybe provide
some direction on things where
unfortunately I can't answer everyone's
questions that I get Facebook messages
and emails from all the time but this is
another opportunity for such eighth and
a new thing that we're doing is we're
gonna start off by having a topic of
discussion and today's it's going to be
mentoring and the importance of mentors
specifically negative mentors which i
think are something that people don't
necessarily have a lot of in their life
for at all and if my eyes look a little
if my pupils look a little big it's not
cuz your boy is on some good drugs or
anything like that I actually just got
my eyes dilated to get a new
prescription and all that sort of stuff
so your boy ain't at your boy too much
happening today no so one thing I want
to talk about specifically is negative
mentors and uh if you have a better name
for this please let me know but I think
negative mentors look it it's what I am
currently calling them the reason that
I'm bringing this up is recently I did a
video called the the top 5 ways to make
sure you don't learn to code and a
subscriber of mine said unsubscribe and
then I I said I said something like too
real for you lol and then he said that
he he that he just can't stand how
arrogant and what a superiority complex
I have and I thought about it and I
decided that it's that I don't think
that is something that I'm exuding in my
in my mannerisms and in my videos
partly because I have had these things
that I refer to as negative mentors
where I go out of my way to make sure
that I'm not like this and in his case I
don't know if maybe I hit a little too
close to home or oftentimes people
people are looking people like to what
they see about themselves sometimes
seeing others so they don't feel as as
alone or rejected and who really who
really knows right this is two messages
back and forth with a subscriber on the
internet but I I thought it did remind
me that that we should talk about
negative mentor so so one of the reasons
that i i i i personally responded back
and i said something along the lines of
I'm sorry to hear that I always do my
best to be respectful and stay humble
and part of that is because I've had
these mentors whether they realize it if
not of what not to become a while back I
I talked about how the first time I ever
met a subscriber
there was this super senior dev who
decided that it was appropriate to
on me when I you know describers think
hey man I love your free code cam videos
this and that and he he looked me up on
LinkedIn and was like I didn't realize
that delivery driver could do do deliver
I didn't realize the pizza delivery
driver could be a could make coding
tutorials or something like that
and ever since then he has been what I
refer to as a negative mentor is
somebody who I look at and I reference I
say you know what whatever happens I
don't know what type of man I want to be
I know what type of man I don't want to
be and I find that quite as refreshing
that's knowing what goal to go towards
and so I've used him and many other
people in various aspects of life these
negative mentors and knowing what not to
do and what not to become is just as
important as knowing what to do what to
become often times will help you lead
down the same path right and so he is a
great example in my opinion
of somebody who who I don't want to
become like and that is why he has
become a negative mentor and this is a
years ago but there's other people and
other other things that that I you know
I reference you could talk about
finances and people in my personal life
who I look up to or who are you know I
love very dearly but I've made bear very
bad financial choices and I referenced
some of what they do you know I'm
actually how credit cards and all these
sorts of things that I look at people
who have done it right and I look at
people I've done it wrong
so I want to encourage you that not only
to have those positive mentors that you
can look up to but you have those
negative mentors in your life who you
reference to say look why are they doing
it wrong and what is it getting them and
how can I make sure I don't end up like
them and so I encourage you to to find
those negative mentors in your life as
well as positive mentors right so
Johnson has released a video today I
haven't had a chance to to watch it but
it said hey I don't want to be your hero
or something like that
and I personally don't look up to
Johnson meds as like a hero but I do
look up to him as an educated individual
who has made a good choice in how to be
financially well-off how to have a good
career and so I look to pick things from
his videos and from him that I think are
going to be helpful and in the same same
way I look to look at the the negative
aspects say how can I take the things
that they're doing wrong and make sure I
don't implement them into my life so
when you are choosing the mentors I want
you to sort of try and find those people
that you just don't want to become as
well as people that you do want to
become because I know for me I see
people and and it did this could go for
not only like what type of man or woman
you want to be but also your finances
right when I go into a grocery store and
I see I see somebody who's make
minimum wage that is over the age of 60
that to me is the negative mentor and
that's not to depict pic fun or anything
like that but that is a perfect example
of where I don't want to be in life I
understand everyone you know for all who
knows what those people went through but
I personally want to make sure that that
is not where I am at at life at the age
of 60 right when I should be having
grandchildren and probably getting
married the first time but uh I this is
fine line right because I don't want
anybody think I'm disrespecting them but
I do I mean it is it is completely okay
to have people you say look I don't want
to be anything like that person and you
know maybe that person doesn't have
anything wrong with their life and
that's fine but there are people and
situations in life where I want to make
sure that I don't do that well you ever
seen a crackhead on the street just a
crackhead on the street and you say you
know what just seeing this crackhead has
convinced me that I'm gonna stay away
from crack it's kind of the same thing
right just seeing those people who are
living paycheck to paycheck and maxing
out credit card says decide told me that
in life that I don't need to max out my
credit card to find out that it's a bad
idea so I would encourage you to try and
find those negative mentors in your life
who was the money mentor he is speaking
of uh not necessarily a money mentor but
someone who has done very well for
himself as Johnson miss or simple
programmer sort of just trying to pit
pit pick bits and pieces of how he has
gone from a successful developer to sort
of a businessman and invested in real
estate I actually have to watch this 25
minute video about buying real estate so
you know you actually pop out the chat
here but that's my that's my little
spiel about positive and negative
mentors something that a lot of people
don't ever talk about we always talk
about the the people we look up to right
the people that we want to become the
people that but just as much you have to
be aware of what you don't
want to become rain and it's oftentimes
ignored which would be better to learn
from a failed business owner or
profitable growing business owner often
times what you'll find out
David yang is that the in might so I
would say the profitable / growing
business owner I'll tell you why is
oftentimes you'll find out that the fail
or the profitable business owner has
failed several times and has learned
from his failures right so you're just
kind of getting that failed business
owner after they've learned from their
mistakes and also on a side note if you
guys ever do think on becoming arrogant
or I'm having a superiority complex
you're always welcome to tell me in the
comments below so I don't think that's
the case but maybe that's just because
I'm so arrogant I don't really know
that's right so happy Saturday to
everybody this is our we do these every
Saturday which I kind of look forward to
them I have a little bit of a headache
from the dilation but but I can tell you
so so I was talking to April about this
yesterday we went to stock Thor by the
way excellent movie I couldn't recommend
it more how is my cryptocurrency
investing going it's all right I've kind
of saw invested about $4,500 and I've
just kind of let it sit there and now
it's worth ten thousand right now I've
been investing in stocks and I wasn't
that reinvesting in peer-to-peer lending
but my peer to peer lending went from
returning 7% to like 3.7 percent so I
don't know if everyone defaulted
recently because the holidays
coming up but I've halted that I'm not
reinvesting yes bit petite did fold so
yeah I'm just holding I do have a little
bit money and bit connect and coin room
and stuff like that but uh says bit
petite folded I'm not going to recommend
anymore I know if you're interested in
the bit connect engineer truth just
released a video he's balls deep in it
he has forty six thousand plus into bit
connect so if that's something you're
interested in you can definitely check
out his current video yeah right now so
I I'm reinvesting in my stocks right now
so when I originally got that forty five
hundred I cashed out my stocks that I
had purchased and now I am trying to
read up my stock aspect and go from
there yeah I don't know I don't
something I kind of want to learn today
trade stocks and and crypto currencies
but I I don't know yeah big connects I
have I have about three hundred dollars
a bit connect nothing crazy I never
throw any crazy amounts of money into
these things because they you know they
only last so long this is the crew so
the crypto currency like staking and all
that this is the Wild West man all these
coins are the Wild West so like there's
really no accountability but that's also
why you get you can get such high
returns yeah I don't really want to talk
about it too much
I feel kind of bad well yeah yeah so
what uh what's going on with you guys is
in your life what is a mutual fund by
Vanguard
Yeah right so right now I'm kind of in
at a interesting place in my life where
I want to buy a house but I don't like
debt so I'm kind of it's kind of hard to
pull a trigger on that and then there's
the you know I just started a new job
and although I don't think my job's
gonna go anywhere you never really know
and I would basically clearing out my
assets to for a down payment on the
house and it's it's interesting I find
myself lately not as happy as I was a
month ago and I don't know why if I
don't know if you guys are very
emotionally aware of of what's going on
with you as a person but there's
something some sort of repetitiveness in
my life that that I need to change I'm
not unhappy I'm just not as happy as I
was so in terms of the property
everything I've been looking at is
either duplex or a single-family home
with a back house the reason for that is
I want to these are all rental
properties I'm going to live in one
because I have to for the loan for it
but eventually I will just rent them
both out but I will be renting one unit
out as as I've ran out the other ones
but that's basically what I'm going to
do am I looking to settle down in
Florida I'm I would imagine that I'll be
in Florida for several more years and
I'm looking to buy some investment
properties that's really it just stuff
that I could rent out that's why I'm
looking at duplexes and things like that
stuff that would cover the mortgage and
then some right but yeah so I'm in this
weird place in life where I've kind of
hit the groove I mean I've hit my groove
right I have a like sort of a every day
it's kind of similar I love my job very
happy in my
relationship money's the best it's ever
been I'm pretty much healthy I have
three wonderful cats you know I'm I'm
but there's something missing and I
can't quite figure out what it is and so
I find myself not unhappy but not
content with something and so I've been
kind of going on this sort of mental
soul-searching where I'm trying to
figure out what it is that I'm missing
so I'm trying to sounds like you need a
kid that sounds like an awful idea I'm
trying to switch things up like last
weekend for those of you who don't know
I used to play a lot of Poker so what's
your job income if not secret uh well I
don't mind same but I don't think the
company would appreciate that I would
say that I'm I'm compensated decently
well yeah so I I recently started
building a course just a little project
but I even then I feel kind of weird
charging for just the project so I'll
probably end up releasing it for free
but I'm trying to do some soul-searching
on a very light level of just sort of
reflecting YouTube's going very well and
this is the thing that I find very scary
about this is my life has never been
better from a very objective standpoint
I've never been happier and has never
been better but there's something
something that I'm not fully enjoying
and so I have this sort of sadness
that's sadness is the wrong word so
these guys it's gonna come on this whole
conversation I think it's gonna come off
like I'm depressed and that's not the
case at all I'm actually very happy but
not as happy as I've been
as as recently as a month or two ago and
so so I I don't know what it is and
sounds like you need a non-coding
related hobby that could very well be it
I mean I did start playing poker and I
had a good time because I won money last
weekend I um I also play video games but
I'm not that hasn't really been doing it
for me I just I feel like I'm wasting
time every time I sit down and play
video games for longer than like 25 30
minutes no I'm very happy with my work
and new co-workers it's probably the
best place I've ever worked at due to
seasonal situation perhaps I don't know
but it very well could be that need a
non-coding related hobby I could just be
that I need to switch something up so so
I'm gonna start trying to go to a few
more meetups I'm going to go from there
what's your opinion on Coursera
specializations are they worth paying
for
I haven't actually checked them out I
couldn't tell you I could tell you that
you net the Udacity nanodegree program
is very well I'm starting to think that
most youtubers are egomaniacs is me
talking about my problems an ego make me
have an ego or is it just sort of trying
to say hey it's okay to talk about these
things so yeah I mean yes I need to
exhume both classes that very well could
be it so that's another thing that I'm
trying to do is actually exercise more I
don't know if perhaps I maybe that would
help me
feel a little bit different but I I do
think it stems from from some sort of I
don't know just sort of the same old
same old so it's uh it's very strange
too because there's something missing
more than that there's something wrong
so I find myself trying to just figure
it out piece by piece
ya know each year I'm done
I've yeah I'm I'm done with that stuff
but uh yeah so I find myself looking
inward by trying to change things up and
I don't know like I you know what it
might be
I've spent so much time trying to be a
developer and like working hard and it's
like I feel like we've arrived on that
aspect of life maybe I just need a
vacation
have you had to learn cybersecurity out
your jobs I have not that's also so
that's also something I find hard - that
might be it as well
do you get plenty natural sunlight I
don't think so
I was talking about this yesterday with
some co-workers about how I find it hard
to relate to people who aren't software
developers and what I mean by that is
like we're like everything I'm
interested in that is a very technology
internet or software related and
and it's one of those things where we're
just like talking with the average
person you can tell they don't get it
and they don't care and they want to
talk to you about Dancing with the Stars
which I could give two shits about right
they want to talk to you about some new
TV show and it's it's just hard man it's
hard to and this goes this goes even to
family members right my family was
texting me about I guess the world
serious it was happening and they're
from LA and from the text it sounds like
the Dodgers were in it and it was just
like I don't want to hear anything about
this baseball sucks it's boring
as and it's a waste of time to
watch right I just don't need to be in
this group chat and like we were joking
about it but that's the truth right and
so like you could go and say hey you
know if I were to talk to if I was to
talk to my father or my mother abouts
like say I gave a TED talk which would
be really impressive and in my opinion
and I think a lot of you would agree or
I say say they get I got I was asked to
give a TED talk and I gave one they
would say who is Ted and what does he
want to talk to you about so so it's one
of those things where I I don't know I
don't know man and it it's it's hard
it's hard to it's hard to relate on
certain things and like
uh should I take a creative writing
class I used to do a lot of writing so
I'm fairly familiar with creating
creative writing oh yeah
have I taken a vacation this year yeah I
mean I've taken a couple three-day ones
but I have a lot more vacation time now
I have I would say I have three weeks of
vacation and then I have a rotating
holiday in three sick days so until life
about us I come out to about 19 days of
vacation so uh I'll uh I'll be taking a
nice long one eventually but yeah it
could be it could be that I'm burnt out
can Anu become a coder yes and so I
really I meant to ask this so should I
mentioned I went to a boot camp I feel
like my colleagues who have CS comps i
degrees are looking down on me so this
could be two things one this could be
that they are actually looking down on
you and they're pieces of and you
should leave that horrible job and two
it could just be that you're a little
bit insecure and that's fine right so I
didn't go to a boot camp and I don't
have a comp site agree on I'm
self-taught and it took me a very long
time to feel comfortable about being a
developer and so I completely understand
where you're coming from and a lot of it
isn't that people are looking down upon
you a lot of it is that it might at
least in my case at least in my case
that I was just self-conscious about it
because we are sort of ingrained
ingrained into what's going like it's
been ingrained into our minds from
society and various aspects that that
you are not worthy unless you went to
college
do you already any education books if so
what no I don't really read books
anymore
sounds like you're having a hard time
compiling yeah so even the
stuff I watch I don't watch too much TV
or too many movies but like I do watch
the news and I pretty much only follow
up with mm a question about bootcamp can
you explain the whole process how the
whole process works from start to finish
do I have to quit my job now or can I do
my job and learn on the side until it
becomes my job in the end well bootcamp
doesn't guarantee you a job so and
oftentimes you need to study before you
go into the bootcamp and then when you
actually do go into the bootcamp
typically they will want you to not work
while you're in the bootcamp but it
depends on on what's going on with your
your goal right but or what's going on
with the bootcamp there are boot camps
designed to allow you to still work yeah
so it's it's been an interesting thing
with me right now because objectively I
have been at a very good point in life
and from a personal standpoint something
needs to change
so yeah but
your passion can I flex bro do you even
lift all right but yeah so I'm
definitely going to start implementing a
little bit of exercise I'm cutting out
the caffeine in my life again which
caffeine has a tendency to mess with my
sleep patterns did you hear about the
new Wow in classic Wow watch no I'm
gonna look that up though that might be
what I need in my life yeah that's what
I'm starting to think is that I do need
I do need something slightly different
how's your diet it's it's what
state are you living and I thought you
were in Florida
I saw I've lived in Los Angeles the
majority of my life but the last year or
so I've been in Florida
yeah I'll have to I should take a look
at the wow stuff see see maybe I'll do I
eat meat I do yes I am
I am a meat eater yeah I have to check
out the while stuff
did they really did have they made any
announcements about Warcraft for that's
all that really matters
was there a warcraft 4 trailer if there
wasn't sadness
yeah so so that's what's going on with
me let me stand a little bit does April
motivate you to do better than your
current career situation or do you
motivate her to better than her current
career situation so I motivate her April
has been one of those people who doesn't
really she just wants me to be happy and
and she's I mean here's the thing guys
is I mean April's unemployed right now
but if you go back three years ago when
we were in California living off April's
salary she was making like thirty
thousand dollars and combined before she
stopped and if you take in YouTube and
investments we're probably closer to 120
combined while she was working
so like money-wise and career-wise we're
in about three years
everything's been going amazing right so
like we are we are great compared to
where we were and so there's really
there's really no worries on the career
front now I personally have career goals
of my own she sometimes tells me I need
to not work so much and kind of relax
and part of the way I kind of stay fresh
and have fun is through YouTube right
and that's like one thing I really enjoy
doing and then April right now is trying
to career change so you know I would say
we both motivate each other with me
leaning more it's try and lean on her
to do better in her career and her kind
of telling me I need to calm down and
work a little less what webcam do I use
the Logitech god sorry I can't read this
1080 so I can't read this because my
pupils are dilated but I use whatever
the 1080p Logitech cameras
I think it's the c920 you think Chris
Sean's Oprah has been rubbing off
on you god no yeah I don't watch enough
Chris Shonda to have that yeah so I
think I don't subscribed the other day
it's that one video about his girlfriend
dumping him or them breaking up I just
like alright this is so far from coding
at this point in time I think I'm done
with this I wish you the best of luck
though what you think about going to
information technology while in the
military and eventually software
developer I think anything that's
related to software development and
anything that's related to servers and
hardware in the military would be a good
choice if that's your goal when you get
out
are you surprised by Matt it's
engineered shoots growth to success I'm
not I am happy for him for one too I
think that he's one of the one of the
few people that will kind of keep it
real and that's what I like about it I
don't know how other people react though
to that sort of content right so one of
the things that I like personally about
Chris Hawkes is is I personally love
that he just kind of tells you how he
feels as much as he can given the fact
that he's an employee of some other
company
so that's personally what I like and I'd
like to think that on YouTube that's
what most people like right they want
somebody who's just honest and tells you
what they think
who would I consider to be some of my
mentors uh I have a co-worker I kind of
look up to you to be honest so I don't
know that I'd call him a mentor because
we work together but uh the the tech
lead I'm very interested in in him as an
individual and so I'm trying to pick his
brain as much as I can
what's going on Ricky but also I I think
that uh I kind of look at a lot of
negative mentors more than I look at
positive mentors but I kind of look up
to Quincy look up a little bit to John
just cuz I like what they're both doing
you're my mentor you've done up
now do you think Gen Z is now
I think that there's a lot of people in
in the current generation you know the
millennial generation for instance that
got dealt a bad hand where if you look
at statistically about how much you're
making as an adult at this age compared
to what it was 50 years ago or 30 years
ago it's the same dollar amount which is
absurd the fact that you go to school
and you're taking out forty thousand
plus dollars in debt and when you used
to be able to go and work at McDonald's
over the summer and pay for your tuition
and unfortunately the expectations I've
stayed the same and a lot of jobs don't
pay very well so so I that's what I
would say about that comm comment is
that I feel like there are a lot of
situations that the millennial
generation have gone put in that people
like to deny is not fact that the stats
support it and because of that you have
to work harder than people did in the
past and a lot of people a lot of people
don't want that I guess that's what I'm
trying to say want to do that it's hard
right it's hard and that's something
that I was I was actually talking about
recently it's like here we are doing
everything right right like we have no
credit card we have no debt or saving
money
we're working we're bettering ourselves
for doing self education we're doing
everything right yet still it's kind of
hard to see these people doing
everything wrong spending money going
into debt and you know you know that
they're gonna be not as well-off in the
future but it's hard to say that why you
see them having all this fun while
you're postponing your fun in theory so
how do I feel about asp.net MVC that's
what we do have my work although I
believe they just moved to dotnet core
2.0 I by any chance do you have any tips
on getting an internship I'm in my
junior year in college for my CS degree
and have a high GPA I would say worry
less about your high GPA although put it
on there and have some projects that are
going to work with what role it is that
you're applying for and have a unique
resume and a you your LinkedIn and
github and all that needs to be done as
well just start applying really just got
to cover your bases and then it's a
numbers game and start applying for
things
does anyone really see very many baby
boomers or Gen X individuals attempting
to improve themselves I generally see
them plateau well you're talking about
people are in later stages of their
their life right when you're talking
about baby boomers mostly speed works 55
plus whoo they've had their families
they've had their their marriages
they've had they've they've done
everything that they wanted to do in
terms of setting a strong foundation and
the older you get the less change that
you want in your life right the less you
know you're not going to necessarily
when your life is when you're younger
you're willing to jump into another
industry and when you're older you're
gonna have you're gonna have you're
gonna you're ready can I kind of kind of
be established and you're gonna be
jumping in a different direction so I
wouldn't say that they necessarily
plateau but maybe more so a lot of
things that they do do will have issues
that like art now issues it's just
you're not going to necessarily be
educating yourself at 60 most of the
times what I'm saying but at the same
time I get real sick of people
telling me about how Millennials are
broke because they spend their time buy
an avocado toast when it's just complete
 just absolute yeah
yeah it's it's it's not that housing is
at an all-time high it's not that it's
not that college is super expensive and
people are getting so Millennials here
here's here is a faculty of think I'm
line you're always welcome do your own
research but Millennials by and large
are not only better educated than their
previous baby boomer generation but they
have more debt per dollar and they make
less money so somehow you became better
educated but have more debt and make
less money which makes absolutely no
sense but it's all about the Starbucks
and it's all about the avocado toast
that's it it's got nothing to do with
fact that they got screwed yeah no yeah
it's got nothing to it's the avocado
toast I am 30 years old and I've never
once had avocado toast I don't know
where this came from well I'm
sick of hearing about the avocado toast
right or Starbucks
I don't like Starbucks so like I saw
something the other day on LinkedIn
where said the guy literally said the
guy literally said you know what
Millennials he did like one of these so
like I don't know if you guys know this
but there's a lot of hate for like
Millennials everywhere and if you go on
to if you go in to LinkedIn it's equally
as hateful because most people on
LinkedIn are not most but there's a good
portion of people who who have
established their lives and they they
that you know they're not in the grind
anymore so they they like they like to
to still kick on people who are and so
this this idiot from Bank of America
some executive at Bank of America sound
sound say you know what if you dear
Millennials 10 things to tell you about
your first job if you hate it just wait
it out for two years awful advice if
you're not getting paid all that much
don't worry no no here here's some
advice for you if you hate it work it
and leave it for a job that pays more
because you are more likely to get more
money when you already have a job a
matter of fact if you stay at a job and
especially as a software developer
you're less your you are not rewarded
for loyalty in most jobs you are instead
rewarded for disloyalty meaning if I
stay here even though you should respect
the developers where you're at and we're
working hard but if you stay here we're
gonna give you a 5% raise which let's
say is $4,000 based off your salary so
you're gonna fire well hell we'll say
$5,000 so you make it 100k good for you
$5,000 raise off your salary but you're
more than
you're more than likely going to get a
much larger raise going to another
company even if it's just ten BAM jump
jobs jump jobs jump jobs and you'll be
in a much better situation until you hit
that top cap until you hit that top
market right it's just awful advice my
interest for you yeah yeah if you're
miserable at your job just hold it out
no you should never be miserable at a
job it's absolutely insane
it's just bad advice right in the same
ok the same guy in a stop tensley you
might have more money if you didn't buy
a five-dollar coffee every day it's like
come on man
but yeah so back to KC's point you can't
feel sorry for yourself right there is
no sort of sorry feeling sorry for
yourself does nothing right there are
reasons and there are excuses I am
giving you reasons as to why it's harder
for Millennials but it is not an excuse
as to why you can't go and get it right
yes it is it is harder to make more
money yes it is harder to buy a house
yes things are more expensive but we're
not going to complain our way into a
better situation we're not going to cry
our way into a better situation we just
have to work harder and even though
people are going to say that hey you
know what these guys are lazy they have
it worse off
we had it easier but we you know forget
those people you you have to work harder
and that's just that's just the reality
of the world you have to work harder
does it suck yes so I don't know what to
say but about that but you can't feel
sorry for yourself but that doesn't mean
that there aren't reasons as to why a
lot of Millennials do
so so angel says you can't argue that
Millennials are focused on luxurious
luxuries too early and loose focus I
would argue that that's probably always
been the case it's not as if the baby
boomer generation didn't have losers and
didn't have people who are failures in
life every generation has their crack
heads every generation has their losers
I don't think it's probably anymore or
any any worse or and you look any better
the only thing is it's been you have an
entire generation that is now on a
public sale on another
generation and also it's it's much more
accessible right all this information is
much more accessible because the
internet and and everything that goes
along with it sorry I can't read very
fast today guys because my eyes are
blurry still
so yeah I think VLS makes a a very good
point here I think the hardest part is
trying to unlearn everything we've been
programmed to believe all our lives I've
said this about college and myself even
now I still think about going back even
though I don't need to the kilt our
parents generation put on us when we do
things we love is sickening yep so it's
again again I just want to reiterate
this because this may come off as
complaining but we're talking about
reasons here and it sucks right like I
have I am someone who I'm not struggling
well I've had to work very hard it's ok
still working hard and there's a lot of
you who are trying to get out of poverty
trying to get out of debt trying to get
out of all that sort of that
goes along with it and when you have a
generation that have any of that it just
kind of is laughable that you would
compare that it's like you know what
Bertha you bought a house for $10,000 in
1975 and you're your college tuition was
$300 a quarter let's not talk about who
had who got the short end of the stick
all right you bought a house working
part-time at McDonald's and going to
school at the same time it's absolutely
insane right
could you imagine you can just work a
fast-food job part-time and pay for
school no because it's it's not even
remotely realistic a matter of fact
McDonald's knows that if you work
full-time so much they actually this is
a this is a really laughable thing but
McDonald's created a thing on how to pay
how to manage your money they assumed
that you were already working a second
full time job
McDonald's did and said yo you know what
you're gonna have no money for heating
no money for savings and we're assuming
that you're working a second full
full-time job somewhere else meanwhile
Bertha
in 1965 could pay for her college
tuition working at that same job but uh
the Millennials are lazy right they're
the ones who have it so easy because we
have we have you know our
representatives are people like catch me
outside our representatives are you know
the Instagram models the coding babes of
the world right are the the ignorant
artists of the world those are our
representatives right the what's that
idiot blonde dude on YouTube right we
don't have any of the good reps right we
don't
there's no good there's no good
Millennials killing me right so whose
fault is it oh it's it's a lot of
people's fault Jacob Paul yeah that
idiot
that's the guy who that's and by the way
if we were all like this moron and all
the other Moritz and mind you this guy's
making money and doing it big but that
is the type of individual that these
these older generations are having so
like I'm not I mean look at my channel
right I'm at 28,000 subs we have this
guy who's at like 5 million of course
she's gonna be more well-known right
very few people are going to the
self-educated or out very few people are
talking about this so how can we what
can we do to make a difference about
this well you can do what I do and you
can you can simply do what you can for
yourself and those around you
I've done my best to communicate my
message to the world through YouTube in
the best way that I can but at this
point in time you really just got to
look out for for yourself and those
around you I try to make the difference
that you can when you can
am i traveling for the holiday snow I
was debating going back but with me
saving money to buy a house is gonna
cost about thousand dollars for April
and I had to go back so I decided not to
just wasn't good financial decision
although maybe I'll go snowboarding or
something I don't know I kind of take it
try and take it from there um I can 47
yeah yeah I mean there look guys there's
a lot of people that are my age or
younger I'm 34 it to put reference five
years older five years younger 10 years
younger there are a lot of people that
don't do anything but that they've
always been there but we live in a day
and age of no matter what it is you want
to do you can pretty much self educated
about it if you're not trying to be a
brain surgeon you can go and you can
learn carpentry online you can you can
go get a print and ship after you pick
up some basic skills you can learn to be
a software developer on your own a lot
of people don't right a lot of people
just rather complain and never do
anything about it but that's never
change it's always been that way it's
just a simple scapegoat and that's what
goes back to it every generation has
their losers every generation has their
crack as so what's better learning C
sharp or Java Java is more used
c-sharp is very very nice for web
development as the dotnet
so yeah it's it's just uh I don't know
any and it's hard right so I I I want
everyone to succeed right i I want to
live in a fantasy world where where I
can help whoever I can help right that's
part of the reason I do these that's
part of the reason that I do these these
live streams right where I try and
answer these questions we talk about
these things right like right now we
have 48 people in here and that's 48
people who were having a conversation
with right now who is trying to become
better in whatever it is that they're
doing in their life and trying to
educate themselves I mean at the end of
the day this is an infotainment channel
where we're given some info and we're
trying to entertain at the same time and
so it is here we are also down here we
are hopefully helping someone do
slightly better by the end of this live
stream where maybe they've gone in and
said hey next time let me make a mental
note of that idiot so I can make sure I
never become like him or her so uh yes
thanks I have seen Suraj YouTube channel
although I haven't watched any of his
videos lately but I do watch Steven was
Chuck's channel on occasion do I think
traditional education system K to 12
will ever be discontinued I do know it's
too ingrained in our society I do think
that community college and college will
be free though within the next ten years
free or highly discounted because in its
current form it's just not gonna work
out that's the truth of the night
I think what's going to happen is you're
just gonna see a lot more bootcamp type
things popping up will you please review
angularjs from the net ninja channel on
YouTube I've watched some of the net
ninja tortoise if you has an angularjs
section I'm sure it's very good as
tutorials are so well done well done so
we don't do though yeah
also I you know so the funniest part
about college to me and this is one
thing I think they would that could
change is so you go through K through 12
which essentially is a general education
for 13 years so you're going through
general education for 13 years and then
you have to go to a community college
not Community College but you have to do
two more years of general education you
talk about that you just spent 13
years going over history art history
when in reality what you should be doing
is going into a program that's going to
give you skills and go from there
so maybe in a perfect world they will
eliminate that requirement what is the
best way to study full-stack books or
lectures build projects watch videos so
it's a one six I'm gonna grab some tea
real quick guys
yeah so I I mean I have a very strong
opinion about college and post high
school education yeah it's it's very
strange right because not only can you
go 40 grand into debt you can also you
can also then not have a job after that
40 grand because realistically the only
degree that's really teaching you stuff
is it may be a engineering degree in
some business degrees but about what
just say 70 percent I think would be a
very fair number of degrees are useless
so about 70% of degrees are useless and
and I know it's T it's just unsweetened
black tea and what you end up getting is
people who take out debt and then get
jobs that now they strapped themselves
with debt for about ten years of their
life right and so much so that there are
programs built in that's it I think it's
15 years if you pay the minimum amount
and in 15 years
you can't you haven't paid it all back
they'll wash it out I think they may be
putting that program to an end
but it's a it's very sad Ron Sensoji so
the average as of 2016 the average
college student was graduating with
$37,000 a debt what's going on buddy
so that's where I'm getting that number
so it's probably gone up slightly
can I please distinguish between
react.js and angularjs yes so react Jas
is a front-end View library only and
angularjs is an entire framework well
that basically means is that angular is
gonna have a lot of
built-in that react is not if you're
looking to go in one direction or the
other I would recommend picking up
angular they're currently in version 5
not angularjs which is version 1 and
going from there um it is is the reason
for that is just because I think that
you could pick up react react or the
current version angular is the the
better way of going about it so and I
said by the way I say all this with
plans to one day be a teacher so because
I've had those poor teachers I would
love to actually go and teach computer
science and and and teach you know maybe
introduction to JavaScript course and
and and and go from there but I'm not
qualified I don't have a degree I I have
had more years in this field than half
of my professors who's went straight to
being instructors but I'm not qualified
so yep somehow you can have relevant
experience in the field but not be
qualified
Fleur site is always looking for some
peeps to teach I don't know
was Blair a site pay it would be nice
just to get plural site on the resume
you didn't get a notification this is on
well if you click the bell icon and
subscribe you'll make sure to get
notified when all my videos go live and
go from there
my old roommate teaches Python for
inmates at jail in jail
have I considered pretty more memes in
my video sort of if you've watched some
of my most recent videos I always have a
joke at the end with April so come up
with an advanced reactor angular course
I've been just thinking about coming up
with a JavaScript course breaking down
the entire library there's so much even
as a JavaScript developer I don't know
about the language that I have to go and
build out any tips on portfolio projects
for full-stack coding fate phase
breaches restaurant and e-commerce real
estate sites I don't know if those types
of projects on a portfolio or worth the
time and effort coding phase preaches a
lot of anything that's going to sell
some of his courses
my suggestion is build something custom
and then go from there
custom is always better than generic so
so your recent video on how people don't
code Oh on my top five reasons not to
learn code how do you get started we
just can't figure out where its chart
start watching YouTube videos buy a
course start building something that's
really it man you just got to start
diving in I know a lot of us get
overwhelmed by all the resources in the
world it's a good problem to have though
so if you really want somewhere to start
in a web dev just going free code camp
knock that out as quick as you can go
from there
create my own bootcamp and teach
whatever you want I'd be fun how's your
course in air memes project going so I
the course I think I'm just gonna give
it away for free just a little project
course I was gonna charge five dollars
for it but I don't know
I go back and forth about charging you
guys for courses and so I end up just
giving it away for free
originally those five projects I didn't
react it was gonna be it was gonna be a
course I ended up giving it away for
free so I think something similar is
going to happen one night when I move on
when I when I release it we'll see it's
in terms of the air memes project I got
kind of burnt out playing oh right
playing around with the Chrome extension
stuff so I might just build that one
project and then release it on the
channel and not have to worry about it
see here it's funny thinking about it
they want you to be taught by a
certified teacher but who taught the
first teacher and a given fill it's
highly likely that there Thalia any
goals you have left now that you want to
make a comfortable living as it pertains
to industry yes I want to get senior in
my title I also want to get my income to
the six-figure mark and I want to become
a team lead after that so that's where I
plan on going engineers truths latest
videos was most disliked video I would
beg to differ I would imagine his how to
be a sugar baby video might be his most
disliked video but it's definitely
probably out there what do you think
about the Twitter worker deactivated
Trump's account on his last day at work
I mean it's just a dude one dude that's
pissed off at Trump one of them any but
uh it's this last day at work if your
that's the time to do it if you're
already piecing out call it a day has
April shown interest in web development
how good of a student was she as a web
dev as with me as a web dev teacher
April has shown interest in web
development in the past and she is she's
currently taking some project management
certifications with her unemployment
she's actually got a
that's going to pay for some of these
certification programs in project
management so that's where our focus is
right now uh fifty-three viewers is that
a record or have had more I think I've
been in the 90s once or twice or that
high 80s but this is pretty solid for
Saturday's for sure
am I still working on your book I know
not really man it's been hard it's
something that I want to do so you it
eventually will get done but it hasn't
been a been focused more on this project
in course last few weeks make two
projects charge us for one make 3d
projects charge you for three yeah I
don't know man I just we'll see we'll
see I'll do something is my house
burning yes called the police what do
you think of a video about how to get
about getting live market data from
different exchange api's and how to do
things at that day that's very good you
should be very familiar with the main
HTTP verbs and and be able to execute
them in various frameworks at the very
least
very underrated like a lot of this very
kind of you anymore tutorial videos
planned well the the course project I
was building its angular for angular 5
now I guess it's a personal portfolio
project so that'll be the one that comes
out either charges for all they're done
yeah
I mean eventually it's just natural that
I will build courses thoughts on coding
boot camps do your research and most of
them are very well I use a fork a webcam
now it's it's yeah I eventually will
sell course it's just natural I don't
know yeah what do you think about going
to school online I think is an excellent
decision you waste so much time going to
class and it cuts out as much fluff as
possible although you have to be very
dedicated and have have a strong will
and a strong that's what I'm looking for
not dedication but you have to be able
to be be very determined and be able to
stick to deadlines have I tried the the
digital marketing course no but it's
been getting people a ton of jobs a lot
of people like it housework always far
pretty good excellent I love I love yeah
yeah you have to have a lot of
self-discipline thank you
all right guys um let's let's wrap up
today's Saturday weekly livestream we
talked I for those of you are new I like
to
i-i-i like to end my livestream so it's
uh some words of wisdom and what i want
to say we started this video about
mentoring we then kind of dived into me
saying that something is lacking in my
life and trying to figure out what it is
and then you know we talked a little bit
about Millennials and what i what the
sort of common theme is is a very
objective understanding of what's going
on and and being informed of your inner
self right being informed of the
negative people who who you need to not
be like and the positive people who want
to emulate being informed of hey i am
happy but something is missing and then
being informed of the the unfortunate
disparity of how life has been slightly
unfair to Millennials in a very
objective and statistic standpoint right
and that we're going to also be
informing yourself that just because
that's the case doesn't mean that we can
complain ourself into a better situation
so what i what i want to say to you
today is is i hope that whatever is
going on in your life that you inform
yourself of every aspect of what it is
you're trying to accomplish and instead
of making excuses understand the reasons
and then maybe perhaps you can overcome
those issues along the way excuses are
one of the worst things that anyone's
you start making excuses for yourself in
life it's very hard to stop making
excuses for yourself in life once you
start believing them so hope you instead
understand the reasons and inform
yourself of those reasons and don't make
excuses so I appreciate you guys all
don't forget to join the patreon join
the Facebook page join the subscribe hit
that little notification about like and
us and I'll see
you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
