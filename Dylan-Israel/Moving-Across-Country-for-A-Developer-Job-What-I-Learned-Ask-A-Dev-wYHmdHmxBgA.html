about moving across country I'm going to
talk to you about why you might want to
consider it not necessarily moving
across country but being willing to
relocate what benefits that can have and
what my experience was moving to you
know 2,500 miles away and not knowing
anybody never even having been to the
state and what I was expecting and what
actually happened so you can see the
background here this is basically I was
from I'm from Los Angeles
essentially in Southern California I
relocated at Tampa
it was 37 hours of driving and about
2,500 miles it was a long drive I could
that never felt like it was going to end
but we inch our way down here
and I drove did it in about three days
so three very long days of driving now
why why did I why did I take a job all
the way across country quite literally
ocean to ocean excuse me so when I was
applying for jobs one of the things I
noticed was that I was going against 300
applicants in the very condensed but
very job heavy area of Los Angeles and I
was getting very few calls back now the
calls that I worth was getting back was
for a lower amount of money than I
wanted to take for a developer job and I
felt like me to take advantage of
especially such a high cost of living
now I also noticed that I was getting a
lot more calls back when I was planning
to less less condensed areas for a lot
more money and a lower cost of living so
I made the choice for me very easy now I
had always wanted to get out of Los
Angeles because of the traffic and
ridiculous house prices just give you an
idea I looked it up the other day to see
what the median houses in the entire
state of California it's four hundred
seventy thousand dollars for the average
house in California which is kind of
insane
now if you want to go in Southern
California it goes much higher now in
comparison in an area like Florida I
believe it's around 220 so literally
more than half little less so that was
one thing
platings I like to do research on areas
that I would want to live and I happen
to be living in one of the most the most
condensed and one of the most highest
tax and highest cost of living areas
when I looked it up Florida was number
37 on the highest cost of living what
California was 11 and which was
surprised me I thought it's gonna be 2
or 3 maybe one even but I hear New
York's pretty expensive now
so that was my thought process when I
when I went and accepted a job 2,500
miles away and what question you guys
have asked me for a while was were you
were you afraid like um and I get that
question I understand one thing that I
kind of thought my father thought was
when he when he came and visited me not
too long ago we had talked about me
coming down here he was giving me some
some nonsense advice that I didn't agree
with about the job market that I I kind
of think he has out date advice on and I
said look I know you think I'm an idiot
because I moved across country for this
and that and I actually know what I'm
doing is I don't think you're an idiot I
think you're ballsy and it kind of
enlightened me a little bit now why am i
bringing that up well I think that when
you take a there's chances there's time
to take educated risk now could I have
gone to Tampa and really just hated life
and whatnot yeah I I mean I've never
been to Florida I don't know anybody in
Florida um you know the only thing I
know about Florida is the occasional
crazy news articles that I see on
YouTube right and like but I think that
as like right before this is I remember
talking to my brother my brother is like
oh you're moving to floor he's like he's
there at the place where the guy ate the
bath salts to start eating people's
faces I was like yes yes that's Florida
but uh so why am I saying educator is
because what you when you start
educating yourself about okay well the
job market is better here for me so
lower cost of
and what's most important when you're
trying to get your foot in the door
getting your foot in the door now once
you get the foot in the door you get
that resume experience you become much
more valuable and if you're if you have
your heart set on going back you can
write you can you could say okay well I
have I I have two years of experience
which is a decent amount believe it or
not right so uh it's what I'm learning
is it's a fairly decent amount like five
years you're like a senior developer at
this point in time so say you just leave
for five years and come back stock
follow your money use it for a down
payment for a house and go go back to to
where you came from right Los Angeles
for me or wherever it is I'm not going
back to LA so don't worry about that but
uh but um you guys get the point now
when I arrived what was I afraid of I
was afraid of I was afraid of not being
able to find a room for rent when I
first came down April night about six
months before I took this job had
started a rekindling our relationship if
you watch my thing about being developer
I talked about time where we broke up
and we didn't speak to each other for I
want to say four months five months and
eventually I convinced her to forgive me
and we were we're still even though we
had been talking to you to look for
about four or five more months and I
wasn't I took the job and I told her hey
I'm moving 2500 miles away I don't
expect you to come with me but it is too
good of opportunity for me and I'm going
to take it regardless if you come with
me or not now some people can take that
as a very offensive thing right you
should all you know you're loved above
all else I hear you man but I started
being broken I wanted to do that
experience and I offer it to me I
thought I was given a pretty good deal
come down I don't have a job I'll pay
for what I can and we'll go from there
and we did she didn't give me an answer
to I was already down here and then she
just missed all this hotness too long
unless you came on down but uh so she
that was probably the only thing I was
really concerned about was
just like that that was one of those
things where I didn't know what was
going to happen now it's hopeful and it
things worked out and I'm very glad that
it did and we've been able to start a
nice life together but that's going to
be a different experience for you maybe
you don't have somebody now there's two
ways that you can look about that you
may say look I'm going to an area I
don't know anybody you know Dylan you
had your girlfriend who came down with
you and forgave your your-your-your
your dumb f and and you had her right I
come home every day and I see somebody
that you know is you know my essentially
my best friend and we talked about work
and whatnot and I'm lucky to have a
social media channel where I can put out
something out there and I read every one
of your guys comments and I feel like
I'm having millions of conversations but
you're saying look I don't I don't have
that significant other come with me what
can I do well I think you would have an
easier time moving across country if
you're single than with a family there's
a lot less things to juggle and I don't
have a family but it's given to opposite
ends of the spectrum for what I would
say is that as you move to the you know
and you're going to move to a city most
more than likely you're not just going
to move into you know somewhere in
Kansas that isn't Kansas City like
you're going to move to areas where
there are people and I think one of the
best things you can do is just start
dating right and you know you it's not
or software developers right so the bulk
of us aren't going to be the best dating
but we're also employed individuals who
are working hard and so that's in a
depends what your age right you know I
feel like as I've been getting slightly
closer to 30 the employed individual has
this together is much more
attractive man than the guy at 20 who's
not so I'm a little biased about the
dating but I think I think for you guys
if you're single that that's something
where you can go and you say okay cool I
can go out and meet people like I I can
go on tinder man I just swipe right and
super liking something like that right
whatever you you kids are doing nowadays
that's what you can do and I think
you'll just very quickly and you know
you'll join
their group of friends sometimes if you
end up dating somebody long-term or
maybe you'll just make some friends that
way now what what about it that's not
you right what about it that's not you
because the the biggest thing for me is
I don't necessarily think it's a culture
thing so I went from a very liberal City
of California to uh kind of a swing
state that leans Republican right like
when my brother came down from Portland
and we were walking down through
downtown st. Pete he saw em IDs Portland
if you're not familiar with Portland
Oregon it's a city of hippies
essentially and I love Portland Oregon
to live there one day but uh essentially
it's a much more liberal City than the
average place and very leftist city if
you will and so he came down here and on
one of the bars they had a blue lives
matter sticker and he was just like oh
like I get it it was like a shining
light the room so not everybody is going
to to love their new place of origin but
I don't think it's going to impact your
your life as much as people think right
we're all humans we're all living day to
day most of the time we just want to go
home we want to make sure that our kids
are taking care of our loved ones are
taken care of that we have health
insurance we have food in the house and
we have rent and hopefully we can save
more money that's not the paycheck so I
don't think I don't think most areas you
have anything to worry about
now I went from a very liberal state to
a less than liberal state and I could
tell you it didn't make to two cents of
difference in my life so that's one
thing to consider though because a lot
of people have this very big identity
politics and I think you shouldn't look
at the world to black and white in
general but rather than go down that
that that route I will leave it at that
now in terms of salt and the social is
really where I think it gets you really
have to start thinking outside the box
because not everybody can handle I do
very well on talking to people on the
phone I do very well
keeping myself busy but sometimes people
can't keep themselves busy and they need
to they need to make friends I need
actual physical communication and that's
a whole different thing now if you're
going to do that one thing I can highly
recommend is bill
not your network right going those
meetups and and talking with people and
finding people are interested similar
things and and and if dating is not your
thing you have to meet ups other than
that just try to find some hobbies and
clubs and work on projects one of the
best things honestly and I don't mean
any disrespect to any of my friends that
are in Los Angeles is that it's just
April and me and the cats and I've never
been happier and it's part of it be
working as a developer and and having
money right to to do simple things like
buy groceries and and pay rent on time
and all this sort of stuff but part of
it is I've been able to be so laser
focused in the last ten eleven months
because I don't have any distractions I
don't have any family events to go to I
don't have any friends telling me hey
let's go out on Saturday night and and
do this and that and and it's not that I
don't enjoy those things but at some
point you become you get in a different
phase of your life and for the last two
three years I have been in this phase
where although I enjoy my time that I
get rarely with my family and friends
now what my goals in life are are to get
my salary to a hundred thousand to get
my my youtube channel to a hundred
thousand and YouTube I'm coming for that
silver play button baby keep it warm for
me alright and so like you know I mean
it's I have these goals that that I want
to work towards every single day to
accomplish them and one thing I want to
become a better developer right and so
what am i doing I'm studying every
single day and when my mom and brother
were here it was really hard for me to
get out of that group I didn't want to
get out of that group I was afraid of
falling out of that groove and I liked
being in it right I like I like being
busy I like doing these things and I
like coming home from work and I like
doing my own work right because I want
to be a better developer because I have
these goals and I'm it's given me this
sort of I can hit the ground running for
a couple of years before I ever have to
think about relocating elsewhere and in
that couple of years where I don't have
the outside distractions
and I don't have any children and I
don't have any any family and I don't
have any any of this I've been able to
let me get laser focus about what it is
in my life right now I want to set up
for the next stage in my life and that's
one of the one the greatest thing about
Godhead moving 2500 miles away from
everybody I know and I really don't mean
that to anybody watching this like this
will be the one video my my father
shares with my with my entire family and
then just disown me but I'll so that's
really what I've learned about this
journey across the country one thing I
learned on the drive is if there's a lot
of waffle houses I had no idea how many
waffle houses there were in this country
that was interesting but in terms of of
relocating just really think about first
off do your research right when you get
offers out of state if you're willing to
relocate make make sure you understand
the tax code one one state that I was
willing to look at instantly and one
other reasons I did because I already
knew that Florida having state taxes it
saves me about four or five thousand
dollars a year and I get four to five
thousand dollars in my pocket a year
compared to what I'd be having just as
state tax in California so these are
things to consider the social aspect I
think is really the most important for
most people and it depends on what type
of person you are
I have this sort of attitude that
everybody at some point in their life
has to make do what's best for their
career and for their life and maybe
maybe I'm just a little too practical
and maybe maybe I am I'm the in
exception to the norm but I like to
think that and it's hard right it's hard
it's hard to do that I don't sound like
I'm - like oh I'm just this hard man
who's just hard-working and I don't have
any feelings or anything I concise
thought the casement when I saw my mom I
saw my brother and I saw my dad it's
hard especially after your folks are
getting older right I'm 29 I'll be 30
soon and my folks are going into that
senior citizen category
and you know one day one day that it's
you know they're not going to be here so
every year I spend away from them it's
hard right so it's it's almost things if
I understand I have to get my career
together actually do all this sort of
stuff but I do want to live close to my
family and I do want to be able to do
these things man so you know it I do
miss them at times I definitely miss
Mexican food man I don't know what the
Mexican food in Los Angeles is fire I
don't know what's going on down here in
Florida you guys got to get it together
on that note guys I will I will leave
you with this i if you are considering
moving across country for a job and the
money makes sense and the location makes
sense keep in mind the type of
individual you are like my girlfriend
for the first six months really struggle
not being able to talk with people on
the regular inches and she still texts
her friends and everything like that but
she required a lot more of my attention
than I realized
before because she had this void filled
and so she struggled a little bit with
the relocation more than I did in that
aspect so that's what I want to bring it
up so make sure you that you're the
right person I can go into a city that
you know nobody and just be like yo man
I'm here baby
you know so that's my two cents about
relocating across the across the country
I'd love to know what you guys where you
got them relocating what your experience
is look because I'm this I'm just one
guy right and I relocated coast to coast
if you have a similar story where you
moved out of state for a role was it
successful
did you enjoy or was it a horror story
scare people away whatever it is I just
want us to have an open conversation
