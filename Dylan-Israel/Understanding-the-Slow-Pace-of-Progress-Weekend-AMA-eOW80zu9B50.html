the weekend am a live stream we do every
week Fuzzy's who are new every weekend I
do a live stream where I do my best to
answer your questions about software and
try to provide a little bit of mentoring
for where I can if I can and I started
off the video with usually a topic of
conversation something it's relevant in
my life in software and today's topic as
people are coming in is going to be
understanding the slow pace of progress
not so much a question as a or a venting
session as just sort of trying to to
explain and how my thought process works
in frustration it's really what it is so
we're all working towards something at
least I hope you are right and this can
go for you learning code to you getting
your next job to you progressing in your
career and I'm one of those people that
I'm working at it and in various aspects
right now I'm reading books I'm doing
the YouTube I'm building courses I'm I'm
also doing tutorials on the channel now
things like that I'm trying to grow and
you know sometimes I'm working with
people sometimes I'm working with
developers who have 20 years experience
10 and it's easy to get frustrated as
myself feeling like I'm the worst step
out of them all and it would even be
fair to say that at times and and and
sometimes it's not but it's not fair to
compare yourself to other people like I
know sometimes people on this channel
for instance like oh man I can't wait to
get to Dillon's level and this and that
and I feel like I'm never getting there
and you know when you're at my level
you'll you'll see the developers have
been doing for 20 years I thought man I
can't wait tell this and that and it's
frustrating right cuz you more your work
so hard and you want to get there and
you know this happens for for my
girlfriend as well you can happen in any
industry where you put in effort and you
want you want the reward for that effort
come right away right it takes time it
takes energy and these and the the the
main thing that you have to make sure
you keep doing this keep crime even
really at the other day you have to keep
making sure that you're progressing
because you'll get there eventually
eventually never sounds like a good
thing people want concrete dates or they
want to believe you just have to
continue to grind and move forward but
it is progress
innately is a slow paced item no matter
how fast you work and how how hard you
work progress in something such as a
career progress in in a technology
progress and whatever it is that you're
trying to accomplish is always going to
be slower than you want it to be and
there's something to be said for
understanding that and you know not
beating yourself up about it right I've
been having a rough week this week
because I haven't you know I forget this
at times you know I work so hard or at
least I think I work hard some people
may think I don't I you know my opinion
and I work pretty hard and you know I
wish I was getting more out of it or as
progressing more than I am now and you
know sometimes it's easy to forget where
you came from in terms of you know the
developer you were a year ago two years
ago and it's it's it's easy to start
kicking yourself so when that's really
that announcement for not only for my
sake but for everyone's sake of hey you
know I know a lot of us are grinding in
our own way and the grind never feels
good until it does right it never pays
off until it does and then it all
becomes worth it so when you're when
you're feeling like that progress is
slow when you're feeling like you're not
you're not getting anywhere just
remember that eventually it does pay off
and continue to continue to move forward
and it's easier said than done without a
doubt and it's a little bit of a grind
but try not to get down on yourself too
much I had a rough week this er this
week partially because of that and
frustration and not being as good as I
thought I should be here I think I can
be yeah so I know that's that's my PSA
vent if you will
happy Friday to everybody how's it going
David and Thomas and Matthew let's get
some let's just some questions out in
the chat today so algorithms take me
some hours for problems how good were
you at how good were your math grades
I'm pretty good
they were pretty good up until calculus
then I start getting C's do you think
Matt talent is just serve algorithm
algorithmic problems no but I think it
helps you'll get better with it you just
have to understand iterations and be
able to see patterns so but yeah so if
you guys haven't noticed on the channel
freako camps response Erikson me Devon
island it's a sponsor again and and also
I am doing software tutorials that's one
of the ways I'm trying to force myself
to learn is by teaching tutorial so the
last three weeks we've done a get we've
done a basic Java Script we've done a
angular and now we are going to be doing
this Monday's Welsh will be in es6 core
co 7 yes al combined into one so how's
that B's you you going I dropped out of
that about a month and a half ago and
then it was just a waste of my time
to be honest with you yeah I'm a two
time college dropout boys that is not
something that I have any regrets on
failing with honestly it wasn't that I
failed so much as it was I was doing
quite well in it to be honest I
finished three classes in about six
weeks it's all my tract finished two
more but I just couldn't do it that is
soul-crushing everything about it I'm
glad I'm glad I went back though mainly
because I always had this thought in the
back of my mind right where man how can
I should I go back and finish this up
and you know and wants now that I've
done I know know it know so that doubt
is gone and that peace of mind is one of
the greatest things $3500 could buy yet
I have been completing one come fight
question day with Java for five days
straight but now I'm stuck on almost
increasing sequence problem I think I
have a JavaScript solution for that I
did a little bit of code fights this
weekend I let this last weekend it was
kind of fun kind of taking a little bit
of a break playing the new God of War a
little bit that's been exciting and fun
although Saturdays are kind of my
workday I've also given up caffeine this
week I haven't had any caffeine since
Sunday which doesn't sound like very
very long for you - some green tea but
there's very little caffeine in green
tea so I'm trying to take better care of
my health is that a WG mug it's a $3500
WG mug so I got out of it was this mug
baby yeah I did get some certs out of it
how many hours gave you study I usually
put in about an hour a day on YouTube
stuff during the weekdays and I do I was
doing a little bit of reading by I've
been plenty honest with you guys this
last week I've been slacking off my
reading time the hour of reading time
that I've been dedicating and studying
time complain cata where man I've been a
filthy degenerate this week eventually
that's why but I only play games that
have endings like I don't play League of
Legends anymore because you can keep
there's always another game of League of
Legends so you know the point being I
usually do one to two hours a day during
the weekdays weekends are really when I
get my study time on and on Saturdays
I'll put anywhere from four to twelve
hours and it really depends on how
motivated I am yeah what I'm trying to
do by usually put in about and on
Sundays of varies but this weekend I'm
gonna finish up my es6 TSI eight course
and then I have some filming in the
video so I'll be cramming it in well you
think it's more important to learn learn
first continue algorithms are cool like
Travis Jenkins for continuous
integration I mean if you're learning
tools like Travis and Jenkins you're
probably interested in DevOps but if
you're not you should probably focus on
algorithms Thank You Thomas I've just
been I there's been a lot of stuff going
on in the background man no not all good
stuff Oh bad stuff just soul journey and
stuff you know you know it is hey Jones
to break into full-stack dev with no CST
should I focus on mostly JavaScript and
web related technologies or data
structures and algorithms well if you
focus on data structure and algorithms
you'll be able to break into companies
that are higher tier what I mean by that
is those are the companies like Amazon
and Facebook and Google and those sort
of fortune 500 companies
every time I have a company an interview
with a fortune 500 company it's always
about like binary search tree and
 like that and I do very poorly
on them which is why I'm reading
cracking the coding interview but really
you should look at your area look at
your region and then study some sort of
web dev and start building projects and
building a portfolio building a personal
site those sort of things are the basics
that you're gonna need to start having
an active github you just have to really
show that your code and that you love to
code and then you're currently actively
coding then you have the skills and the
data structures the algorithms will the
help yes and will they help with
JavaScript or web related technologies
yes this well I'm learning code and
digital marketing but I keep getting
caught up watching YouTube or feeling
like I'm missing out any advice I am a
little pissed off with myself it's a
little I am a little angry with myself
so honestly although leisure I usually
don't have much sympathy for people who
say hey how can I watch less YouTube or
hey how can i play less games it's a
it's a self-discipline thing it's a it's
something that's completely within your
control I think it's why I don't have
too much too much understanding I think
you probably are usually the people this
is just my basic assumption I don't
think you're like a 35 year old dude
you're probably like 20 maybe live at
home and you know you're able to get by
and do that but really I would say have
some self-discipline start sticking to a
schedule
and try to just try to be a little bit
more of an adult about it and if there's
distractions you can get rid of do them
I have fun I have a whole video on the
good collaborating on free code camps
channel about consistency and I talk in
there about how to get rid of
distractions so I would I would say go
in and check it out but really just just
understand this is all stuff within your
control like I struggle with caffeine
I'm completely addicted to caffeine for
the last 15 years I've been and so this
week I stopped drinking caffeine is
probably part probably one of the
reasons that I'm kind of in a foul mood
so I'm just slowly going through
withdrawals
so it's it is something within my
control and it's one of the reasons why
I'm finally saying you know what I have
to hold myself to the same standards I
would hold other people to you you know
it's easier for me to say Ellen's you
should code everyday because I can do it
I do it all the time you should work I
work towards stuff every day but can I
give up caffeine it's much harder I have
a little bit more sympathetic but yeah
man so when you're self-taught I'm I'm
guessing so what I would tell you is to
find what type of developer you want to
be and then find out what skills of for
that category of developer and go and
get them and then you don't have to
worry about taking the right path sit
down and actually define what the right
path is don't have it in this mythical
part of your brain where you're always
thinking about it go through spend four
hours looking at job application so
we're gonna seen what's out there in the
market seeing what you want to become
and see what those skills require make a
list and start knocking them out piece
by piece
uh how would you learn machine learning
I gotta tell you hey villain you're the
man I appreciate that
I loved your video being developer in
2018 question I've learned HTML CSS
basic react and angular any advice to
get a job have very unique projects in
them have a good github have a good
LinkedIn and have a excellent resume and
continue at a portfolio site those are
the bare minimum things that you should
be doing and if you're not you need to
do all of them immediately and start
start becoming a unique candidate that
means going to hackathons and have a
hackathon projects that means
volunteering that means going to meetups
there's a lot that goes into getting a
dev job so that that's sort of my my
advice to you right now
haven't done any digital ocean soap hey
how can i watch more YouTube hey there's
always more you doodle - how am i
investing my money that's a very
interesting question right now I'm not
really I have some money in
cryptocurrency that's really my only
investment right now and peer-to-peer
lending but that money is coming out of
peer-to-peer lending in the near future
the reason for that is I need to have
money sitting in the bank so I can buy a
house oh so that that's why I don't have
money and you know Robin Hood or I've
had money in Robin Hood in the past in
stocks and you know various micro Robo
investors like acorns and betterment but
right now I'm sort of sitting on my
money and whatever happens with the
crypto money happiness of the crypto
money I'm not too worried about that but
I'm looking for I'm looking to looking
to buy a house there's my next big
financial investment slash purchase so
that's sort of what's going on there
have I heard a battle snake hackathon
now so what would you say the skills are
I need to become a web developer I have
an excellent video going over this about
the must-haves and the nice to haves but
if you're talking about just a front-end
developer the basic stuff you're going
to need today is HTML CSS JavaScript
you're gonna probably need to be
familiar with git for version control
you're also going to need to be familiar
with a a front-end framework as well
such as angular or reactor maybe a few
views when picking up steam that would
be my advice for the bare-bones minimum
so real estate yes a real estate will be
a future some of the stuff I'm looking
at I haven't decided I haven't decided
if I want to be if I want to be
buying my my own house like a house I
plan on living in and you know nice
house and go from there or if I if I am
I'm gonna buy an apartment complex or
some sort down the road like a small one
like a two or three unit sort of you
know house of the back house er I duplex
something like that and we rent that out
that's that's a possibility as well the
truth is I I don't know what the future
holds what video is that that I had it's
called the the skills so you need to be
a front-end developer or something like
that I don't remember it off the top of
my head let me say how in demand are
crypto coding jobs they're quite in
demand it's one if I was going to start
fresh today I would be going after that
because it's a field that it's a field
that is new it's a field that is growing
what are my career goals for the next
five years um my career goals and my
life goals sort of sync up my career
goals are to become a senior developer
perhaps a tech lead and that's in a a
professional sense I also want to grow
the YouTube channel and start it started
launching my own web applications and
things like that
so that that's sort of where my career
goals are and build a passive income
streams which I've I've been somewhat
successful with with the YouTube channel
so that that's been good in that aspect
can you get a job after finishing all
free code camp topics so you guys have
to look at coding sites like free code
camp or anything else as something to
help you get the skills to build the
projects you need to get the job so
so that like it like people yet the
answer is yes the smoke in the
background is the essential oil diffuser
thanks for the tip David I will I I'm
I'm reading a book about buying your
first house and stuff like that so I'm
absolutely educating myself got a war
for spark high five I haven't played far
high five but got a war I say so when
the best games I've played in a while I
haven't had this much fun playing a game
since I played horizon zero dawn that
scrim of course was legit I'm glad you
liked him and I have a video I have a
video that I'm gonna be releasing on
Monday or maybe 20 suggest announcing
that for those of you who don't know I
got a contract it out and partnered up
with partnering up with scrim be calm
and they they they had me build a
introduction to JavaScript course as
well as a es6 and beyond course so I
hope you guys check that out it's free I
love their platform every unique
platform where you can pause the text
editor ass you're going and then start
typing and running the code it's pretty
cool
you'll see I'll have a video just sort
of announcing it on Monday or Wednesday
we'll see nice summer senior deaf myself
but no YouTube how do you find the
mental bandwidth great valuable YouTube
content along with your job honestly I
keep it fun I keep it refreshing it's
not too time-consuming I mean these
tutorials that I'm working on are much
more time consuming than anything I've
done and in recent times but you know
why don't you topics alright so like 20
acronyms every developer should know
that's a fun video you might learn
something you might not it's a it's a
fun video at the end of the day when I
talk about scope creep or
um you know the Dolan videos sometimes
take a little while
technical debt these are all things that
I think are important topics and should
we discuss and I don't want to take away
from the fact that that's what we're
doing but but you know those videos
don't take very long in terms of time
commitment let's say the average video
for that might be a two to three hour
time commitment because I have to record
it
you know it's say the average video is
15 minutes or so for me I have to record
it and it takes me to three times so
we'll just say that takes an hour to
record they don't really will say 30
minutes I have to edit it that's another
30 minutes I have to upload it that's
another 30 minutes because I have to put
content in and tags I have to do all
that stuff I have to create a thumbnail
so it's you know each videos two to
three hours but when I start going and I
start doing things like tutorials that
gets way more long so like TLD TLD TLDR
javascript that took me like six to
eight hours TLDR get that took me like
four to five hours is just sitting there
and doing it and not counting even
uploading and handling that so but so
goes to the mental bandwidth part of it
is I I make what I want so there's so
many people on YouTube that create
content they don't want to create
YouTube for me has always been been a
way for me to get to enjoy coding to to
continue to grind continue to grow and
part of me continuing to do YouTube
because in in Juneau know if you guys
just guys know this will be three years
of me consistently making content on
YouTube
and and part of that part of being able
to do something for such a long term
passion project like YouTube is yeah it
helps it you know it brings in some
money you know that's that's without a
doubt but it's also one of those things
where you have to keep it fun and and at
the end of day I make the videos that I
want to make and I change the content to
what I want to make Western in my
channel I was you know a guy who wanted
to be a dev and I I was doing coke atom
II tutorials and I grew out of that and
now I'm doing topic Orion tutorials and
I'm not growing out of that but I am
changing the concept to do tutorials
where I want to hammer down the basics
and learn Bill tutorials in that
direction whether anyone's asking for it
or not right so these are these are
things that I'm continuing to sort of I
I have my channel grow with me as I grow
and keep it fun that way do you think at
this point you have enough skills to
build anything
your jobs require you to build I think
so in the front end in the back end it
might take a little bit longer cuz I
don't do back in anymore just to front
end so I think we're people with the
YouTube where you people lose their way
with YouTube is you have to understand a
lot of times it's a it's a marathon
Cyprian and so sometimes people try to
sprint they think if they put out five
videos a week that their views will
double and in reality doesn't really
have that much of impact and on top of
that they they try to guess what videos
would do better than others and how they
might grow and don't get me wrong I know
when certain topics are gonna do better
than others at times but they stop
trying to make the videos that they want
to make and that's that's where it gets
a little tricky because then you no
longer you're doing it for yourself
you're doing for other people and it's
not gonna it's not genuine it's not
gonna work long term you tired it's
Friday man it's been a long week so for
those of you don't know usually by
Thursday or
Friday my girlfriend knows this very
well but I'm sort of beat down by
Thursday or Friday and I need about a
day a day to recharge if you will you
know so it is what it is when searching
for a new job is it easier to find one
we currently have one or when you don't
it's currently it's used so not only is
it easier to get a job when you already
have a job you'll also make more money
and get better benefits so if you guys
are everything and leaving your job
without a job it's a horrible decision
and you're in a much better bargaining
position when you have a job
so this bootstrap dead I don't think
bootstraps then you just have to be
comfortable to everything and that's one
of the things that I'm going to sort of
try and wean myself off is how can i how
can I get better with CSS that in future
tutorials I'm going to lean myself off
bootstrap and start doing it manually
hey Valen code tech caffeine is blown up
everyone should check it out almost
6,000 hours tons of topics every day
yeah for those of you guys who don't
know I have a Facebook group called Co
tech and caffeine and Eric program with
Eric is an admin and an avid poster and
moderator and it is an excellent job but
if you guys are interested in you know
it's just seeing what news articles are
coming out you'll see the videos when I
throw them up I'll do one little
shout-out to my cell phone there and you
definitely check it out and people ask
for questions you know it's it's it's a
strange thing because people ask for
help and advice and you get 30 or 40
comments on a post and that that's
really a cool thing I don't even give
videos with 35 we knew thanks you for
your educational entertaining : Thank
You Man
do I have any connection to the State of
Israel I do not
um have I worked with Amazon no I failed
two interviews with Amazon though I've
been interviewed I should say I've been
interviewed two separate times with
Amazon and have not gotten the job
Claude dev for life eh
yeah this is gonna be it's gonna go Tech
caffeine it's gonna be Co tech and code
Tech and the life that caffeine free
life yeah so I'm slowly going so my goal
right now is to do one tutorial a week
so I am NOT Jewish by faith but Jewish
by heritage that makes makes any sense
my family my dad's side the family's
Jewish yes join the cloud yeah I would
man I'm stressed I'm thinking about it
I'm thinking well I live for without
caffeine I'm just a healthier life and
your boy your boys been doing the
perfect pushup I don't mean to brag
doing set said to you guys should hear
me man I'm trying to do his first time
of my life I can't do a pull-up it's so
shameful and so I'm I'm
polling and screaming and I'm so close I
feel it pulling in my ABS I'm getting
back in shape boys don't you worry we're
getting there slowly but surely you're
gonna yes you're gonna be thinking
you're gonna be like it's that Dillon or
is that John song mess up in that bitch
that's what you're gonna be thinking a
couple couple weeks what would I do if I
lost my job
ah that's an interesting question
I very surprised but from a practical
standpoint what would I do if I lost my
job well I have I have plenty of money
saved up so I wouldn't be worried about
that financially and I
I currently bring in with YouTube enough
money to cover rent which is my largest
expense so you know what I bleed money
yes I'd have less money coming in so the
money situation would be covered but you
know I might I might move back home for
a little bit you know I did so
Tampa's always supposed to bend like a
five year thing so and we're going on
about two years right now in Florida so
about three years left but we probably
would just trigger it probably would
just trigger a Tito Oh stinker probably
just trigger me to head back to the west
coast
you know relocate maybe the tech city
like Seattle or SF or - where my
brothers at in Portland I might even try
and just do the like content creator
life for a little bit and I apply for
jobs I'd probably be what I would do I
don't know but I can say this Chinatown
bus is it's the first time in my life
that if I lost my job I wouldn't be
 you know so
you know that's it that's a good thing
that's a good feeling
you know I'm in Portland have you heard
great thanks my brother was in Portland
I've visited several times I thought was
a very beautiful city and being from
Southern California I know a lot of
people in Portland and Seattle so they'd
be nice a lot of people have relocated
there that went to high school with in
college and stuff stinker
where you going well like oh no that's
my water buddy we're gonna livestream
here Sundy best for ya April let him in
so he doesn't like when I close the door
Tito Tito waits all week and a hangout
and makes I've been so busy during the
weekdays yeah I've seen this
Google flutter stuff I've ever been
following it its latest bus decades I
don't even know what to do with it man
at what point would someone in front-end
development say someone was ready to
apply for a job a couple things you have
to have the basic skills right you have
to have the basic knowledge base and to
cover that that'd be HTML CSS JavaScript
a front-end framework like reactor
angular version control with get that to
me is probably the bare minimum if you
have those skills and you have projects
built in those and you have a portfolio
of those skills I think you're you're
about there I look tired guys I'll be
honest I'm sick of you telling me I look
like alright so if you notice the
bags under my eyes are much less than
they are no
so I've I've been sleeping in this week
to help counteract the the caffeine so
I've worked a little less this week so
I'm trying to give up caffeine I'm not
trying I am giving up caffeine
there's no more trying this is one thing
I eliminated when I said when I was
learning code as I stopped trying to do
things I now do things I fit there's no
more trying so and this is kind of this
is kind of one of those hippy hippy sort
of Jedi sort of spiritual you know
liberal craziness things but when I how
can I put this stop trying and just do
and that's what I'm trying to do I said
again that's what I'm doing you know
if you want to get in shape don't try to
lose weight go and lose weight we all
know what it takes if you want to have a
six-pack
only get a six-pack you know we all know
what that entails that's a great thing
about today's modern society is
knowledge is free knowledge of the world
is free and we all have the ability to
get the knowledge but can we follow
through with it right that's the hard
part you know we all know what it takes
to get six-pack ABS we all know what it
you know what we have to do to get
straight A's we know these things are
they important enough to actually make
changes in our lifestyle in their life
you know we all have to make those
decision
I personally am I'm striving to
accomplish the things I want to what I
want right now is to be healthier and
and you know continue to grow so that
that's sort of what I'm trying to to
accomplish what I'm accomplishing you
know and it may and it kind of leads
segues into the start of this video of
you know progress is slow sometimes but
it is progress and consistency will
speed it up as crazy as it sounds
well longer you do something the easier
becomes the more efficient it becomes
most of the time it's hardly any healthy
I like pizza too much yeah I'm starting
to get heartburn for the first time I my
buddy yeah and and here's the thing I'm
not like doing anything crazy right so
the three healthy things that I've
started maybe two weeks ago is every
morning April juices fresh veggies and
fruits for me and I have a that's my
breakfast as fruit and veggie fruit
juice right every morning weekend's
weekdays doesn't matter I've also
started doing perfect pushup nothing
crazy I'm doing two push-up sets right
now
that's but I'm consistently I'm sticking
to the perfect push-up doing two perfect
sets and you know on top of that I am
giving up caffeine I am you know and I'm
handling that in a way of okay less
caffeine I'm gonna feel tired let's get
a little bit more sleep so these are
actions that I'm taking that will make
it make me healthier and a conscious
thing so I want what's going on Casey
you're back Elliot so increasing the
exercise I'm also slightly changing my
diet right I let April do the shopping
she cooks much healthier than I would
normally and I'm also when I go out to
got to lunch I get less less food you
know first time in my life I find myself
ordering more on more than just an
entree and part of it it's just gluttony
there's no reason for it well people
still cook now it is yeah
I'm not balling that hard have I watched
sure Silicon Valley yes I watched season
one and season two I haven't caught any
of the newer seasons I think there are
season five now
I have not watched mr. robot serpent
hair bread yes we're gonna real sort of
strange usually is there like what does
heartburn feel like feels like hot gas
in your chest and throat what I do for
fun nowadays right now I'm playing God
of War but uh right now honestly meant
honestly right now I I don't do too much
for fun
I've playing a little God of War
recently but I've I've been in work mode
since I've been down here for about two
years now working on YouTube progressing
and and moving it forward that may need
to change I may be getting burnt out I'm
not sure I don't know I it's something I
asked myself quite often but I don't I
don't really do anything for fun anymore
I work a very goal-oriented I told
myself I was gonna work every day for
the most part till 2020 so I got a
little bit time left if you don't leave
anything at your job as useful in the
market you look for another job yes
absolutely
um I would say you go and get those
skills and be prepared for that other
job but yes
what is the reason you give when you
resign you just you say thank you for
the opportunity I appreciate I
appreciate you know everything we do I
wish you best of luck in your project is
with regret that I I must be giving my
two weeks effective blah blah blah and
you don't have to necessarily say say in
a letter but if if they ask I mean they
I didn't put it in my letter when I when
I resign from my previous role but they
they asked they asked him like well you
know what's up I was like it's just a
better opportunity that's it people
understand you know what II don't pay
the bills yeah I mean it's cold but it's
true right um you know if you get a job
that pays 20 grand more that's 20 grand
to help take care of your parents that's
20 grand to you know feed and clothe
their children and get a good house and
you know your career look here's the
thing here's the thing this is the
honest God truth 99.9% of companies and
I don't say a hundred people get upset
when I say a hundred but 99.9% of
companies don't give a about you
and if they had to they layoff they
wouldn't lose any sleep about it
and they would move on as if you never
were there
honest to god this is the truth man and
I don't blame them for that but we as
people as employees sometimes sometimes
you know they they like they it's a cold
hard fact they either keep you they
don't and there's a reason they get rid
of it most of the time so the truth of
the matter is that if you've tried if
you stick with a company they may not
stick with you they probably won't
coding phase is making 20k a month good
for him man
respect that expect that grind
god bless I'm gonna have to go start
taking some notes what's he making all
this money from Casey
ad revenue don't pay that well
he's got sites that are tools with ads
oh yeah that makes sense I thought about
doing stuff like that and I just haven't
got around to it someone asked me about
what I would do if I was unemployed
probably something like that good for
him though huh
I also do blogging and blogging it would
be a fun thing to do should I start with
the reactor go with PHP those are two
completely different things
honestly you should probably pick up a
framework once your contr Othon on a sh
t on CSS reactor English
um but yeah I'd pick up a front-end
framework and then you can integrate
some back-end that could be PHP as
that's what you want all right guys um
is that a green screen or is the wall
green the wall is green but it's used as
a green screen I guess I preciate y'all
I'm gonna have some dinner spent a
little time with the girlfriend work on

forward to means tutorials come in in
the near future I guess</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
