random quote machine in angular 5 the
current version of angular fun little
project just to kind of expose you to
angular if we built it in the past in
jQuery and now we're gonna go to the big
boy frameworks and do the same thing
you'll see here that we have a nice
little green theme to go with it click
here it'll bring up a new quote with the
new author and then we have the of
course the ability to go ahead and tweet
out what that quote is using some of
Twitter's built-in functionality so
let's go ahead and go over what it is
that you're going to need to do this
project hey guys before we get started I
just want to do a quick shout out to dev
Mountain who sponsored this video I
won't thank them for supporting the
channel and I really like this start a
career you're proud of it really reminds
me of like damn man I remember when I
hated being a pizza delivery driver and
now I'm a developer I'm so happy about
it I love the people at dev Mountain
they they're a great boot camp it so if
you're looking for one with housing and
tuition included go ahead and check them
out again I want to thank them for
sponsoring this tutorial alright first
and foremost you're gonna need to go
ahead and install a node it's real quick
install you don't need a walkthrough
it's literally just download this
recommended for most user file it's a
desktop installation just clip on keep
on clicking next and you'll you'll get
done with that eventually then there's
the angular CLI and this is the this is
gonna be what's going to help us
essentially get our project set up
there's a lot of different functionality
I really just use it for that so we're
gonna want to npm install in one of our
terminals - G that means globally the
angular CLI and then when we create our
application will use all will say as ng
new and then the name of it and then
we're good to go and then we can launch
our node server or our angular server
rather with ng serve now if you're
interested in what terminal I'll be
using I'll be using the hyper terminal
mainly because I can get puppies and
cats on it well that being true but also
has some additional plugins to the open
source terminal
so this come off like a sponsor grits
not sponsor just at that and it's a it's
code in HTML CSS and JavaScript check it
out but that will be what I will be
using for this project so let's go ahead
and get started make sure you install
the angular CLI
make sure you install node and then just
have some sort of terminal that we'll be
using to launch this stuff all right so
let's go ahead and get started
wherever you keep your projects go that
place on your desktop I have this new
folder called web dev YouTube so I'm
gonna go ahead and launch one of my
terminals and we're gonna just
instantiate our new angular application
at this point you should have installed
node and you should have installed the
angular CLI so all we need to do here
now that we have angular CLI to get a
new project installed is just say ng new
in the name of the project will call
this random - quote and this is gonna go
and create our brand new angular sort of
settings or not settings but um you'll
see the folder gets created here it's
gonna start installing the packages via
yarn because I've yarn installed and I
think it actually comes by default in
here but uh well let that install and
we'll come back to a some actual coding
alright now that we've installed our
project it's going to install font
awesome icons we can do that just by
saying NPM install NPM should work just
fine because we've installed note and
NPM cuz with node by default so NPM
install font - awesome
and while that's going when you go ahead
and open up our text editor I happen to
use Visual Studio code that's my
personal favorite but you can use all
the other janky ones because this one's
the best
no it's whatever you want and we'll
continue with our project so go ahead
and find that folder or that project
that we were in oops
and of course make sure I just realized
that I installed node modules into my
directory and not into my actual project
make sure you're actually going into
your random quote project and installing
your font - awesome alright so that's
getting installed let's go ahead and
open up our our project any other quote
nope it's the wrong folder sweet alright
so
ya know quote file this is from I
believe that that's from my bad install
earlier alright so she's done installing
over here it's still installing and what
we're gonna do is we're going to start
by cleaning out the crap that we don't
need so by default any other comes with
some tests installed in here there's no
testing that we actually really need to
do it's a pretty simple application so
we can go ahead and delete all that save
that in the HTML we're gonna be
reworking our own HTML down the road
we'll go ahead and delete that as well
and then in the half component TS we can
go ahead and get rid of this title
property and delete that as well
all right so by now fun awesome should
be done installing there's one last
thing that we have to install which is
the current version of bootstrap 4.0 -
beta - you can see I'm just going to go
ahead and copy this over and then we'll
go ahead and install that and not only
do we have to install it we actually
have to then go into the application and
tell it that we want to use it and we'll
go ahead and showcase that first so
that's gonna install and then what we
need to do is let's go ahead and open up
our text editor go into our angular CLI
JSON and you'll see here that there are
a ton there's a ton stuff going on here
one the name of the project but what we
really care about is this global
stylesheet here and what we want to do
so we just want to include the font
awesome icons so that all our
applications has that and it's based off
the path node underscore modules /font -
awesome
slash CSS /font - awesome dot CSS and we
also want to install bootstrap which we
just installed as well start out /no and
i underscore modules nope let's see here
fix that and this will be slash
bootstrap
and if you go into the slush disk slash
CSS slash bootstrap dot CSS and if
you're actually going to the node
modules you would find all these files
so that's what we're referencing here
but now we have access to be able to use
our font awesome icons and our bootstrap
CSS that we just installed alright so
let's start by just creating the files
that we need now we're gonna create one
component and then we're also gonna
create one service so typically you
would have your services and a service
so let's go ahead and create that
services the service is just going to be
the get call it's gonna store the get
call to be used and return all the data
that we want down the road so we'll say
services a new file we'll just call this
quote dot service dot TS and we won't
put anything in it yet we're just doing
some setup and they'll do new folder
here and we'll just call this quote -
box this will be essentially our quote
box component at the end of the day and
what that needs it pretty much needs
three things always a for if you're
doing testing we're not focusing on
testing here so the first thing is and
you'll notice the naming convention it's
going to be identical right to the file
name quote box component dot T s so
that's going to be our component that
we're going to be building or though
we're all our logic goes so we have our
quote - box dot component dot HTML it's
going to be the template for our
component and then if we need it we're
gonna have quote - box dot component
dot scss this is just going to be
styling for our component so now that
we've gone ahead and set that up
let's showcase a little bit of what
we're gonna be using to go and actually
get our our data
I took me a while to find a random quote
thing that wasn't going to give me a
course here which is to elaborate
essentially some some servers don't let
you hit an API from your localhost
so I found one they did which is nice
and so we're gonna be creating a model
as well there we go and so we have three
things coming back to the category the
author and the quote we really only care
about the quote in the author for our
random quote and we're gonna go ahead
and create a model class based off of
that so that when our data comes and we
know that it's coming in correctly
formatted so how do we do that
well one more folder here to do some
setup and we're gonna have models go
ahead and Stan she ate a new class in
here and we're just gonna call this
quote dot class dot TS and we'll go
ahead and set that up right now
so what we want to do is export a class
that we can use in our document other
places so we have this class quote and
quote is going to have two parameters
it's gonna have a quote which will be
the string and we're basing this you'll
notice that it's we're essentially
making these identical right as to what
its gonna be and then we have the author
right so that was what was in the object
public author this is a string as well
and now we need a constructor for when
we build a new class and basically this
is just us saying hey for these things
that we instantiated go ahead and
make them part of our object when we
create our class when we create it so
we're just gonna create this constructor
real quick and if this doesn't make
sense
your first time dealing with
constructors and classes it was it needs
to be out there don't worry too much
about it essentially what we're doing is
we're just saying hey that these values
when we have a constructor when we
create a new class we want to set this
quote equal to quote that's all and then
I want to say this dot author equal to
author was it complaining about here Oh
get rid of this public get rid of this
public
there we go
and so now we have our constructor so
whenever we create a new class a new
quote it will take the values that we're
passing and and set the properties that
are quote an author here so let's go
ahead and create our angular service
that's gonna go and actually get the
random quote from the API and when
dealing with services we're going to
need to import the injectable know if
it's called a library or a service or
what before we need an injectable from
at angular core
and one things that uh one things has
changed is in angular 5 they updated
their the way that they do HTTP calls so
now we're going to also need to import
the HTTP client from angular at angular
slash common slash HTTP in the past you
would probably have been importing the
from angular slash HTTP but now that
would be although it's deprecated now it
still works I believe but it's not
something that they recommend that you
use so we're gonna have this at X at
injectable then we're going to export a
class and this is going to be our quote
service that we're going to import into
our component later on and all we need
to do here is we need to essentially add
Stan she ate what our application is
going to be using which in this case is
the HTTP client and then we can go ahead
and set up our kit call now so I got to
work yet because there's some additional
setup that we need to do not only in the
component but actual in the module where
we import some of our dependencies but
we'll get to that when we're done here
we're almost done with our service so we
need to create a function called get
random quote and this is going to do
exactly that so go ahead and return a
random quote to us and what we want to
do is return this dot HTTP GET and in
here we're gonna go ahead and pass in
the quote I still have it safe good and
you'll see here that's all we're doing
on the for our services hey go ahead and
return whatever this gives us and we are
done with our service but let's go into
our app here into the app module now
module is really something I says hey
all these things that we created we
actually want to use them and the first
thing that we can go ahead and do is
import our service that we just created
our quote service services will go into
the providers array
and we'll go ahead and do services and
so now that we've imported it go ahead
and jump down to the providers this will
be quote service very nice and one last
thing that we need to import for here is
the angular HTTP module client modules
the HTTP client module that's what it is
and you'll see here so this is another
new thing that we need to import we
modules go into the imports and now we
have access to our git call so let's go
ahead and build out our components so
that we can actually call that get call
and see the results of it alright so
last time we were we finished our
service and now we're gonna go ahead and
get create a component so that we can
actually execute that service as well as
actually do all our additional logic so
first thing that we need to do is we
have to import component from at angular
core angular slash board rather now
after that we just want to go ahead and
create our component basically do all
the bootstrapping setup stuff and you
can do this by generating a component
using the angular CLI but I think it's a
little bit helpful and this is how I do
it at work normally just because we
don't use the angular CLI so it's kind
of a habit but uh so we have our
selector which is going to be the name
of the component when we use it in the
template we're then gonna have our
template URL which will actually be the
HTML for this specific component which
in our case is just going to be quote
box quote - wasa dr cohn HTML and then
we're going to have a style so you start
of the URLs it's just be an array with
our style sheets I don't believe we
actually have anything in here but just
in case we will actually set it up
because we'll be using bootstrap for the
most part and then we want to go ahead
and export this as a quote box
this is typically how I would name my my
components the the file path name and
caps no dashes and then dang opponent
you saw earlier I'd ended in services so
now that we've said that we have to
actually import our service our quote
service so that we can use it here and
instantiate it or use it rather and then
add it to the constructor to do services
we don't need the dot TS all right so
now that that's there let's go ahead and
add it to our constructor again if
you're still kind of struggling with the
constructor syntax essentially all it is
is saying hey when you build this
component when you construct this
component these are some default things
it must have and here we are
instantiating those default things so
public we'll just call this quote
service of type quote service suite now
that we've done that we can go ahead and
subscribe so let's create some
properties here we're basically just
gonna have a single quote on the page at
one time so we can go ahead and create
the models already over the quote class
I did so you see here we have this quote
let's actually go ahead and create an
instance of that so say this dot public
quote is equal to new quote and in here
we're interesting to pass in some empty
strings right so by default it's going
to have some empty strings in here and
we'll need to import the quote class
mmm models put class cool so the reason
that we instantiate this is if we don't
it's going to give us some errors in our
template later on so we're just going to
set some default values of empty strings
which in our constructor here will then
go ahead and give it some real values
some some values that have some meaning
and so we'll say this dot quote service
why'd you stop typing quote service is
equal to excuse me dot get random quote
and what we want to do here is we just
want subscribe to this observable and
pass the data to it I have data in here
and we'll just put a type quote that's
really what it's coming through here at
the end of the day and so now that we
have that we can go ahead and say this
dot quote it's just used to class syntax
again is equal to a new quote that is
going to be this data dot quote and data
dot author and we'll go ahead and
console dot log this and we may get some
modulators and things like that but
we'll take care of those right now
so console dot log this dot quote and
let's go ahead and actually export this
to a function because we're gonna be
calling this later on on a button click
so we might as well take care of that
right now public function
public get quote I apologize if I'm
making silly mistakes s it I just got
off work I'm just trying to finish this
project now so I'm a little look a
little tired I got cat on my lap so if
you hear purring in the background loop
that's what it is let's go to
instantiate call this dot get quote so
it will instantiate our quote
sweet uh do we have any compile errors
no so let's go ahead and launch this
real quick I'll go to local close 4200
and see if we have any errors now I
don't believe we've actually
instantiated our application sweet no
errors but I think we're gonna get one
or two when we go to jump to our modules
so in our app here in the component what
we want to do is we want to go ahead and
just inject our quote box all right and
so let's see any air is it it's pretty
loading reloading yes quote box is not a
known element so we have to go add that
to the into the app module you'll see
here we have we are imported our quote
service but we didn't actually import
our quote box component we have to give
our app module access to it and say
quote smash box box and we remember
components go in the declarations area
go ahead and save that and is this the
winner winner chicken dinner
almost unexpected value undefined by
compiler what does that mean
Oh gonna refresh this one time quote box
opponents from coal box for box
interesting
I have no idea what that means uh
undefined completely alright so it
looked like our compiler just messed up
all I did to solve this issue was I just
restarted the server so I closed it out
with ctrl C and then I restarted it with
the ng serve command so everything
should be the same if you've got that
air that's what I did to solve that
issue now so we've added that and school
we're actually getting air quote we're
getting the author and we're getting the
quote and we'll you will set this up to
a click property and we can go ahead and
add that real quick I forgot what I
actually made this look like so let me
go ahead and launch that real quick all
right so in here what we want to do or
excuse me in our quote - box template we
want to do is just go ahead and create a
bike on real quick called
I dot for fog - Plus then we'll go ahead
and we'll wrap this with a button and
we'll give the button a class of
BTN outlined success and on click add a
click function here you want to go ahead
and call the I believe I called it the
get random quote is that right
I don't just get quote and save that and
let's see what we have here that looks a
little strange but it's working I don't
know I don't know what I must have
missed type something uh let's see here
oh I forgot BTN in front of it so that
looks like me if you added bootstrap
like negative 1 &amp;amp; 2 windows 98 or
something there we go
a little bit cleaner cool so let's
actually just go ahead and add the
Twitter icon because that was another
functionality and the rest is just going
to be CSS and HTML and we should be able
to handle that easily enough so we'll
add a button here and we will add the
BTN dot B TN - outline - success
and we'll go ahead and add I got fog fog
- Twitter ID our Twitter icon and the
way that I did this was I simply wrapped
I actually changed this button to an
anchor tag and we went ahead and we
opened this set target equal to blank
and then let's go ahead and change this
button tag to an anchor tag again and
then there was a route that are at URL
that twitter has that we can append our
data to so let's go ahead and set the
just give a little bit of space here and
then in here we're gonna create a
dynamic href in this first part is going
to be a string that we're passing in
that we're going to then add some stuff
to so you'll see here we're passing in
this twitter.com slash intent slash
tweet query string text equals and at
the end of this text equal what we want
it to be is just BR our quote and
that'll be pronounced our quote quote
you know what maybe quote that quote is
good we can refract it later I just
thinking I didn't add the author to this
I think it's okay for what we're trying
to do here but we can we can do better
down the road so you'll see here we
click here opens up in a new window and
it should sweet it has our as our text
I'll hold the alright
you see this query string goes on for a
very long time nice so we have our
buttons now it's just a matter of making
it look nice right we we if I remember
correctly we had had a green background
and set the background a whole whole
application we would simply jump into
our index.html
now here and we can just go ahead and
have everything I have a background and
again this BG success is just some
bootstrap stuff to set a green
background to go with our color scheme
well that's interesting we'll come back
we'll figure that out in a second I'm
not quite sure why it hit a white over
it wrote our things we'll figure it out
piece by piece so let's go ahead and
start created a div now oh I know why so
we'll create a div in our HTML and we're
gonna in here we're gonna add a make it
a container so we get a little space on
the side and we also want stuff to be
centered so we're gonna add the text
centered class center not centered and
let's go ahead and pop these bad boys in
here so this will wrap our whole
application and the next thing that we
want to do is we want to create a row
and then we're going to justify the
content center so that our couple of our
things are centered as well so it's
going a div dot row and then will
justify content Center all right and
control X and let's face that in there
and let's see what we have so far
you know what let me actually take this
off because this is thrown this is
throwing me for a loop right now
actually let's see it let's see what
happens
let's take off this index.html I wonder
why that's so strong okay I think our
card will fix it when we add it in a
second we'll have a white background
with the card we'll come back to that
background so we have this in here and
this and the next thing that we want to
add so we want to add a card element now
this is just our card class here on a
div and we want to make that text green
that's in there so we're gonna go ahead
and add everything that's in here text -
success and I'll make it green and then
we'll go ahead and copy these bad boys
in there let's see if that gives us all
right so there's our buttons you can see
they're centered and let's see we should
have a carb just going to give us a
little bit of oh you know it it only
gives us around the edges there so we
have to add our text to really see
anything but it is there and we don't I
don't want my card to touch the top of
the page so we're gonna go ahead and add
MT - 5 and that's going to add margin
top and then a large amount of padding
and then in here we are going to create
a blockquote with the class
equal to blockquote and we're going to
add text center although I don't think I
need let's actually get off there I
think it should inherit it from the
container and within here within our
block quote we're then going to create a
paragraph tag and this is going to have
the M margin bottom - 0 so nope
no margin and then this is also going to
add a p3 padding class these are all
just defaults that are that are part of
bootstrap for probably one of my
favorite things is the margin and the
padding aspects for bootstrap for now
next what we want to do is we won't have
a big quote right a big green quote that
that shows up as we're trying to use it
oh also on our card we want to give it a
minimum width of 30 REM so let's go
ahead and add this to the card skip that
sweet all right so here we want to add
the fafa - quote - left and then we're
going to make that a little bit large so
we're gonna add that dot the foie - LG
and that will be our quote and then
within the paragraph just put a little
space here and we'll just use a little
bit string interpolation here and we'll
say quote our quote objects and then
quote it's going to refresh and see what
we're working with so far so you can see
we got pushed down a little bit and now
we have oh that's quite big I have to
that's doing something I don't know it's
not doing what we wanted to do but
all right not quite there yet but almost
so we want to go ahead and add the the
author is what we haven't actually added
the author jump back into here and in
here we have within our block quote we
have a footer with the dot class of
block quote - footer and block quote
footer has its own sort of class so
we're just gonna add text - success to
it to overwrite that and because we
don't need to add anything nested and
the tax we'll just use a little bit of
property binding and we'll set the inner
text equal to quote dot author to
inherit from our author and we will go
ahead and wrap these two buttons in a
single div and throw them into here
let's see we have BTN retain online
success - and I believe I wanted to give
each one of these a little bit of a
little bit of spacing so we'll go ahead
and what I put em - yeah MC you sound it
looks good and we'll go ahead and add a
little bit of margin around them and em
- - go ahead and save that so you see we
have our we have our so that's off a
little bit why is it off a little bit we
can Center it but at the very least it
should have
do we have one too many this
all right let's see if this fixed it
yeah okay there we go
all right cool so all we really have
left to do now is we just need to go
ahead and add a the green background and
I think now that we have everything set
up with our our card and everything it
shouldn't overwrite it if it does I may
be very confused
um and save that and we should be good
to go
there goes all right yes so so at the
end of day we just go ahead and click
this you'll see us still we can go ahead
and get rid of that console.log you
don't ever want to leave debuggers or
console statements in your code and try
to eliminate as many comments as you can
once you kind of get better at naming
your appropriate functions and that's
our app that's our app that's our
angular app pretty pretty
straightforward I know I brush through a
lot of the CSS it's all bootstrap
classes so if you're not familiar with
it just got to get bootstrap calm then
go ahead and tweet this and you'll see a
small house musta pen and we click this
again right just make sure hey is it
actually resetting dude a little bit of
debugging is this what we thought it was
gonna be and it is right so everything's
working I hope you guys found this

guys if you like this course you're
looking for something a little bit a
little bit harder not not too hard but I
would recommend my angular 360 part 1
course it's a one-off project that's you
building a personal portfolio it's about
three hours of content we do wireframes
we build out the project with
refactor the project then we also add
additional features for you to build on
- after the fact it's a it's an
entry-level project it's about one step
harder than what we just did so if
you're looking to continue on with
angular I'll include a link to this in
