talking about the results of free code
camps 20,000 people surveyed not too
long ago you may remember the video
where I tried n do a little promotion so
that people could go and put in their
inputs but uh I I love this sort of
stuff because it really I think what
people find out is that you'll read
through here and you'll see that your
goals what it is you're trying to do a
lot of people are in the same rut a lot
or a lot of people are in the same area
going through it and you're not alone
in this case we have 20,000 people
thanks to Quincy who posted the results
of their data so let's go ahead and go
through to it so you can get a quick
summary it was over 20,000 students the
the prerequisite you've been coding for
five years or less right so you get a
little bit of a goal of what what goals
what's everybody trying to do some
people just want to work for a company
that's fine some people want to start
your own company some people want a
freelance some people want to work for a
start-up a multinational corporation so
some people want to work for the biggest
companies whether that's for money or
other reasons but you can see that it's
kind of split all around everyone's kind
of learning code for their own for their
own reason in this case most people are
trying to be web developers full sack
front-end back-end no big surprise here
that as we're going to what I thought it
Quality Assurance engineer that's QA a
lot of a lot of people don't know about
QA or product manager and I've talked
about this a little bit in the past hey
there's not only front-end back-end and
full stack there's other positions that
you may be better suited for game
developer data scientists user
experience designer information security
DevOps so there's a lot of different
roles and I hope you learn about those
if it may be web developments not for
you but you still want to work as a
insert of the same basically one of the
one of the strongest industries you can
get into at the
of the day so of the of the 9,000 people
who answer this question how many
applying for jobs in the next 12 months
apparently 17% immediately so people are
actively who are using free code camp
and other resources as well are actively
applying and let's see 28% so within the
next six months people plan on on
applying which is pretty reasonable
right I think you can learn a lot in six
months 50% on wanna work remote I want
to work in the office as opposed to
working remotely down for 50 so this
doesn't surprise me I think more and
more you're going to get a younger
generation that is they understand that
hey I can work at home on a computer and
they're you know they're going to be
more enticed to work from home or have
no preference at the very least where a
it'd be great if I work the remote but I
still want that paycheck in the office
so not not too not too much this I'm
like I like to see this this was
probably my one of my more favorite
things about the survey is that 77
percent of people are willing to
relocate for a job so what does this
tell you well one that people are
willing to step outside their comfort
zone and move and the 23 percent who are
saying no might be doing themselves a
disservice because you're not only
competing with the developers in your
area you're competing with the
developers trying to move into your area
so are applying elsewhere I'm a great
example of this I'm part of that 77%
where I was in California now I'm in
Florida and so those those Tampa
developers are competing with me all the
way from Los Angeles right so it also
opens you up to a lot more positions but
that's pretty cool
so it no surprise that free code camps
the number one learning resource Stack
Overflow w3schools code Khadem e md and
all these are sort of the great
resources udemy CSS tricks is it is a
great site as well if you're if you're
bad with CSS like I am Udacity I feel
like Udacity Coursera udemy AK we could
probably throw them all into one
treehouse is another one at 13% though
in projects not too not too surprising
considering I believe that is a Ruby on
Rails only code words 10% good for them
a lot of people like code Wars so this
one kind of set was kind of sad that
less than less than half have attended
in person coding related events so of
the 20,000 only about 40 as I come down
to 40 9700 was to do that let's not do
math I hate math it's hard boys uh so uh
I just got off work alright so if
anyone's judging me right now I know
someone's judging me watching this video
my brain is jelly I just got off work
cut me some slack but what's cool about
this is you can see where people are
going I've always said meet ups are
great hackathons free cooking have study
groups I've gone to a couple of these in
the past and I'll let you get a wide
range of people sometimes you get a
senior dev most are on the junior end
decide working through free code camps
and trying to learn and get help I I'd
like to go to them because I
particularly like teaching I like I like
solving like helping people solve
through issues I already understand and
until they kind of get it I enjoy that
so I like going these things because a
lot of times I'll get some out but most
of the time I'm usually helping because
it's a younger earlier on in your career
you're getting started I guess what I'm
trying to say I don't listen to podcasts
but apparently a good 37% of people do
and other is the largest one so I think
it goes all over the place code newbie
is the largest one I I don't know any of
these but it doesn't really surprise me
that that a younger I feel like podcasts
are for more of the senior developer
type than anything else when you you
know maybe you got that long commute and
you're trying to just better yourself a
lot of senior developers I dunno do
listen to these things though so I mean
that could be bias on my end but but I
feel like maybe maybe as a junior
developer some of the concepts they're
talking about might be a little too
advanced or
even as someone who's just learning code
might be able to hear that so YouTube
this is the section I like uh but uh so
you choose my number one resource when
learning a new framework or library so
I'm glad to see that fifteen thousand
out of the twenty thousand one hundred
and fourteen point five thousand of the
20k decided to take advantage of that
and I hope that the other five thousand
start as well but three out of four I
use YouTube forty six percent free code
camp MIT OpenCourseWare is cool Google
developers the new Boston surprise
surprise right learn code Academy I was
surprised how many people use learn code
Academy I will say that def kicks Derek
bonus is one of my favorites that I
highly recommend him people ask me all
the time who I watch on YouTube it's
Derek bonus the new Boston and I don't
see him on here but I promise you that
you guys will not you uh you will not
regret starting to follow traversée
media a lot of great a lot of great
tutorials coming out of this way on a on
a frequent basis and we got our boy
engineer truth probably the only YouTube
survey I will ever beat him on but and
then we came in that test which is got
eleven percent of the go that's pretty
solid
I like that up to twenty K six percent
of coders have attended more than one
hundred and forty eight different boot
camps that's crazy because I consider
myself kind of a boot camp connoisseur
and there's not that many on here that I
can that I recognize general suddenly
App Academy I haven't heard iron hack
the iron yard is common have heard
lighthouse labs and of course dev
Mountain who I'm sponsored by isn't on
here as well shame on you guys know well
yeah I'm glad suit people are got that
I'm glad to see there are a hundred and
forty eight different boot camps because
I feel like the majority of them are
pretty pretty good seventy percent of
people did not take out a loan to go to
boot camp good on you if you're praised
at seventy percent you saved your money
to put towards your education
for you and if you're part of the 30%
who found yourself in the situation
where you needed to take out money so
that you can better your education good
on you two winners all around baby I
appreciate all of you guys spending your
hard-earned money or taking out a loan
and paying back that hard-earned money
so that you could get yourself some
skills and go through the program and it
sounds like 82% of people would
recommend a boot camp to their friends
that's pretty big
cuz 18% know ah that because how many
people didn't complete the boot camp or
how many people signed up and thought it
was going to be easy and didn't prepare
because there's always going to be that
and that sounds like somewhere around
18% to me so I feel like this is almost
like a hundred percent passing rate only
because I think there's something to be
said about people who there's always
going to be a percentage of people who
jump into a program and it's not for
them or jump into a program and they
don't really take it too seriously as
well I think boot camps you get both of
those people because you get the people
who are motivated and want to learn and
want to get a good skill set and want to
get some money and live a good life and
are willing to work hard for it at the
same time you get the people are like ah
10 grand and it's almost like I'm
guaranteed you know 60 70 80 100 K or
whatever it may be
I'll just jump into the program so I do
feel like they're there you're prone to
get that good 18 percent as we'll call
it now Oh
80 percent are considered male 19
percent female and then a little bit
broken up into the the other genders
genderqueer I'm familiar with trans I'm
familiar with other I'm someone familiar
with a gender I guess maybe a sexual
although I think that I don't think
that's gendered but anyhow the big thing
from here is that uh we're all men quick
four out of five minutes that's it at
the end of the day and about the other
four the other fifth is a female so
better than better than it actually is
in the industry right now which is
probably one in ten so it's probably
doubled the amount of females that are
going to be jumping in which is good and
here is the thing I really like here I'm
29 years old I'm a developer I wasn't a
developer until I was until I turned 29
actually I I turned 29
three weeks after becoming a full-time
developer and so the average person the
average age of a person learning code
out of the 20,000 is 28 so I know when I
was and you make you know you may be 30
40 don't don't be discouraged if you're
above this number jump right in mana you
can see right here all the way up to 50
60 70 75 there's even so 70 maybe or 75
and you're learning to code bless you
bless you bless you bless you I might be
religious but I hope you are blessed
because that is impressive
now I know when I was 25 I felt like I
was getting in my life I wasn't getting
my life together and all this starts out
28 right here you're ahead of the curve
then so uh and if you're a little bit
older you don't worry about it guys just
work hard and you'll get there but 28
the average age of the personal area
coincidentally I believe it's twenty
nine point six is the median age of
everybody on on earth I saw that in a
video the other day for CNN you can see
everybody is learning to code across the
map where the age is where it breaks up
pretty cool 187 different countries 38%
is in the USA which is cool to see that
62% is out of out of the states learning
code most live in large countries know
about fourth are ethnic minorities it's
just an interesting question to ask on
here because I don't know that it has
much relevance but but a is interesting
at the same time you know about 50% are
English and there's a bunch of other
down below and then here's education 38%
have a bachelor's degree 17% some
College 12% a high school degree 9%
a master's degree seven percent some
high school professional degree
associate's degree trading school all
this sort of great stuff no high school
hmm I guess that's interesting yeah 3%
or almost 500 people are saying with no
high school I guess maybe in the u.s.
you pretty much have to go to high
school so maybe this is out of the u.s.
or unfortunately just had unfortunate
circumstances um who would and they said
this is pretty this is pretty common
where you see the most common degree is
computer science the next five are like
business business or tech and business
oriented and so you see economics a lot
and this is a lot and a lot of those
guys go into data scientists so if you
ever talk to someone who maybe builds
databases or it's doing data analytics a
lot of them have econ degrees or
business series psychology that's
interesting
computer programming I don't know if
this is because is a newer degree or
less well-known the computer science so
I'm surprised that this one's down to
low say with software engineering
two-thirds of us are also working so if
you if you think that you can't go to
school or you can't work and you can't
learn code two out of three people say
nah I'm doing it and you came to I know
I was when I was living free co-champs
so don't let that not motivate you and
don't like that you know don't get in
your head that all I have to work a
full-time job it's impossible it's it's
and by the way to those two thirds and
to Congrats everybody learning to code
but to those two thirds good for you man
I want you right now and you may not be
where you are want to be in life but I
want you to to look at yourself and just
appreciate yourself a little bit more
cuz it's hard man I've done there I've
gone I've worked and I had to you know
after working for eight 12-hour days and
had to go say look I don't care I'm
doing my hour of code on those 12-hour
days on those eight-hour days I'm doing
my three hours of code on those four
hour days I'm doing my eight hours of
code whatever it is I'm doing it and you
know it's hard you got to grind it out
and good for you guys I hope you guys
appreciate that you grind in and out
you'll get there man half of us are
working
a software field this is a print it's
pretty impressive which is Mike in my
case I was working at a software company
as a technology trainer doing videos and
getting requirements and and doing
technical documentation occasion a
little bit ui/ux in terms of wire
framing user flow so that I fall in
those categories so I guess I'm not that
unique but I'm trying to say um 38% of
people travel at least one hour to from
work that sucks man that sucks
spent at least one hour travelling
confer that's yeah that's up man
that I think this is another reason why
so many people want to be developer in
terms of a remote developer anyhow you
have three new coders are single that's
interesting 8% of coders have served in
their country's military this doesn't
surprise me there is a but maybe it's
you guys I work out a company with a
military background so 15 percent have
children this is surprising I always
assume many people have more children
but just like I felt like I I'm in
minority of not having children but
maybe I'm wrong
44% considers themself underemployed
that's why you that's why the you know a
lot of you guys are trying to better
yourself so not to be there 23 of
student loan debt that sucks
and a home mortgage all right 15 percent
this is the real travesty 15 percent of
people don't have high-speed internet at
home that's that's unfortunate um I I
love that Quincy releases the data and I
look forward to every time he does this
and hope you guys look and see that
you're eight even at times you may feel
that you're a little behind or not where
you want to be and and all that sort of
stuff just appreciate that you're in the
grind and you're going there and if you
like Quincy's articles as I do make sure
you follow him and getting email or go
to medium free code camp calm I enjoy
all this stuff man and I hope you guys
stay motivated it's hard learning how to
code guys I won't lie to you but it
takes it takes cry
it takes emotion and it takes it takes
feeling good while you're doing it and
think and you're not getting paid to do
it yet right it's just a hobby until you
get paid and like you'll get there and I
hope you see that of those twenty
thousand people they believe they're
going to get there and they will as long
as they stick with it I hope you got
stick with this same motivated work hard
