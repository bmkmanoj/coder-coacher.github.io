what I believe to be one of the last
videos zoom and I'll come back to this
project going to run this real quick so
what we're gonna do is basically turn
these seconds into minutes and then
format the code accordingly so the first
thing that we want to do is the session
time now what we're gonna need to do
you're going to pull my code is we're
gonna need to when we click start
convert this minutes into seconds pretty
straightforward so all we have to do
here for the start is say look take arc
take our there goes take our our count
here and go ahead and set it equal to
the correct value so we're gonna say
look count is equal to count times 60 so
basically take that number and put in
the 60 so we'll go ahead and run it
right now and you'll see that we're just
gonna have just gonna take our 5 and
it's going to turn it into a very like
300 cool so that's working so next what
we want to do is we actually want to
format that down in our actual code
because right now our logic is sound but
we need to format it no one really
counts seconds we want it to look much
more normal than that so the way that we
can do that is we're gonna have to use a
if-else statement so here we can do if
and we can do an L so the reason for
that is extreme rules and parameters
when dealing with when the way the
modulo that it's not going to format it
correctly so we'll do the major if
statement so if again remember this is
our so we're what we're basically going
to say is look if count modulo 60 is
greater than 10 greater than or equal to
10 meaning if it's not a single digit
number what we want to do is we want to
target that num our output and say look
change that HTML and first thing that we
want to do is count divided by 60 plus
the colon plus count modulo 60 now I'm
going to show you this this isn't gonna
be perfect quite yet so I'm gonna take
out this else statement real quick
just so that you can see see the
formatting of why we're gonna use math
dot floor here so it's going to start
and you're gonna see that it's gonna
fall
why did you do that
oh I see why I did that so we have to
take out this line of code it's go ahead
and run that I forgot that we already
put our HTML in there actually close so
click start now it should have our
format so you're seeing right now
there's our seconds but unfortunately
this is has a we need to actually get
rid of this remainder so pretty
straightforward
all we're going to do here is do math
dot floor and this will get rid of it
just go and run that
so you'll see right here everything's
counting down properly pretty cool but
uh I mentioned that we are going to need
to use a little bit different logic now
we're gonna go ahead and let this count
down right now for the next minute maybe
I'll speed it up maybe I won't great
opportunity go ahead and check out my
patreon page a new blog is going up on
is well kind of how my channel started
is basically what I'll be covering good
time to shout out some future sponsors
code mentor do I'll be doing some
sponsoring videos and like they'll be
letting me do some react courses to
review for them and also quick shout out
to ericsurf6 on youtube we're going to
be doing some collaborations together
I'm very excited about it he's a much
larger youtuber
than myself and he's really taking a
liking to my channel wants to support it
so thank you to Eric for that but
alright so we'll see right here that now
this logic doesn't work so what we have
to do here unfortunately because the way
I did this logic I just realized this
it's not actually going to display it
it's still working it's just not gonna
display so let's go just go ahead and
I'll go ahead and just throw it in here
so again what we're gonna do here is
we're going to go to target the num and
what we want to do for the num dot HTML
we're gonna do the same thing that's in
here except we're gonna add a zero
because it's gonna return a single-digit
number and we don't want that so right
here we're gonna go ahead
Plus and then the string zero and that
should fix it so let's go ahead and run
this and we'll see that everything we're
working
work you have some other interesting
collapse coming on is I'll be doing a
lot with my good buddy Matt Tran from
his channel engineer truth along with a
gentleman by the name of Stephen may and
exerted his last name but he's a he's
gonna be doing an advanced algorithm one
with me as well so kind of cool stuff
well so I see here we got about 30
seconds to go but yes so this is
basically just gonna be formatting we're
gonna do the same exact thing for break
time and then you're done
pretty cool stuff so it's let's go ahead
and wait up here just make sure
everything works this is exactly how I
did my code as well so you'll see right
there cool everything's working so let's
go ahead and just copy our code here
this is really all we need to do so
we're gonna jump down to our break time
and you'll see right here go ahead and
throw that in there so instead of count
we're gonna change us to break time and
so num we're gonna set that to break num
and then so count here we're gonna go
how to put a break time
break time break num break time break
time we need to leet this line as well
let's go up make sure I I cool us so I'm
gonna go ahead and run this make sure
everything works go do that and I will
be right back I'm gonna just go ahead
and stop the video and when five minutes
elapse we'll come back and you'll see
that the break time is working hopefully
all right guys so what things are
wrapping up real quick
so we're basically just checking to make
sure that we didn't mess up on our logic
here for our break timer so if
everything works accordingly we should
transition nicely right here I'm not
gonna wait for it to go to single digits
but everything should be nice and clean
interesting times up so our break time
we never set to the in minutes so it
still worked in a second so we know our
single digits working so all I'm gonna
do is do exactly what I did
in the timer here except for count times
two equals 60
we're gonna go ahead and do like sup so
we're gonna sit count so this is gonna
be break time
9:06 tea Oh so I hope you guys found
this helpful well I'll try to do more in
the advanced projects as they come along
as always guys thank you for liking and
sharing it helps the channel more than
you could ever know and a special thanks
to anyone on patreon it takes our
hard-earned money to support the channel
that goes above and beyond and there's
all I can really do is keep putting out
content for you and hopefully get your
approval but as always guys thank you
for watching and I will see you in the
next video for watching the video don't
forget to check out my collaboration
with ericsurf6 going over how to get
started coding and if you're looking for
some coding help go to code mentor using
the annotation or card and if you're
looking for internships or part-time
jobs or full-time jobs as a student or
recent grad check out way up com see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
