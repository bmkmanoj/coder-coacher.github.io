do when you get burnt out and it's
something I'm pretty familiar with in in
life and in general I would say now
there's two types of burnout in my
opinion there's the I'm burnt out on a
specific thing and then there I as an
individual and I've worked myself beyond
my limit or life has presented me in a
situation in which I am overwhelmed and
I am burnt out on life and you know
depend how you handle that it goes in
you do various things that may be good
or may be bad for your health or your
life or anything like that
now I am of the I'm of the type I don't
really get burnt out by certain things
like coding or gaming or anything like
that I get more burnt out as a person
and overwhelmed than anything else and
and how I've recently dealt with that is
I started picking up some old hobbies in
life one way though let's talk for a
second about how I as an individual of
Gothenburg toute before in recent time
so I get basically three four weeks ago
I noticed that I was getting burnt out
and for me it's something that I'm very
aware of because it's happened so many
times in the past that I kind of know
when it's coming on and I can kind of in
my you know my girlfriend can kind of
pick it up I start becoming more
irritable I I'm not really performing at
the same I'm not really enjoying the
things I normally enjoy right like I
enjoy youtube I enjoy coding these are
kind of my hobbies I'm not really
enjoying them anymore because they're
feeling more like work and part of the
reason that is is when I start getting
burnt out or it's because I'm working
too much
I am studying too much I'm trying to
code too much and I'm not really taking
time to not do things like that so even
though I enjoy it there's a point where
for me it becomes less enjoyable and
more just kind of like I'm work
which is not what you want it to be like
in your personal life maybe it could be
something where you know you've had some
rough challenges in life and it just all
built up or you've been doing the same
task over and over and over again and
you're done with it
so everyone gets burnt out for their own
reasons for me it's because I'm working
too much on various side projects
YouTube coding and I've had some I've
had some real real issues with it I'll
give you a very realistic example for me
I was coding so much for a couple when I
first started as a developer I was
coding so much on the weekends that
there's two or three weekends where I
went into work not refresh and not ready
to be coding anymore showed up on Monday
and I said oh my god I don't actually
want to code right now and I became a
developer because I like doing this
stuff and I did too much of it and I
burnt myself out of a made my week very
long very tiring and recently that
happened not at not in that aspect but I
became overwhelmed and so I heard that
now what can we do before I say what I
did what can we do when we become
overwhelmed the first thing is kind of
what I was already mentioned is try to
try to be aware that it's happening and
change your habits maybe if it's your
first time you know where well they're
not gonna have that but chances are in
life you're always going to get burnt
out or overwhelmed it's just part of
life right but be aware be aware notice
the signs if your significant other says
hey are you okay or they said mentioned
something like you know what's your
problem
calm the F down whatever it may be
don't just think they're overreacting
actually think for a second like is
there something wrong like is it am i
actually be am i burnt out am I tired am
i irritable why is this just think
logically for a second pause say if
tired
if burnt out if cranky keep on hitting
those if blocks until you get else not
she's in a mood whatever it is right but
think logically for a second about you
know what can I do
is it me do I need to relax how can I go
about that what relaxes me and then that
what relaxes me when you have kind of
think you're going down that path
because the key is to really get it
before you you implode or explode right
and so once you're there find out what
relaxes you for me I bought a game
system recently now I don't I haven't
really talked about this too much vice
to play a ton of video games League of
Legends PlayStation Xbox steam games
whatever it may be
but when I got serious about coding I
stopped playing about two years ago and
now that I'm kind of happy about the
direction my life is going in and I've
been working hard for two years straight
I feel like I mature to the point where
I'm not going to sit at home and play
games 24/7 but I needed something that I
could escape for and I tried to watch
movies and I try to read books and I
have something I've done in the past and
I wasn't able to kind of sit through it
it wasn't enjoyed it so I bought a game
system and I just played the game not it
doesn't matter what game I played I got
a platoon short for oh and I played a
horizon zero dawn very good game a very
enjoyable story and I played it the last
two weeks and it really kind of gave me
something to sit down something
different and go about it now some
people if they're getting burnt out
cause of coding for instance that may
not work for you're staring out screen
you're playing a game but fine what up
works for you when I was in school and I
was getting purged out by school I
started doing yoga I enrolled in a yoga
class at the at the college for a
semester and I also did yoga at the
24-hour fitness and sometimes at the
park in Long Beach on the like ocean so
you pay like five dollars there but I
really enjoy love yoga I tried I tried
various things and don't get discouraged
when the things you're trying aren't
working right so I will start watching
movies reading books didn't work for me
I don't have the time to do yoga and I
don't have the philony to I want to
incorporate that in my life later down
the road soon but find what works for
you and sometimes it's physical activity
everyone will tell you physical activity
is great right exercise
five walks or something I've done in the
past I felt me where I just kind of walk
around if I've been in the house all day
which happens sometimes about Saturday
what Saturdays and Sundays are like my
days to put in work learn new languages
frameworks become a back-end developer
all that search stuff I put in 10 12
hour days even now and I enjoy it I
really do but sometimes by that tenth
hour
I just realized oh my god I am
completely exhausted and kind of
stressed out and I'll walk around my
apartment complex with the girlfriend
once or twice or I'll say baby let's get
out of the house and go get a yogurt or
something just kind of get myself moving
and get myself out and change kind of
stop staring at a screen
stop coding stop thinking like that and
introduce something new so if you're
feeling burnt out whatever it may be
feeling stressed out sometimes you just
need to pause I know we're all in the
grind right we're all trying to get to
be a developer as quick as Wachtel if
you're a developer trying to become a
better developer right that's my case
I'm a developer I want to become a
better developer so that I'm more
successful so that I make more money
so that I have better job security so
that I can provide for myself and my
family
all those sort of things right so
there's always going to be something
pushing you and sometimes you have to
make sure that those things that are
pushing you don't hold you down at the
same time it and aren't a burden and
when you do feel like they are you need
to sit back for a second evaluate and
see what you can do to kind of alright
let me step away for a second go go
elsewhere right and go do this thing
that helps me relax in my case is gaming
walking around yoga exercise changing it
up a little bit and then a day or two
later come back to it and get back into
the grind but just for a second pause if
you're feeling burnt out and try to
evaluate and see where you can change
and take a day off or take an hour off
and go and do something else because in
the long term it will be much better for
you and your career and your life and
your health and your happiness and
you'll be more successful people are
happier more successful
and you'll get to where you want to go
so if you're feeling burnt out just calm
down and try to do something different
and try and find out what makes you what
makes you what makes you relax what
makes you feel better you see me man I
got I get a question every day what's
all this smoke in your room this is one
of the things that helped me relax
aromatherapy I happen to really enjoy it
and I find it very soothing so you never
know what it can be so find your thing
and if it takes you 10 tries to find
that one that fits for you right now and
what may work for you now may not work
for you for a year for now so always
don't try to make it work if it doesn't
yes so find what works for you and I
promise you you'll be much happier less
less stress and you'll be better off for
it but you know guys that's my two cents
