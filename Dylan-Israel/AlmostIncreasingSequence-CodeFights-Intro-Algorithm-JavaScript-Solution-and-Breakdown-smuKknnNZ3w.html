in code fights almost increasing
sequence of the intro so the objective
here is we are given an array and we
need to find out if all the values are
increasing by one sequential or
increasing in order so a 1 and then is
it greater than 1 in the next number is
it greater than that number so and so
forth but it's almost increasing meaning
that we can have one screw-up where and
one number is less than it could still
return true and that that's essentially
the goal is hey is it almost an
increasing sequence meaning are they all
going upwards from there so you'll see
in our example here we have 1 3 2 1 this
is false because this is increasing then
this is decreasing then this is
decreasing so it's decreasing twice
which means it's false well this is true
where it's increasing then decreases
that only decreases once
thus it is true so how do we how do we
get started well we need to keep track
of how many times it's decreasing so
we're going to create this count
variable set it equal to zero and and
what we're going to do in our return
statement
this we're just going to return count
less than or equal to 1 so what this is
going to do is it's going to evaluate
the value of count and if it's less than
or equal to 1 it's going to return true
or if it's greater than or great if it's
greater than 1 it's going to return
false so we're going to do that with our
return signal that's the easy part right
so how do we how do we start figuring
out our logic well let's create a for
loop here because we know we have to
iterate through the entire array zoom in
a little bit
and we're saying while I is less than
the length of the array I plus plus all
right so we're going to iterate through
the first or email first thing that we
would do is an if statement and this is
where I got stuck for quite a bit so it
was pretty apparent like okay well all I
have to do is check that the number in
front of it is if it's less than the
number behind it so if index 0 or if
index 1 is less than index 0 well we
need to add 1 to count and I was
thinking ok well that would be all I
would need to do and we're good to go so
let's go ahead and get that first piece
of logic in there and then I'll explain
to you why it doesn't pass all the tests
so we're checking the current index
we're checking if it's less than the
previous index we checked go ahead and
add one to count and let's run our tests
so we're going to pass some but not all
so what ends up happening here is look
at the look at this this use case we
have one two one two where it increases
right and then decreases so you say oh
ok and then so you swap this out and say
ok ignore that and then you say is this
number greater than this number we
didn't program logic for that so how do
we go about doing that well if it's
essentially we have to nest it within
our if statement here because we only
care it's only in the instance in which
it fails that this statement right here
isn't enough now we do that with another
if statement and this took me a while to
figure out but once I kind of understood
what I was going at all the numbers
start to make sense so what we say is is
our current index that we're checking in
this case let's say - is it less than or
equal to this number
so is it less than or equal to two
numbers back to numbers back because
we're skipping that number that's behind
it and we're checking one more because
now our array is almost increasing right
we're we've already calculated that we
have that mistake how does it affect our
current sequence of events so that's
where this comes in but that's not it
the next thing we have to check is is
the current number that's increasing is
the current it is the current number in
front of where we're checking less than
or equal to the previous number because
we need that as well
so add add statement let's go ahead and
open this up a little bit and we're
saying hey is this true as well where
the current number plus one current item
current index plus one rather is less
than or equal to
so if both these statements are true
we're just we return false because now
we're done we had we hit a second we hit
a second statement in which in which
this is a now a an issue and we
immediately returned false because this
is we already felt once we fell in twice
in here if we hit it so go ahead and
return false run our tests submit wham
bam thank you ma'am we are we are done
again what this might be a good example
to run through some some some
whiteboarding of a nice big array and
drawing it out to kind of visualize the
numbers because I know we threw in a lot
of different arrays here and a lot of
different indexes and things like that
I encourage you to kind of draw it out
on your own and visualize it and you'll
see the logic but essentially we're
checking the values keeping track of how
many issues there are and then we have a
special use case here to handle those
unique inputs like one two one two but
as always guys thank you so much for
