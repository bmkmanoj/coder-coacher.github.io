starting a new video section in which
will actually be just watching me work
through some methods and JavaScript and
how they work so the idea being is that
when you're starting out as a developer
trying to maybe you don't even feel
comfortable calling yourself developer
maybe you just say look I'm just trying
to learn you may not know what tools are
at your disposal you may not know that
there's a push method or a pop method
that won't you know do the things to an
array that you needed to do and when you
go to look for the information it really
seems like either it's too technical or
it's just overwhelming you're like look
man I want a three minute video I don't
want a 15-minute video and I don't want
it from some guy across the other end of
the world I want to see some examples
and I want to see them quick and that's
kind of what I'm gonna try and deliver
in these videos i'm actually even going
to be writing them out on the whiteboard
they're going to be a kind of a
different change of pace because i
really want you to see kind of the
thought process and keep it as simple as
possible if i personally have to write
it out i'm gonna really only have like
four lines of code in these videos in a
little bit of talking so i hope you find
these helpful and if there's ever any
functions or methods that you want to
explain that i haven't got to yet of
course go ahead and request them and
this is kind of something that I'm
trying to give to to the viewers and the
subscribers because I have had this
question before like oh I didn't know
this existed myself included or how did
you how did you know about this county
you know can you explain this I don't
understand how this method works and
these videos will help will address this
in a very simple and basic way and I
hope you find them helpful thanks as
always guys see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
