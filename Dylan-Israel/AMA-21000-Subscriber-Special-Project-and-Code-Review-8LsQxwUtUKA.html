chat here real quick and we will get
rolling
so live chat yeah
all right so for those of you don't know
what I like to do every thousand
subscribers is have a new video have a
live stream where sometimes you can show
me projects sometimes you can ask yeah
usually there a mas stuff like that
where as one of the ways that I can give
back is if I can answer any questions to
help you out while you're on your coding
journey out I will do my best to so
today that is what we are celebrating
we're celebrating a thousand new people
who have joined our channel here and hit
that 21 sorry I'm taking my shoes on I
just got off work I got a pretty busy
schedule today after this I'm actually
going to a one sock two sock oh I am
going to a coding Meetup
a throne thrown on by coat pin actually
at in downtown st. P so if you happen to
live in the area and you want to you
want to say hello
I'll be down there in about two hours
but life is good thank you we are at
21,000 subscribers and some change and
even to the some change thank you as
well and to the thousand new of you who
came here thank you very much I hope
that the channel is helping you out as
it helps me out and I hope that you
decide to stay and watch the videos some
of the exciting things that have been
going on is I just announced this on
Monday but every Monday Wednesday and
Friday we are giving away a free course
or book currently we're giving away some
angular to typescript courses as well
courtesy of angular University IO so
tomorrow's video if you haven't won yet
don't worry
giving away one and one one course
Monday Wednesday Friday and once I reach
out to a few more creators of course
traders I guess a few more teachers I
will be I will be seen if we can give
away a course every day so that's that's
cool we're trying to ramp up to a course
every day ah but that means I have to
put out video every day and I've been
working on my own course as well so when
this 100 days of code returning when is
it returning I don't know the hundred
days of code was called short by me not
by April she's still studying she's
still learning and I'm helping her when
she asked for it I unfortunately that
was a very time-consuming thing for me
for me to put to put in perspective I
get off work I study on algorithms and
things like that which I wrote a
beautiful algorithm today for work I use
the every function the the array every
function and I use the fine index of
function and I use the reduce function I
believe only one is beautiful so all in
all in one function and I think I could
I used two for loop but if I wanted to I
could knock out the for loop and use a
for each loop but it was a was one of my
moments where I felt pretty good that I
had been using some of these functions
that I been working with in the
algorithms and getting better as a
developer and it was a very nice thing
to see that happening but um when is the
hundred days of code returning I don't
know it might return one day at a time
to be honest with you where once a week
I do a tutoring session with April and
we can continue it on like that
the problem is really just between me
working on the course bettering my
skills
YouTube channel and work that leaves me
with very little time unless I throw
something out and to be honest with you
I
want to do that and so it's a I have
about two hours to myself after work I
get home usually around 4 or 4:30 and I
have a bite to eat
and I get together and I get my shit
together
and then I I start working on YouTube I
start studying and April gets home and I
have another bite to eat cuz I'm a
little fatty dick is dinner and it
happens no no saw tea milk welcome uh up
here twelve could you mind helping me
create a pig dice game using javascript
uh uh
I'm guessing Opie Opie is
object-oriented programming maybe I
don't know that I can necessarily help
you I do offer tutoring sessions and if
you want us to work on that for an hour
you can book one now part a good a good
shout out to myself for my coming course
one of the reasons I'm someone asked me
hey will I be able to buy your courses
on udemy and originally my thought
process was no because I wanted to
continually put out new material and I
wanted you to and it gave me a
consistency of income and things like
that
I've changed my stance on this too to
help too because not everybody wants the
same thing so my courses will be
available on udemy but I will still have
my own site where you can get all my
courses for a flat rate of ten dollars a
month or fifteen dollars a month I'm
leaning towards ten because that's
basically what you buy a course at udemy
or Udacity for and so basically the
price of one course on sale at udemy or
Udacity for ten bucks will be what the
monthly rate is so why do I bring this
up not just a self promo something
that's not out yet not done yet but
because because um up yet twelve one of
the things that I will be offering in
different tiers of the course there's
going to be three tiers there's going to
be a $10 tier get all the course
materials there's going to be a $25 tier
where you get access to portfolio
reviews code debugging sessions so those
are going to be sort of group meetings
where every Saturday or every Sunday I
I'm leaning towards twice a week or
twice a week on like a Wednesday or
Saturday we spent an hour to as a group
who's every part of the course and shows
up and say hey can you look at my code
how can I repay the
how can I build my pig dice game for
instance if and assuming that we have
enough time hopefully we'll get all your
questions again we'll be doing this
twice a week and then they'll be a $75
cheer which is what I charge for an hour
of tutoring right now and that
eventually will go up but if you're
signed up through the course it won't I
don't think I'm going to go higher than
that for the course but you'll get all
that all the courses the the weekly
sessions where we get to debug and and
talk at answer questions all this or
stuff and then get a one-hour session
where we can go in you know alright so
we're just from the next hour working on
your stuff you want to ask me questions
about whatever boom let's go and so that
that's what that's another reason why
I'm okay releasing it on udemy and
Udacity these various courses so that I
can help people out in different ways
and there's an audience there as well to
try and sell stuff what do you think of
using WordPress WordPress is a CMS so
that clients can easily edit their own
content I'm learning PHP on a JavaScript
so I can make my own things the plugins
I mean if you're doing it for clients I
can understand that I only my only thing
is that WordPress developers make
significantly less devout less than
other developers do you still work for a
company I do I work for a a company as a
developer as a salary developer I wish I
could be doing youtube or self dev
full-time but that's not the case in the
average month I make about before taxes
before taxes I make about 10% of
somewhere between what and this was with
sponsorships and with ad revenue I make
somewhere between 10 to 15% of my income
and
I expect my income to grow so he took
that number to go down would I like to
be a self dev full-time yes I have a lot
of projects and that's part of the
reasons and in do YouTube full-time that
would be that would be fun I don't know
that I would even if I could do it now I
don't know that I would do it now
because I'm learning so much at my work
recently a recruiter asked me what would
I prefer remote and I've thought about
this quite a bit and the answer is no
and you may be saying wow dealing why
would you ever pass up a remote
situation well because I do think
there's a value as a junior developer
going into the field and saying hey I
actually I actually want to go and leech
as much knowledge as I can from the
senior developers if I wanted to hire
for an hour a senior developer of the
the quality of at my and my work for
instance you know any senior developer
five years of experience to basically
mentor me on a regular basis you're
looking at one hundred and fifty dollars
an hour something like that instead
instead of working at home I can go in
there I can pick their brain I can learn
and absorb as much as I can become a
better developer as quick as I can and
so that's why I'm not really looking to
work as a remote developer now would
that change down the road of course it
would I
I still want I still have a lot to gain
by working in a company so I'm not
necessarily looking to get out of that
environment but at the same time I'm
building up other things like my courses
that I do want to be able to supplement
my income so maybe that ten or fifteen
percent now becomes twenty or thirty
percent give it a year now it's forty
fifty percent of my income and at some
point you can say okay maybe maybe
that's a maybe that's a viable option
who wouldn't want to work for themselves
like I find it very having a youtube
channel has been one of the most
gratifying things I've ever done in my
life because it has been a two-year
commitment and has done a lot for me in
my career it has been something that I
stayed committed to for two years and
I'm continually working on and it's been
it's been a very very good thing for me
and I want it I want to continue that I
think I should continue it as it's made
me a better person
and has made me a better developer down
the road alright hello from the UK a UK
men one day I want to go to England what
stack do I use at my job we use a a
combination of the lamp stack and the
mean stack we're building a lot of
different applications so depending on
the applications we may be using
different backends and different
front-ends and things like that and not
necessarily friends we mainly use
angular for the front-end but we're
using the my sequel a Linux environment
a although we develop on Windows which
just caused a lot of issues in recent
times so people asked me oh well what's
better to learn when Windows or Linux
well I develop on a Windows so what
happens is is sometimes when you develop
on a Windows things that work on your
Windows device does not work on a Linux
environment and you don't find that out
until you push to production I found
that out recently using the PHP so he
run into issues like that maybe didn't
expect which are really hard to track
down by the way spend almost a full day
tracking down the fact that uh I had a
couple of errors like that
I don't know if you answer this question
but do you write test for your job
projects just with you we write unit
tests now we do we were doing some
end-to-end testing and for those of you
don't understand the difference and
there's a bunch of different testing but
in my experience there's mainly two
there's unit testing and then there's
end-to-end testing those kinds of two
main ones in my limited experience but
that seems to be true if if I'm
incorrect someone definitely let me know
but so unit testing essentially is you
testing functions of your code bits and
pieces so you want to say hey if I call
this add to function and all it does is
take a parameter and add 2 to it I want
to check to see that that function is
running properly and the way that you do
it is using testing frameworks like
karma or jasmine and you'll write your
rights
you'll write tests testing your methods
hey is this still adding to if I put 4
in here does it return 6 yep it's still
true great that's that sort of unit
testing
now there's end-to-end testing which is
really cool and what that basically is
is it will run your web application on
an actual like on the screen we'll run
it and and from there what it will do is
it will it would it will so it will run
it and then it will you'll actually
instead you'll code out hey when I click
this button it should launch the click
function and if that if it needs to
change the data model the data model
should now be this and then it will go
here and it'll do the next step in the
mouse will move here and when I enter
these characters I leave and that's
where I've imagine your computer screen
going through you going through the
application actually working through it
that sort of end-to-end testing so we
weren't doing so stuff like that
unfortunately end-to-end testing at
least for our application is very very
time consuming and instead instead what
what we have to do we're sticking with
unit tests on the front end and we're
including unit tests on the back end for
PHP as well because
it tests a little bit of our code and
you should have as many tests as
possible but there is something to be
said about being on a small development
team and not having the time to do all
the tests that you can it's it's just
kind of a reality unfortunately so we
write what we can in unit tests but we
do we do do we do to write tests all the
time but we are a small team so we can't
spend all our time writing tests and not
building things unfortunately do I plan
on cream on your own startup becoming
the next Google Facebook ooh BRR
I don't think anybody ever actually
plans to become as large as uber Google
or Facebook it just kind of happens
through a lot of hard work and a good
idea I don't necessarily have any ideas
that I think I could skyrocket to Google
or Facebook status the the ideas I have
I do plan on starting my own business
I've talked about this a couple times
and we'll see if we'll see if that
changes in the next month or two will
you uh will your company consider my
company doesn't care about the
frameworks we're already working with
one but would I consider switching to
other frameworks such as direct I am I
would and I am and i plan on LA
specifically learning reactor act native
and Redux as well since a lot of people
seem to be pretty pop on top of that if
you had the money would you have gone to
a coding boot camp is it a bit better
than being self-taught I would say yes I
would have gone to a coding boot camp
and I don't know that it was necessarily
the money aspect of it I I guess it was
kind of the money aspect it's not that I
couldn't have gotten alone I just didn't
want to go into debt but so if I did
have the money would I have gone to a
coding boot camp I think I would have
yes is it better than being self-taught
I think you were essentially are
self-taught going to a boot camp but
you're getting a little bit of
hand-holding for the first three months
of being self-taught which is a huge
help and this also could potentially
networking you and connecting you the
people who are applying for roles and
are looking to get hired at the end so
that's a big benefit as well but
something like 92% of developers you can
go and 90 to like 90 plus percent
developers can Center themselves
themselves self-taught because even
though you're out there going and you
even though you got like a formal
education or a bootcamp education the
world of development is one in which you
are constantly learning and you have to
be able to be self-taught to get to that
that point so I think I think maybe a
bootcamp prepares you a little bit more
in practical skills than being
self-taught because sometimes I've run
into roadblocks and and you don't even
know what questions to ask to be honest
with you at times and so there would be
times where I'd spent you know 20 hours
trying to understand what a API was and
maybe a 15 minute conversation with a
professor would have cleared that up now
this is this is something kind of funny
but I would actually love to go to boot
camp like logically it doesn't make
sense now I'm a working developer I have
resume experience I've been able to
maintain a steady increase of skill set
and continue to to become a better web
developer and but I would actually love
the experience of going to boot camp
something about the the dive all in
don't worry about anything especially
Deb mountain where housings including
you live with a bunch of developers I
would actually love just to dive in
embrace it all see what gaps in my
knowledge I could fill because you
definitely no matter if you're senior
developer or a junior developer I think
you definitely would discover new things
along the way and you probably I
probably learned a lot more about node
and Express I know now as well so I'm
going to be a mongoose I use all these
things on occasion and my free projects
but I don't use them like I use other
technologies so I would love to actually
do it it just doesn't make sense for me
to go and it definitely doesn't make
sense for me to quit my job and go and
take out a loan of $10,000 but if I'm
ever self-employed
I'll make this caveat that if I if I
come to a point in life where I can
support myself off YouTube at which one
would be have to maybe tenfold in size
and are in income 10 plus fold and
income I would reach out to some some
boot camps and ask if they would sponsor
me and then I would go and I would I
would vlog you'd see you'd see a hundred
days of code coding boot camp right
there that's what usually yeah would I
consider myself senior developer I would
not know I'm definitely a junior
developer although I do think I'm a
decent junior developer and I because I
strive to get better and I think I have
the characteristics of a good employee
and things like that
because I I'm very aware of what makes
someone a good employee I would say and
I would like to I would like to I put it
I would like to be a senior developer as
quickly as possible it's not necessarily
the years it's kind of strange this is
the thing about being a senior developer
and I'm not by the way I'm not a senior
developer just make that completely
clear is that a lot of times just being
a senior developer is five years
experience I would really consider you
if your full stack developer for five
years that you'd be considered senior
developer on the cusp of it or around
there but in reality I think it fends on
the individual more than anything
anything else it depends how many hours
they put in not how long they've held a
position it's not necessarily a direct
correlation so let's say the average
person let's just think about this way
let's say in an average week I code 45
hours at work let's say 40 I code 40
hours at work and then code about 20
hours out of work that's 60 hours a lot
of times I code about an extra 20 hours
that I know compared my my coworkers I I
code 50% more than them because they
don't code at home I know that they
don't have time they got families they
got lives they commute about an hour
plus each way so if you take that and we
say okay let's just say the average
person doesn't
outside of work so already I'm coding
50% more so in a span of five years I've
coded seven and a half years compared to
their five so if you take that logic and
it's not perfect logic but it you should
in terms of skill set maybe become a
senior developer more quicker and more
efficiently than the other person
not correlating years but in terms of
time spent is what I'm trying to say um
I would consider myself on average a
senior developer in about three years
from now three years will give me about
four years of what resume experience and
three I think somewhere five years would
be probably the standard be senior
developer nice I would say at that point
I could consider myself that one I find
a hard to stick to free code cap I've
bounced around other core courses I'm
currently going through tree house and
find the knowledge is sticky more have
you tried and what other courses you
recommend well tree house is a different
platform thing than free code camp free
code camp is go and do it
tree houses hey let me show you and then
you go and do it which is kind of a
different thing they do video the free
code camp doesn't necessarily have
videos to go along with it do you keep
making side by web John keep on making
side projects I work on little side
projects are they live on the web I
usually just do videos I have a couple
small ones that I did where I was alert
I did the the the boy they call the the
the micro service projects to the URL
shorteners things like that to teach
myself MongoDB Mongoose a node and
Express I did those haven't put them up
though I release videos on them do you
think it'll be easier to find your
developer work in tech hubs I think I
think typically are going to be more
jobs but it's been my experience that
breaking into the industry was a little
bit easier not worried about tech hubs
if you know if you if you're unaware I I
live in Florida I took my last job was
in Los Angeles where I grew up my entire
life now I went on I was willing to
travel the entire United States for a
role so if you're willing to take my
advice is this be willing to work
anywhere and apply anywhere and once you
get some years of experience and you
want to go a certain area will be much
easier all right uh is it accurate to
say that a boot camp is just a fancy
word for a technical school I think so
although I think the boot camp aspect of
it Brandon refers more to the amount of
time and the sort of sort of extreme
amount of stuff you're covering in a
very short period of time most boot
camps will tell you expect to put
somewhere between 60 to 80 hours a week
end and they they most of the time
they'll advise you not to work because
you really won't have the time if you
want to get the most out of it could you
advise me to be a full-stack developer
or mobile developer full stack full
stack mobile developer jobs are harder
to get there they're harder to maintain
and in terms of full stack development
there are libraries popping up right now
that are actively being used that are
building you build a web app it compiles
into a mobile app so that's taking some
of the job market away from mobile
developers what is the best way to
calculate project delivery time I don't
know I don't know I think you should
probably if you if you really wanted to
do it you would have to start a
ticketing system like a confluence or
JIRA decide breakout every function
you're gonna put and then estimate how
much time each function would take you
and then go from there that would
probably be the best ways actually break
it out in little bits and pieces in the
in the documentation and go and and go
from there and see what makes sense and
then whatever it is fucking double it
okay so the whole thing no people should
take what you're doing there and don't
think about doubling as you're doing be
like ah you know this function might
take me three hours cool and then add
all those together and you say all right
cool F 36 hours to do this small
one-page application cool it's now 72
hours of work that's that's my advice
how do you apply for jobs I'm not in the
area you apply and on your linkedin or
your resume that you're handing in you
say willing to relocate for great
opportunity right in the top sentence
it's exactly what I did I'm 15 year old
from England I do computer science I
can't code to save my life I'm pretty
good on security binary networking I'm
awful with binary security and
networking so good for you any tips when
you're 15 it's going to click and
eventually just keep with it
code daily is the best advice that
anybody could ever give you to learn to
code and I deserve this collar right now
oh that would be funny man uh but yes so
code daily stick with it just continue
learning start by breaking your
project's into small pieces
piece by piece by piece start doing
whiteboards start just start going
through the process and putting in the
time what do you think about Oracle ADF
for application I don't anything about
it livre releasing the 67 steps course
on web development I kind of just want
to just cuz I think it would be funny
how do you get work assigned you get
general tasks assign or do you get
specific tickets to fix it depends on
the company
we are a smaller company and a smaller
software team I should say our company
is fairly decent-sized but so on a small
development team you may not have as
much documentation not always the case
but it depends on the on the job and my
previous work they had about thirty
developers and so they had basically two
project managers and what happened was
they would break out everything into a
ticket your tickets would be hey you
need to build this database or hey you
need to build this function like just
one part and you might have ten
different things and you kind of work on
in there they're rated in terms of
priority and what needs to get done is
something blocking somebody else if it's
blocking something else that's a
priority that's number one priority your
tickets holding up my ticket man you
that shit done at my current work
essentially goes a little bit like this
hey I need you to build this application
cool thank you and then if you need help
you go and ask and you go and you start
architecting it out you start designing
the database you start doing the
wireframes you start doing sometimes
getting requirements still sometimes you
need additional details sometimes you go
and and go from there it depends
sometimes it'll change right priorities
change from the top down hey this can is
on the backburner go and do this now
because that's what the bosses are tech
saying any interviews if you get to pay
for your travel how how many did you pay
for I actually had phone interviews a
lot of them were either not especially
for recruiting agencies recruiting
agencies weren't willing to to to to pay
for my travel site and go
some companies whoa you do a phone
interview you do a Skype interview
that's enough and they'll fly you down
if they're interested I never got that
opportunity but I did a lot of phone
interviews I deal on Skype interviews
and the recruiting agencies that did it
that would only do in-house interviews I
didn't go to I'm not driving to Texas
for an in-house recruiting agency and it
is just it makes sense I can't find a
website called kodÃ¡ly no one said that
there's a website called code Daley I'm
telling you to code daily to per a tutor
a bill says Amen that's like that's why
I say think when people say at code and
Taurus 360 Amen
as a beginner I feel overwhelmed by all
these new tools such as frameworks task
runners es6 and other stuff any tips
don't worry about it man
I'm still overwhelmed by it just start
learning piece by piece actually put in
the time I think I think a lot of times
what happens is no one that no one sits
you down and explains you what Bower is
no one else it's you down and explains
what gulp is no one explains how the
rails
why they're used and how to get better
and a lot of times it's just a matter of
connecting things to what you already
know a lot of es6 is just new syntax for
stuff that already existed in es5 for
instance and if you can relate it say
hey this arrow function that looks a
little different feels a little strange
is just like this callback function here
and you make a correlation and you say
okay this framework this is like the
framework that you know here this is why
since the same this is what's different
and so those are things I'm trying to
tackle in my course as well is breaking
down and videos that I put out every boy
don't don't get overwhelming and take
the time watching our video on it that I
mean a lot of times how many people here
have watched an hour video on on some of
these subjects if you're feeling
overwhelmed by Bower
gulp react go watch a video on it start
doing projects and start working with it
and add it to your add it to your
toolkit is it correct that cloud
developer will have a good value near
future yeah everything's going the cloud
man wouldn't be I don't think I I don't
think the clouds going away if the
clouds going away the Internet's going
away boys I don't think either one of
those is going away so I think we're all
good I think we're all good although
they are trying to get rid of fucking
net neutrality so you never know you
never know I think I think you're all
right though
and Milo you won't come up here buddy
get up here go up your little fat cat my
fat cat no get up up we don't get up
here I'll pick you up yo fatso Oh hernia
I love learning CS material on my own
more than in classes that weird no a lot
of your teachers are probably really bad
I had very few good teacher I had two
good teachers that I can I had two in my
college courses by the way there's a lot
less like CS courses then you would
imagine in a CS degree in terms of
coding but in my college coursework I
had two two teachers who I would say I
enjoyed their company and that they were
good teachers a lot of teachers and this
isn't just CS right I think this is
unfortunately true about most teachers a
lot of teachers either do it because
they their skill set is no longer
relevant
so they teach what they know and it's
the only field in which after a few
years you get tenure and then you can't
be fired and let go I have a very low
pending of most teachers but maybe I
just had bad bad luck and also I don't
think I think I think being able to
learn on your own is a crucial skill for
a developer so not to not to worry about
that it's not weird and struggling it's
vocabulary I think you just have to
start you if you if you watch me talking
with April I always try to use the the
words that we're talking that we're
actually using and reiterating them and
using them in conversation because I
want her to start storing those in her
mind so just start using it any way that
you can I am in my new place yes yeah so
universities unfortunately are more
about the teacher than they are about
the student which is one of the reasons
why they are failing and one of the
reasons why
students are getting fucked over any
books you would like suggests it could
become a good program I you guys may
find this shocking but I've only read
two short books in my entire time
so I don't I don't want i don't i don't
read many coding books i think that by
the time a book comes out is usually
irrelevant although i am going to read
the new view j s book because i want to
learn you jest at that air can shit who
will be in tomorrow's video we're giving
away a copy then as well is coco writing
so i will be reading that one to teach
myself of UGS uh would you consider
looking at people's their projects
during the AMAs or give me feedbacks
yeah I will I'm kind of enjoying this
right now they'll be honest with you
before we start jumping in uh have you
ever worked at Agilent environment I
have at my last work and I would say
that even though we don't necessarily
have a a direct agile environment at my
current work it isn't like it with no
hard set rule that's a j'l I would say
that we're basically an agile shop as
well so let's talk about agile so those
you don't know what agile the different
like why agile is kind of mentioned I
think I this is my theory about agile
and I kind of discussed this if you
caught the interview with Kristen leak
which I haven't released yet so agile is
a new way of programming for the last 15
20 plus years there's basically two
there's a waterfall which means that you
basically plan out your entire project
and into like maybe four steps you
finish step one you never fucking go
back to step one and it's just like
never never we'd ever divert for the
plant never we don't go back we only go
for like it's it's very straight as I
explained waterfall essentially you have
a very long plan that you you execute in
multiple steps
now there's agile which is essentially
what it's called it adds a different
development process
where you you're able to jump back and
forth a little bit you're able to be
much more flexible and the problem the
problem and the reason that's emphasized
is I think if you take people from this
sort of waterfall mentality and put them
into a new sort of hey this is the next
year of your life - hey this is the next
week of your life
some people don't adjust too well now
should you yes I don't think anyone
under the age of 40 is going to have an
issue with agile and that's not to say
that if you're over 40 I just I'm just
saying I think I think most people are
comfortable working in agile environment
if you're not I'd be I'd be very
surprised you're going to have to get
used to it pretty quick I think I think
most companies are agile unless you're
working with like massive massive
development teams do you watch TV or do
you house all day every day I normally
don't watch too much stuff occasionally
I watch some YouTube but right now I'm
actually watching house of cards with
April we watched one episode why we eat
dinner and I go back to the grind so is
view jeaious worth learning it defense
I'll I think I like for UJS I like
things that are coming up I would say
for a practical standpoint if you're
trying to learn something that's going
to be a good skill set you should still
stick to angular react all of you jay is
on its way up oh man yes might get lucky
man maybe I'll stream a little bit of
the meetup today
how much for our shy charges a contract
New York City it depends on it depends
on what your worth
so Brandon says I know so some of the
other tracks on free code camp are
incomplete coming soon everywhere what
do you think about free coke gets past
their front end certificate what if we
are we talking about are we counting the
beta as well because the beta has made
significant changes but let's just say
we're not talking about the beta I like
that they throw those projects up there
I don't necessarily like that there's no
guides to them but I think if you got
through the front end you should be able
to get through the rest of stuff as I
have I I built the micro services hiring
a tutor for one hour and then going and
watching videos would you say that most
companies today are looking less and
less at your degree over your actual
portfolio I would say that they're more
open to it than they may have been in
the past and I think specifically in
software so uh I know I know that I know
that it's that it it does hurt me but
not as much as I think other people
might think I think let me put this way
I think it doesn't help that I don't
have a degree I think that as far the
reasons I have been thinking about going
back my next big jump in pay I'm going
back I'm finishing up my degree I'm
which I expect my next jump in paid to
be about anywhere from ten to twenty
thousand dollars so the reason I'm
waiting apricot jobs six weeks ago or
not less than three weeks ago start
working I've been paying for all the
bills for six months I didn't want to
take out any loans so I wait until she
get a job now I'm getting close to my
one-year so based off my one-year I'll
go and I'll read and roll I'll finish up
online that's my game play I don't want
to take out any debt now why am i doing
that
I'm already developer yes but it will
open doors down
Road I don't think that it hurts me but
I do think that it would help me and in
the same fashion so and that which is
kind of like hurting me right like if
your plus five here is it's like saying
hey if where is this let me make a money
term I got money
so on alright so it's kind of like
saying this right this is your degree
this is your degree got 20 more dollars
than used to have this is your with no
degree you're not in the negative but
you don't have the $20 to add to your
worth degree no degree now now imagine
this is negative money this is what a
liberal arts degree is it's worse than
this
negative money liberal arts degree no
degree liberal arts degree negative
money no degree you guys get the point
here this one try to say uh so how can
machine learning concepts help as a web
developer I don't know I don't know
anything about machine learning how many
meetups do you go to in a month I
usually go to one to two I'm going to
one tonight it's a if I was if I was
unemployed or looking for work I'd be
going to a couple of week
Oh bless me and answers it
David Basil what's going on sir good sir
I saw yeah I saw I saw you on Eric's
video today say hey learn jQuery PHP -
bloom as I saw today do you have any
recommendations on how to make cool mega
menus animations get good with
animations animations are hard to get
started with but but I think if you're
looking to make cool anything in web
development is always animations also
scan code code pin man there's a lot of
cool stuff on code pin I got nothing as
jQuery and Petri I think it was an
oversimplified response I just noticed I
just noticed your comment on it you're
very passionate I like it man how many
programming languages do you actually
know zero I'm always learning that I
don't think you could even though I work
in JavaScript everyday and PHP every day
and I've been working with JavaScript
for two years I would never even if I
just say one and B JavaScript but that's
about it although I could probably learn
any language if I spent the time with it
do you think it will be okay if my
portfolio projects use bootstrap if you
use it for the column grid system I
think that'd be fine I also think that
there might be it might be better if you
don't use their styling and you go from
there a job job I mean it so here's the
thing guys is it's I I quit two things
not necessarily being a negative that
you use bootstrap but you shouldn't have
all your projects in bootstrap did i
watch the e3 conferences I've watched a
couple portfolio a couple per full a
couple portfolios I've watched a couple
of boogies videos reviewing it in this
Frances videos that's about it though
what's your progression rate in terms of
subscribers let's see here
I believe I'm growing by about 1500
subscribers a month right now what do
you mean all these tutorial videos are
just faking it what does that mean hello
my friend
any games I'm looking forward to I still
so I'm pretty cheap guys I still need to
play world of Final Fantasy Final
Fantasy 15 but if I were to I'm up by 4
I'm up by 6 percent I'm at 1457 subs by
the way uh so um I'm looking forward to
the new God of War so that's what I'm
looking forward to how often do you show
people your code or do white board
coding when going to job interviews did
you provide I show people my code
I usually it's more algorithms for me
when I was looking for work did you have
to provide your github to get your
current job it was on there there wasn't
anything in it I actually got a job much
quicker than I was anticipating so I
never pushed in my code to github what
level am I on code fights let's see here
I just leveled up the other day am I
tired after work yeah but I find
potential poverty be more time so I go
through it
I am trainee to a trainee too so
whatever level that is I think that's
the level what happens setup I moved
offices I move not like into an office
but I I have my my office now I got four
monitors up right here I got the the
green screen effect going on
I am and I'm not no joke I am very
scared to being broke haven't broke in
my life before and I'm working hard so
that for those who don't know I save a
ton of money since I started working
I've saved
I started at 10% saving my income and
now I'm up to 33% of every cheque I save
I invest and then I save a little on top
of it so I've always kind of kept my
life down to the minimum and that's why
I'm working so hard man I don't ever
want to go back to that I didn't move
apartments I moved closer to work I'm
about ten minutes away from work versus
the 25 I was we moved into a slightly
bigger place it was fifty dollars more a
month but he's about 30% bigger and uh
and and from there it was it was a I'll
make it up on the gas I said going to
him from work what what kind of
technical questions to the mastering
every six or was it what personal
personality type question depending on
the place a lot of it was you were
talking with the recruiter to start they
kind of are they they kind of they kind
of ask you the basic questions when the
you know what's your experience and then
you go you talk about you sell yourself
basically and you go from there and that
would be like the recruiter now when you
get to talk to the developers they might
ask you some more personal questions hey
tell us about this hackathon tell us
about your your most impressive project
so on and so forth what languages are
you comfortable with and if the
developer likes you it and thinks that
you give good answers typically they'll
send you to an algorithm section now
every company is different but I'm just
going to be a rough estimate and the
algorithm part they'll send you usually
a timed algorithm that you have to
figure out a couple usually it depends
on the company but usually you do a
couple algorithms and send it back and
based off your algorithms or not you
know if you pass the algorithms and you
do well you're usually I'm pretty good
she'll do you get shivers where you see
a pizza delivery cart no I uh
it's not that I mind delivering pizzas I
just didn't like if I could make what I
here's the honest country if they could
pay me the amount of money I could make
us a delivery driver deliver pizzas I
would be driving with a smile on my face
that was the easiest job that I ever had
like I had to work hard but like it's
much easier to be a developer what is
the five-year plan in terms of learning
is tonight a second deal have you given
a have you given the angular give away
from angular University yes so that that
went to a gentleman by the name of
Jamaal I believe something is the user
name was like Jamal so uh don't forget
though there's a the there's a giveaway
every Monday Wednesday and Friday so if
you don't win then you can win the next
video and you can win more than once
guys it's all random all you got to do
is use the keyword in that video and you
in the in the 2-day period that goes out
so if you do win I'll just ask for your
email in a comment send it back and
we'll get you hooked up to the next day
or so there's a few like there may be a
day or two gap between when when you
send the email whatnot so uh what's the
five-year plan in terms of learning very
good question my five-year plan depends
on where I'm working for one if I get a
job elsewhere or my job changes its
technologies it's going to change my
five-year plan in terms of learning so
let's talk about what my five-year plan
is in life and just assume that I'm
learning whatever is relevant to to my
current current life
I plan on release in a course I plan on
starting a company and my goal is five
years from now to potentially be if the
company succeeds running that company
and buying a house that is my 5-year
plan uh what do you think the best ui/ux
tools are in real life
it depends man on what what sort of if
you're talking about simple wire like we
can do very simple wire framing with
balsamic at my work I really like that I
used to have my previous work it's not
it's not like super detailed but I don't
necessarily think it has to be but in
terms of someone who does a little bit
of everything I'm a full-stack developer
so it's
is UI UX front-end sometimes back in
database just depends testing all over
the place right it's a green wall
supposed to be like a green screen for
videos yes so that's exactly what it's
used for I wonder
I might actually break this like try and
switch the video camera let's see if we
can get it because I thought on here
alright I may have broken it I'll give
it a second to see we'll give it a
second to see if it actually goes
through is it working come on man I
believe nope
so oh there goes hey oh my arms what
happened what hours all right
hey we in it we in it to win it I don't
know why I don't know why key so cut up
my heart
I can't code I can't code oh look at oh
hi so uh in five years I will be 34 that
is correct man you're making me feel old
hey as I can call of duty you gotta
gotta wait a second for your help to
come back and bam well whatever consider
being an independent contractor
somewhere in the near future if the
money's right and I have a few more
years under my belt of experience and I
have side income which I'm that's kind
of my number one goal right now through
these projects is to continue with my
side income yes
can you buy aged working a Tesla Model S
as a software developer yeah all right
we're back mmm
does your outward appearance matter to
potential employers I think it doesn't
necessarily matter but it doesn't hurt
when someone who's overweight find it
more difficult good job than someone
who's fit in muscular every stat will
tell you that if you're a more
attractive individual male or female or
you're more fit you will more likely be
eligible to get the job it's it's just a
fact
should it be absolutely not but it is
and you being aware of that is crucial
like one thing I've always really hated
are my my teeth my teeth have got fucked
up after for the last couple years I
don't think I'm losing jobs because my
teeth were jacked up it goes back to the
it can only help you like no one's
actually looking to say hey are we not
going to give this guy a job if he comes
in here with some fucked up teeth like
no is mentally making that but it will
only help you if you are in shape
muscular fit person oh do I know any
companies are looking for remote
full-stack JavaScript developers and
maybe your company now siren is that a
recruiting agency yet they start paying
me the recruiting agency money's all
sorry you'll start seeing Sunday remote
jobs top 10 places click the links below
thank you for the checks um are you guys
still doing a hundred days ago not right
now no have you seen any developers at
your job rather goes there over 40 yes
most of it by the way most of developers
at my work we have about six I
the only one under 30 not counting the
the intern who's I think gonna be
part-time now I don't know what's going
on with him but I'm the only one under
30 without kids there's the next junior
developer who's 35 everybody else is
over 40 9 out of 10
developers I've worked with in the past
my past job and my current job and my
internship before that we're all men I
attend is it bad to watch code camp
tutorial videos finished projects I
don't think so I think what you should
really use them for us to see where your
gap in your logic is and try to
understand why you have that gap and why
you don't make that connection how did
you get through the projects on code
camp did you also use outside resources
no there were none ma'am I was the
outside resource uh no yeah I just
thought I just pieced it together piece
by piece man as much as I could do they
call you kiddo
no they all try and say I should marry
April though I like because I have no
plans of marriage and kids in the next
five years
and they've all made that decision it
may be my my stance will change after
five years but I'm so focused on getting
other things started I don't want to
change anything else
are the ancients out there you find jobs
for programmers to take a commission
first one salary cetera I know another
industry is common practice there there
is yes I would say on average though the
way most recruiting agencies work is
let's say let's say code fights write
code fights interviewed me the other day
they saw me working through their sites
part of the great thing about code
fights is they will actually once you
get a certain points start sending your
resume out if you want so I take the
interview because I talk with all
recruiters best practice you can do you
never know what's going to happen so
they for instance and this is common for
most people is they actually when you
when you when they get you a job they
send your swag bag and a thousand
dollars you say wow man you got me a job
and a thousand dollars that's really
dope why are you doing this are you just
super sweet no they are very nice people
at least the woman I talk to is very
nice I is one of the best recruiting
experiences I've ever had I would highly
recommend her so the reason is the bulk
of recruiters the reason they're
actively going to pursuing you is
because we developers for the most part
are in demand now the way that the bulk
of these agencies work is they get a fee
so they go and say okay cool we we got
this guy does he fit you will you want
to hire them cool that's going to be
$10,000 that's going to be $20,000 now
if you want to hire him sometimes you'll
work through the through the recruiting
agency and they'll just kind of pimp you
out so in the contract to hire position
or our contract position whatever it is
so that's usually how most recruiting
agencies function is they get it they
get a flat rate or Commission but it's
usually paid by the employer and not as
a developer salary it's like okay well
he's going to cost a hundred grand and
then we're going to need our $10,000
philia cut how you know when to continue
learning from one language and framework
to another well I would say when you
have built up a sufficient amount of
portfolio projects I would say that's
probably a good time to move on to
something else or if
possible taking your current front-end
projects and building a new back-end for
it take the projects you have and start
building out different applications with
existing stuff thanks for making the
code cap code Academy Python walk
through they're helpful you're welcome
man
thank you I'm glad they helped you
Ricardo Diaz what's up what's up so guys
we've been going for about 50 minutes or
an hour so um I uh I usually do about
our live streams for these thousand new
subscribers so you don't know reiterate
that every new thousand subscribers that
we get I like to do I like to do a thank
you video where I answer questions we do
these AMAs and sometimes we'll even
review portfolio projects I'm sorry that
I didn't do it this time we have very a
very active audience I'm glad and I
appreciate all the questions they're all
great questions so for the thousand of
you who are new thank you for coming
kill this little gnat here thank you for
thank you for subscribing thank you for
being part of the community and if
you're new the community you don't know
we do have a Facebook group called code
tech and caffeine I will actually throw
it up in chat one second let me go ahead
and get the link for it it's a place
where you can ask questions share news
share memes for coding the reason for it
is I really think that especially on the
days that you don't feel like coding and
there are those days not for me but
maybe for you like I don't know some
days for me oli right where you're
getting frustrated some days you can
better your skill set by staying up to
date on what the up-to-date on what's
going on in the industry and make it fun
in a different way I'll post that link
right now in chat and then we have our
discord channel as well where we have
various groups in there where you can
ask questions and you can maybe get help
from another code from another
subscriber so these are all things that
we're creating and I always I'm trying
to find ways that I can help out as well
as help me out so I hope that you guys
take advantage of the Facebook group
take advantage of the discord channel I
am on continuing to do my best to
build the channel out and as I mentioned
earlier take a check take a look out for
our Monday Wednesday and Friday videos
where we will be giving away a free
course and a free or free book I should
say course or book every Monday
Wednesday Friday video which I hope to
expand all you got to do is use a
keyword like the video and comment with
that keyword and hopefully you're
subscribed if you're not subscribed and
you're just trying to like and comment
shame on you shame on you you should be
subscribed I will be doing more
giveaways down the future as I still
reaching out to a few people on udemy
and Udacity and stuff like that but uh
we have a lot of great courses I want to
I always try to leave these live streams
with some final thoughts for some final
thoughts and I uh today every I try to
write one post a day or share one thing
a day on the Facebook group and so let
me share what I wrote about today on
Facebook about two years ago
I was in the middle of the grind
becoming a developer I got it it seems
like it was just yesterday but I guess
it was two years ago is a long time ago
I was delivering pizzas I was miserable
I was unhappy I was broke my mother
often times was bringing me groceries so
that April myself and her sister at the
time who we took into the house so that
we could get by the three of us were
living off her modest salary of an in
Los Angeles of about $28,000 $30,000
something like that I was unemployed I
wasn't working as a developer I was
struggling going through it but I was
coding everyday and there was days I
didn't want to code and there's days I
felt like a loser and there was there
was days where I questioned that I was
going to get there
and there was days when that was there
that she was there to tell me that I
wasn't all those awful things I was
thinking about myself and it's something
that I will always respect her for doing
now two weeks ago I bought a washer and
dryer and I had the money to buy it and
it was a surreal experience because I I
I remember not be able to buy groceries
I remember not being able to when April
came when it April's been so good to me
for so long and I and I remember not
being able to buy her birthday presents
I remember not being able to to take her
on trips I remember not being able to
pay for the movies I remember not being
able to treat her the way that she
should be treated and I remember feeling
bad about myself for that and her
telling me it's okay and and that was
one of the one of the things that
motivated me every day was not wanting
to go back there so when when David
Basel early says I really don't want to
be broke at it it has a very negative
connotation for me money doesn't
necessarily mean make you happy but um
you know poverty made me sad and I don't
know how to put it I just I don't want
too much out of life I just want to be
able to live a good life from so here we
are two years later we're full stack
developer life is going in the right
direction I'm able to buy a washer and
dryer win not too long ago I was unable
to buy food I wasn't able to treat the
woman I love two things in life other
than my charming personality which
depending on the day isn't as charming
as it can be and today I made my first
stock purchase whether I lose my money
in the stock market or not is is not the
point
it's that I have the ability to have
extra income to invest and make sure
that if times come and my money goes way
I have something so safe I hope that I
hope and when I bought the washer and
dryer I really had this wow what certain
it may seem silly Wow how far we have
come and I kind of kind of remember
thinking back in like just thinking like
wow I bought a washer and dryer and like
it sounds silly it sounds really silly
but I remember I remember streaming on
Twitch before this and not being able to
buy a camera and trying to make money
and donation it was at the the closest I
could ever explain the way I felt was
when I first I made my first hundred
dollars on Twitch to buy a webcam that
someone donated I was really excited
about that we were really struggling
there's no way I could buy a webcam
April and I were living in the living
room at that point oh man it was it was
a it was a rough time but uh it's nice
to be able to reflect on the moment and
think how far you you've come and I hope
that when you do get those those moments
in life those hey the grind is still
going moments but it may not be as hard
as it is now we're grinding to something
better not just grinding out of
something we're grinding from good to
better not grinding from shit tear to -
hey we can scrape by so I hope that as
you grind to the next level and you
continue your grind from bed it from
worse to better and better to great and
whatever comes after I hope that you
reflect on that and really appreciate
the hard work that has that you've put
in to get there that's what I'll leave
you with for the thousand new
subscribers thank you for joining I
appreciate you all and if you happen to
be in the st. Pete area I'm going to a
meet-up coat pins meet up at the iron
yard and st. Pete tonight maybe I'll
take some pictures and share them on the
Facebook group make sure
you guys are members I'll see you guys
in the next video look forward to
tomorrow's video where we talk about
view Jay s with Eric program with Eric
who is a co-author of it and will be
giving away a book in our Friday video I
guess I appreciate you all thank you for
all the support you have given me I will
