Harold borjan today who is a a front-end
developer at scrimmage com which is
their new startup where it's basically a
web web screen recording that interacted
that you can pause change the code
something that I do in my patreon as a
bonus those who support me and really
cool thing we also talked about how he
got started which was that a completely
free open boot camp where you actually
are taught among each other through your
peers aren't actually you need teachers
and you just kind of volunteer at the
enter are encouraged to we talk about
impostor syndrome which was really deep
and really something I think a lot of
junior devs when they get their frozen
in the door for the very first time
really struggle with I I kind of had
that going into Java overcame it very
relatively quickly so something I can
kind of relate to talk about coding we
talk about all the great things and it
was really fun interview a really
positive guy and I one of the things I
really like about interviewing people
are people with good energy not to sound
so mojo mojo so everything lays a great
interview great guy and I wish scriba
scrimmage calm the best best of luck go
ahead and enjoy this video thanks for
watching hey guys i just want to show
you scrim be' because we talked about it
quite a bit in the intro it's their
project that they're working on where
basically you can record a video and
then you can go and enter the code now
i'll just show you real quick i'll make
a little bit more sense so let's say
we're going to record our video real
quick and we'll just call this demo and
this is going to be on JavaScript so
therefore languages right now they're
going to expand it to multiple
JavaScript frameworks so we're going to
do a little Illuminati right now a video
within a video so we'll go ahead and
test this and we'll say let's go ahead
and confirm we want it to be my Yeti
microphone there we go and so now we're
testing that so we can go ahead and say
VAR x equals 5 VAR y equals 5 what 66
and then console dot log X plus y this
is just a simple example it can get much
more advanced than this plus y and let's
go ahead and stop the video we can say
I'm finished obviously when we run the
code you'll see right here it's at 11
I'm finished let's say you have the
option making a public private or here
so what actually happens here is we just
recorded an interactive 4224 second clip
so as we play it you'll hear me but
let's say you want to pause and you want
to check in and say oh hello Dylan you
now have that option you can also fork
out of here so it's really interactive
you'll see that the console output right
here and this works what you can have
multiple files as well HTML CSS it
doesn't have to just be JavaScript so
you can actually build your whole
projects out it's one of my patreon
perks as well at a certain level I do
all the algorithms again where you can
interact with it let's go to resume the
playback and you can see we jump down to
here and say we're like oh I don't
really understand what they'll still
talk about what's that mean how did he
get 11 oh well we'll do y plus X that's
what it was but I actually want to see
what 5 plus 5 is we're going to run it
and you'll get interactive examples like
that's grandpa let's go ahead and jump
on into the interview nice okay so today
I wanted to kind of talk about scroom
be' in general and about kind of how you
got started what you're doing the future
skill set that you built it with and
just anything else do you think you
could kind of elaborate on that would be
beneficial for people ok hun will answer
that at the end oh yeah would you kind
of mind introducing yourself out your
experience and you know anything it
related like that yeah yeah so my name
is pierre i'm one of the co-founders
behind scrim ba to say audio visual tool
for conveying concepts about programming
and coding and I'm a developer myself a
content developer so I haven't been a
developer for very long I am I didn't
start off before this where we made kids
apps
and there are from the non-technical
tribe during the beta stuff and then I
got more and more into coding or more
more interesting to learning how to
actually building the stuff as well so
in like late or early 2015 I joined a
coding boot camp in London like a it's
actually free peer-to-peer basically
boot camp where I learned javascript and
total development and then gotta come
back to Norway which is where I'm based
worked as a throttle developer for a
year or little over a year and then I am
trying to scramble awesome now also the
coding boot camp value is it called
founders and coders and it's really cool
because it's totally free and all peer
to peer based so they're like there's
like no paid teachers they're working a
full time to like just get you to a lot
like a teacher there you all work
together and people from previous
cohorts join in and help new chords and
it's all about learning something and
then explaining that learning that to
the others it's really awesome converse
so you don't you don't pay for it at all
there's no make their money so they make
it so I think em and you're like
encouraged to become a part of the
community after you've been there and
then you'd work they take on consulting
work and take a cup of that consulting
your that's one of the models they've
dried up I am not completely sure
exactly how they do it right now but
that's what it did when I was there so i
would get some you get some you actually
get some paint when you're there at the
end they give some of that back to
school and I think they've also done
recruiting now for various companies in
getting in recruitment fee or something
in addition to Gramps nice now how long
is that the boot camp process
traditionally so I was there for about
16 weeks I think
I had I live in London I would have been
a part of it much longer but I think the
core program Alice 12 weeks where it was
at two times eight weeks when i was
there in yeah 2015 and there is going to
change that outfit just a fantastic
congress so imma so i really like
scramble and i plan on using and we've
shot we talked about this um yeah what
kind of how did the the topic like how
did it come to fruition like how did
this idea come because it's a great idea
and something that I'm surprised doesn't
exist or like I even never thought like
oh man this would be great if it
occurred how did it had a birth of scrim
but if you will start yeah so I mean is
it the best person to ask there is
microfiber syndra who so you should have
him on the show some times as well oh
yeah it's a fantastic developer and he
was he who got the idea for this because
he has been developing a programming
language for quite a few years and then
he opened for sis and want to share with
others and create documentation and well
he's not a big fan of writing
documentation he started creating some
tutorials and just he just realized what
a hassle were a horrible experience it
is to actually try to convey something
through the video format at least if you
you're not used to doing that you know
you have to download the screencasting
tool we have to set up your system you
have to start coding if you want if you
want to tallish you you have to if you
do a mistake start over again or headers
go into iMovie and Stitch the clips
together and then you upload it to
youtube and then you to buy coats it and
something spent like an hour and a half
trying to explain a short concepts which
maybe takes you five minutes to explain
to somebody so and and once you've done
that all the semantics of the code and
all the information is gone it's just
dead pixels
so he started with it aside dl creating
a format liver the scrim about formats
which basically it enables you to head
over to our site just start coding and
talking as you would explain explain to
someone in the group in the same room of
you and then just hit publish and it's
already like and people can then view it
and then concert and play around with a
concert with the example themselves and
keep all the semantics and it's a yes
it's just so many ways just a better way
than video which is a week at least so
uh yeah I i if i remember correctly I
know you guys are still in beta now you
have functionality for HTML CSS
JavaScript and you were going to add
some libraries or frameworks what any
ETA on that and what would they be yes
we're actually will actually defeat that
feature is now in our local environment
and we it'll be published or deployed
this upcoming week nice where you can
add like script to your m and your
screen bot so you can add like beaut AAS
and a boulder dash jquery and whatever
you want oh cool so it will work with
basically any javascript framework out
there hey yeah we're Mike we might have
to do some some because my station to
get react working with j sx and stuff so
also but basically that's the that's the
goal sweet i mean that that to me is a
super valuable and sweet i mean that
that to me is a super valuable and like
the first thing that came to mind i know
this is like if even it's something that
would happen was way down the road but
have you ever thought about getting
scramble up and running and then trying
to maybe sell the technology to
something like Udacity or udemy because
they they have their own code
environments and I've always want to
make a course but your your screen but
it's just so much more valuable the way
it is than just a regular video that
whatever occurred yeah I'm actually
we're in the on the business side of
things of scrim Bach were actually at
the very start and talking to actually a
couple of online code courses and
companies which do grease or teaching
people called online like it is a
faction the Udacity type companies and
their clothes or companies that's one of
your eternal training and so we're
definitely thinking about how we can use
technology to ya and other ways not just
having your platform but monetizing it
another way yeah so we really don't
right yeah it's definitely you know when
you're still in beta you can't exactly
make all these decisions quite yet I
talk to you briefly about monetization
because I've wanted to create content
and only thing really is stopping me is
monetization right shows like my
subscribers are on YouTube how do I get
him get site without losing money and
that's why I kind of have worked it into
my patreon page well but I I am a huge
fan I love everything about it so I
think it's going to really change the
coding tutorial / coding and video the
education platform all together because
the number one thing I get our people
struggling debugging code and even
though they're watching a video but if
they can pause that video and they can
see the code themselves and it can
interact with it not only will they have
a better understanding but they'll also
be less frustrated and stop hating on my
video so much as the mark riley that's
exactly I thought that so you get a lot
of comments from people who like ask you
what would how does this work are like
ask you specific stuff in relation to
the tutorials you make sometimes yeah I
get a lot of people who struggle through
and they think their syntax is right and
so not nine times out of ten they've
messed up one time I attended to me like
that's probably pretty accurate um but
nine times out of ten there's some
syntax air something else but if they
have a video where they can pause they
can look at it they can interact with it
they're going they're going to be sore
bit much better than just watching a
video but
are also going to kind of be able to
find their their air I think a little
bit better so I mean I I think it's
great man i really wish scrim ba and you
guys the best I think it's really going
to a bit I think it's going to be very
well received and we're going to see it
a lot of places pretty soon Thanks we
hope that I mean getting you to use it
people like you to use it it's really
important for us like getting it because
we need to attract people that can
create high-quality content but if not
then then it's not worth having this
platform you know so we're going to have
to work on tailoring tailoring it
towards your or your needs and other
YouTube teachers need so if you have any
I know we're going to talk afterwards
about this but the availability out
there is trying to scramble platform and
try sit and have any got any feedback or
saw some things that irritated you or
requests for features or whatever just
come back off now right now is are they
able to create their own accounts now
because I thought maybe you're in a
closed beta for a while and it is you
are able to create your own account now
yeah we don't like we haven't opened it
up fully it still says we're in a closed
beta but you can create your own account
so if you're really interested in just
head over to the side can just take
requests access or if you're watching is
rimba you see that log in via github
stocking up in the corner then you
actually get you created account they
can play around with it yeah it's still
fairly close since we have to open the
front page destruction I have a dream
that all this awful documentation the
world will have scramble videos insert
it into it so it is my dream that the
documentation our libraries will not
stuck in the future it's a far-fetched
dream but I'm hoping scream but we'll
just be absorbed by the document people
i mean we share that dream with you so
that's one of our goals and what are we
thinking about like contacting people
who write the
mutation for big libraries just getting
them giving them embedded swimbots on
their documentation stuff like that now
is that is that something that currently
works and you can embed your scramble is
that it's out of possibility and we
haven't I mean it's not it's hard to
make it work the technical I mean you
haven't gone back yet but it's just a
matter of when that mean is handled
probably in some of that so that mean it
I mean that's the both for like
JavaScript libraries and also within
we're thinking about using it for
example API documentation so that
companies who have api to want to
onboard developers in a quick and easy
way come on just embed maybe even a
white label scrim bar yeah I I mean I
would sing you moron like a blogging
platform so you see all these blogs all
the time with tutorials and some people
prefer blogs / videos and vice versa but
I I always think that you should have
both in one right so scrim it would be
an excellent thing to have where you
could embed the scrim bow with your
coding blog and then you have uni base
they're both at the same time hmm kind
of where I was going ok yeah that's uh
that's interesting a directioner as well
when we open up for embedding death will
very likely work as well I said
something I thought about recently
because I was kind of thinking about our
conversation we have after this and also
I've been think about starting a blog as
well so that's kind of where I was like
man that'd be great if I could embed
these videos and screamo all that sort
of stuff hmm oh yeah see you you want to
move there would you start would be like
a wordpress thank you stuck a wordpress
none on I i I'm I mean I i don't know i
don't think i would start with wordpress
a lot of people would i would probably
just add a blog section on my channel
and then use it as like a project maybe
i'll do i got she i think it uses PHP my
admin with godaddy i would just send
them enough where it created yeah
uploaded yeah
um so I see on here you have a up as an
excuse me I've mispronounced this is
Anita if I'm saying that right oh yeah
yeah okay can you talk about that a
little bit yeah so that was when I was
the fresh out of the coding boot camp I
started there couple months or a few
months after a quick or what after i
graduated from founders decoders and
janessa is also it's a start-up but
really fast growing startup paranor
right and it's pretty awesome that they
do like the crowd source sea freight
pricing information so that if you're a
if you're if you produce so far in when
you shake them from China to Europe per
town and you actually don't know where
you have very little insight into what
you should pay for a container from
Shanghai to Rotterdam but with this
metal if you get full access to what the
market is paying and you can check how
well you're performing against market so
it's really big all very old fashioned
the industry which they are disrupting
by doing this and when I was a part of
created building like the front-end
mbatha like the drafts and the panels
that the customer seen nice now that
looks like other than that looks like
maybe your first running job is that
it's a pretty accurate yes that's
correct so how did you I when you just
got boot camp obviously I'm sure you're
looking to start working and get some
experience on the resume and stuff like
that what how did you look for a job and
how did you finally get your job so I
was a little bit lucky in terms of
knowing some of the guys later they're
from before i joined the full founders
of coders so I met up with belittle that
one of that
the CTO there and just asked they needed
people who knew or actually knew that
they needed we asked about the person
looking press as i said in may you still
be directly overs and you're so yeah and
that mean by what do a couple of
interviews and yeah but but i also
applied for a couple of drops like I
just found online just apply them with
the less degree of success LLC same yeah
networking is it always sucks because I
feel like that people want like a hard
proven rule this is how it does but
networking really is great but a lot of
times when you're trying to get in to
the industry or any industry for that
matter if you don't know anybody it's
very hard to get a job it is yeah so I
mean when you and you know somebody you
trust them as you know there is good guy
so it makes sense that actually that
networking helps oh yeah and networking
thing which is which is also why it's
important to start going to like meet
ups and things like that and hackathons
where you can meet people and kind of
network that way I've met so many people
at hack phones and meetups that have
helped me maybe in my career and so
sometimes you gonna take advantage of
that yeah i mean that's that's where i
actually accidentally bumped into that
to the CEO of smith archetype it because
i was a bad like a tech moved on so that
helped and i've written a lot about
learning how to cook on medium and yeah
did you know that they're like i like
here you have a profile like the area
with you and yeah let's find that you
should have a city league chapter in
your kitchen chance it so the people
watching the video no luck with the
medium / app airboard again so there
have been writing a lot about how I kind
of this journey from being a
non-technical to becoming technical and
because I felt that before I I did this
are the transition it so many questions
in terms like what you have to do how
much how many how much time you have to
spend how what do you need to learn how
hard is it to work on like a
professional project and all these
questions that I felt was partly
unanswered and resources i could find
them as i started like just like writing
about my experience and yeah just to
share that which is which is great
because I think everyone's journey is a
little bit different I've talked about
my own before on here and it's great to
hear because some people it's like well
you have to do this is like no it's
critically do this this or this there's
a lot of different ways of going about
it you know there are the people on the
camp that like you can't be a developer
unless you have a computer science
degree and like nine out of ten
developers don't have a computer science
degree it's not super sad oh I don't
know where this get started yeah the
market needs more people than the
universities can produce so it has to be
similar is out there yeah my um one of
my boss is talking about hiring interns
and I said hey we should go talk to and
that this is what kind of our big boss
he's really in charge of sales and
things like that and managing us but
like we should go higher at the you know
it's the state colleges or near buying
go find insurance I said it goes a boot
camp across the street because they'll
actually be learning the stuff we're
working with oh that's just my personal
opinion it is and I've gotten something
like quite a few like on these articles
that people who are exactly that dilemma
like should boot camp versus University
and I think it's always the different
thing that you learn one or the other
but I mean if university education and
after it's not a possibility for you you
just have to like work really hard on
the weazy like in like a core computer
science complex and you get a job
working alongside the guys who who went
to university that's 110 possible yeah
let's see what someone has Gus here at
how is the how big it to the developer
industry in Norway is there a huge
support network meaning that people want
you to learn how many resources
available is a long question basically
how is the developer community in in
Norway and kind of job prospects there
for the industry and so job prospects
you thinking as from the developer's
point of view like a how many algorithms
yeah it's from the develop developer's
point of view yeah so I can start to
that it's a huge lack of front-end
developers at least i'm not back into
the other like back in but our it's a
huge lack of developers overall
especially these days in front end it
really hard to find people so because
they're not i mean there are no boot
camps here most people go through the
traditional way of the university and
but there's a lot of businesses here and
the economy is doing well so they should
huge mean for technical skills whereas
the community itself i I'm not that like
into the community itself of just
developers more like into the next
startup image growing a lot been going a
lot the last few years all right this is
this is kind of an interesting question
I like this question and I'm a little
confused by the same time I'll get my
answer after I hear yours okay well art
so Java says I'm a software engineer
from XYZ company for almost a year but I
don't have any technical knowledge to
call myself a good developer any advice
so they're working developer for last
year but they're not rocketing in their
skills so I'm not going to sit here and
claim that i'm a crucible a breather
yeah i mean i think guises I'm man I
learned things fast so I used to
optimize
but I certainly have tons of holes in my
knowledge so if the question what what
does she need to i get a call yourself a
good helper i guess so see this this is
my take on it is that sometimes there's
that um that sort of i don't belong
feeling i think that's what this person
is going through and kind of where
you're there you're around a bunch of
senior developers that just look like
there's God's gift to coding and you
don't really feel like you're learning
that much in my advice is to kind of not
worried about you know there's people
who watch my channel I think I'm like
the godliest coder that has ever been
because they're just getting started
I've only been developer for three
months like there's no way I'm that good
that whatever but the thing is sometimes
you just have to be realistic about what
your skill set is especially one year
into the business impostor syndrome is
what it's called yeah and my thing is
what you always need to be doing is
continuing to improve so like when I
started my job three months ago I had a
very limited knowledge of angular now I
now I'm very confident with it I'm much
better and I never touched PHP and it's
been a long time since I touched my
sequel so in three months I've such PHP
my sequel I've touched d3 all these are
things that I'm continuing to learn so a
year later you should be a better
developer than you were a year ago as
long as use that you're continuing to
strive and improve and I think if you
were doing that a year at any company
you'd feel much more confident yeah
that's very good point and I think you
should like as you said don't worry too
much about the other guy and they even
though they are senior and probably know
a whole lot more than you they have
holes as well though like in their
knowledge though you don't notice that
or see that too much but you think
always about your own lacking skills you
know it will advise at least if you're a
junior developer which I found out
quickly because that I have to be honest
about it when I just didn't know
anything or when
and I have questions that's meta like
just off and people prefer that you're
off and get the appropriate feedback
then just wandering around and start cuz
nobody and nobody wants that neither you
or your company or your colleagues which
is so what can you learn at your boot
camp the vs. what did you learn on your
on the job at your first job recorders
and I learn JavaScript and of course
some HTML and CSS but I knew a little
bit of that or I have done that for
quite a while and when I started and
also react we'll just ate and teamwork
and stuff like that and like the basic
the foundation whereas when i joined
founders and coders what I really learn
what how to work in a big organization
on a big code base and I remember that
scared the outta me when I started
because I didn't know if I was smart
enough to understand the professional
code base like that's huge monster
returns laughter and when you look at it
from the outside and see the whole see
like huge big professional projects huge
called co betas it looks a lot harder
than when you get into the nitty-gritty
details and start understanding one
concept after the other and see that ok
so just that it's just a big it's a big
monster but it the feature of a part can
be understood so after neethu I kind of
gain that confidence that I could be
able to contribute in professional
projects and of course I learned a whole
lot about embark reacts which I didn't
know of course perfect is there any
anything else you want to talk about
before we end the interview here mm-hmm
I will ask you like I've been talking a
lot that's good man I've been really fun
yeah that's the point of these things
that's good yeah hey guys thanks for
watching the video if you're interested
in
coding boot camp check out dev mountain
calm warehousing is included in your
price of tuition and don't forget to
Like comment subscribe and share and
support me on patreon I'll see you guys
in the next video thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
