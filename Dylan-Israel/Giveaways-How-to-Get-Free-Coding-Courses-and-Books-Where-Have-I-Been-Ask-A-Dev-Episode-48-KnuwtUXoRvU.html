making a pretty big announcement which
is that I will have giveaways on my
channel for as long as I can see every
Monday Wednesday and Friday because the
the platform that YouTube has given me
it's given me a and because the audience
people want to support and want to you
know get their name out and they're
working hard on whatever that it is in
this case it's courses or books and so
so they're willing to give us a free
course for a shout out or whatever so
today what we're going to be doing is
I'm just essentially making an
announcement video to let you know how
you can every Monday Wednesday and
Friday for this entire next year get a
free course or a free book or something
related to that in it for the next month
or so angular university has decided
angular - university IO there will be a
link in the description if you
unfortunately if you don't win the
course you can go and check them out all
the same because it is appreciated but
because of this wonderful platform where
we get to share our knowledge on
software they're willing to give us
courses that I'm going to give to you so
every Monday Wednesday and Friday we're
going to have a giveaway I'll have more
videos than just on Monday Wednesday and
Friday I've been a little bit busy with
moving so if you've if you've also been
wondering a man where you been at you're
usually a frequent uploader I just got
situated in new office invested a little
bit of money with the 4k quality screen
shares as well as new lights and the
green screen as we can see so moving
forward though starting with this very
video tomorrow on Monday all you have to
do to be eligible is be subscribed you
like the video as well as comment with
the keyword today's keyword will be
angular so as you use angular on in a
comment if you're really just want to
put angular you could you're eligible
but I hope that you maybe maybe drop
some knowledge for those around you
talking about why you like angular we're
gonna this luckily angular university
has tons
different courses the angular tutorial
for beginners typescript to build a web
app with angular and firebase and a lot
of other stuff and we're going to be
giving away a couple of each of these
for over the next month which I'm really
happy about because I I know a lot of us
are in the grind and I've struggled and
you know you don't necessarily always
have the money spent ten twenty thirty
dollars on a course
so hopefully you may not win the first
time obviously because there's going to
be hundreds of views on a lot of these
but hopefully you'll win one eventually
and we're so will be giving away a
course or book every every Monday
Wednesday and Friday
and if I if I am lucky enough to get
more sponsors I'll give away one every
day this is just what I can forcibly
maintain for the next six months to a
year based off the the connections I've
made but I hope that you start tuning in
for the videos part of this is you know
I can't say that I'm all just trying to
be you know mother Teresa over here part
of it is to promote the channel as well
so I hope that that you would share the
videos and let other people know who
might be interested as well as just come
watch them basically at the end of the
day I'm not trying to sell you anything
so I try to give stuff away so I hope
you help

curious just what I've been up to since
I've been uploading since we ended
April's April learns to code first 30
days essentially I've been moving I've
been working on my course that I'm going
to sell to try and make up some money
and work for myself one day and things
like that you get that residual income
digital nomad lifestyle sort of thing so
that's what I've been up to but I'm back
on track today starting with this video
I got plenty of others but I hope you
guys like the plans moving forward and I
hope that you get some benefit out of it
a lot of these especially with you know
