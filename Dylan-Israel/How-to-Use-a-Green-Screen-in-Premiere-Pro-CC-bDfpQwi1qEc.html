be showing how to use a green screen so
what we have here is something from my
work where I was going over a sa
software as a service called workday and
its employee software and essentially i
use the green screen for me to talk
while stuff went on in the background so
it's gonna look a little something like
this alright so now we need to take a
day off for two days off of that matter
you're gonna do that just by alright so
you've seen what's going on here so the
way that I did this let's go ahead and
delete that effect and start from
scratch now the first thing to know when
create we're gonna delete everything
we're going to leave the mask we're
going to delete the ultra key effect so
there's our green screen in the
background now now there's a couple
things we can do here the first thing
that we're going to have to do is apply
the ultra kia the reason i suggest
applying ultra key for a video effect
instead of any sort of keene is because
you have so much more control over so
we're just going to drag and drop it
onto there and then it's going to show
up in our effects here so here's our
ultra key now keep in mind sometimes
this is bugged if you are multiple
monitors where this will actually not
select the correct green so when dealing
with lighter backgrounds the green
screen is going to be a little bit
harder you'll see a little bit of
wrinkles there and I wasn't fully able
to adjust for that right away so we're
going to adjust the settings so by
default we can set aggressive and it's
going to get much better so let's go
ahead test around a little bit that
looks pretty solid try a little bit more
and just really kind of guess and check
until you get the one that you're like
it's not getting better than so the next
thing that we can kind of do to clean it
up a little bit is there's this pedestal
value now basically you'll see here
let's go to change it to alpha channel
you'll see what's radiating outwards so
when we set pedestal it's going to set
it to a hundred you're going to see that
it's basically the
still of our guy is going to redo out
radiate out a little bit more and
they're going to make it so if we set to
0 then we set it to 25 you'll see that
slowly from where we're radiating in the
center going to get much better so we're
going to set that to a hundred but you
still see in the bottom left corner
there is a little bit of an issue so I'm
able to time off out and we're like ahh
how do we get rid of that so the way
that I do is I plan mask so we're going
to close this ultra key we're done in
there now and there's this opacity so
we're going to just go ahead and create
a four point polygon here and what's
basically do is only show part of the
video based on where this mask is so we
don't actually move across that bottom
corner this is a nice little way of
getting around it so we can go ahead and
do something like this where we can have
it come in and we can pull this out like
so so that we just make sure if our arms
come out work it's still good to go okay
so we have now there's also a my time
off now there are a lot of great ways
that you can kind of make this cleaner
make sure your green screen has no
wrinkles in it make sure your lighting
is good as well but this is kind of a
quick and dirty way of fixing so maybe
not perfectly shot green screen film if
you're still learning or if you don't
have the proper tools so hope you guys
found this helpful and learning how to
use and edit a green screen and w
