are we doing today we are in free code
camp we're doing the HTML and CSS we are
going to be doing exercises 51 to 60 so
let's get started we're gonna override
class decorations by styling ID
attributes so give your h1 element the
idea of orange text so we have our class
here and we're gonna say give it the ID
is equal to launch - text so we need to
create our CSS for it so I'll do is
Donna orange - text and your h1 element
should be there so it wants the color
orange let's go ahead and run that okay
No
so our name is correct
ooh I forgot we're using ideas so it
looks like we have to do the promise so
when we're using the ideas we IDs we
have to use the pound so it looks like
the IDS override the classes there we go
so I give your h1 element the inline
style color white so let's just say all
right
pink 2x12 wah occasionally so I'm gonna
change that to white and bam
in line Styles white
oh they want us to do a hand like whoops
okay so inline styling that's done like
this you declare style and you set it
equal to style is equal to and then what
do we want to do you just type the CSS
oh so color a white semicolon there we
go
oh I've never even used this listen
all right so apparently we can just add
important after this parameter and no
matter what comes next
this will always be what it does and you
can see right there it overrides it cool
there's a new exclamation point
important that's pretty pretty all right
let's here use hex code for the color
black instead of the color word black so
yeah there's a lot it's a you want a
very specific color you can just go and
like click on the color or experiment
and I'll give you a hex code so they
have pre-programmed want basic ones but
you can also it's gonna be six
characters like this do it like this to
get in this case it's the same as black
but gives you a lot more diversity
alright so we want to set the bot the
background color to white so 6s for
white there's six zeros for and don't
forget the hash tag as well and you do
that go so I think that was five so five
let me see I usually not got about one a
minute we're at 420 so let's say that's
four so give your element this is five
give your body element the background
color of red all right so what is the
background color red is ff0000 if you're
looking where I'm getting this from just
the highlighted portion so we're gonna
change the background color to red and
cool so we're gonna say that's five or
six I'm very like neurotic about making
sure I only do ten so let's see give
your body on the back on color green
again we're just changing the background
color so there 0 FF 0 0 and there it is
that green so that's 7 I think I give
your body elements back on color of blue
I think at this point we get it what so
that's 8
and let's go ahead and give the
background color of orange FF a 500
that's actually pretty nice orange no I
mean let's go ahead and go to our map
real quick and check to make sure we're
on point with our tent ass today so just
like that we're almost done man we're
blowing through this so we're yet we're
on our last one right now so we want to
change it to gray I'm gonna set of
running gray is 808 oh and and there we
go so we did a little bit of a little
bit of CSS just kind of repeating all
these colors those are kind of the
primary ones I guess we need to know and
then next we're going to using RGB and
then we're we're done with this HTML and
CSS portion and that's gonna go
relatively quick as well so look forward
to the responsive design with bootstrap
this is very important if you're just
getting started with web design it's
like this stuff you basically should
already know each channel CSS and here
is the kind of the newer stuff that is
you know makes your phone makes the
browser and your website adjust to
regardless what device you're on your
phone tablet whatever BAM
