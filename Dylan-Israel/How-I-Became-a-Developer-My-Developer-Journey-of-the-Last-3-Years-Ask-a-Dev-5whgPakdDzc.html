how I became a developer a lot of people
ask me how long have you been coding
how'd you get your first job and one
night about let's say probably got six
weeks ago I was I was feeling I don't
know if I was feeling bad but I was in
some sort of mood and I used to write
quite a bit and I ended up writing a
blog essentially telling my developer
story that the plan was to actually go
and put it and submit it to free code
camps medium publication I I know this
is my rough draft there's a lot I want
to do with this seal but I figured
before I kind of Whittle it down and
take out the embarrassing parts refactor
some of it a little bit here we have the
rough draft and you guys can really hear
the story as I actually sort of and I'm
sure you'll have heard bits and pieces
of this but I'm really going to paint
the whole picture from basically 2015 to
the president about my life and my
thought process and how I became to
become a developer so I'm going to read
this and maybe one day I'll actually
finish it up and one thing to keep in
mind is that I really only consider this
part one of how I became a developer
because I think as a developer you have
to be in the mindset that you're always
getting better and part two will be
maybe how I became a mid-level or senior
level developer but this is my story the
origin story if you will its kind of I'm
going to try not to feel awkward reading
this because it's kind of personal but I
will do my best because it's very honest
oh yeah so six for 2015 will mark the
day my coding channels started in my
eyes and also the dancer I changed my
life with code it was at this time I
decided to make a game plan stick stick
to it to become a developer I was a CS
student in all honesty I hated it as a
rule as a rule of thumb I recommend most
people go and get a degree for the
record to sum up my game players it was
to become a better developer by doing
online tutorials at the time
it was just at the time it's just coke
Adam II my Jesus is a rough-draft guy so
I apologize that the grammar is not
perfect from there I would put them on
YouTube as a sort of video portfolio and
I'm lucky and and if I'm lucky makes
them add revenue in the process I was
highly inspired by my friend of 20 years
Matt Tran engineer truth'll so I can't
say I have I came up with this idea
completely on my own from from there the
idea was to get an internship try to get
hired
try to get hired there at the internship
or in a role where I could still be a
full-time student to finish up my degree
later on after a very specific event my
plan would change I began became willing
to take a role in the field even if it
was in developer role developer role and
stopped going to school for the time
being I did the math on what I needed to
scrape by with and it came to about $20
an hour in Los Angeles area if I was
going to drop out and get some semi
revelant work experience to come back to
school at a later date so this was about
in 2015 in which I kind of formulated my
thoughts of hey I'm in school I'm hating
it it's sort of slowly killing me
I believe I'm probably starting my
junior year at this point and it's been
on my mind for probably about a year and
now we're moving forward I applied to
several hundred applications no
exaggeration in in Los Angeles area
eventually got a three-month internship
at the web at a web design company after
posting my resume on Craigslist yes
there is a resume section - Craigslist I
had called that about 6:00 p.m. and
asked if I could come in for an
interview at 6:00 a.m. the next day
I said yes even though the internship
was 120 miles away and took around two
hours each way when I arrived honestly
did very poorly in the white board
interview which was covering HTML and
CSS well part of the reason was I was
purely studying JavaScript and Java at
that time I felt that I felt I would not
get the role as this was my first
technical interview I had the very least
got some experience out of it as I was
leaving he told me he was going to call
the more qualified candidate who
recent CS cried and said he needed his
who said he needed to sleep and couldn't
be until 9:00 a.m. that the roll was
filled so that guy told the guy when he
asked him come in at 6:00 I know I can't
be until 9 or 10 and he lost the
internship for that for that reason I
would start the next Monday and we get
the first relevant experience on my
resume for a whopping $12 an hour
it wasn't much money but it was the
first step on my journey to becoming a
developer at the end of the internship
they hired me as a freelancer which I'd
take on several clients of my own down
the road for about the next six months
at this time I had probably about five
or six clients doing a lot of content
management WordPress stuff very very
very little web develop more web design
and I would I was charging anywhere from
20 to 25 dollars
shortly after I found myself penniless
and without clients I was still student
and at this time my girlfriend was
supporting myself herself and her
sibling we had taken in every day I was
studying and uploading videos to YouTube
while working towards the goal
it was around it was around this time I
was running out of content on coke ad me
and I discovered free code camp which
had around 30,000 users at that time I
instantly I instantly fell in love with
they knew it was going to be a great
resource to help me become a better
developer it wouldn't be much longer
that the event I mentioned earlier what
occurred the event where I decided I was
okay dropping out and going completely
all in on the self-taught route so I may
think this may be a bit silly but it was
very profound I may remember it very
remember so vividly this day April and I
were grocery shopping and I needed some
underwear I remember looking in the
basket trying to figure out what food we
could get rid of so I could get some
underwear as we had calculated as we had
it calculated down to the last dollar
for the amount of money we had it was
this moment that something would be very
sad but also very angry that allowed my
life to get to this point I was pretty
angry with myself it would be a month
later that would drop out to accept a
role as a technology trainer at a
software company
essentially doing technical writing that
was my previous job I was there for
about nine months I know I said some
people that may sound very silly but
sometimes when you everyone has things
that I kind of I think they relate back
to of how did I get to this point where
I have to choose between food and
underwear and that was kind of what put
me over the edge to be honest and I
decided I was going to take things a
little bit into my work own hands a
little more than a year ago a little
more than a year ago is coding sleeping
eating cooking and everything else is a
small 400 square foot room I was renting
in Los Angeles this was one of my lowest
points in life I was unhappy and
miserable be around which is a lot April
left me at this time I was living
paycheck to paycheck
sometimes out in my pad my month have my
mother bring me groceries if I had an
unplanned bill come up and would drive
for lyft to make any sign money I could
do at the time so this is probably about
a year into my channel nine months into
my channel at this point so this is
probably a year and depending at what
point a year and a half to a year ago no
more than that a year and a half a year
and a half ago however I was happy to
have the job and the and to pad the
resume as much as I could every day
after work I would go on sites like
Codecademy free code camp occasionally
code combat for three to four hours on
the weekends I would code it anywhere
from 8 to 14 hours a day doing my best
to build a portfolio learn skills and
pursue the goal of being a developer
while doing this I would upload my
progress and videos on YouTube and some
of you got to see the struggle for the
last two years
whether that be coding in the closet
coding with the microwave / kitchen in
the background or me just looking
disheveled in the lack of sleep and
stress I was coding so much in doing
YouTube that in some of the videos up
I'm even eating spaghetti while doing
the raw walkthrough as I was feeling
pressed for time I was always feeling I
always felt I was behind in life and not
where I want to be somebody hasn't
really changed too much
to be honest with you as of as of today
much worse than though while in the
coding journey and it was and is
definitely a journey some days were
harder than others I'm not talking about
the days where I had more bugs or days
where I wasn't understanding concepts
like what an API is talking about the
days I felt like a complete loser and an
utter failure days I felt like my goal
being a developer was a far-out fantasy
days were friends and family whether
intentional not were discouraging of the
decisions I had I made to pursue the
route I have taken in the days where I
was on the verge falling apart oh I
think when you were taught when you are
taking a more risky path a path lit and
this goes in my mindset and as kind of
maturing in the last two years of
understanding where my family is coming
from I think when you're taking a more
risky path the path that's taken by it
by most it's natural for those closest
to you to not be supportive or not
understand it could be those closest to
you whether it be your mother father
brother sister wife or husband who can
kill many of your dreams why this is and
why it happens is for another time in my
personal life is my parents who'd angry
with my path and it was until the age of
27 that I realized I knew better I have
no doubt I have no doubt that I'm not
alone I've talked with an ex-convict who
was trying to get his life together and
become a developer he wanted to turn a
new lease on life and provide for his
family an honest and respectful way
respectable way when I when I agreed to
tutor him I thought we would be
discussing technical skills a map of
what skills to learn in what order but
it said his first question was how can I
get my wife to understand why I spend my
time Cody
let's rock out there guys that doesn't
mean that those closest you will always
be the ones to scourge you along the way
but it does mean in my eyes that they
will be the ones they will be the ones
that are most likely to succeed on this
on this journey one of the best decision
I've ever made just was to start going
to coding meetups something I to this
day go to several every month I remember
when I first started doing our IP the
iron yard that's where my local meetup
is rest in peace I remember when I first
started doing my free code camp
tutorials and there's a meet-up in
downtown Los Angeles a friend of mine
with that she asked me to come down
because a fan wanted to say hi I was
actually really proud that someone
enjoyed my content and thought it was
helping them after about three minutes
of talking with the subscriber another
person there look me up on LinkedIn and
said something along the lines of I
didn't know a Domino's driver was
allowed to teach code this would be the
only negative experience I ever had out
of about 100 meetups why am i bringing
this up I want people to be prepared
that there are others people who will
look at you in the grind and make fun
those people who for whatever reason
will talk down to you and those people
who truly don't want you to succeed you
need to be mentally prepared for this to
make sure you stay on track because it
only takes one moment that you are not
ready to handle and cause one to give up
that's that's really the point of that
guys is if not if you don't understand
what are people they're negative in life
and and want to hold you back because of
whatever reason all it takes is for one
day you just stop grinding that's all it
takes five months pass at my job the
tech has technology training I've been
studying web development exclusively it
is at this time I start getting the
confidence I'm ready to work as a
front-end developer I get this from two
things one working with developers and
seeing what they are working on be able
to follow along two-seam the interview
seemed to interview potential junior
applicants and seen a few fail the
whiteboard interviews I was certain I
could pass we don't partially we had a
partial glass wall and if they ever
looked out I'm sure they would see me
creepily looking in
I began to look at the job application
to see what skills I'm missing for a
front-end roll I noticed angularjs n
react and begin to start building
projects in both I start learning by
watching Derrick's bonus angular video
build my channel's website
simultaneously I do the first section of
the code Khadem II covering react and
build the first project on free code
camp is that this time one of the senior
developers who I respect tells me to
talk with the director of software
engineering about promoting me into a
front-end or Quality Assurance role it
takes me about two to three weeks to
build the courage to talk with him he's
really nice a friendly guy and would
have no problem working with him in the
future
but socially awkward which makes it a
bit difficult especially talking about a
sensitive topic like this more than
anything else the situation of saying
hey I don't really like my current job
and want this other job but I also need
this job if that doesn't work out so I
can pay food pay for rent and food to
survive what was what what's going on in
my head some things have something
something's changes I have that
conversation some things do happen over
the next week but not enough in my own
eyes over the next four weeks I I fill
out close to 500 applications I expand
my search out-of-state after seeing on
indeed that I was in the Los Angeles
area applying against 300 applicants and
notice in more rural areas sometimes
less than five I end my lease in Los
Angeles and stay in the leases in quotes
because I was basically running a room I
I and stay in the guest bedroom of my
mother's in preparation for a potential
move I apply only the job applications
listed in the last 24 hours as I want my
resume to be one of the first they see
and let them know I'm actively looking
for work when your job sets my new job
search technique begins to start working
I start getting calls back from Portland
Salt Lake City Las Vegas and more
I feel the momentum turning in my favor
and hopefully I will land a developer
job soon I get a call from a company in
Florida we discussed my youtube channel
my experience in angularjs and web
development and why I want to work as a
developer it goes extremely well in my
eyes I get an offer two days later and a
upped it two weeks later I'm driving
across country with nothing but my three
sill three cylinder Mitsubishi Mirage
tacked to the ceiling over three days
covering eight states twenty five
hundred and fifty miles for a total of
thirty seven hours of driving I've been
working as a full stack developer for
now ten months and is everything I ever
wanted and more much like that very long
car drive that I felt would never end I
kept moving towards the goal and
eventually I got there I hope while you
code daily when you finally finish that
first step of your coding journey you
realize it never ends and you and just
keeps getting better so that is my
developer story there's probably bits
and pieces I left out but that covers
the bulk of it as to where I'm at now I
hope you guys you know reflect on you
know this is basically the last two plus
years of my life two and a half years of
my life to get to where I am today and
you know not everything was rainbows
Sunshine's you know my mom and my dad
weren't happy with the decisions I made
they still aren't
you know there's you know I'm not
telling you about when I feel like loser
one thing I was always respect April 4
is even though she dumped my ass so it
really a miserable person to be around I
don't blame her that when I was feeling
bad and I needed a friend to tell me
that I wasn't a loser and tell me that
you know are you trying your hardest and
if you are I know you'll get there just
a it's that one day when you think you
thinking about giving up that one day
where things are just it feels too much
in life she was there to say you know no
matter how angry she was with me to say
you know I believe in you and you'll get
there but that's that's my story guys
that's how I became a developer and I'd
love to hear your guys stories leave
them in the comments uh anyhow we'll be
given a course away the key word will be
journey that's really what all this is
is a journey journey of life with a
little bit of code right so journey will
be key word will give away a iOS game
course or a Windows game course I forget
which one I gave away in the last video
but I will give away a game course how
to make games with iOS or Android or
Windows one of those so I make sure use
a journey make sure you're subscribed
make sure you like the video if you want
to support me you can a patreon join our
Facebook group as well and discord
Channel I appreciate you guys almond and
I hope no matter what where you are in
your own journeys because I do see a lot
of you comment about how you're worried
about getting to where you want to go is
that if you really do just take one set
forward every day it may be a stutter
step but if you move forward you'll get
there man you really will and I know
there's those days where you don't feel
like it
I promise you when that when that guy
basically as I was writing this high of
meaning basically not basically the
absolute first person who ever thanks me
in person and just was like hey I love
your stuff and then you have somebody
basically mock you so you will have lows
and it's it's it's when those lows come
no matter what they are in life that you
take it may be you lay down for a minute
and then you get back up so I hope you
guys get back up on your coding journeys
or whatever journey you are in in life
thank you for watching the video I'll
see you guys next time bye
hey guys thanks for watching the video
special thanks to our sponsors dev
Mountain if you're looking for a coding
boot camp where tuition and housing is
included definitely check them out
appreciate it and I'll see you guys in
the next video
