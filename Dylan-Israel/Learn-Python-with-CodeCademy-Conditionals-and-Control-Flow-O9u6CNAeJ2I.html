conditionals and control flow
conditionals and control flow need to
start changing some of these names as
you can see I already did it
a while back so we're working through it
fresh and going to reset the code as we
go so just kind of give us an example of
how you write a function in this case
Clinic print some stuff we get some raw
input which I remember correctly it's
kind of like a prompt that pops up from
the browser so let's just get started
here and you just enter the clinic do
you take the door to the right or left
let's go left this is a verbal abuse
room you heap of parrot droppings okay
so this one we're going to be using some
boolean operators set this to true if
all right so set below there's all day
17 less ISO so it's true if 100 is equal
to 2 times 50 so this is true don't
forget to just capitals it's true if 19
is less than or equal to 19 this is also
true if negative 22 is greater than or
equal to negative 18 that's false it
sets is true if 99 is not equal to 98
plus 1 that's false and should be good
to go here just kind of letting us know
how to equal equals not equals less than
less than or equal to but if you're
familiar with any sort of math operators
which it should be just fine it's not
even necessarily coding at this point
it's going to reset this so
let's see bull one is false because
twenty minus 10 is 15 and let's continue
on so we have bull two here
so if 10 plus 17 is 27 and 3 to the 16th
power is about 43 million apparently so
bull 2 is false and bull 3 is 1/2 this
power 2 is in less than or equal to
negative 1 is also false and then 40
times 4 is greater than or equal to
negative 4 is true and then a hundred is
not equal to so this is also false cool
now same thing here
Oh in this case they want us to write a
boolean expression so we need this to be
false so 3 is less than 5 make me true 5
is greater than 3 make me false 3 is 3
is equal 3 is less than or equal to
negative 3 and then true 1 is greater
than 0
double check your expression boolean to
make me false 3 is less than 5 3 is not
equal to 5
all right use at least three different
ones I'll forget truth oh this is true
actually
oops three is greater than or equal to
five
there we go alright look at the truth
table I know don't worry if you don't
completely get it you will by the end of
this session so this is just going over
how some boolean operators work so true
and true returns true so if we have true
and false its false false and true is
false false and false is still false and
then you have true or true is true so
this is talking about and and more
operators for and both of them have to
be true and so you're going to have more
false statements but two falses do not
equal true true or true is true true or
false is true false or true true and
false or false is false and not true is
false and not false is true you'll get
the hang of it it'll be kind of
intuitive once you do it a couple times
all right so let's practice with an set
bull one equal the result of false and
false so we are going to do one is less
than two and two is less than three
said bull to Eagle or zone
so it will - equals a result of so a
negative negative negative negative 2 1
2 3 so 2 is so that's false and 4 is
greater than just so false and true is
false full 3 oh I don't know we don't
need to actually write something so
false and false is false that's also
possible 3 Eagle legs all the 19 mod 4
it's not equal to 300 by 10 30 is 3 so 3
is that equal to 3 is false and then we
have + false so that's also false and
well 4 we have negative 1 is less than 1
because 2 0 power is 1 so that's true
and 10 mod 10 is 1 and 20 minus 10 mod 2
is 0 or 10 mod 10 is 0 since less than
or equal so this is true so turn true
and then both 5 equals your ensure is
true hopefully we got all these good
cool it's a little confusing but you get
the hang of it
all right so on this one set Bowl 1
equal result 2 to the 3rd power is 8
which is 108 mod hundred or cleese is
equal to King Arthur so we have true or
false it's true or false it's true and
then we have true or false is also true
then we also have
both reach 100 square root of 100 is 10
which is greater than or equal to 50 is
false and false is false tip willfully
full boolean for equal to true or true
which is true and then both 5 equals out
of one to the 100th power is 1 which is
equal to that's false and 3 times 2 is 6
times 1 is 6 3 plus 2 plus 1 so that's
false and false to true false circles
cool a little more practice here Bowl 1
equal to the result of not true not sure
is false
so I built it to equal up of three to
the fourth power is 81 which is less
than four so the third power is four
1664 so this is true because we're
saying not so 81 is not less than so
that's true and well 3 equals all if not
10 mod 3 returns 1 1 is less than or
equal to 5 so this is false because it's
true because 3 is greater than 0 full
flower equals is Allnut so let's see
here we have 6 plus 16 22 is not equal
to 25 right 9 or rather not 9 plus 16 is
25 not equal so this is true because it
is equal so for it not being equal not
not true well 5 equal to not not false
so so not false is true and not that is
false I hope I understood that correctly
so both 3 we made a mistake let's see
what happened here
not so 10 mod 3 returns 1 1 is less than
or equal to 0 and they're saying it's
true so that's true so that's not true
yeah it's true because it fulfills the
statement that make sense
sign true or false is appropriate set
bowline equal the result of false set
Bowl one sentry or false set bull and
equals the result of false or not true
and true so it's false or not true and
true
sounds like false to me then we have set
bill two equals the result of false and
not true or true false and not true this
is true
Oh three set equals the result of true
and not false or false so if it's not
true
and then suppose R naught not true false
or false
I think this is false pool floor I may
have made a mistake on bump so false or
not true and true so false and false the
souls yeah bull for the name I miss so
not not true it's false so not true
sauce and not that it's true so true or
false so because we have true on an or
statement there you go alright make me
true remember to use so we're going to
save to this less than one and one
Oh Justin eleven and one is greater than
negative two and then we also want to
make me false one is greater than 2 or 2
is greater than 3
and make me true to is not alright make
me sure not false
make me true let's just try true see if
that works cool so we're going to be
looks like if and elf
if and hell if if I remember correctly
if you think the print statement will
print to the console set response equal
to Y alright I think it will this is a
verbal abuse room you're a heap of
parrot droppings okay so replace under
line of line two with expressions that
were returned true
so we'll say if 1 is less than 2 and
place nice with an expression their
transition will say if 2 is less than 3
sex number 1 its success number 2 cool
and obviously you can do whatever if
statements you want I just did some that
were quick and easy complete the else
statements to the right note the
indentation of each line to spot a
scratch else print look
the pain is too much go away or I shall
taught you this next time else we want
it to print this shit hurts
save us man
make sure French soldier returns false
from the answers not go away or I shall
return you oh also turn false
cool we said this another is statement
fill this statement to check if answer
is greater than five
if answer is greater than five return 1
else if our answer parameter is less
than 5 return negative 1 else return 0
BAM
last but not least we got a little bit
of review here so write an if statement
in the Flying Circus so at least 1 and
or not so what did I do last year
alright so if 1 is greater than 2 and
actually I want to return to it so it's
true 2 is greater than 1 and 3 is
greater than 2 or we're going to write
one complicated thing here or 3 is
greater than or equal to 2 and or true
you
courage
true else if not false are not true
and so see we need three is equal equal
to three
or three is not equal to four or so we
did less than greater than three is less
than or equal to three
or do we do greater than or equal to
okay and then we need to do
we need to return true here and then we
want to put else return false and then
we need to call it so call the
underscore lying
I'm circus and we did this pretty quick
but I'm pretty sure it should work
return true nine twelve
Oh what are we doing around here
expected an indented block
let's see what's going on here we want
to add an else statement to
maybe we need the same in here print
false else print true and right here
return true return true and then we also
need to call it now I'm just for flying
under star circus there we go so you
probably want to have better output but
more or less they just wanted us to use
all the conditional and control flow
type of statements and up next in our
next video we will be doing Pig Latin
so if you ever remember Pig Latin like
my sister as a child would always
pretend to speak Pig Latin but it was
something like you would add difference
that you would speak the half half of
the end part in the front of the word or
still they like like that but I am
thanks for watching and I will see you
guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
