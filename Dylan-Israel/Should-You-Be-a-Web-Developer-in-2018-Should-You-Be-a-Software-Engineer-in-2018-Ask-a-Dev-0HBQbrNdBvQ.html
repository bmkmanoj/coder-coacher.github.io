about should you be a web developer
specifically should be a front-end
developer should you be back in
developer should be a full stack
developer which one pays the most we
have a we have a couple articles we're
gonna look at as well as some census
stated to make this decision
I don't like do it when I do these
videos I've done something about being
data scientists I like to more so just
look at the facts really the job site
stats the US Bureau of Labor Statistics
those types of things that really give
us a look of this is a good career path
and why speak of making good decisions
for your nursing web development much
you consider going to a coding bootcamp
to get your start and get a jump start
on your career they have four different
locations they have Provo Utah Salt Lake
City Utah Phoenix Arizona in their
newest location Dallas Texas I've been
to the Provo Utah one it's a beautiful
campus and they have housing included
with their tuition so if you're
interested in things like full stack
development the UI UX QA Salesforce they
have all that so go ahead and check them
out dev Mountain comm so we're gonna
start this video off by talking about
salaries and a little a couple things
that I want to talk about on top of that
his titles titles oftentimes at a role
will help determine what amount of money
you get in the good example I mean we
give you right here is front-end web
developer so if you've ever heard me I
say I'm a front-end engineer that's what
my title says and that's the reason for
is that cuz I don't like the word
developer but because by and large the
word developer will actually make you
$10,000 less so you see the average base
pay of a front-end developer is about
eighty eight thousand round up to eighty
seven thousand and you'll see here the
front-end engineer salary which is
pretty much identical to the role of a
front-end developer and this isn't
counting senior or junior we're just
going with the general titles here you
can think of this as a mid-level
position so on two three years
experience this is their average base
pay but you can see the same pretty much
the same role the highs are higher the
lows are lower
and the average is better when you're
using engineer so for a front-end
engineer I just wanted to say that and
obviously if you have junior in your
title you're gonna probably make less if
you're senior in your tie they're gonna
probably make more so it's something to
keep in mind but this video isn't
necessarily so much about how much money
you make between a front-end back-end
and full stack engineer but what's the
best choice for you going into the field
because most of these you're gonna make
pretty good money as you as you start so
ninety-eight thousand average base pay
for a front-end engineer we're going to
drop that according to Glassdoor now
Glassdoor
is just one of many mini sites but for
what I found looking at a couple
different you know LinkedIn salaries and
things like that is it you're gonna
generally see this trend of where
front-end engineering you slightly blow
a back-end engineer salary and you'll
see here 105 about $5,000 difference
between the front-end and back-end and
scheme of things not that much full
stack engineer though in comparison it's
about 115,000 so you're definitely
moving your way up to a full stack
meaning that you can do the front to the
back all that sir so there's definitely
about a 15 $17,000 $17,000 difference
between front engineer full stack and
share what I will say about this
specific thing since we are talking
about money with jobs is that if you
want to specialize naturally you'll
become a full stack engineer I consider
myself a full stack engineer even though
I do front-end engineering right now
because I do know it Express MongoDB I
also do PHP in my sequel at previous
roles and now I'm just specializing in
front-end and what I want to say about
that is as you're as you're progressing
through your career what will end up
happening is in terms of your salary in
terms of what the money you make it's
not going to matter so much about the
job it's going to matter more about how
accomplished you are how much you stand
out from the other candidates and how
much you're actually in reality worth
right so there are plenty of front-end
engine
years who are you know making twice what
a average full stack engineer makes and
vice versa right so it's really gonna
come down to you it's all those things
that some people sometimes people
struggle with because they're like well
I don't want to live my life around
software and I understand that I do but
if you you know you have courses you
have books you have some marketing
attached to you because you give
speeches and lectures and you're
becoming somebody who of note within the
space it's you know and you have an
impressive resume impressive portfolio
impressive companies behind you and
you're done everything right you can
make a ton of money regardless of your
job title but that that with that being
said let's jump into the look ins the US
Bureau labor of Statistics data and I
want to point out two main things and
this is a little bit of marketing a
little bit of job skill so the toothed
ones that we're gonna be looking at job
wise are web developers and software
developers so you might be saying Dylan
the front-end engineer is software
engineer the full stack engineer it was
like a ninety five ten or fifteen
thousand average this is saying sixty
six thousand median pay why is it why is
there such a discrepancy right well
partly because web developers I think in
this tent tents in this sense is
encompassing a lot of what I tell you
guys to stay away from but it was
important note because some people are
interested in that so you're interested
in WordPress development you're
interested in more of a web design
aspect of you know the mom-and-pop
building websites this is about what
you're gonna expect to make this is uh
this is when I had my first internship
this was roughly what the guy made with
eleven years experience he made actually
exactly this he was making sixty seven
thousand and eleven years experience
essentially doing web design with
minimum web development the occasional
jQuery like this is one of the reasons I
also say stay away from jQuery because
the type of rules that are very jQuery
heavy they typically pay about this
which is fine for most people you know
sixty six thousand is more than the
average family in America makes which is
about fifty five thousand so your
in the scheme of things doing quite
alright the barrier of entry is
associate's degree so basically if it's
not a bachelors there's nothing as far
as I'm concerned right associate's
degree is you know that's where you
would be if you wanted to meet the
barrier of entry for people to get
started it's the growth of the job right
is great fifteen percent job outlook for
2016 2026 number of jobs one hundred
sixty two thousand nine hundred this to
me is really in that sort of mom-and-pop
web design /dev space which is why the
pay so low but it is a great entry point
for junior developers because of the low
education level the work experience and
related occupation on the on-the-job
training God knows we don't get any of
that and any pretty much any job but um
I think it is is worth noting that there
is quite a difference between a web
developer and a software developer at
least and how the Bureau of Labor
Statistics looks at it and that you know
we just looked at you know Glassdoor
which is used by thousands upon
thousands of people and companies to
post salaries review companies and you
can see that you know the full stack
developers making was that fifty
thousand sixty about fifty thousand
dollars on top of what's there and so
almost doubling it there's quite a
difference in discrepancy but this is
they are grouping a lot of different
things into one category of web
developer and I think I think most of
the jobs that we're talking about
front-end developer saw back in
developer full-stack developer it sounds
kind of weird because they are web
development but you're not necessarily
web developers in the sense of how the
Bureau of Labor Statistics look like
you're you know the front-end engineer
developer rules I think you're gonna
more so fall into the software developer
category but before we move on to the
software developer category what are the
sort of three things that really matter
when you're looking for a job for me it
is high salaries the amount of jobs and
the growth in that field and the reason
for that is you want to get paid well
you want to make sure that there
is jobs available and you want to make
sure that the field is expanding because
even if you are qualified with
experience now you don't want to
necessarily have to be competing against
other people who you know a job ends
three four years good job you wanted you
want to be able to jump back into the
job market not like doing the rat race
just stressing because there aren't any
jobs available so you want to be in a
field that's growing and web developer
is pretty good in that aspect let's go
on a software developer software
developer traditionally Falls more into
the more into the object oriented
programming languages things like
c-sharp things like Java more of those
call it more of the languages I guess
you would learn in a computer science
program you can see the jobs here 24%
much faster than average it's gonna be
hard for you to as someone who looks at
this stuff quite often you're not going
to see stuff much larger than that the
average median pay is about 102 which
falls more into the front-end engineer
the backend and full-stack typical entry
level education bachelor's degree a lot
of people asked should I get a degree
and I always say that it it depends
because on average yes but not everyone
needs a degree you just have to be able
to prove that you don't need it right
you can't just say oh well I don't have
a degree and I can't prove it I'm an
okay example of that I don't have my
bachelor's I'm actually enrolled in an
online bachelors program right now and
I've been working as a developer for a
little lesson than two years now and I
do quite well for myself so you could
see the number of jobs one point two
five six million which is quite nice
and then employment change they're gonna
adding another three hundred thousand
jobs in this space so should you be a
full-stack front-end or back-end
engineer yes by and large on average
will you make more money as a full-stack
engineer yes as a back engineer a little
bit less on low and a front engineer a
little bit less yes will you make a good
income in all of them is there growth in
all of them
and is there a lot of jobs in all of
them yes the barrier of entry on average
is a bachelor's degree it is a it is a
job it's gonna be around I know a lot of
times people are all the skies falling
you know look at WordPress look at Wix
look that's as a front engineer you
don't do WordPress you don't do Wix 99%
of the time it's not really you're not
too worried about not to say that there
aren't companies in the world you use it
to manage their site and stuff like that
but you as a developer you'll be
building custom things that Wix and
WordPress can't handle the other thing
to consider is what it is that you want
to do I don't want you to look at a
ninety five thousand to a hundred and
fifteen thousand dollar salary and they
almost about twenty twenty grand
difference and say oh my god even though
I just want to do front-end development
I'm going to jump into full stack
because I'll make you know an extra
fifteen percent that fifteen percent
increase in salary or twenty percent
increase in salary you can make that
relatively easily just being
accomplished and you know getting some
certs up in your education building a
better portfolio being an author
buildings of courses all that sort of
stuff the stuff that makes you stand out
so my advice to you is front end back in
full stack it's all they're all great
and you can fairly easily transition
from front to back to full stack just as
you have more years of experience but
really choose what it is that you want
to do and the money will come as long as
you're focused on getting the money and
doing what it requires which you know
we've talked about a few of those things
so that's why I thought so include the
links to the web developer and software
developer Bureau Labor Statistics in the
description below if you want to go
ahead and check it out I appreciate you
guys watching this video don't forget to
comment like subscribe share support me
on patreon all that good stuff
every time we share share share a video
a web developer decides to keep learning
code I want you to remember that so if
you have some friends that are given up
you need to share the video it's on you
I want that I want you feel guilty about
it
I'm just kidding guys but I will see you
in the name
video thanks for watching hey baby want
to hear a joke okay Wix developer hey
