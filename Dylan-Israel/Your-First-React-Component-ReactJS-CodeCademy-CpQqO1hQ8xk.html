back in codecademy we're doing
reintroduction react j/s part 1 the
component let's go ahead and get started
here so what are we trying to do
basically it's going over the fact that
you don't actually put in just pure HTML
or variables you actually break your
code up your react code up into
components so you'll see right here an
example where we're setting a variable
equal to react top crate class and then
remember our render we're actually just
going to go ahead and render that out
now what it wants us to do here is
carefully copy the example code into
appt appt j/s we've already done that so
let's go ahead and run that real quick
you'll see we have our require react
require react down this official just
requiring some react libraries we're
creating a variable here then we're
creating a class this is our component
right here we're passing in render which
is a function which your turn some stuff
and then right here we're actually
passing in that component so it's still
the same thing the stuff that we want to
display in the location that we want to
display that now we're just going to do
any ink opponents
so we're going to New jas here and it's
going over what is actually going up on
with this required react so here we're
just creating a variable called Bart
called react and we're going to say like
this is required and what's required is
the react the react right here so excuse
me it's basically again a letter j j sx
work that's basically what's going on
right now very cool so we're gonna go
line to hear oh we're going to do the
same thing except this is going to allow
the Dom to work with react that's
basically with these lines of good do
now to me it's a little bit weird that
we're doing it like this because we've
been using this so so often I think
maybe just to hit it with like hey why
are we doing this before we do this
might be the better way I'm doing it but
if you want a little bit more detail it
goes into it right here but basically is
just two requirements to make sure that
our react works one is for us
specifically the dolt Dom what we're
importing right now
so now we're going to create a component
class now this is how you Capone is
nothing more than kind of a class or
group of stuff maybe maybe you'll have
like a footer component or a header
component or whatever it may be for
whatever it is you're looking to change
or do just going to jump in on line 4
and we're create a variable here I think
we can actually just create it like this
react up create class and doesn't want
us to pass in any arguments yet we may
have to store it in a variable I don't
think so though
here we go now you'll see here that this
hat passes in an object that takes a
grinder and function and return
something render is going to be pretty
much a key of every component excuse me
so you'll have to be using that quite
often so what we're going to do now
let's go ahead and take that component
that we were created and store it in a
variable so recall of our mind component
class we're going to set it equal to the
cone class work we haven't actually done
anything with it quite yet now note that
when you're naming class names you
actually are going to do so do it an
upper camel camel case meaning the
you're in first letters can be
capitalized falling by each additional
word now this goes over what we learned
so on line 1 we learn that this saves a
JavaScript object in your file which
contains the methods to make react work
such as create an element credit class
line two we learned that this saves
another JavaScript object that deals
with making sure the dome works line for
this is how we create a new component
class and that that's basically what we
did right here what we did the last few
pages kind of went into a little bit
more detail now we're going to go ahead
and pass in the component component
class that we're using via create class
and it goes into some details here sweat
as well so let's go ahead and select new
j/s so make some lines in between VAR
react oh alright so they want us to
create a new variable we're going to go
ahead and call this component blueprint
and we want to set it equal to an empty
object oh excuse me
oh i think i spelt that wrong right now
we're just creating an empty very
variable next up in this empty in this
component blueprint object we want to
then pass in the render with an empty
function to our to our object it's going
to run that real quick
and then finally we want our render
function to do some stuff so what do we
want it to do we simply want it to
output hello hello world
and then in a react crate class in our
my my component class we want what
happened here oh don't forget to return
it as well
and then we were just going to go ahead
and pass in the component blueprint like
so and of course make sure that you're
much better speller than myself now
normally you wouldn't do this you would
actually just go ahead and pass in the
the object as itself without naming it
but it's a little bit cleaner when
you're getting used to it to see it like
like this and that's what it's basically
going to tell us right now is that go
ahead and jump in our new Jas file and
it's basically saying that you don't you
wouldn't normally pass in it like a
variable like we did before instead what
we would what we would do and it looks
like for some reason it don't reset but
instead what we do is take this take
this like so and we pass in everything
into here or everything into our
component left so sorry guys I'm uh I'm
my wisdom teeth medication is making me
have the hiccups a little bit so what we
want to do here is carefully cut the
object component blueprint oh it's not
here so that's why that's why I'm going
a little Oh what happened to everything
so carefully cut the object
blueprint leave our component is equal
to its this was serene
it's not here we don't need to cut it
all right so uh and then what it wants
us to do is instead passing our
component class right here which like it
in the example so it's just going to be
react dome is that capitalized yes it is
rach dom dot render what do we want to
pass in uh to let it know that it's in
component we pass it in like this and
then we just pass in my component class
comma and then document and uh we go
ahead and pass it in where where it's
going to be we're just document dot get
element by ID app so just real quick
this is our component class and you're
letting the the react dom no its you
component with this like HTML looking
bracket and then we're passing it to the
location so what we're changing or what
application we're implementing or what
component and then we're we're we're
doing it Oh
there we go spelling mammoth it's a
struggle oh my goddess but let's
misspelled it again
there we go and then I believe we
already did this but you just passing
the location as well so basically what
you really need to take away from this
is how come components work and that
you're going to create classes a lot
like this wait and they're usually going
to have render a little bit more detail
about react react DOM and then this is
how you passing components moving
forward so as always guys hope you found
this helpful thanks for watching and
special thanks to you who support me on
