your life all right so good morning
everybody today we are doing our weekend
last year so for those of you who are
new to Saturday's I do I try to every
Saturday sometimes Sundays sometimes
Friday nights we do a weekend livestream
where I try to answer your questions one
of the things that I wish I had a lot
more of when I was trying to get
starting all this was someone that I
could just ping some questions to and
from and maybe hopefully get some
answers and that's what these are all
about every weekend I do a livestream
where I I try to do a AMM style where I
help out any way I can and I typically
have been starting recently to start off
with the question why people sort of
funnel in if you will and this week I am
going to start by giving a little update
about myself when I'm doing and then the
question that's in the title so alo
update about me I am in about three
hours gonna go be taking a certification
exam that will if I pass it which I
should it's a web dev certification will
fulfill one of my courses for college so
it'll be as of this coming Monday two
weeks since I went back to school and I
should finish my first course today and
that's pretty exciting so that's gonna
be what I'll be up to in about three
hours time so I've been studying and
doing all that and I'm still waiting on
my new computer it should be here in a
week I have some great videos coming out
on Monday I have a video called the
fifth top 50 online resources to learn
the code so look for that video it's a
36 minute video we
I'm going through 50 different resources
but I think that'll be a be something
that's very exciting you guys will like
so that's what that's what's going on
all right so the the question the the
first intro topic we're gonna talk about
is my boss asked me for those of you I
don't want to go into too much detail
about my workplace or anything like that
but my boss we have these one-on-one
meetings every week where it's about 15
minutes where we talk all the employees
talk with their managers once a week and
it's kind of your chance to vent to
discuss your career and things like that
he asked me a question he normally
hasn't asked me in the past which was
what is it that you want out of your
career what is it what are your career
goals and I gave him a very honest
answer like where do you want to go how
do you want to progress I gave him a
very honest answer one was I want to go
where all the money is so whatever can
make me more money is where I want to go
which is true because I truly do enjoy
it all for the most part - PHP and
luckily we don't do page people that's a
separate video we okay so I do enjoy it
all what I would like is just to make
more money in general not to say that
I'm underpaid or anything but that
that's my career goal is to make good
money and be able to I work a job
because I'm not financially wealthy or
independently wealthy that's typically
why people work jobs now it's kind of
strange to boil it down to that but that
is the facts all right so if we were all
independently wealthy probably nine out
of ten of us would not work we would
work on our own stuff and not for other
people no daily thing that I said was
that I would like very much so to get I
think I used the word disgusting I would
like to get the disgusting jr. off of my
title now my previous job I didn't have
jr. on my title and I'm not quite sure
why they felt it was necessary to put it
on my current title but they did
and I wanted to work for them so I
accepted the role even though they did
and so that is those are kind of my to
short term career goals well yeah I've -
the first second ones short-term but the
more I reflect upon this question the
more I think about it I want to I think
I'm gonna have to dive in deeper and say
what is it works plan for my career what
is my company's plan for my career goal
because I think that is equally as
important
and why are you asking this question and
so I will be asking a question next week
because I think it's important to find
out if you're asking this question
because what I mean long-term what my
plan is is kind of I could I could map
it out I would like to drop the junior
and go to senior as soon as possible
I would like to make more money and I
would like to eventually be a tech lead
or some sort of lead of a team and get
some developer management experience the
that is Michael but there's several
steps to get to that so that was
something that happened recently and I
think it's important to to to say
because I do have career goals now
oftentimes I've never really thought
this is the first real company that I've
been with that I could see myself
working for for five years
most companies I see myself working for
a year to two years to three years to
four years at here two years it's kind
of what I'm saying and so it is the
first company in which the goals that I
am looking to achieve I could say can
line up I can become a senior developer
I can become a better developer and it's
not beyond the realm of possibility of
some sort of promotion or something like
that in a in a reasonable amount of time
so it's strange because I've never
usually when I think about my I guess
what I'm trying to say is usually when I
think about my career goals and I filmed
a video about job hopping and I haven't
released because I didn't really like
how it came out but I just think about
it as me I don't necessarily think about
the company asked
right and I think that's I think that's
something that is different because I do
think about staying with my company
because I I tend to actually love
everything about my company currently
which you can always change but it's a
very interesting thing because there's
first time that as a employee I have to
think about these things because for so
long as an employee I'm just looking out
for me and I'm still looking out for me
but I'm more so looking I I see how the
company and as an employee our paths can
align to where we are both successful
instead of I'm just worried about me
being successful which is an interesting
thing that has never occurred as an
employee before so that's that's my
little blurb for the week let's see what
sort of questions we got pimpin ain't
easy early bird gets the worm giggity
giggity yes where it's a waste um from
Street Fighter motorcycles let's stand
up real quick um literally was just
watching one of your videos well thank
you very much up you clearly have a good
taste what do you think about trying to
get to the front end of I I mean I I'm a
front end of I think it's great
allegedly I'll start being groomed to be
a full-stack death but we'll see what
happens with that best web projects for
front-end first a long-term project
something that you're going to
continually work on and and continue to
grow with and that the best projects in
my opinion are once that will make you a
buck not like you need to get rich but
if you can take a project make fifty
dollars a month you're gonna be
motivated to continue to work on that
project to get it to $75 a month to $100
a month so on and so forth and continue
to learn right so that's that's one
thing I would stress and unique projects
people are so sick of seeing weather
apps in your portfolio or calculators do
something unique build your own sort of
thing if you're interested in MMA Jenna
mate MMA stats page I hit so much MMA
api's built if you're backing guy
building them at
a MMA API you know how to get confidence
and react you've code you build things
and react and you learn to continue food
angular react in 2018 Schuyler both of
them I honestly think it's probably fine
to learn one or the other when it comes
to the angular or react front-end
frameworks I don't think you necessarily
need to learn both I think you probably
would put yourself in a disadvantage I
mean having both skill sets is great but
if you're trying to learn that first job
I think probably focusing on one or the
others fine hey sensei I guess that's me
I don't follow advice from experience
test who advise noobs who want to get
better to just start building stuff yeah
I get that you need to practice what
there has to be more well here is the
honest-to-god truth you need to code
everyday and then you'll get better it's
not there's no shortcut I guess what I'm
trying to say I'm code everyday outside
of work and inside of work I show up to
work about thirty minutes to an hour
early and I watch udemy tutorials or I
you know I read blogs or whatever it is
I am progressing my skill set I'm
outside of work going to get my degree
last week I went to a meet-up and you
know learned some stuff and so what I'm
trying to say is you can do it in a
number of different ways you know we
have our Facebook group code Tech and
caffeine where people are sharing
resources and like hot you know new tech
new software new frameworks the goal is
to learn a little something every day
and if you do that you'll continue to
grow why'd you shave off half your
Mustang I didn't man it just grows like
this it's dark in the center it's all I
got man I can't help I can't help the
way my facial hair grows besides
everyone likes a porn stache all right
um but yeah so the goal is for you to
continue to mature as a developer you
should be two to three times the
developer you are every year that's kind
of how I look at it so
after JavaScript what should I learn for
freelancing
you should probably so anyone who's
trying to freelance my nice please just
suggest you go and get actual company
experience in freelance after you've
been working for a couple years because
uh I just think it's one of those things
where you need that in person
you'll be cash such a better developer
how much do you balance your social
career and now school life not very well
this is something that so I don't know
if I've ever said this but I told April
about three years ago that I told her I
said look I'm gonna work every day for
this is what this is when I I kind of
said I was feeling down in the dumps and
I was just like I'm gonna turn my life
around I said look I kind of made a
mental note and stuck to it that I'm
gonna work every day for five years and
see what it gets me and I think if I do
that I can be very suspects successful
and so we're about three years in of the
work every day for five years
and it has been working phenomenally I
mean from living on the floor or on a
couch to I got money in the bank to buy
a house and then some so I got a I get
my career's going great everything so
when it comes to actually managing the
work might so I in terms of career I put
in about forty hours to forty five hours
a week those s extra five hours my
career in terms of time is a standard
full-time job I've actually had my my my
director of engineering come up to me
and and he noticed us coming in early
and staying late because I'm studying
I'm doing this he came up to me and said
show up on time and leave on time you
don't need to be here doing this so in
the current job I'm in it has a very
great work-life balance in that aspect
in terms of social life it's a little
bit hard I am it is just April and I in
the cats right now we are in saving mode
because we're looking to buy a house
we'd normally would probably be taking a
here there but that is one of those
things that kind of in social I don't we
don't know anybody out here that's the
truth man I've tried to make friends
with some of my co-workers and we are
friends and stuff like that we don't
really hang out and school life just
studying everyday kind of like coding
everyday I'm I'm learning and doing what
I can
my goal currently is one class every two
weeks it looks like I'll be able to
stick to that at least in the beginning
and I'm setting myself up with the
courses that I think are a little bit
less of a learning curve for me in the
software development degree program so
that's what I do how much you code for
the cup for my company I would say about
50 to 75 percent of my time is spent
coding depending on the week you know
there are other aspects there's meetings
that you have to go to it's not like I'm
doing other work besides coding but
there is in terms of actual me sitting
down and building out projects and
working on projects you are a lot of
times you have meetings you have to talk
about requirements you are you know
there's workshops and and all that sort
of stuff that go along with it but it's
I was if I had to say an average
probably about 70% on average that I'm
actually spending Cody
I'm about to sell sunny JavaScript
what's one project you suggest building
profile building for profile I would say
start by building actual personal
portfolio you can put you know header
images in or whatever to hold those
places as your current as you are
currently learning and building those
projects for your portfolio but I think
being able to build a nice-looking
portfolio page is super important I
think that's a good place to start
I'm currently using angular angular in
the latest version we update the day
that angular updates we update our code
typically in the project that were we're
running so I'm currently working in
angular 5 and I love it I it has a
little bit of a learning curve in terms
of just the way that how everything's
connected but once you pick that up it's
not too bad I could probably teach I and
I've been meaning so I one of the videos
I'm gonna film is like angular 5 and 30
minutes or something like that one of
those types of videos where she's a
breakdown of angular showcasing what it
is you need to know and how to use it
and stuff like that I've ever considered
starting own company yeah but it's not
like a dev company and it's not
something that I'm considering too much
if I was gonna consider start a business
I probably would just do a franchise
something that I think would be low low
effort in terms of the amount of hours
or that would not have a super high
learning curve something like a ham
Scott like a money shop sort of thing so
we'll see
so Paul Hannah says what's coding like
on the job is it slower face do you pair
program is it acceptable to spend time
on technical slices that do they expect
you to handle that after hours so here's
the thing every company is different by
far i I can tell you that I personally I
do pair program on occasion and that
when there are technical spikes most of
the time and I see
most companies but I can only say for
the ones that I've worked with it is
expected that you don't what wittily
twiddle your thumbs if you need help ask
for help we are a team in most software
companies right we're all in the same
team and you should be able to lean on
other people and it's very it's fine it
happens all the time right
I mean you should be happy to help as
well as be happier ego in check enough
to be able to accept I'll I'll give you
a perfect example there are a lot so
there are about triple the amount of
back-end / full stack devs as front-end
devs but as a front-end dev I work in
the front-end all the time
and so with what happens is you'll
you'll see that sometimes the full spec
devs will need a little bit of help
going into things because they're not up
to date on the packages that we're
updating or how we do this how we do
that because a lot of stuff is custom so
you go over there and you say I think
it's because this is broken and they've
been looking at it for 30 minutes but
you can just spot it like that because
why should they go spend another 40
minutes to hours try and debug it when
there's somebody who works in this every
day
is it better to learn JavaScript
frameworks like react training or
learning a back-end language like PHP or
Python it really depends on what your
goal is both things accomplish
completely different things
ice blade Network how's it going man
which project do you think lending a job
and what do you post on your github so I
actually have a video for my github
going over my projects that will come
out in about two weeks maybe a week and
a half but the projects my most
impressive project is YouTube and so
that is what has landed me probably my
last three jobs actually I would say
landed me but it's played a factor would
be a better way of putting it and so it
shows a passion it shows that I'm
learning and it shows that I'm
continuing to educate myself and grow as
a developer and I think it's something
that is unique to me and it's all about
building unique projects as I I've kind
of explained and so that would be the
thing that helped me the most
what type of questions did my boss ask
in the end of your front-end I can't
really answer that they're not gonna
like me answering what sort of questions
my job a stranger process as PHP they're
in 2018 PHP seems to be I mean you just
do a little bit of research about what
jobs are showing up with PHP there's a
lot of PHP jobs out in the world now
whether they're the high-paying jobs I
can't really say but there are a lot of
PHP jobs in general and the reason for
that is a lot of times it's just you
have people have been working in PHP for
20 years and they they are now
architects and they're architecting
projects in PHP so was that local
Starbucks and lady offered me a
freelance the opportunity for for her
from her husband's company when I'm
ready I'm excited but nervous amen
so the thing about the thing about being
a developer is just be confident that
you are going to confidently work at
something that's kind that sounds kind
of heck I put this in a much better way
than just it understand that you are
going to Willy willingly chip away at
this first project as you go and there
may be setbacks but you're going to
continue to grind it out and if you have
that mentality it's really nothing to
stress about projects as you become a
better developer don't necessarily
become more complex 90% of the time they
just become larger in scope it's just ok
well because a project is nothing but a
bunch of set of mini projects and if you
look at the mini projects okay I just
got to chip away at this one this mini
projects done I 5 mini projects do mini
project 1 2 3 4 5 oh that big massive
project is done and you start looking at
programming that way becomes a lot less
intimidating but I can't say that I'm
not I'm not I haven't been in your
situation numerous times where I'm now
freelancing and things are very scary
yeah cuz they are what kind of things
you need to know about my sequel as a
developer you need to be able to what
defense depends on what you're doing in
my sequel but if you're just like a full
spective you probably just need to
how to create tables join tables and add
rows and columns to the database
whatever happened to your JavaScript
udemy course so I have five hours of
content on there and my computer
although I'm using it now you'll notice
that things are a little bit slow and
breaking my computer's been breaking I
have a new computer coming and I'm kind
of thinking what I'm going to do is take
that JavaScript content and I'm going to
add it to a hundred algorithm section so
you're gonna kind of get it two in one
course that's kind of what I'm thinking
well projects have you built that you're
most proud of
again the YouTube channel this is
something that I've been working on for
two years seven or eight months
according to my LinkedIn and I've been
sticking with it I've been grinding it
out to the best of my ability it's
introduced me to a lot of interesting
people it has been very helpful in that
is by far the project that I'm most
proud of and people know that's not real
project
oh if for sure is anything that shows
coding don't not all projects have to
actually write code but you just don't
think I'm very proud of how you get
clients on freelancing I mean there's
websites there's Craigslist there's
word-of-mouth
there's contracting so you could you
could be a contract employee so how much
time should it take for the front end
certificate free code camp everyone goes
to a different pace it took me and mind
you I wasn't doing exclusively but from
the day I started the day I finished
took me about nine months and I put a
lot of time in that I was doing all the
algorithm in cheat on any of it I did
all myself how many hours should once
commit to web development starting from
HTML if you really want to learn web dev
just front-end to start you should be
doing about three hours of coding a day
until you get a job that is my my
recommended amount of time every day no
breaks until you get a job I'm gonna say
it one more time to a lot of you are
gonna think that I'm kidding or that
that I am exaggerating code every day in
you have a job and you will get
a job I've told you guys the secret that
is the secret wire might get my monitor
high they're not I just have a standing
desk do you think you need to learn
object-oriented programming for a friend
dev in c-sharp or C++ before work in
JavaScript on you know I mean you don't
have to angular uses typescript which
essentially does object-oriented
programming at the end of the day it
uses classes and all that sort of stuff
so I don't think you have to actually go
in like C sharp or C++ I'm working in a
software house or other company and
working in a company that's in the
health and beauty space with its
in-house development team I guess is how
it would put it can you make a video
customizing an angular 5 project from
ThemeForest no there's no time for that
so that's it's a waste of your time and
my time sorry as far as I'm concerned
what should I learn after HTML CSS and
JavaScript a cup kit and a front-end
framework such as reactor angular
I've been learning I've been taking
react angling a few courses on udemy or
spending most of our like however I
really liked view things is in jobs man
it's not like angular react yeah it's a
waste of time I've said this quite a bit
there's a reason I only recommend react
or angular cuz you need to be learning
if your job is to land a goal be
learning a reactor angular because those
are the front-end frameworks that there
are jobs in now I couldn't tell you if
you is great or wonderful but I can tell
you that if you're thinking about look
if you're thinking about getting a job
in two years with view maybe but most
people are trying to get jobs today and
so I wouldn't waste my time with you so
um let's see here can working a web
development lead to an antisocial life I
think working in any job that works too
long hard hours and a lot of times a lot
of people in certain industries the game
industry is a great example this you are
working very long hours and certain
companies you're working very long hours
and if your company is consistently
trying to work you 50 60 hours a week
you should leave that company you should
really consider leaving that coming now
I'm not saying that there aren't gonna
be weeks that are gonna be longer
because you have special events that
happen once a year or twice a year that
all happens what I'm saying is what you
need to do is find a company that
doesn't expect you work 60-hour weeks is
not only is your hourly rate going down
it will take away from your social life
but does working in web dev make you
less social I don't believe so so I have
helper be willing to focus on applying
for jobs in high demand area like
Seattle San Francisco Seattle New York
City areas thus far apply for jobs in
place with the lower cost of living so
it it depends on where you're at in your
career right so when I was applying for
my first web dev job I was applying in
all of the United States I would apply
every single day for every front-end
role that came up in the United States
in the last 24 hours now if I were in my
say I was job hopping in a year from now
or two years from now whatever it is or
today for Edmonton in this situation so
same job hopping I would look for cities
that I wanted to work in and the reason
for that is I have some experience now
but I think when you are looking to to
get your first role you should just be
willing to go anywhere and get the
experience now the problem with that is
is that some people don't have it in
them to jaw pop some people have this
loyalty gene and don't understand that
loyalty goes both ways right so if
you're making 50,000 in your first web
dev job in your first year that's fine
it's not a great amount of money but
that's fine as long as you understand
that now that you have one year
experience you can leave and go get 65
but what happens is that one year comes
by sometimes you get a raise to 53 and
then you're like okay cool I got a
little 53 a little $3,000 raise but you
just lost out on $12,000 and it probably
had a larger or better company but
people some people don't have that in
them so that's the one caveat to that I
would say where's my cat I have three
they're all over the place man it's hard
keep track you cheat on the algorithms
do front-end devs designer do they
convert PhDs from designers typically
front-end devs will convert designs
given to them by the the UI team but it
all depends on the organization what are
my thoughts on view GS essentially
there's no job so it's not worth talking
about I mean if you're just so looking
for a passion project
already working to have fine but most
people who are on YouTube on these
software channels I say the majority
probably are people who are in school
probably are people who are just scratch
their coding boot camps people who are
looking to jump into the career they are
wasting their time our algorithms
necessary for full sachdev they're
necessary for you to get jobs they're
necessary for you to understand now do
you have to memorize the min/max
algorithm big big big ten all that sort
of crap
no fair Big O rather now there may be
questions in some very computer science
e interviews but are they really
relevant to your job absolutely not
ninety percent of the time I'm not
familiar parcel what version of angular
should you do the latest if you're gonna
start how do you apply for jobs when
you're looking do you apply for a
certain number of ads every day so again
when I was applying for jobs I would
look on two sites LinkedIn and I'd be
looking on zip recruiter and what I
would do is I would filter by a 24-hour
period and every single day I would
search for the jobs in like say and for
my first job it was the entire United
States which was would turn out to be
about a hundred fifty a piece I would
fill out every single day so I'd come
home from my job and I would fill out
about four to five hours of apps is
typically how long it would take me to
go through about 150 apps I go to bed I
go to work in the morning I come home I
fill out four to five hours with apps
and in six weeks I had a job and I take
the same approach when I found my
current job although I got a recruiter
through it I would apply to the jobs in
this case in the area and there's a lot
less and I would do it every single day
for 24 hour periods the reason for that
is I want my a lot of job apps just soar
up that are stale I don't want to waste
my time on it and to I want to make sure
that if this app went up today that my
app was my my job
was going to be one of the first ones
that they saw and that that way they
could look at my wristband give me a
call that was my goal
jump-scare personal portfolios should I
have a straight JavaScript then a
reaction you could it be fun honestly
guys none of these things are like bad
questions most of the time are bad ideas
like should I do it this way or should I
jump to this it but often times if you
do it both ways you'll get something out
of it um but I mean it depends what you
want do you want to get better at
vanilla JavaScript do a vanilla
JavaScript project you wanna get better
at react to your a project why is it why
is it that so many companies are
obsessed with solving algorithm
searching your level position they want
to make sure that you understand
frameworks and you can think logic or
understand a lot understand the lot the
the language and can think logically so
that's really it
all programming is this problem solving
and be able to break everything down
into bits and pieces that you can then
build out and connect those bits and
pieces you kind of think of it as the
project itself is a puzzle you then have
to build out these puzzle pieces that
then become larger puzzle pieces that
then clip in with the other large puzzle
pieces you just created that's kind of
how I I would think of it and for that
you have to be good at solving puzzles
in something so that's why the
algorithms test exists now I've had
other companies that have given me very
realistic projects where they say hey
here's a mock API go ahead and create a
get call in this library in language
because that's what we care about
so do I use bootstrap yes what's coding
on like on the day-to-day work well I uh
I um I just did a video on Monday saying
day to day as a front-end engineer it
will probably answer all those questions
what's your experience on how to code
please little buy your life journey
developer job I have a whole video
breaking down a two-year period of how I
got my first deaf job and it is a it's
called how I how I became a developer
Joshua nine-one-one did you already
explain your answer earlier in the video
can you oh yes I did in the earlier
video when when apply for companies I
say to do you generally entertain
relocation package is paying for the
move house hiring process we're not low
this is a company by company thing a lot
of the lower tier companies will not pay
for your relocation the higher tier
companies will and they'll say it right
when they interviewed like so when
Amazon interviewed me in the interview
they said if you mean really already you
know we're not discussing salaries or
anything but it did say in the interview
thing that pay no matter where you're at
we're happy to pay for relocation if
necessary and at my last job which was a
much smaller company than Amazon but
it's about 200 person company there was
a relocation package and the way that
they did it was I could take the
relocation money or I could get a larger
salary and just larger salary because
it's a better decision but it's a
company by company basis where the goals
that you have currently my goal my
immediate goal right now Justin is three
to four things one I want to finish my
degree my bachelor's that is an
immediate thing to I want to become a
senior developer as quickly as possible
and I think I can do it in a year and a
half to two years three I want to buy a
house so that is those are my three
immediate goals and four I won't buy a
second house so I am looking at duplexes
to buy out I plan on renting them out so
the houses that we're looking when I say
house I mean
flex or house with the Backhouse and the
reason for that is I plan on renting out
these properties and having them become
income generating properties as well as
me saving money on rent so that is kind
of what I am doing right now
those are my those are my goals in the
next six months some of them to the next
three years I would say how many
projects have I made four front in front
and for work probably like 30 at this
point I just like relying at tutorials
so much often wonder what thought
process for breaking a program what's
the process for identifying these parts
so if you can understand what a user
story is essentially as a user I want to
do this and thus I need this that's kind
of so let's talk about a weather app as
a user I want to see the weather in
degrees and in Celsius because I may be
a European user or a American user
something like that so you start
thinking about that like okay well what
is that user story need well I need a
way to switch between the two right or I
need to display both depending on what
the context is so you essentially go
through your application and before it's
built obviously you say what would I
need to actually accomplish this and
when you're able to do that you can then
break down the parts and start building
it out and you say okay well where is
this where's the degree in Celsius
coming from well am I getting a JSON of
data if so before I even get to that I
have to get that data what does that
mean I have to do left you get call all
right so I'll have to do a function to
do a get call now what am I actually
calling well I'm calling an API now what
is that data it's returning is it
returning degrees is it returning
Celsius if it's just returning degrees
after converting it so you start
breaking out piece by piece by piece so
Oh
testing higher we still alive oh yeah so
you just start doing stuff like that and
you start thinking about it I see so
many jobs asking for three to five years
experience ignore them because at the
last feel like the last shy avoid these
jobs are applying them it's kind of an
interesting question I don't think
there's any harm in applying to them
I've been interviewed for roles that are
five plus years experience and I've
gotten very close to actually getting
the job but often times I am a little
bit inexperienced for a five plus here
experienced job when I have one year
experience at the time with those
interviews but I don't think there's any
harm in it oftentimes what it will do is
if junior roles come along apply that
and they've already interviewed you
maybe they'll take you in this
bachelor's degree required for companies
for the job well I've had two deaf jobs
and I have no bachelor's so it's it's
again it's a case-by-case basis can you
prove without a bachelor's that you can
code
do you have an impressive portfolio
impressive LinkedIn are you interesting
canning can you show that you're
passionate and then you're enjoying this
stuff and are used type of persons they
want to hire do most people need degrees
to get jobs yeah because most people
can't put in the work that's required
when you don't have a degree
so again it's it's a it's a
person-by-person basis but how many
hours do I sleep about eight I I go to
bed about 8:30 and I get about 6:30 so
but 8:30 I'm in bed by 8:30 or 9:00 but
it takes me about an hour plus to go
sleep
I've just been completing the your
course last few days I just finished a
code now it's time to refactor great
course thank you very much man yeah it's
it's a introductory course to angular I
have so here's the thing I want to I
have like two to three courses that are
completely accepting percent there and I
can't wait to release it but I'm waiting
for my computer which should be here in
a week they're building it what's your
favorite database firebase Mongo I like
MongoDB I just like the JSON style
database I think it's pretty easy to do
queries on it but honestly any of the
JSON databases that kind of nice should
I bother to post udemy course completion
circuits on my website I put them on my
I put them on my LinkedIn and I put them
on and as I get better certifications I
probably will remove them from my
LinkedIn but if you go to my github
github.com slash Pete's poker jumpstart
job follow buff beefed up that if
you if you if you go on there you'll see
I actually have a certs folder of which
I have it broken out where I have certs
from udemy on there would they accept
which companies use a u.s. accept
candidates from other countries yes
there's a whole process you have to go
through and my two workplaces ago I
would say about a third of the
developers were imported I don't know is
imported the wrong word but I feel like
imported is correctly imported
developers but yes so they it does
happen you know I don't see I don't know
how you could apply to a hundred-foot
fish new job as when I searched your
friend and developers I get maybe six I
can see myself capable of doing well I
was searching a 24 hour period but I
searching for the entire United States
on between LinkedIn and between between
a zip recruiter and oftentimes I I had
the mentality that that if I was not
qualified for a role that I applied for
to I still applied to it and the thought
process being like I would pick it up as
I got there so a lot of times people are
so intimidated to apply for jobs you
could probably go out today everyone in
here could go out today and get an
internship if they tried hard enough and
you'd learn a ton of that internship
even they paid you minimum wage and even
if you're not ready there's plenty of no
job and here's the thing here's the
truth about web dev no matter how many
years of experience you have you're
never going to be the perfect candidate
for this industry because it's so every
workplace is so different so specific
and you have to accept that that's a
reality we all want to be 100% prepared
and guarantee that we have a hundred
percent chance of success and it's not
it's not realistic to the workplace and
so what ends up happening is you have to
you have to let go and say look I'm
confident that I will do I will put in
the effort and the energy to get up and
running you know when I started my
current job I never had any angular2
experience and it was what I but what I
did was I put in twenty hour
week the first month doing angular
courses and studying angular so that in
a month from now I could write be a much
better angular developer and I you know
ask for help when I need it so and so
forth uh what are your deadlines for
assignments now that you're doing online
college had like a pair when you're
trying to get your CS degree in person
well so the way that Western Governors
University works is much different than
any traditional college is that you
enroll in courses you pay a flat rate
because they just care about you being
in school essentially but um there are
no deadlines your deadline is that they
expect you to complete 12 units I want
to say a semester which is six months
and so you if you wanted to you take all
three finals last day or you should take
all three finals the first day if you're
meant if your course your program coach
or free or what they call them checks
off on it so in terms of deadlines there
are none you just take your test or you
do your project and the that you have
six months to do it within there and if
you finish the three you can enroll in
more and do other courses which is great
and I love it which is why in terms of
my schooling and about two hours and
that will be will be ending this in
about fifteen minutes here guys in about
two hours I will be taking my first
final F which if I pass I will finish
one course in a two-week period which is
what my goal is while in in degree
person you have to go to these classes
where you don't really learn too much
you have to do a ton of assignments that
you're required to do all assignments
are optional - the test or the final
project in my current program
do you believe something for front-end
dev now should be done by summer do you
believe my 10 year domain experience in
the auto Mont I don't know what you mean
by don't ten year domain experiences you
just mean working in the hot amount of
parts field would help me in a job
search with that industry I think it
would yeah but I wouldn't necessarily
tailor yourself to it how long did you
wait to start applying for jobs how far
were you on free coaching I was about
3/4 of the way through free code gap
when I start applying what are your
thoughts on the last episode Dragon Ball
super I you know I I watch Dragon Ball
super every every week and I can just
tell you that the fan service is at an
all-time high always and it's kind of I
think Dragon will super will be better
when wash sequentially from start to
finish but it's really hard to enjoy a
lot of these episodes in just a
20-minute piece because all of them lead
to something else
and I find myself more frustrated with
it than anything else that's really what
I would would say write a book on
journey from grasshopper to sensei maybe
what's my favorite coding channel
YouTube channel for coding approach
traversing media for actual coding can I
have a look at your LinkedIn today I
said I did next time next time next time
thank you thank you Joshua
why are you getting a degree in the area
select developers you think a degree
will make a difference I think a degree
will give me well a couple of things
from a personal standpoint I have a chip
on my shoulder and I'm a bit of a
pessimist so I am I don't like that I
didn't finish my degree finish a degree
and that's one thing a second thing is
one day I want to go and be a teacher of
some sort and so I'm starting that
process now because I'll need a degree
to do that thirdly I think it will make
me more money
and fourthly I found I found a program
that works for what I want to do a man
just started it started out saying
thanks for doing these logs they're a
great help keep up the good work sir
Thank You Man that's part of the reason
I do this guys is I mean there's 40 of
us in here and people are gonna tune in
throughout the week and so you know
maybe a thousand people here gets a
chance to watch this and a lot of the
same questions that we've been
discussing in every live stream they
typically are questions that most of the
people want to know and so you know this
is really sort of some open source
mentoring type of stuff right so where
if I think I can provide a solid answer
where people want to base
you know what worked for you I'm happy
to share what works for me because I I
think I there's a lot of hard work I
think I've made some good choices along
the way to make sure that my hard work
went paid for or paid off rather do you
think blockchain is as revolutionary as
no SQL I think blockchain is going to be
something that whether you think it's
gonna be cryptocurrency sir those are
going to succeed and I think if
blockchain as a whole is something it
could completely succeed there's a lot
of companies have a lot of databases
that are not as secure as blockchain and
traditional Suns we'll see though I mean
Elektra has been around for a while and
it hasn't necessarily taken over it's
it's I mean don't get me wrong this last
year the jobs a blockchain exploded and
I'm expecting that to continue but
whether it will to the point where I'll
need to sit down and think about
actually picking it up because it is
such a thing we'll see
yeah do you have any advice or resources
for making a resume that stands out to
recruiters I think I've talked about
organizing your resume to showcase your
skills and your projects and I
personally believe the photo is good as
well and just something that shoka's a
single page and has all your relevant
jobs on there with bullet points to
successes that's basically all I can say
right now try going to get the basics
under my belt then do a boot camp not
sure which one yet but seems like a good
way to get going in my honest opinion I
think it's a solid way for a lot of
people I did it myself it's not beyond
the realm of possibility there is
something that I would I would love to
go to a boot camp just because I think I
would thoroughly enjoy it and there's
probably some gaps in my knowledge but
you don't have to but a lot of people
need their hand held I don't mean that
in a disrespectful way but a lot of
times people need that person that
they're going to ask a question and get
a response and and it's a it's kind of
why I'm here is to give you a response
to the questions that you have right
a live response and a lot of people need
that especially when learning coding
because sometimes it's I remember when I
started out I didn't even know what how
to Google to get the result that I
needed right so when you're at that
level it's really hard to get going
where you're like this is a failing I
have no idea what I should even search
for so I'll just paste it in that didn't
do anything what I do next don't know so
how do I get my
what Dave Joe I applied for six weeks I
got a job in Florida and I drove across
country in four days three days it was
awful I would never recommend anyone
travel across country in such a short
amount time it's better not to start
with the boot camp then I mean
everyone's different here's the thing
guys there's no one answer I definitely
think you need to be prepared to go into
a boot camp I don't think there's
anything wrong with the coding boot camp
I think that if you put in the time and
the effort and the energy you'd probably
do very well with it so it just kind of
depends
I am very Pro coding boot camp if people
ask me a lot one of the common questions
I get is hey I want to start a career in
software and web dev and I want to be
working within a year and I don't want
to you know like what is what is a good
option I think coding boot camp is a
great option right dev mountain has
tuition and housing for ten thousand
dollars and they're gonna teach you
front-end full stack or full stack
development it's a great way for you to
get started do you have to go to boot
camp no of course not just like you
don't have to go to college just but it
is something to be said that you will
have resources with a clearly defined
learning path as well as help to teach
you what you need to know to be commonly
working dev what if
hard to comprehend is that I can go from
knowing nothing to getting a $60,000 job
in under 12 months is that a real deal
are they pulling my plunker it's plunker
a word that you guys say over there in
your home no I mean it's a real deal man
I mean if you were to look at my my
salary I went from a pizza delivery
driver to nowhere you look this is let's
let's say within three years I went from
delivering pizzas to a $75,000 plus
bonus plus multiple weeks of vacation
salary with a career that is just going
to continue to grow in terms of all that
do you think one should learn JavaScript
before jQuery yes every day so I mean
it's just one of those things where it
sounds kind of crazy right because like
you go from making $8 an hour in my case
if you were to talk about what I made
hourly not counting tips as I was a
student in school I was making $8 an
hour like $8.25 an hour and you were to
compare it to where I am now I make
around if yet if you don't count bonuses
and and you don't count paid vacation or
any of that just straight up money I
make $36 an hour or something like that
so you start thinking about that and
you're like it's kind of crazy you're
like you more than four like four and a
half times here or around four and a
half times your increased income so it
sounds crass Script crazy and it sounds
intimidating right like damn man who's
gonna pay me that much money and
it turns out a lot of people so when you
when you start thinking about it is you
you have to have the skills you have to
be able to do all that but yeah first
job is always front end that's like
you've seen at least four no degree jobs
I think front end is a great entry point
which is why you see that whether it's
the first job always just probably not
the case
I mean my first job is full-stack jQuery
is jQuery necessary I think jQuery is
not necessary I think is a supplemental
skill but that's my personal opinion now
I do think in terms of front-end
development react or angular is
necessary what I think about a complete
education in computer science is the
online resources I think a complete
education and software development is it
much better if you actually want to be
considered a computer scientist you need
to go get a degree how should i chart
how much should I charge hourly for my
work as freelance web developer I don't
know I've used to charge $20 but that
was pretty low by most people's
standards now I charge 90 I've been a
chef for 20 years it took years and
years to work after a head chef for
making me earning maybe 20 I'm here I
can walk in job three times as much in
under a year it's a different skill set
I mean honestly that's just the truth of
the matter it's no disrespect to chefs
there's plenty of people who want to be
chefs and there's plenty of of
organizations that that there's plenty
of people that don't value the skills of
chef's half as well and that's just
that's just the nature of that industry
it's the u.s. overpaying for devs or
other countries under pain how to say
other countries are under paint which is
why you see a lot of devs leave the
underpaying countries and come work in
the companies here and also there's a
lot of competition for developers right
so if you're working in Seattle New York
or or San Francisco or something like
that they're trying to still devs left
and right so
I'm 42 and strutting again any tips code
everyday for three hours till you get a
job that's the number one tip right
there all right guys I have to I have to
end this livestream it's been it's been
a pleasure I have thoroughly thoroughly
thoroughly enjoyed myself and I hope
that I have been able to provide you
with some value as always thank you so
much for watching if you're not already
subscribed might I suggest you please do
it it is greatly appreciated like one of
my other goals someone asked me what my
goal is my goal is also by the end of
2018 I want to hit that hunger K I want
this silver play button up over my
shoulder I want to I want to have that I
want I want to have that on the mantle
alright guys and I need your help with
that so if you want if you like my
content and you want the channel to
succeed please share the videos please
like the videos please comment on the
videos and share your opinions whether
you think I'm right or wrong
oftentimes I think it's educational for
me and everyone else sometimes people
just come to videos watch the continents
so I appreciate you all thank you so
much and if you want to support me you
can we have my course links in the
description we also have the bro do you
even code shirt in the description where
you can get yourself a shirt a mug a
phone case or a sticker and I think
probably a sweatshirt as well so thank
you so much guys I'll see you next time
have a wonderful weekend bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
