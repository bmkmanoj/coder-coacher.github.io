doing the basic algorithm scripting the
bonfire section repeat a string repeat a
string so essentially what this quick
bonfire wants to be is they want us to
take our string take in a number and if
it's ABC it comes back ABC ABC ABC and
turns out that if you've been doing then
if you've done the previous bonfires
this this should kind of be a easy task
so the way I do it is I set up a empty
array because we want to return a we
want to return a string so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to push the
erase every time that we do it so create
an empty array fill it with strings
depending on how many times on the
number and then we will then change the
array of strings into a string and
return that string so we create our
empty array here we create a variable a
a counter variable just called I so Y is
less than our number so Y is less than
the number increment I by one and then
in here all we're gonna do is take our
array and we're just gonna dot push it
push STR push the string onto it so when
you push to an array it adds it to the
empty right so the first one will go to
the zero index the second one will go to
the the first index and the third won't
go go to the second index so well we
need to return a string and on an array
so if we let's go ahead and convert our
holder array and then we want to say dot
join and we want to join it each one of
these on with no characters so if we
were to return to space just so you
could see it
when we return it it's gonna space ABC
ABC ABC but that's not correct so let's
go ahead and return them this should be
everything we needed to do so you can
see right here returns ABC ABC ABC so
let's go ahead and just put some
comments in here to kind of because I
know we go by go through these things
pretty quickly so in the holder array we
create an empty array to store the
strings here we just add strings based
on how many times requested turn array
strings into a single string and that's
it so crazy empty array have a for loop
that runs as many times as the number
ammeter and then just push it into the
array and then turn it back into a
single string so that's what a repeater
string repeat of string and there as
always there's probably a couple
different ways we can do this this may
not even be the best way but for me this
was the quickest so thanks for watching
the video don't forget to thumbs up it
and subscribe and leave me a comment if
anything I said was a little confusing
or you have a better way of solving this
so I'll see you guys in the next video
thanks for watching the video don't
forget to Like and subscribe that helps
me out a ton and I appreciate all the
comments that I get and all the
questions I get in the comments and I'm
happy to answer them so keep them coming
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
