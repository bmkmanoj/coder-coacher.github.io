specifically in Python lists and
dictionaries lists and dictionaries if I
remember correctly it's going to be
using an ArrayList and other sorts the
list so I'll be resetting the code as we
go
so let's do animal has three items check
them out on line one
go ahead and add a fourth just enter the
name of the string of animal a stream so
we're just gonna add another animal to
our array and since I now have three
cats why don't we do cat not that
there's any house cats at the zoo though
but a write statement that prints
Dussault adding the second the fourth
items of the list alright so just a
reminder ArrayList start at zero so the
second item would be the first index so
we want to print the numbers one plus
and the fourth item which is number
three
there we go
and the numbers 1 &amp;amp; 3 this is actually
adding together probably because we're
not declaring it a string yeah so write
an assignment statement that will
replace item that currently holds the
value of Tigers so what we want to do
here is say tiger is the third index
value so we're zoo animals similar the
hyena actually identical to the hyena
is equal to and again we'll just do cat
because it's a tiger general cat so
we're just overriding the third index
value so they know it's now cut all
right on lines 5 6 &amp;amp; 7 append 3 more
items to the suitcase list so suitcase
dot append and append is basically just
adds on a new value to the end bliss so
there's three three values they'd be the
fourth one so a suitcase out of pen and
we are going to put shorts we'll just
copy this three items right and shorts
shirts and panties panties I done
listening it's equal to length of the
suitcase so this length is equal to so
apparently the suitcase is four there's
probably a method to call it yeah Linda
listening okay so they wants us to do
like this line so we're calling the Len
method just a better way to do it
because our suitcase length may actually
change as we append new items to it so
there are items
all right on line four create a list
called middle containing only two middle
items from the case so all right about
that guys I had a quick phone call that
came in let's see all right so online
for create a list containing only the
two middle items from the suitcase so
the first and second items they're on
one so this starts here and ends right
before that not including it so what we
want to do is we want to start on the
third item which is the second index
value and go up to five and because we
don't want then for this one the last
two items we want so one two three four
five all right there's six items so just
six and then we'll start at five or at
four rather four to six I think that's
right
looks like your middle slice
all right so let's look at one two three
oh so his passport laptop student said
passport laptop so we actually need to
go to two for because when you want two
and three but not four and then we want
for the last slice fourth and fifth
index four and five all right here in
here so we need to go six and I'll get
four and five so now we're good all
right
so dog sign the dog slice of animals
from index three up and tell but not
including index six so we need to get
we're gonna break up this string and we
need the fourth through the six
characters so if you're over four to
seven so at four five six this dog and
we also want from the seventh character
to the end animals and what you want to
start at seven pulling and I should go
to the end got a GF instead of dog so
one two three so we start oh these are
index with variables so make sure you do
this correctly draw instead of four out
well I did the same thing here there you
go
so count amiss index variables not
numbers like I did
alright so use the dot index item
function to find the value of duck all
right so let's see here how do they use
it so we're gonna say animals dot index
and then we're going to search for the
string duck
and then what else doesn't want to
co-sign the result variable called
ducking next then dot insert the string
Cobra at that index and then we'll say
duck underscore index equals animals dot
assign the result to a variable called
duck index all right
all right and then we're gonna say
animals dot insert and then we want to
put duck underscore index comma and then
the value of Cobra and I believe that's
what they wanted think I'm gonna clean
that correctly first off Cobra and let's
go ahead and fix that there we go so we
have Cobra now
all right so write a statement indented
for loop that prevents that prints a
number equal to two times that number
for every list item for the number in my
list print my list my underscore list so
you want to print the list of the
current index value times two
I should be it okay good looks but off
checks in if you need help is not
defined okay so my mistake there we go
what list index out of
we don't know here for number in my list
print my list
for variable endless name list index out
of range so let's see here let's look at
the hint
alright I'm not sure what's going on
here because when we do a for loop with
the my list it should automatically stop
before it gets out of range so that's
this is a 2:14 let's take a look real
quick see what's going on here
I was looking at the what was the name
of it it was Python for one and for one
and all
okay so apparently we can just call the
numbers because it's already parsing it
so we don't actually need it's saying
for the value in this instead of for int
I so this should work just fine okay
that makes sense our sing this was like
an a random I was thinking more of a int
I and then it's a random number but the
number is actually a value in the array
so just remember that the for loop when
you do like this it already has a number
in the array that's how I have to think
of it alright so we're gonna write a for
loop and we're gonna say that iterates
over start list for I and start
underscore list
what do we want it to do pen each number
squared to square this
and we will say square and there's
underscore list dot append and then we
are going to put I and we want to square
it and then sort square list all right
do they tell us how sorry note this
checked let's see if we we probably we
probably could just do this one time so
there you go so it sorts it so one is 1
2 is 4 3 is 9 4 16 and 5 so 95 cool
alright so print the value stored under
the sloth and Burmese python keys all
right so we are basically just gonna do
it like this so print presidents
and then these are basically think of
them it's like accounts and passwords so
the password in this case is going to be
sloth and it'll give us it'll give us
our number value our account I guess or
if you don't think of it that way like
doors and keys is kind of how I think of
it and I should be good so we get we get
puffin 104 105 106 all right and at
least three more key value pairs to the
menu variable so chicken alfredo is 1450
so I guess we can go with the the menu
theme and so we're gonna say menu and we
want to what do we want mac and cheese
sounds good and we're gonna set that
equal to 999 and then we're gonna say
menu
how about fries and we'll get those are
a little bit cheaper so we'll do $4.99
appetizer and then we'll do menu and how
about some dessert Sunday okay so Sunday
I think I say you stole Sunday I'm gonna
do that $6.99 it's a nice Sunday and
should be good to go so there are our
keys and then our value all right so
delete sloth and mangled items from zoo
animals using Dell so we want to delete
the items from Zoo underscore animals
and the key name
so it's sloth and then delete again from
zoo animals via the key name and that is
Bengal tiger
and that's the value associated with
rock hipper penguin to anything but
Arctic exhibit and then we're going to
say zoo animals and then for rock hopper
is it rock yeah Rockhopper penguin and
I'm gonna set this to a new value and
that should be good so we have you see
our new value there and we deleted two
as well now we just want to remove
dagger from the list items stored in
backpack so let's see how they they want
to see use remove item so backpack dot
remove dagger so a couple different ways
to change things and in the arrays and
the keys and the values and all this or
stuff so all right let's add a key give
it inventory
so let's add a key called pocket and
pockets gonna have a value of c-shell
it's also gonna have a value of strange
berry so we're kind of just using an
array list with an ArrayList you'd agree
if you want to look at it like that
that's kind of how I think of it
Lindt alright so we've added this new
pocket with items and we want to sort
the items list under backpack key
so this is how they sort right here so
you do the same thing we're gonna say
look for our new pocket item we need you
to sort that one holy dot sort so
there's that and then remove dagger from
the list items store it in the backpack
key and then we'll say inventory back
pack and they'll say dot remove dagger
it's probably case sensitive so make
sure and then add 50 to the number
stored under the gold key and I'll say
inventory gold equals let's see if we
can do it like this I'm not sure we can
inventory
gold plus 50 I think I might just have
to rewrite it well let's see what's
going on here did you remember to sort
the list inventory your backpack Oh was
it backpack very so so sorry
there we go so apparently we can do it
like that you could also just rewrite it
to 550 in itself this is probably the
better way to do it so that you don't so
if you make any changes later on you
don't have to go back and edit your code
so pythons lists and dictionaries
something to mess around with let's see
what we're doing next it's called a day
at the supermarket it looks like we'll
be using some more for loops and lists
and dictionaries and all that sort of
stuff so I'll see you guys the next
python video and if I remember correctly
we are all caught up yeah so I'm back to
where I was before I started this course
for my Python class so we're gonna get
back into it we're about a third of the
way through and at the end of it we're
gonna start making our PI Python game
using PI game so I'll see you guys next
