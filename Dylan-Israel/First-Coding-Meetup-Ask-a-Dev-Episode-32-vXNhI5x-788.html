Meetup
about a week ago and I was going through
some of my old footage I never released
for a video I'm gonna be putting out
that it's like that didn't make the
cut but here it is sort of thing and I
came across a clip talking about my
first coding meetup that I was ever
about to go to I've never gone to one
before I didn't even know they were a
thing so I hope you guys enjoy it little
an old clip from like three years ago
and a recent clip about April's first
coding meetup should be fun stuff I
guess I'm headed to a code and coffee
meet-up what if that is apparently I was
so sometimes I do lift like on my way to
school I just turn the lift app on it'll
make like thirty to fifty bucks just on
my way to school so I'll leave an hour
early or so and you know in two hours
three hours sometimes it's just uh you
know if it's busy busy but yeah so I met
this guy David who works at a web design
firm slushed
it's like a go to tech shop for
everything they do Android they do i/o
students they do websites they do every
in any sort of program any customization
that's this company to does but he told
me about this code and coffee it's
basically a once a week or bi-weekly
event where a weekly get-together for
programmers of all ages skill levels and
interests so it's like a programmer
meetup so I'm excited to go I think
would be fun but I also think it would
be a good a good potential business sort
of oh oh oh so this opening is open at
your new workplace thank you yeah let me
let me go in there and take care of that
and see if I can know your job yeah just
wanted to record something on that
I remember we just got done with our
your first coding meetup we went to a
es6 talk what you think it was great I
didn't understand a lot because a lot of
it was something that I'm not there yet
but the guy that was definitely
preventing even though it wasn't his
area of expertise he was still able to
you know get everything across and even
though I didn't understand like the
lingo of it he was able to describe it
so well that I can actually follow along
so it was good
I enjoyed it good yeah that's just a
reminder that and we're all busy but uh
you know I just got at work and April
came down and we went and saw our and I
went to the the coding meetup to try and
factor into your life it's a great
opportunity to network it's also a great
opportunity to learn I learned more
about the ESS than I did watching an
hour-long video kind of breaking it down
and gonna try and make that extra leap
to always using the latest technologies
to kind of showcase a little bit of your
drive to learn and be a better developer
you go to school this is kind of like
taking because they're free and there's
also usually beer and food I had a beer
my first beer in like six months but I
had one I was really surprised you had a
hero like really yeah okay
I usually sneak up here when it's free
what yeah I was interested I only go the
ones that I'm interested in so hey guys
make sure to go the meetups hackathons
and if you're not sure where to find
them you can find a lot at meetup calm
and a bit fright as well and just try
and go as much as you can we're going to
be going to a lot more now that April's
on the path see young the young Jedi
over here trying to learn
hey guys thanks for watching the video
