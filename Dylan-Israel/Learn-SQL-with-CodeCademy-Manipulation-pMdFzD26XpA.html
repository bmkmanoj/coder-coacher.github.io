I told you that it was in beta
it looks like it's complete why you
might want to learn SQL
well everything web related uses a
database and you have to tie in your
code a lot of times with databases and
if you have no experience this is a
great way to just kind of dive into it
and learn how to do that so let's just
go ahead and get started we're in
manipulation manipulation so queries are
kind of like where you take you like
look from my data I want this and I want
to know what it means
so just keep that in mind when we use
queries from contacts all any press run
so this asterisk means selects all and
you can see our query results right here
this is our primary ID we have a name
person one and a birthday for each one
of these people so ID name birthday and
your text date not too bad let's just
continue on here so now you can
understand me let's create a new table
tables are kind of what store your data
I suppose so we're gonna say I the ideas
integer and I believe it's case
sensitive so my name is Tex and the page
is in check so this looks if I had to go
off of it this is the name of the column
followed by the column type so integer
text integer
all right so insert into and I celebs
alright so now we want to edit our ID
name and age and we're gonna say the
values are one Justin Bieber
I guess so many celebrities and you
choose I 121 so ideas one the name is
Justin Bieber and the ages 21 so now
we're out of that now let's see if we
want to make sure that it got added as I
select from celebs and oh we need to run
it and bam so there's our new table with
our new result
alright so let's add three more celebs
to the table let's see if they'll let us
do this
so set typing all out you can also copy
and paste it and then let's run it this
should have added the three celebs now
say we just want to select a row or
column we want in this case just the
name from our celebs table now we run it
we're gonna do it just a name which is
Justin Bieber Beyonce Knowles
Jeremy Lin and Taylor Swift I don't know
who Jeremy Lin is I think he's a
basketball player BAM
alright so we want to update our celebs
now we want to set age equal to 22 I
notice there's no semicolon after these
where the idea is equal to one so we're
saying for the first person we're gonna
set that and now we want to select all
the columns from our celebs table and
running in now we should have for this
Justin Bieber is now 22 so
because sittings id-1 let's add a new
column to the table in text editor type
alter table
alright so alter table alter the table
celebs add a new column called Twitter
underscore handle of the text type so
now it should still be empty but we
should have for as many IDs of empty
Twitter handles cuz we haven't had them
yet but the row should be there so when
we run it see empty Twitter handles not
too bad I kind of think of sequel has a
excel sheet that you're messing with
except it's a database so if that helps
you just think of it as a complex excel
sheet alright so now we want to update
Taylor Swift Twitter handles so we want
to update celebs our celebs table we're
gonna no semicolon we want to set
Twitter underscore handle equal to and
let's let's double check I believe the
double quotes is fine too at Taylor
Swift 13 and then we want to do that
where ID is equal to 4 and a better way
to do this in my opinion is cuz you're
not gonna remember that Taylor source ID
is for you but you might remember that
the name is Taylor Swift so it creates a
few more problems because you may have
to do case sensitive it may be case
sensitive
but uh for me that's just one way you
can also go down selecting a row so
let's go ahead and run this and once we
do that our Twitter handle for Taylor
Swift is there and now it we want to
delete from our select say will aware
and again we can drop this down
so we're going to do where Twitter
underscore handle is null and
so when you're in it so it looks like it
worked
let's move on so in this lesson we
learned SQL statement so it's true so it
looks like this is just a review but
we've learned how to create edit delete
data from SQL so just a reminder oh we
learned our lesson completed
manipulation so that's pretty quick
we're already 25% of the way through a
three hour lesson in about seven minutes
so definitely take a time to look back
maybe make your own chart about how to
use SQL and in the next video I will see
you and we continue on using SQL
hopefully it goes in a little more
in-depth but again great thing great
resources to have I just had an
interview where they asked me about my
database knowledge and I wish I'd taken
this course because it's very limited
for me so I'm same thing and I recommend
being very familiar with it I'll see you
guys next video don't forget to comment
