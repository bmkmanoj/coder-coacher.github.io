also in the description below alright
guys today where we talk about es6 I did
a couple of courses and did a little bit
of research watch some videos I kind of
picked out what I thought was most
important and what I and kind of got rid
of some of the other stuff kind of the
practical stuff they actually use as a
JavaScript developer one of the new
things with es6 is the Const and let
variables to talk about what that is way
that variables work for instance a lot
of our example one here I'll set this
equal to Dylan the way that variables
work is it works on what's called the
function scope versus the block scope
that's really the main difference now
what does that mean to someone who's not
super super not knowledgeable at
JavaScript it means that if we have a
function we'll call it a test where
within here we have our variable example
one that we're going to pass into here
if we go ahead and do if true just a
simple if statement and we say of our
example one is equal to my last name
instead of my first when we call so log
it out here this will actually a couple
log your example one it's going to
output example example one here it's
going to output Israel now if we do the
same thing within the block scope you'll
go ahead and see that it's going to be
let's go ahead and do this and we'll see
our console here know oh we have to call
it excuse me let's go ahead and just
call our function real quick save it and
you'll see that it's putting out Israel
and Israel both times now this is an
exact this isn't how you may think this
would work but what's happening is
because this deals on the function level
it's assuming that these are
the same variable plus it's assigning it
when in reality what we want to do is
just output this here in this scope and
that would be block scope variables var
deals with the function scope meaning
everything within your function bracket
can be reset that has the same name now
if we change this to let and this delet
you'll see right here what's happening
is now it puts Israel which is the first
console log and then Dylan the reason
for this is that deals with let's deal
with the block scope and what that
basically means is it deals with the
most inward brackets here or the the
brackets that are so if we have an if
statement the leg that takes place
within there is where it kind of gets
its scope that's the main difference now
you can switch all your console all your
variables and all your let's over you
can switch all your varsa let's if you
want and that seems to kind of be the
general flow going forward now what what
we talked about let and we talked about
far and that's really all there is to it
for those two but what is it well with
this cost so conce will go ahead and
will give up our example one one more
time will set it equal to Dylan now what
happens if we clear this and then we
console got log out example one this is
obviously going to put out Dylan like so
now what happens if we want to go ahead
and reset example one to my last name
what you'll see that we're getting an
air the reason for this is you're not
you can't is read-only
this is kind of the quick way of seeing
this you can't read you can't really
reset Const constant variables now there
is a caveat to this so for instance I
can't reset this to five or any any
other thing however if our example here
was let's say an object this works also
for a race but let's say we have an
object called name and we'll go ahead
and set it to Dylan and instead of
actually outputting an example one
example
one name so I guess we could output the
object as well what's up with the object
so you'll see right now we we're getting
the entire the object is there but let's
say we just wanted to change a single
key value pair within the constants
variable we could do that that we can do
and we'll do an example one name and
we'll set this equal to Israel like so
I'm just going to save it and you'll see
now our object comes out with my last
name now like I said we could also do
this with objects or or with arrays
rather because the Rays are really just
an object at the end of day but let's
say we have one two and three okay let's
say that we actually wanted to do
example one zero we're going to go ahead
and set that to the zero say that you
could do that you can also add things to
the array as well so maybe we do example
1 index 3 and that's equal to 1 so we
should get 0 2 3 1 now that's really all
you have to know about VAR Const and let
consc it kind of gives you the idea that
yeah you can't change it unless it's an
array or a object you can change certain
properties of it but like let's let's
say we wanted to reset the whole item to
Dylan this we would not be able to do we
can we can mutate the array or mutate
the object and change the values in them
but we can't just change the entire data
structure and we can't change the on
these more primitive data types it we
can't change those values of well for
instance we can't change our string to
another extreme well that's all we need
to know about consulate and comp and bar
