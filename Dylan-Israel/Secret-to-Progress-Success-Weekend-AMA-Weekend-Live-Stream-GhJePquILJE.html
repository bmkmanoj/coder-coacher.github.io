6:06 p.m. I have a very busy day
tomorrow it is Friday I just got off
work took a shower had a bite to eat hop
straight on to make sure I did my
weekend AMA for those who are new every
week weekend Friday or Saturday
sometimes Sunday we do a weekend
livestream where I start off with the
question and then for about 45 minutes
of the hour if not more I will be
answering your questions sort of provide
some feedback some some support some
mentoring whatever I can do I know a lot
of you have questions you're getting
started what is this good ideas this bad
idea and I will answer them to the best
of my ability so today we have a very
clickbait tea topic hi normally I try to
phrase it more as a question so doing
this clickbait topic but it is what is
the secret to success and progress which
is what I think is really important
there and have I been hitting the gym I
have a little bit but uh yes so my
personal secret to success in your
career it's pretty straightforward
it's hard work in the sense of
consistency consistency is your greatest
ally it is also everyone's greatest
weakness at times what I mean by
consistency every every day I take one
to three hours on a weekday and one to
12 hours depending on the weekend I
usually close every three to three to
eight hours on the on a Saturday or
Sunday and I I work towards a goal Tork
for me I work towards progressing my
career in one way or another and that
consistency of sticking to a schedule
where every morning I wake up I put
about an hour in getting off work I put
about an hour in and on the weekends it
varies based on what I got going on
but I put time in consistently to move
forward and the the key to success is to
outside of your day job have something
that's moving you forward
there's a lot of different things that
could be that could go to the
traditional route of hey I'm gonna go
get my master's online that could be the
the less conventional route of I'm gonna
build a personal brand I could I'm gonna
build a course I'm gonna read a book but
that consistency of every single day for
the most part moving forward and never
falling out of it I have consistently -
two or three days where I had the flu or
I went on vacation or something like
that
have done something that has progressed
my career in one way or another and
you'd be surprised how the little things
can add up you know and and how you can
this sort of minor little blimps that
just get you a quarter of an inch closer
quarter of an inch closer all that adds
up as you're progressing you become a
much more well-rounded developer much
more well-rounded individual and it will
lead to it will lead you to the path to
success and it's it's one of things
where it's a long-term thing to get to
where you want to go all these channels
to tell you that you're going to become
a developer in two months and it's just
click late they saw oh this one video
this one video saw you know and it takes
out like developer or intern you know
there's a difference between getting a
developer job for $10 an hour for one
for 30-plus dollars an hour and so on
and so forth and the thing you have to
know is even if you're lucky enough to
be one of those few that learn to code
in 60 days right where do you go from
there and that consistency is what's
going to carry you through long term and
that hard work because it's it's easy to
work hard but how hard and for how long
right so we all can we all have the
ability to work hard some of us only
have the ability to work hard for one
day at a time if you can work hard every
day put one two three hours a day
towards yourself towards your career you
will go so much farther so much quicker
than you can even imagine so that's
that's today's topic about how to be
successful in anything really is to take
one
three hours a day outside of your normal
job and and go from go from there
hitting the gym I've been so I've been
doing perfect pushup and attempting to
do perfect pull up your boys so out of
shape this is the first time in my life
I can't complete a pull-up it's
disgusting
so I'm started for those of you a little
bit about what's going on with me in my
life I finally gotten serious about
getting back into the gym by getting
back into shape rather I'm not in the
gym quite yet so I'm sticking to the
perfect push-up plan and I'm trying to
hit on the perfect fault I just can't do
a pull-up that's the truth amout it's
really it's really depressing first time
in my life I've been so out of shape so
I am trying to get back in shape in the
mornings we are juicing fruit and
vegetables every morning this kind of a
breakfast kind of get off the the fatty
stuff the carbs in the morning and try
to have that I've been lowering my
caffeine intake all this earth stuff so
I am trying to get better and go from
there it is 4/20 happy Illuminati day
all that sort of stuff finishing a web
design course in college planning and
learning more HTML CSS and JavaScript to
summer shelling reactor angular I would
say look at your market but reactions be
sort of the hot technology right now who
do you think an engineer truths new
course title o Fisto
well ty Lopez lied about his credentials
the course he's promoting here for
people who are actually successful
without just sort of lying about and
faking it so it's a little bit a little
bit different in my opinion I'm certain
I'm not good enough at solving problems
how would you know whether you would
need to give up on development go to
another field well Mr D Mac o 9 as
someone who has felt several technical
interviews I have failed a technical
interview with Amazon I failed a
technical interview with many companies
I can tell you that it is not something
that you're always going to be naturally
gifted at it is something that you can
work on and get better and I have gotten
better myself by practicing on sites
like Co
fights calm is one I used no sponsorship
or anything but code fights if you did
want to send me some money it would be
appreciated
no but seriously practicing and and it
is it is a it is a hard task to solve
algorithms technical interviews are a
very hard thing but it is something you
get better at
I'm currently I know that this is being
a non-traditional student being someone
who even though I studied some of these
things in college I've forgotten it at
all to study the sort of algorithms that
you should be working for to know all
that sort of stuff
it is one of those aspects of life that
even if you've gone through that
traditional si s program you need to
consistently be learning and that's what
I'm doing right now is I'm trying to
fill the holes and the gaps of my
knowledge I just got done reading simple
programmers book the complete software
developers career guide and now I'm
reading currently I'm about eight or
nine chapters in to cracking the code
cracking the coding interview which I'll
do a book review and probably some
topics based off of that book and trying
to fill in those voids so that I can get
better at solving problems so I can get
better at solving algorithms so I can
understand these concepts that are a
little bit more abstract to my own
skillset and stuff that I don't
potentially grasp all that well that I
don't use on a daily basis but I
understand the reality of life is that
if I do want to work at a Google I do
want to work at a Facebook and Amazon
wherever you know big well pain you know
giant company and get that on the resume
I need to have these skills and so the
same could be said for you that you may
need to just work at it not everything's
going to come easy in life and a lot of
this stuff for me doesn't you know none
of us came out the womb saying you know
what I understand problem solving I
understand how to solve algorithms I I
you know I was boring and typescript was
in my blood doesn't work like that
sometimes you have to work hard at these
things and if you work consistently
you'll do you'll do much much better
I'm sure my first web developer Monday
working as a front-end developer for a
fortune 500 company I've been watching
your videos since I started from your
free code camp tutorials to now thanks
you're welcome and congratulations for
your friend and web developer job it's
hard to get a job at those big companies
believe it or not
final boss says thanks for all the work
you do your work ethic has inspired me
to do just the same thank you man it is
it is hard to be consistent and to
progress every day is a challenge
because you're essentially challenging
yourself to change the way that you live
your life which is a hard task to ask
right I almost look at it like having
children when you have children your
life changes and when you you when you
want to become a developer you need to
take the mindset that if you want to not
only give job but progressing your
career and be the best in your career I
don't have any aspirations of just
having a job I have aspirations of being
a developer that people know by name and
that's not like a narcissism thing that
is a I want to I want to motivate people
and I want to get better myself and and
help people stay on the path right the
the learn to code path then and that and
to do that I need to build a brand to
accomplish the things that I want and so
in order to give myself validity so that
not only can I give advice here with
people of watching Oh several hundred
videos that I can go out there and get
people to stay on the straight in there
the stay on the path and be successful
in a traditional way as this as well as
a non-traditional way because the thing
that keeps people on the path is finding
out how to keep something fun how to
keep something refreshing and how to
keep him happy and finding a way to
enjoy so do I have a brother named Eric
I do not I do have a brother but he has
no programming skills and he doesn't he
looks more like my mother I look more
like my father
start up a big company defensively what
what stage at your career I I like them
both thanks man I was watching some
something you did yesterday on code
fight sighs thing could I ever come up
with that on my own I sure hope one day
I can I'm sure you can
Mr D Mac it takes time and the code
fights algorithms they're hard for me I
have failed many algorithms and I failed
on my I have companies that you know I
got hit with a binary search tree
algorithm I haven't touched binary
search trees in forever and it's awkward
you know I bombed the interview a while
back so it happens all the time and so
the only thing you can do is keep moving
forward keep progressing keep getting
better and better right so and uh you
know it's you never know what
opportunities may come along because
you're doing this sort of stuff you know
like recently I I got paid to do a
course for scrim ba scrim accom which is
an excellent site if you want to check
out the JavaScript course I built for
them it's an introduction in JavaScript
course it is go it is it was a fun thing
to make but that opportunity came along
which not only looks good on the resume
because now I'm building content and
getting paid for it and you know having
contract work and things like that but
I'm also having that I owe a bill of
course and I'm making a little bit money
these things only come along because of
the consistency of everything and moving
forward with it so you never know what
sort of opportunities may open up but
what I can guarantee is that if you want
to be if you want to be the guy that if
you if you want to be understand what it
takes to become what you want to be I
guess that's what it what I'm trying to
say I want opportunities like that to
come my way and to potentially work out
because because I understand and I I
work hard so that those
our realities their injustice fantasy
pipe dream they are something I'm
working towards to accomplish it so
whatever it is you're working towards is
uh it is uh you need you need to
understand what it takes to get there
not just talk a goal without a plan to
achieve it is nothing but talk so
whatever your goal is come up with a way
to accomplish that Robert are enjoying
the videos keep up the good work thank
you with ten dollar donation I
appreciate that man I have I have two so
my schedule right now for the channel
for those you haven't noticed is on
Monday I release the video and on
Wednesday I release the video and then
on the weekend I do a livestream I am I
am considering doing more videos in the
future I'm kind of I got I got a lot on
the plate right now so doing more than
more than two videos in one live stream
a week might be a little bit much and
it's also the pace that has been allowed
me to continue on with what I'm doing so
I I'm always trying to come the one
thing I don't want to do on my channel
the one thing the one thing I I don't
want to do is repeat videos there's a
lot of videos I see on people's channel
that are clickbait II that are and they
get and and it's it's kinda it's kind of
unfortunate because they get more fit
they get more views than I do but views
aren't everything right I'm trying to
not only have entertaining videos but
also have diverse videos so when I have
videos on the channel I do my best to
make sure that is a new topic that we
haven't discussed on the channel to the
best of my ability so I appreciate that
you enjoyed the videos some videos do
better than others and I know I know
what those are typically when I post
some like I did a video on scope creep I
was in it's a you know a little
technical sort of video not something I
think everyone was gonna watch but if I
do a video about how to become a good
self-taught developer which is something
I haven't done before I know that's
gonna get a lot more a lot more views so
you know I I try I try my best to keep
it fun keep it different
God knows we're probably all sick of
watching the same ten videos and with
five different titles and thumbnails
you're gonna be that mystical unicorn
super programmer I'm trying man yeah I
appreciate that JavaScript love ya John
I I don't watch everyone at John's
videos I watch a few here or there but
John's an interesting place mentally I
don't know I watched one video of his
about what it's like to be like a public
personality and he seemed very depressed
and uh and it was uh there's one of
those things where I I sort of related a
bit too so John is I I relate a little
bit to John in the sense of he has a lot
of the characteristics of the man I want
to grow to be right I don't want to
necessarily be John right
but John understands what it takes to be
successful and I respect that about him
and his work ethic and that's one of the
things I talk about like having positive
role models and native role models so
when he's what John's really going
through right now in my opinion my mind
you have I'm basing this off one YouTube
video so I'm not a psychologist for the
record in case you're wondering but he's
uh he's going through something in life
where I think he's finally getting burnt
out and I under
you don't want to stop working but you
need something else and I think John's
trying to find out what that something
else is right now so I hope he finds it
that that's sort of my two cents as
crazy as that sounds last
ask you about different interviewing for
an internship I got the internship damn
man sounds like I gave you some good
tips any tips to succeed in it
absolutely so my number one my number
one my number one tip is to prepare
outside of work and before the interview
so if you dare before the internship so
if you know you should have an idea of
what technologies you'll be working in
you should already be studying up on
those so that you can hit the ground
running and when you leave work it is up
to you to continue studying outside of
it you need to consider this your
full-time gig
inside and outside of work and once
you're up and running you need to not
only understand what's there but feel
free to voice an opinion after about a
month
it's how I would say it feel free to
speak up that I say a month so it gives
you an idea to to get a feel for things
and understand how their processes are
done so you can speak to it so when you
do give your opinion when you do have
some valuable input you're not going to
be speaking out your ass but feel free
to speak up voice your opinion and
honestly ask your boss directly how you
can succeed at it the thing about the
thing about bosses they want you to
succeed nine times out of ten unless
you're dealing with some some someone
who has the chip on their shoulder nine
times out of ten they want you to
succeed because you succeeding is they
are succeeding as well so ask your boss
directly I say hey what can I do to
succeed as in this internship I have a I
have a one-on-one with my boss every
single week it's about 15 minutes and we
talk about you know what's frustrating
me how I can succeed what I can do for
him what he can do for me have that
conversation with your boss on a daily
basis maybe you don't need to make an
official thing but I received on a
weekly basis but have that conversation
because instead of you trying to figure
out there's basic stuff we can do about
like continue continuing to grow as a
developer and being comfortable with
their stack that's an obvious one that's
one that you should
probably already know but every company
is different and be willing to take
constructive criticism and say you know
for the he may come back with you on
week one a week to say you know what we
just want you to get it comfortable this
and that don't be afraid to dive in a
lot of times when you're taking on new
responsibilities like this especially is
that you probably your first internship
it is one of those opportunities where
people oftentimes are so afraid to get
break stuff don't be afraid to break
stuff you know be okay going balls deep
in the code so that that's my advice to
you about starting an internship and how
to succeed at it it's me it says I've
been knocking
one chapter did in Coke Adam I'm
actually learning slowly yeah I mean so
even if even if that's your pace that
you're going out right that consistency
of working at it everyday and you'll
pick up the pace as you move forward you
may say one chapter a day and start
getting bored and like god I can do so
much more let's keep it going
and continue moving forward
so Kevin Cho says there's no such thing
as a super program or a great program
only as one has more experience and
exposure and programming field if you
disagree with this you're just an ass
yeah I mean there there are better
developers than other developers but
there's the main difference there
there's a lot of differences with
developers there's those who are
continuing to learn and then those are
who are content and being that content
can can really hurt you long term do you
think you could get an interview with
one of one of your co-workers or your
boss of them explaining how they got
they got to where they were I could ask
what I ever start my own company yes
if I was financially independent meaning
that I could make it I could pay a
mortgage and live in okay life based off
of the the passive income streams I have
I would I would definitely start a
business and work for full time about it
did I ever watch tech lead no I did not
you recently took down all this video so
I wonder why I find the harder in life
you work that work the more you practice
the luckier you get yeah the luckier
right trifer flexbox or css great lately
I so I've been using bootstraps Concord
system I believe in that in the
background it it uses flex Foss so but I
I'm not I'm not to this is Grace oh I'm
not too familiar with either I plan on
getting better with one or the other
depending on where I'm probably going
discontinuing using bootstrap for future
videos and things like that
um hey man how are you doing love your
channel Thank You Man
when the job's done interviewing for
wants me to be good at SAS what are your
thoughts on SAS because I think it's

SAS is nothing more than
one of those items where s is one of
those items where it's not super
important but you could probably learn
the basics of it in afternoon so I
wouldn't worry too much about it if you
did watch tech leave what's your opinion
thoughts about YouTube potentially being
negative to a programmers career I think
anything where you throw your throw
yourself out in the in the public eye
could be detrimental so one thing that I
do is I watch every video I put out both
every video I'm going to put out i watch
one time before i put it out the reason
for that is it can vary much so affect
your if so if you're talking about the
workplace in a negative light if you're
talking about problems if you're talking
about issues you're breaking a bit of
trust right so I'll give an excellent
example I did a video about scope creep
if you watch the video about scope creep
I did a very professional video
explaining my site of the point of a
business analyst and a project manager
how scope creep comes to exist and and
why it exists but that video came the
thought process for it came out of
frustration at my workplace what that
video wasn't about was it wasn't about
the frustration in the workplace it
wasn't about about certain people it
wasn't whiney it was in a sort of
insightful video about scope creep which
is a common part of software development
but it is completely possible that if
you don't if you don't here's the thing
here's the thing when I when I am
now I'm looking at the camera because
this guy asked me why all this looks at
right when I'm talking videos I don't
know man I just am like thinking as I'm
talking I'm trying to I'll do better in
the future all right so like fixate on
like in chat here so when I am every let
me put this way every video that I have
on my channel which is over 700 every
video I would feel comfortable sitting
down with the CEO and watching him with
him or her and if you don't take your
programming career seriously enough to
control yourself on YouTube
other things are gonna cause you to be
less successful I can say from me
personally for me personally my youtube
channel has by far been the most
successful aspect of my career it has
gotten me now it has helped to get me
now three jobs it continues to help me
get interest it shows I'm a unique
candidate I'm building a personal brand
it brings in side income on top of that
it is a unique project that can that can
definitively prove that I am always
learning always progressing and it is
something that I am I am consistently
complimented on by recruiters by
developers so can it be a bad asset yes
if used improperly it can definitely be
something that is not a a positive thing
in the right hands it will and done
correctly it will be one of the best
things that you've ever done the problem
is is you know being unprofessional and
happy it's essentially it at the end a
is being unprofessional and having a
documented video of your
unprofessionalism right so that that's
that's part of the problem so although I
haven't watched any tech sleeves video I
understand where that that thought
process can come
but I disagree with it unless if I in my
instance female well um I'm late how's
April she's good life is good
am I ever gonna straight stream on
Twitch again I do I when I don't do
these week it so these weekend I'm a
AMAs had you through the live stream
Levent thing so it doesn't go to twitch
because I leave these up but the ones I
don't leave up go on Twitch once looks
alright I'm usually just thinking it's
kind of strange for me to look directly
in the camera I probably should do you
guys find this better if I'm just
talking and looking at you the whole
time
imagine that I am does I contact help
this is a honest question by the way
not so much for the live streams but for
when I am doing the what's where I'm
looking for when I am doing the actual
videos maybe I should I should get
better on public speaking and things
like that
well I moved to Silicon Valley anytime
soon
I get job offers and recruiters in
Silicon Valley and and I'm not
completely opposed to it 100% because I
would I would love to be involved in the
tech scene the software seem there'd be
a lot of opportunities a lot of amazing
events I'd be able to go to a lot of
interesting guests I could get on a lot
of podcasts I could guest on and people
I can meet and it'd be very beneficial
the problem is is I understand what it
means to move to Silicon Valley and I
understand what it costs to moved to
Silicon Valley so currently in my career
even though I think I'm worth what I'm
asking to be paid in Silicon Valley
the company's a lot of the recruiters
that reach out to me are usually just
looking for somebody cheaper that's the
truth of the matter so so to get better
algorithms first I would start
practicing them if you're not practice
doing them you do the the ones on free
code camp move to a site like code
fights or code Wars or hack hack hack my
hack reactor um hey you guys there's a
bunch of websites you know I'm talking
about
but I also would pick up cracking the
coding interview I can't completely
recommend it because I'm in the process
of reading it and I haven't even got I
just got to the first technical chapter
but I can guarantee you by how
well-written it is in the insight it is
definitely definitely a interesting
thing and my one the corporate slaves
engineer truth talks about now I'm quite
uh quite happy yes hacker rank thank you
very much you'll get job offers mainly
because you have YouTube right no I got
I get I get a lot of recruiters that
just reach out I have a I have a very
clean resume and a very distinct profile
I take a lot of time with my LinkedIn
where I'm adding my accomplishments you
know just this morning I was adding my
to my publication section the course
that I did for scrim BA so you know
I think if there's one company I'd like
to work for it would be I mean to be a
lot but I mean I want to work at Google
I want to work at Facebook I want to
work at a missile on right but one
company I find particularly interesting
is after after having talked to the
Facebook recruiter reached out to me
they sort of told me their hiring
process and once you get hired you
actually go into like a six to
eight-week coding boot camp and then you
have the luxury of sort of choosing the
team that you're on so let's say I have
10 open projects you're gonna be Co
mingling with the people who are on
those open projects some of them anyhow
and you'll get to decide what project
you go on you'll say ok well these are
the 10 which one are you thinking and
you know I'm sure you'll they'll be you
may not get your thing every time we go
get a direction which I thought was
pretty cool as well as the fact that
your first 6 to 8 weeks are going to be
going through a coding boot camp at
Facebook which is exciting a house WG
I dropped out about two months ago I
yeah it was maybe not two months ago
about a month ago it was just wasn't a
good use of my time that's the truth of
the matter and I was really miserable
doing it if you owned your own tech
company would you structure it in a way
to avoid technical debt I would like to
think so
it's I don't know it's it's hard because
now you're on the other side of the coin
right where you're saying okay well we
can do it the right way
or in the immediate term we can get a
financial return so that's why I try to
voice my opinion about technical debt
but you have to really understand at the
end of the day as a developer you have a
job to deliver a product you have a job
to build something and in theory that
that product needs to make money needs
to do an endtime lis manner sometimes so
it's it's this constant balance of so I
would like to think that I would try to
avoid tech debt but my definition as a
business person of tech debt acceptable
acceptable tech debt may be different
than then a developer's description of
tech debt do you know you doing buddy
I'm gonna go outside what I can
into hacking no I don't think so how
long have I been coding a little less
than two years right now what do you
think of dev tips leaving this channel
for fun fun function so I've never been
a big dev tips channel because I've
never really been too much into design
I've been just more so aware that he's
in the space right but my understanding
is this has been something I've sort of
been on his mind for a while I don't
know why it could be that he's no longer
he's lost his passion for it and and I I
mean he left it in good hands are you
left in another like fellow youtuber who
has you know software experience and
it's exciting and fun it's gonna
continue to to grow oh and I Denny we
don't know the full extent of what that
means for for his courier or for hits
like like did he leave it to fun fun
function he's keeping 50% of the revenue
I don't know I don't I don't know we
don't know what the detail of that
arrangement is I mean that case is like
hey just go do all the work and I'll
click to check its we don't know but it
is it I find it very strange but I I
mean everyone's got to do what they
think is best for them self so I could
see how sometimes things can get
overwhelming and you can just won't say
you know I want something different even
if you just stopped uploading videos and
do a video every month so for me out of
one time I was doing a video every day I
couldn't keep up with this stressful as
tired so I did one of you know three
week to week so I you got IT position
big coat
Galatians meant good luck with
everything I know you've been working
hard at it what level of detail do you
think of web developer should know about
hardware I mean not much it might be
unless you unless you plan on getting
into DevOps sorry you Flanigan networks
and security that's about it I am
finishing high school what would you do
two years to finish college or seven
months boot camp so I would pry if I was
coming straight out of high school and
knowing what I know now I would probably
this is probably try to see if I could
get my parents give me one year for one
year I would try to just let him give me
a break and not so I could take a break
but so that I could start a side project
learn to code like really dive in deep
learn to code and continue to grind it
out now that's what I would do if I was
just leaving high school now if you can
finish college in two years or do a
seven month boot camp my advice to you
Jose if you can't do that or you just
choose to do that and then do one of
these two options is I would do the
seven month boot camp get a job and then
I would go back to college if I could
get a company to pay for it or if I felt
like I needed it and make the money that
would be what I would do to succeed in
the path that I've just said takes a lot
of hard work and dedication and you're
gonna have to do all the things that
I've done and you're you know be unique
be passionate continue to grind and grow
and build side projects all the stuff
that you're gonna need to do so that
that's going to be something you're
gonna have to learn from so comp size
software engineering doesn't really
matter software engineering is going to
be slightly easier
both are gonna get your word the the
necessary requirements as free code
coughs still worth it because they're
gonna teaching it jQuery which really is
in demand so here's the thing guys
there's a lot of rules with jQuery
they're just old websites that need to
be maintained for the most part and and
should you do free code camp yes you're
gonna learn to build skills and you're
gonna learn to to grow your channel and
and grow from there should be the only
thing you learn absolutely not you know
and you could take those jQuery projects
and those jQuery skills say you know
what I'm gonna build and react I've
already built in jQuery I'm ability to
react so I think there's a lot of value
in free code camp and they're really
rushing right now to get their beta out
but jQuery isn't gonna be the last
framework you work with I wouldn't focus
too much time on it and when they're
when they're new content comes out which
if you go to beta dot free code camp
calm you can take a look at it you'll
see they have react and redux on there
too I think they still have a jquery
section but the the main focus is on
react tear ducts
hey Dennis been a while so I've been
here I haven't been able to catch trees
how are ya I'm good man life is good
partnering up with I've been partnering
up with scrim ba' I just did one course
for them they liked it so much that they
asked me to do a second course which
I'll be working on tomorrow I've also
been breeding cracking the coding
interview doing the YouTube thing and I
was going to start rebuilding so I need
to build a portfolio site I don't have
one
as crazy as that sounds I've coding
tutorials 360 calm which is
the old site which is in angularjs 1 and
what I want to do is I want to rebuild
it and I want to rebuild an angular 2
plus and build it for me Billy for what
I've envisioned and go from there
am I still studying yeah I'm always
progressing right now as I mentioned and
cracking the coding interview that's the
thing that I'm gonna try and get better
at some of the more traditional stuff
see Esther green oh no I stopped that
that was that was nonsense I shouldn't
have done that in view I wouldn't be a
bad idea I've used pretty hot I could
definitely do that maybe I will
that's the one I've been wanting to play
around with either viewer react a little
bit more and yeah what was my first
project my first real project was
probably the probably the weather API
for free code camp I did do you like the
tribute page stuff like that but that
doesn't really seem like a real project
so have I seen Joma text video if so
what's your opinion I don't know Jo my
tech is uh why did I say the comps I'd
agree with silly a couple things from my
viewpoint not that comp sci degrees are
bad or that you shouldn't get one or
that it's right for everybody or it's
not right for anybody that's not very
nice you're getting chubbier day by day
stay healthy that's a very rude thing to
say no manners absolutely no manners
anyhow why do you say comps I agree with
silly well for me it was silly I went
back because I had chip on my shoulder
not because I need
think the things that made me successful
was not going a traditional route the
things that made me successful was being
able to enjoy working and being able to
enjoy progressing and so what I did was
what I did was I was able to continue I
I went back on what would made me
successful I went into a thing that I
knew I wasn't going to learn much I went
into a route where I knew I wasn't going
to injure enjoy how I learned and I was
gonna be unhappy and so all the things
that made me successful was learning the
way I wanted to learn learning what I
believe is relevant and and continuing
to enjoy learning and what I did and
honestly what I got out of it is just
three months of a reminder of why I had
dropped out of college at the other day
so it was silly in that aspect for me oh
hey by the way for the record your voice
stacking gains but he's working on it
and I'm not overly heavy but I
definitely am NOT the young stud I once
was
I'm working on it guys yeah but you know
what let's go ahead can I get ya Amy
Schumer get out of here dude
can we have an engineered verse truth
first day long video with both of them
promoting their respective careers so we
were this close so about two months ago
Matt was staying here and I had to work
a lot I didn't really plan my time very
well but Matt and I were this close to
failing the filming a like a duo video
together why use here and I was gonna be
Dolan and he was gonna be Matt on and
he's gonna have sunglasses and like his
own robe
we just never got around to doing it
it's gonna be really we had all this
great material that we're kind of theory
crafting over dinner and stuff and it
was it was gonna be good so maybe next
time next time
okay so here's here's my promise to you
next time
we're like staying together I'm visiting
him or he's using me I'll continue to do
I'll make it happen do you think a
degree in computer science is irrelevant
to a developer No
so you'll pick up some of the computer
science basics and stuff like that and
you'll learn how to problem-solve a
little bit better they and you'll have
most importantly Oh something that will
help you scale that great HR firewall so
hey how can I get better at coding so I
can make games like 24/7 I'm making
chest right now so I can make more games
to start websites if you want to get
better at making games you make games a
collab with dreaded if I've had a couple
of you guys asked me man maybe maybe
we'll figure something out I'll get him
on my channel I'll get him on his on his
channel I've had a chance to watch his
stuff I think I saw him a livestream say
say that he was in Florida so maybe
maybe we'll if he's nearby we can do it
in person it'll come out a lot better
we'll see what's up it'll be hard to
talk your last day Lanka laughs how
often should I post my cone again I know
employees look at that daily I fancy
like animation d3 worth learning uh I
mean there are some places that are
going to be very intersting is d3 is a
great animation library it gives you a
lot of control there's other ones out
there that give you less control but
they're much easier to work with like
google charts or charts j/s and I think
of course do-it-yourself would be a
 wizard to build a bar chart
it's an SVG but if your there are roles
that are very animation heavy and very
like they they're usually very data
heavy right they want display the
display the the data in a very user
friendly and easy to see way so Eddy
yeah so uh it's it's a nice to have
scale so here this is one of those
skills where it's not a requirement to
be a front-end developer but in a role
that's looking for it and you can
demonstrate it you will go to the top of
the list because you have a skill other
people don't have that's gonna make you
that much more qualified that's like so
there's skills when you interview guys
their skills where their skills where
there's here's thing there's skills
where they're required and then there's
skills that are perf preferred and so
that's a preferred skill and if you have
that preferred skill on those projects
when they are preferred you're gonna do
very good
what's going on with engineer truth what
do you mean
it's just the essential infusion I
thought you guys would know man I've
been having this in videos for like I
feel like two years now and I get
questions every last ring about what's
going on here Robbie says sorry I'm not
quite sure what sort of currency this is
but donates 40 of some currency so sorry
I was not meant to be rude said what I
saw it doesn't make me feel any better
it's like sorry I saw a chubby guy I
said watch out you get in chubby um get
in fat man all right Robbie yeah I'm
gonna chalk it up I'm gonna chalk it up
to cultural differences in English
English barrier right so what we'll call
it uh we'll call it a wash mind a look
although I should don't worry do you
recommend any specific framework for
hybrid web app development I do
I recommend react native because you're
gonna use reactant reacts very hot right
now do you think it's better practice
algorithms every day or every other day
there certain types algorithms focus
more on it depends on so there are some
generic algorithms and those are gonna
be covered in the book I'm reading which
is very nice so there are some computer
science things that you're gonna need
two topics you're gonna need to be
familiar with big o-notation binary
search tree bubble sort there's probably
about ten in total you need to be aware
of and then there is actually practicing
algorithm so it's like in most things
like in most things it's not one or the
other it's both but you have to sort of
way where you're at and what you're
trying to do right so I've practiced
algorithms I have up like a hundred and
thirty algorithms on my github
and I have the problem with that is I
can solve the algorithms take some time
sometimes I you know it but I can't
solve them very quickly and I a lot of
them my understanding from how I
understand algorithms if I knew how
algorithms work like actual computer
science augers I'd be ever able to see
the patterns much easier and be able to
solve them much faster so that is that
is my how what I'm hoping to get out of
being familiar with algorithms so how
long they take me learning either too
well I started my current role I never
touched angular 2 and then I started
working with it on a semi daily basis
but wasn't really until maybe the second
or third week I ramped up and got going
and it probably took me six weeks really
they get like up and going yeah maybe a
month I mean I'm sitting here here's the
thing about angular and you look so wide
and vast I'm learning things about
angular so even though I've done a
25-hour course and an eight-hour course
and I've built projects I'm still
learning on like a daily basis so
it's uh it's one of those things where
it's very it's very powerful
yeah so on that note I will take
questions for about five more minutes
and then I got to I got a guy go do some
push-ups I got stretched a little bit
and then I have to do some reading
tomorrow I am all day I'll be working on
building a another course
for scuba and just continuing to try and
progress and grow right so you know
everyone's growing in different ways or
I should hope so you know you may just
be trying to learn for loops today you
know cuz that's where you're at but you
should continue to to grow even if you
feel like you're making no subscribers I
don't like reading technical books and
cracking the code Ian interview is a
technical book with a very specific goal
so I give it a pass but I typically
believe in soft skill books it's
learning languages and things like that
and projects from books I don't think
are the way to go but cracking the
coding interview has been such a such a
resounding success in the industry and
having talked with several co-workers
who have sworn by it people whose
opinion I wrecked I have taken a chance
and I can tell you thus far has been a
very interesting read although I'm only
about 50 or 60 pages in Matt says I
received the front end now degree
scholarship this weekend thank again
dealing for mentioning the challenge one
of your videos awesome and so did force
tang so what's going on with Matt Matt
is in a spot where he wants to help
people better their lives he originally
and he's still doing career videos but
his his sort of path with career videos
was making sure you got the job that you
wanted and now he's he's trying to help
you be successful in whatever way that
he can and I can see how that could push
people off right so I understand that
and I think he does too to be honest he
doesn't expect everyone to agree with
his content changing direction and
but I think that's what he's what he's
trying to accomplish so yeah it's like
he's so-so Matt let Matt for the last
year or so it's been doing a lot of
personal development and I think that's
part of it as well as this is some
personal development that he has learned
and been successful with and I think he
wants to share with people and and get
people up and going with however they
want to develop so I respect that so
with that being said guys I appreciate
you all I hope whatever it is that
you're doing whatever it is that you are
trying to work towards that you
understand that it takes work to get
there none of this stuff happens by
accident it's like the the joke someone
said earlier I find that the people who
work harder and longer get luckier right
so it's not that it's not that hard work
and consistency is just gets you like
what what hard working consistency gets
you is that when opportunity comes
you're there at the door and they are
you are who they are looking for so
whatever your hard-working consistency
you're working towards to accomplish
keep that in mind is that what that's
doing is preparing you for opportunities
so that when the time comes when the
time is right you are ready because you
never know when a good opportunity may
come and how you may fail to be ready
and you may regret it for a while so
prepare yourself see you guys next time
