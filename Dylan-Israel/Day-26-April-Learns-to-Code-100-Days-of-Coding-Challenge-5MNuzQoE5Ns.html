yesterday we saw some progress with you
solving two algorithms she's pretty good
I was pretty impressed so today that's
not easy to do today let me close this
today we're going to continue on by go
and review what you worked on which I
believe is a jquery section did you do
anything else no because I'm super slow
at this new thing that's fine um it was
frustrating because I was getting
impossible things wrong name is
frustrating okay uh we're not going to
worry about this section Dom
manipulations a little bit they kind of
poke at me does this weird thing where
they teach you a few of the basics and
then they throw you into jQuery which
isn't cool at all um no I was like ah I
just um you know just got introduced to
everything why the fuck I was freaking
out I was like oh my god am I supposed
to know this stuff like how do you get
all this stuff and then how do you get
here I didn't understand how it was like
here and now I'm like here and I'm like
so we'll go over a whole section about
Don Onion Dom manipulation and all that
sort stuff but I don't think we're quite
there yet - right I want you to get
comfortable with the logic and of
JavaScript and to do that I think we're
going to do another algorithm to start
the day off after a little bit of review
and I think once we get done with a few
more algorithms I'm going to leave you
to try and solve them on your own
I'll tell you and I can figured well you
did great yesterday so um is this live
yes it's always live
so April learn Sukkot is a hundred day
challenge coding challenge where we are
in day 26 it's all documented there's a
playlist and all that you'd see the good
the bad the ugly of the one hour we
spend together or so and and then the
the I always been in front of me just
happens to be on that side yeah um so
today would you like us to go into down
manipulation or you want to hold off on
that honestly I don't feel like I'm
ready just simply because I feel like I
don't have a handle on what we've been
doing so to ask me Oh
let's go use what you really don't know
in this really complicated document to
make websites which is like really cool
but at the same time it's like what what
okay
so to be honest I would like to have a
complete understanding like I'd like to
be able just like pass a test on
everything that I need to know in order
to start working with web pages so that
at least when I get that I'm like ah
yeah okay that makes sense okay okay
yeah yeah I can okay
like I want to be able to be like that
when I get to that point not where I get
there I'm like I'm crying on the inside
and I've hit a mental wall where it's
just like okay so what we're going to do
is we are going to do another algorithm
after we do some review right now so I
think that's a good place to start so we
can review the basis all right so what
what is the various jump into algorithms
eight review
I'll oh by the way Julie I don't know my
spider oh it kills fire okay the door
spider that's a spider that's one of
those weird ass fucking flies that they
have here in Florida that looks just
fucking bizarre all fuck I gotta know
what their problem is and they don't
fucking die
all right
you got it all right
so we're you trying to teach today so we
are doing some review and then we were
jumping into more algorithms all right
baby so variables what are they and go
ahead Thank You Nick yeah it's like 7:00
o'clock 2:00 p.m. and it's still
stealing I can't believe it's just seven
hi baby
so so what is the function no a variable
start with basics we got our variable
and then we got our this is a keyword
okay
use that say this this will be quick you
don't need to write this up oh honey is
really good though yeah any right
keyword you know keyword and then you
have a title the name yes okay so give
me an example
okay there's no space between that right
yeah okay I cool so that's our variable
now what are the variable types string
object number
arrey
boy good so
um can you give us can you give us an
example for loop
an example for loose write a for loop l
undefined and not a number isn't
necessarily type is it undefined as a
type actually type it's not a type it's
undefined
alright so for loop example oh yeah okay
so three parts right you say that
nothing anchor manner statement
all right now iterator statement a
current I don't have anything associated
with those words where we start when we
end how we increase for each loop
okay so
we we initialize our iterator I is for
iterator normally right so we initialize
I depending on what we want to do well
initialize it at one or Amish lattices
zero or something so do I need bar here
yes this is our my
No
let me give you an example here so a
for-loop why don't we use for loops
oh not Tessa code we we run a for loop
to run certain code several times for
loop sorry to repeat our code okay so
the first thing we have is our
incrementer our it iterator which we
initialize to a value in this case we're
going to write this down because this
you saying it doesn't mean anything
what is it
iterator iterator standing for iteration
each time we're going through our for
loop is a single iteration
alright next we have our statement so if
I said I wanted this code to run five
times and we're going to increase our
loop by one every time how might we
write that
not less than or equal to so what
happens in five times it's going to run
five so we start at zero runs one time
so run zero runs one once two ones three
ones for okay that's one way of doing it
usually less than it's kind of the
standard way it doesn't matter the same
thing as long as you understand what's
going on less than five because now it
only runs how many times does it run
once listen for okay I plus plus and we
end it and then we have our brackets to
declare where our scope is running so
iteration 1 what is the value by yeah
iteration 2 what is the value of I what
good and it keeps increasing by 1
because of our increment now what's the
point of ICH statements
what do you give us an example of sick
do I work in up work freelance now I'm a
full-time salary developer although I've
been thinking about picking up freelance
work up work tends to be more low-end
okay so far my coin is no you don't
initialize your variables in there and
you're not initializing you're just
creating so we there's just be a
disconnect in you not remembering how to
set a variable up is very concerning
that's like the first thing okay um I
know struggling with this I don't know
that's why I was telling you while we're
talking that I'm struggling with
remembering these things so I don't know
if I need flashcards which I want to try
and do see if maybe that'll help well
you don't understand the logic we have
something and it stores a value in order
for us to access the value it needs out
a name right in order for the computer
know it's a variable it has some a
keyword in this case far in order for it
to assign a variable we have to use the
equal sign so in here we're evaluating a
statement the less than was good but you
had it was this side was it anything
this is mumbo-jumbo so
why don't you create a variable and use
it in this student
you know model were you doing your king
of the castle
so what tell me what's going on before
we move forward
oh my buddy tell me what's going on with
this line of code what's actually
happening this key word is holding the
value of my coin well known it's holding
so my coin this is saying hey we're
creating a variable its name is my coin
and we're assigning it an initial value
of two so what is my coin is nothing
more it's kind of like if I were to say
what is your first name it's April
so my coin is the equivalent of that
that'd make more sense what is your age
my age being a value would be 29
we are assigning because of the equal
sign that is equal to two
say you Merle that you more Lillis more
Lula's see you huh well okay
so
in our if statement what's the point of
an if statement to assess
okay and why would we do that and why so
that's what's happening why would we do
well sometimes on what you're trying to
achieve is exactly so if it's true we
wanted to do something and sometimes if
it's false we wanted to do something
right yeah okay so write a statement in
which this using my coin is true
is this a true statement
okay so make it the the task was to make
a true statement using my coin
good now what's the point of an else--if
statement to run if the if statement is
false good
it was point of a else statement to run
a statement if everything else turns
false good so now that we're gonna
review I'm going to actually I'll read
one more so we have an array we have an
array hold my array
point three and five
so what I want you to do what I want you
to do is write a for loop that adds all
the values of myarray together
No
I know that's my array dot light and
then I take that like three parts three
parts every single time for for you
first part is creating a variable that's
going to help us iterate through the for
loop
so the goal here is to check every value
and then add them all together their
exam that yes how do we access how do we
access a value in an array okay so what
is the next one yeah okay this sir what
is the three it's one all right so five
is ten good now we start at a certain
number this is what we're going to be
using to keep track of I I is somehow
going to be using our for loop to access
our array thank you bit code a bit code
to dollar donations as well for me well
for you baby
Thank You Vic oh I'll take his fine
taking a lot more than a dollar are you
like this name alright alright so um
yeah you should be used to it well you
don't like that since
hi so I want you to iterate through this
whole thing and not one more and not one
less how would we write our statement
knowing that we're going to use I to
help us keep track for that
good now in our for loop in our for loop
in our Foley I want you to I want you to
add all of them together so how do we
keep track of things starting to value
good the variable
right
that so that's a string we're keeping
track of numbers so what might be a
normal place to initialize a total value
where is a number neither negative nor
positive good now how do we using total
in our for loop access the values of my
array and then add them to my total
that returns the value first thing we
need to do now we may want to return it
at a later date but within our for loop
that's all we care about right now
within our for loop how do we add to my
total each one of these values
okay so what is the value of my array
okay so what is the value of my array
Dudley KITT no i3 okay so what is this
saying right here my total three my
total you said plus equals no
my total is equal to my total plus my
array dot length now I'm telling you I
want you to add each one of these values
together how does this logically make
sense now it would work in terms of it
adds is it what we're trying to get
probably not since you're telling me
that well what are we what is the value
of this it's three right
I saw Dan Soder this is nothing okay
I knew the terms that I was looking for
I would know how to respond to your
questions okay well how do we target
this 5c race what yeah right here so far
if I say I want to get this five how do
I get it
forget about this how do how would I
just write it how would I get my array
send five right there
to
all right so my array too
now knowing this knowing that we can get
an index value piece by piece by piece
and we're going to run this loop for how
many times three that length of the
array how might we take my total plus
equals using my rate at the value outfit
existing agents okay now how can we do
that dynamically with the information we
have here we know it's going to run
three times we know that this keeps
track of a number we know that this adds
to a number so how do we target our
indexes
good all right seem familiar did this
all yesterday I know
all right so what's the plus equals
meeting it it means so it means that my
total is equal to my total plus this
number
so maybe for the future start writing
equals do and do you understand why we
have to add my total test all right
exactly
otherwise what would happen is if we got
rid of plus equals it was just equals
our last value would it would just yeah
exactly
and I keep overriding it good so that
was our review we're we're gonna jump
into it's all right
progress this it sticks a little heart
better than most so we're going to do
the next algorithm
all right so now we're going to go free
code camp and using everything
Nik at the end of this in about 20
minutes I'll be happy to answer any of
your questions
ah for $9.99 a minute no I now just hang
out for a little bit man
all right so factorial izing a number
now
to fact to our lives a number what that
means is that if I pass in if I give you
the number 5 we then multiply 5 times 4
times 3 times 2 times 1 or 1 times 2
times 3 times 4 times 5 to that number
yeah okay so I was like yes
the only instance in which that's
different is if that number is 0 in
which case it returns 1 so are two meals
yeah so knowing that these are knowing
that I want
this guy
the I can't but right now like a boy
they play with you later all right uh so
all right so to knowing it
the cats are strong so gillies
break play with the kiddies all right
we're into this algorithm you have all
the skills necessary to solve this
here's an app what we want to do is we
want to return the value of that
factorial now you see right here they've
set up some of it they've created a
function called factorial eyes now
what's the point of a function again
okay I'll remind you the point of a
function is so that you can call that
code to room again in again and again do
it alright and so the way that we set up
a function is we define the keyword
function we name it and sometimes we
pass in these parameters which are
values that get passed in in this case
five so if we were to run this right now
what number would it return return five
right and then this is num has a value
of fun and it's giving you the 5 as a
parameter correct well it technically
it's an argument here you're passing in
the argument into the prim you're
arguing that that parameter is 5 that's
one way of looking at it I suppose I
don't know that you're making it art I
don't know that you're arguing but maybe
that's how they came to of that it
sounds like it because if you're in a
debate you would be arguing your ear
function okay so you're in a debate with
your code so we know that if a number is
0 it needs to return 1 we also know that
we need to count from 1 on if it's
greater than 1 we need to multiply by
each one increasing so 1 goes to 2 2
goes to 3 so on and so forth just the
worst part about this is we've done this
one
we didn't finish it okay well how do you
think we get started okay so it's how do
we get okay what are we doing where is
the insertions we're returning a
factorial so look at this this is a five
that we're passing in what we want to
get back is the 120 which is 1 times 2
times 3 times 4 times that we do is
every number between 1 and that number
the the parameter 5 in this case right
how many how many things is this okay
what are we starting are we starting an
if statement a variable ah a for loop
what are we starting okay and what is
going in in our for loop
okay and what are we
no sir farts the iterator yeah so far I
know what are we setting is
is it good practice
to start at zero or one art is there it
depends on what the logic is in this
case what would we started at well
probably one okay now what is our
statement how many our statement is
going to be used to keep track of how
many times we need to is lesson um what
is lesson
yeah the incrementer and what are we
doing for the incrementer good all right
okay so
per sub Rita
um what do we do now we have to put
in our
punks are for loop
we're gonna have to store this number
okay how do we store numbers how do we
store things and they're variable where
are we storing it no inside of it
it's just I always put it on top but we
are supposed to put it inside inside of
what inside the for loop inside the
function below the for loop so you're
saying right here right here right here
right here all right here here it's one
of the top two I think it's that one
now why why let's not think let's not
think we should think but let's not
let's not yes okay so why would we store
our variable and what it let's let's
initialize our variable how are we going
to initialize it so we're going to call
my total and what are we going to set it
to you okay
um we're gonna put it in the function
because that's hard to return them then
it's going to be part of like that's the
functions job to keep you my tol my tool
yeah and if we initialized it outside if
we were ever to call this function again
because it was in the global scope it
would already have a value and we just
be adding to my total it said so what
the reason we set it in the function is
you know sees that resets the value
weight so that it can be reused because
it's a function exactly now knowing that
knowing about scope why do we and and
our blocks and everything same thing
right why do we have it outside the for
loop and not in the for loop
why don't we have my total animal and
Lulu
yes because the for loop is in providing
the total it's providing the
fractionalization
okay
not the answer you wanted but my tolls
can keep track of that right yes so it's
storing the volume that the for loop is
providing when it runs each iteration so
why don't we put that though why don't
we initialize because it won't be called
when you ask for the function it'll be
inside different yeah and it will keep
getting reset every iteration do you get
that
yeah oh cool so knowing that how do we
what are we doing in our for loop so I
like what we just did so it's gonna be
my total plus equals or you put my total
equals might a little but let's just do
pus equals I plus you um
my total plus equals numb crap we're not
accessing an arrest different okay okay
okay so trying to get the factorization
now what is I in this instance the first
iteration what is I second iteration
third iteration force iteration this
iteration and what do we need to do
every iteration time
is going to be I times none
no because that would be 1 times 2 1
times 5 2 times 5/3 times 5/4 times okay
okay and why is plus equals wrong here
are we doing in the adding nope it's
gonna be multiple okay so what is that x
equals okay x equals
okay so look at our example here one
times two times three times four times
five and then we return in this case
what are we returning so this 120 is my
total each one of these is an iteration
each iteration of the for loop so the
question becomes how do we execute that
yeah you that well look at the pattern
so I've talked to you before about
pattern recognition and so what's
repeating here the multiplication
process and you handled that right
that's the times I thought I'm trying to
figure out how to get the I in there
multiple time okay so what's the
difference between this number and this
number one what's the difference between
this number and this number I plus one
so each one of these is an iteration and
each one of these increases by one what
happens every single time our for loop
we start with var I is equal to one we
run as long as it's less than them so
how might we use I to get the correct
value in this instance yeah baby I know
this is what I would just said to you
like twice now I'm trying to figure that
out all right so what's the value of I
on the first iteration one what's the
value I own the second iteration what's
the value of I on the third iteration
three what's the value by on the fourth
iteration why all right yeah and what's
the value of I on the
fifth generation which it doesn't run
actually
so our logic song or for loop yeah it's
an easy row
well no it's gotta be is for last year
five yeah yeah and it's on the fifth
iteration my love Jesus all right sorry
so each one of these is increasing let
me let me write this to help you I think
I think you're getting confused by the
my total times alright so we know that's
exactly what we had before
yeah okay so I'm gonna give you a hint
because this my total equals a0 is going
to make a network so imagine that my
total is equal to one that's what that
needs to be in this case what do we
times this by we know that first
iteration my total is times by one
second iteration my total is challenged
by two it's times by I plus plus times
by that yeah
why would that be that cuz it's wrong
good good I was being stupid
all right give it so does I Inc is my
eyes did I good cuz ah because I
increases every iteration remember yes
okay and what do we want to return do we
want to return num which is our
parameter good now when we run this
we're not going to pass all our tests so
that shouldn't have happened um actually
that does work out so I'm just going to
say we were going to have to create an
if statement because of zero
we've wrote in our logic here some
things that buzz did you bring the buzz
yeah almost john-boy
he brought buzz okay so
so I reason it's not a plus plus is
because this increases it by one every
iteration yeah so that I know that um
and I was like I plus plus because I was
like oh it's going to add to the I so
you want the I to be in there and that
was what I said eyes less was not like
so yeah good now close your eyes for a
second because we are going to do a
quick one real quick I cool so here's
the Fahrenheit one from yesterday I just
want you to do this one real quick so
remember Fahrenheit we want to return
Fahrenheit here and I'll stir and we
want to I feel like if I was doing sorry
oh I want to smell the chat go ahead
so let's kill ease so let's do this this
algorithm you did yesterday real quick
so we're taking the Celsius parameter
and we want to convert it into
Fahrenheit
okay it tells us right here that the way
to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is to
multiply it by 9.5 and add 32 how do we
do that
hey how do we do it okay well we want to
take Celsius okay
yeah so variables
so oh wait up so they started us off
sorry
fair in height so we want to return
Fahrenheit which is a variable to store
the value now we're taking in Celsius
which is 30 and we now need to perform
the logic to return it in its correct
numerical value right so it has to be
the parameter so Celsius uline good
Celsius
nope Fahrenheit goodnight what
and yes so much hey don't worry baby I
understood everything yesterday where
the fuck did it go it's all look it
takes practice so you're making progress
though alright so I know that I'm using
nine times five plus thirty-two at the
end of the Celsius which is so Saint
sing say that now say that now how would
we communicate that right we know we
want to return the Fahrenheit value as
it and we're going to store something in
the Fahrenheit variable so very well
fairly equals okay now what's the the
formula the algorithm if you will to
return that we know that we're passing
in the Celsius parameter and so how do
we with what we're given here do that
rito read this to yourself aloud that
might help you read this the
instructions to convert from Celsius to
Fahrenheit is the temperature in Celsius
times nine divided by five plus
thirty-two algorithm to convert from
Celsius to Fahrenheit is the temperature
in Celsius
I see it yesterday I was like oh yeah I
get that today I'm like so the
temperature in Celsius where might we
get that okay now where do we get now
what do we do with that we put it into
our aeration our we put it into the
fungus we put it into the now where do
we put it there okay so Celsius times
nine divided by five thirty
good so what's going on here we're
caught we're Pat calling the function
yeah so we're saying look in the
function is saying hey convert to a what
you called down there and the parameter
is Celsius so argument we're giving this
parameter is 30 then inside the function
we have a variable which is Fahrenheit
so it's saying that the Fahrenheit this
is what this equals to if we're giving
it Celsius so siliceous is then entered
which is the argument thirty times nine
divided by five plus thirty-two and we
return Fahrenheit because that's what
Fahrenheit is equal to when you put in
your argument good
good job
[Laughter]
no worry yeah aha moment yesterday it'll
continue progress is being made
alright alright guys so that was today's
um coding yeah sounds like she might be
a little bit frustrated if I'm if you're
frustrated doing this imagine every
other issue like you know what I imagine
for the rest of my life that about half
way I'll be frustrated in hate and
misery in life and then the next half
I'll be so fucking happy that I decided
to be frustrated because I'll be
actually making money doing something
that I worked my ass off to learn yeah
um and know that the money that I'm
making
I earned look bad in there that's okay
so um the reason I went back and
reviewed that similar to review is
because we're going to continue doing
these algorithms and we're going to
continue doing the review and
it and the only one the only way for it
to really kick in is just a dive into it
and do it and do it until it seems like
why are we doing this this is so easy
um it's it's a repetitive thing it once
it becomes a repetitive thing for you it
will be and you have you understand I
understand it we like you fully right
out of foam like I write out a sentence
I'll be like and it's it's a it's a
practice thing as well as a
reprogramming of the mind and so I think
so you finish the the coke atom eCourse
which is good and what I would like you
to do let's see let's assign you some
homework you wanna do the boat yeah it's
all genius
you'd rather do the book instead of
interactive tutorials what's interactive
j'adore what you've been doing what
you've been doing with coke Adam II
freak okay there's interactive tutorials
with the book okay let's do that thing
that's good
so because godless monkey is the jail
so the idea is one step forward every
day yeah so the chapters are pretty
light so I'm hoping to get anywhere
between one and two chapters done and if
I can get three done I'm ecstatic
yeah all right you start with the book
then and we'll continue hacking away at
these algorithms and because I you
really have start thinking these and
started using them we've talked about
what they do that's the review everyday
we're talking about what they do and how
to use them now you have to use them and
start pulling that information because
the only way you're going to retain it
is if you use it just like learning
Spanish I tell you what this word means
let's start using it
well I've almost ass that's about all
you're gonna do yeah that's it how's the
new job it's really good the funny part
is the IT guy is being
passive-aggressive with me because I
replaced his favorite person in the
company which I think was like a pseudo
mom for him so but Papa you shouldn't
talk about anyways can't talk about work
sorry trying to be professional here I
forget so um
so moving forward we we need a 26 I'm
not sure when we should dive into Dom
manipulation because you you you still
don't
where's the pseudo-code we've all been
rainy pseudocode to kind of do it nice
Danielle
it's I'm not quite sure how to get you
to how to get you there
it is the goal to get her to complete
the free code camp fronted certificate
yes do and do I believe we are on track
to do that no um that is that is too big
of a gamble I would like her to have
been there but uh that is too much I
think I think we can I think that at the
end of the 30 days a hundred days rather
we could she might be able to do the
first four basic front-end projects or
maybe even the intermediate ones with my
help right now we need to focus on
JavaScript and continue continue
hammering in the fundamentals the basics
and once that happens we can move on to
the projects and start working with Dom
manipulation and but all that's going to
be so confusing
if she can't set up a for loop or still
is messing up variables we need to kind
of hammer in the basics so that's that's
what we're doing and part of that is
she'll be doing the book and we'll be
doing the the free code camp algorithms
as well to get her to use them yeah
I don't I don't really have anything
else to us again playing you're gonna
turn your chapter to a day I'm having
three I'm hoping I can do three okay
anything I'll say before we got your
baby thank you for all the support thank
you for having me now that I'm normal
and just thank you for being here and as
always code long and prosper Facebook
