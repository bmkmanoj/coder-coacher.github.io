in solo learn CSS and as you see I
already finished it but I forgot to turn
the mic on so we are redoing it
hopefully I remember having touched this
about two weeks so we're going to be
talking about transitions now when you
have CSS um transition for one CSS
styling to another over a duration
period using background color with
Heights opacity and many other
properties function isn't wait which of
the following is not parameters
transition property duration function
property type there we go so you can see
you set the width over three seconds
coverage to 256 so you can see it's
slowly transitioning over my cat's going
crazy because there is a lizard outside
the window it's very destructive sorry
about that guys
so when you want to set these things you
define the property you also put
background - color transition five
seconds and then ease it in excuse me
transition let me go the cat the
transition background so you set the
transition property the element or the
property you want to set over what
period of time so then use it in you
also have a so you have the ease ease in
ease out ease in and out linear cubic
vizier transition timing function you
can see right here cubic Bezier will be
what allows you to set up your own
custom functions transform and rotate so
before we're talking about just going
left to right up to down but you can
also rotate images using that you have
to put degrees in as well ten degrees so
it takes in angles and then you can do
negative values if you want to go in the
opposite direction just put negative 10
degrees like so so if you want to do it
counterclockwise it will be rotate
negative 45 degrees and then transform
origin translate and skew more things
that you can do so you can have like
this is your starting point and then
your going to transform it based off of
that a belief center is the default
value here and then you also have
translate where you want to move
something like so 100 pixels to the
right 50 pixels down so if you want to
translate it goes 100 and then 50 goes
top then welcome this is me 50s and 100
so it goes let's read this 50 pixels
from the left side goes left then top
got it I always use those things
confused I expect to be learning quite a
bit even though I've done this section
just because I very rarely use
transitions I probably should it makes
your website look so much better
so you can also skew elements so you
want to have a nice sort of style aspect
you can skew it by 30 degrees like so so
you're doing that with degrees as well
you do multiple transformations as well
as scale things smaller or larger based
on your needs so you can transform and
scale it so lengthen width if you want
to be the same you know transform evenly
you obviously want both your your
parameters to be the same so if we
wanted to scale it to 0.2 of its
original size we'd do it like so you
also rotate and then translate and you
can do this you'll notice how we can
actually combine these but there's no
commas just spaces when you call
transform so make sure that you just put
the spaces in there keyframes to
animation so what keyframes are kind of
almost
people might get angry at me for calling
them variables are kind of like
variables and you can see right here you
name it your key frame is name as
example and you set some values here
like so so key frames hold the style
elements you want you have at certain
times so I equate them to CSS variables
for certain instances so keyframe values
I guess at 0% its red at 50 percent its
yellow at 70 blue and then 100 green can
you have multiple keyframes in an
animation property I believe so if I
understand the question because that's
exactly what we just showed you can also
use from the two so let's say you always
are going to go 0 to 100 you can start
front if you use from it's going to
assume that you're starting at 0% to
going up to a hundred percent so from
can be used to replace the zero percent
you can also name these things so let's
say you have an animation named color
change where you're basically going to
call this keyframe and then you're going
to assign it into this div like so and
then in this example it's showing what
the animation duration is so at 0% it
starts off at red and half a second or
half the duration it's green and then
blue fill in the blank to find an
animation called mm at keyframe silk you
have to define the keyframes as we saw
in last example you have animation
properties color change a color duration
so you see again that we're assigning
the value like so oh my god the WebKit
I forgot this one so this is what
happens when you forget
so five seconds you have five s like so
WebKit to make the animation complete in
five seconds let's get a hint real quick
animation - duration the WebKit threw me
off it scared me for a second animation
properties you also put a delay on it so
maybe you don't want the animation to
trigger as quick as possible you just go
ahead and throw it to second delay on it
like so or you want to delay it so if
you want a two second delay to s on it
you can also do an infinite or forever
count on it so if you want something go
on infinitely long you can do it with
infinite you also have alternate reverse
so if you want to go from 100% to 0%
that's another option as well so this is
infinite for the animation to
continually repeat one way you may do
this is maybe you have a spinning icon
that you always want to spin so you can
see right here that we have all these
properties in our div here regarding
animation name duration timing function
delay iteration count Direction similar
to how you would set just a border is
that border color or style you can do
the same thing with just an animation
tag usually make sure you do them in
order so the name duration etc etc so
animation - name animation - duration
animation - time no animation - was it 2
seconds let's jump back into your real
quick
iteration count delay animation - delay
and then Direction cool so we have so
start that which runs up to 2 seconds so
we have our function image so animation
name is size change which starts after 2
seconds and runs for 5 seconds that's
duration the delay and then loops
forever that would be infinite
3d transforms now this is stuff I've
never worked with so I follow this I
really don't know but so you'll have the
z axis so x-axis goes left to right
horizontal axis Y axis is our vertical
axis excuse me is top to bottom bottom
to top then there's the kind of z axis
where you can kind of treat things that
transform in a three-dimensional give
some sort of like width at like this you
know I mean length height width kind of
think of it like that
so if you want to rotate around the z
axis and be rotated Z so yep you'll see
right here the normal development so you
transform x and y you can rotate 3d
scale 3d so you can scale all these
things and rotate them in a
three-dimensional way as well so if you
want to translate a hundred pixels back
that would be negative 100 pixels in the
Z elements on the translate Z so you can
you can do basically all but not all but
the bulk of the animation functions on
the z axis as well you can see rotate X
right here so now you kind of have this
sort of Star Wars you feel going off
into the distance here by rotating 45
degrees on the x axis and giving it some
perspective so this is the perspective
one thing to note is it's pretty
important so you can only provide
perspective on something that is a 3d
CSS property so you have to be treating
it like that so the higher the
perspective value the bigger the edges
of the rotating bucks I got this one
wrong last time I don't think I fully
understand what they're asking and then
let's go ahead and do our quiz which is
the it which of these is about CSS 3
transformation statement modify
stimulate scale would be it you can
scale images and and CSS prop attribute
no CSS C is that what's really good CSS
how long L iment with a statement
transform translate from 0 or 100 pixels
behave how long element with a statement
transform translate 0 it's going to go
from 0 I believe it's going it goes left
and then it goes from the top so it's
going to be pushed down a hundred pixels
there we go
and then which transfer transformation
does not exist the CSA's rotate X
translate Z rotate 3d or skew B I think
is it I don't know it's Q B is fill the
blanks to rotate an object with I D ball
so it's going to be hashtagged ball
rotates counterclockwise 45 degrees so
this is going to be a transform rotate
negative 45 degrees oh my god I put it
in wrong spell checks and I'm still
checks so ball transform rotate negative
45 degrees it's built it right that time
and finally fill in like to make a first
letter oh man they're bringing it way
back so I believe this is : first just
child oh so just know right here it's
first child first so the first letter or
first child of our paragraph tag we want
to set the color to red and the font -
weight to bolt and then here flip the
paragraph by 180 degrees so we're going
to transform it as well I think that's
it huh
so that didn't work so let's try it
let's fill it out and get a little hint
I thought it was first child but
apparently I was wrong first child color
red and then we have
font - wait and we'll go get a smell
first child will get a hint right here
first item another game let's see what's
going on here first letter silly me what
happens when you forget some of these
things but I've always hope this is a
good reminder good refresher I apologize
I stumbled through these last two
sections this is my own shortcomings as
a developer I need to get better at CSS
and css3 and I this actually helped me a
lot to kind of get comfortable with and
I hope to be using a lot of these
animations in my future projects but as
