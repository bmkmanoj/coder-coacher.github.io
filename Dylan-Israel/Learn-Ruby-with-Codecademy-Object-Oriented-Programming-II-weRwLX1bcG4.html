we're in the final section finally we
are doing Agha joining the programming
part to object-oriented programming - so
we're gonna continue on the object
oriented theme
it looks like and this one we are
creating a bank account so let's go
ahead and just get started here so first
we ran create a class called dog so
class dog to end it and then within
there we want to create a function or a
method rather initialize and we want to
take two parameters name and breed and
then we also need to add that as well
and let's see and so you're initially
something assigning those alright and
then we also need to let them know where
they belong essentially I mean at 3
equals breed so should be familiar after
you've done the first object on the
programming section alright now we're
gonna add a public method called BARC
that puts alright so it's still in the
dog class so we're going to call it
death and I guess we need to start off
with public and then underscore what's
the name of the method bark and from
there it's it looks like it doesn't take
any parameters
but in there it's going to the foot
statement that says what go just and
save them
oops did you add a public park method to
your dog once oh you know it it's just
bark and before it above it we need to
declare it public but look so I believe
actually there we go all right a lot of
stuff to return all right add a private
method called ID to dog so here we're
going to declare it private above and
then we're just going to Claire like we
would any method I want to call it ID
and should create an ID number
at a private mystical a dog the ID
method should create an ID number
instance variable you can just want to
say maybe C underscore cool alright so
it got rid of our our code we're
starting with a new one here the class
person all right so that's brought back
our person class is a message for
getting that the name and the job go
ahead and remove the name and job equal
methods and add an attribute reader for
a name attribute of your job so we're
going to remove this and we're going to
remove that and
let's see it's an example here okay so
apparently there's a built-in function
called attr attribute reader and you're
setting it with the coin so in this case
we're doing name and in this case we are
doing new underscore job
well you know what do we keep it the
same
okay
so I made a mistake here so those
attribute readers are actually done and
the class when we're declaring them
variable so this is attr reader named
GTR and you're a reader and we're gonna
set that to job so we have an attribute
attribute writer for job go ahead and
replace these with the attribute access
err so this is a reader let's see does
it want us to replace it with them all
that's what it sounds like
let's okay so this makes a variable at
you we can actually by the sounds of it
remove one of these let's go ahead and
remove this and this basically
incorporates both aspects of it so that
should be fine
it lets it be a reader and a writer so
check out the example mantra let's see
how the information of Pi is stored in a
series of methods for calculating the
circumference so they give us the
variable pi we then insert it into here
in the dot area method and pi times
radius to the second power okay looks
like we're just going to be calling or
creating create your own module in that
area include constant called faith books
all right so let's see module
aigis modules are probably simplified
classes so in this case we'll call it my
library and and this we want to include
a underscore and that and then we'll say
they look is equal to I could be wrong
with where this going
actually I am if we're setting into
cameras actually that's good I want to
try it first so this is equal to the
last book I read was by Ernest Cline not
Armada his latest one but it was the
ready player one this littlest baby
player one a good like read if you like
coding and stuff like that alright so
let's take this out it seems did you
create a module called my library
okay so ready player one is on here the
scope resolution of off of operator two
puts about a pie from the math module to
the console so here we need to declare
where we're getting pie I believe that's
all it's asking it looks like your code
doesn't print massive all right so let's
go ahead and cool so that it goes ahead
and prints out the value PI from the
math library fits in there go ahead and
require date online once with the code
on line three will work
so we'll say acquire date and I believe
this is just importing the date Oh lower
case that's interesting I'm not quite
sure why it's lower case here when it's
capitalized there but I guess that's
just how the libraries work in our case
you want to use math cosine but we don't
want to type math colon colon include
math on line two alright so instead of
doing that where you this I apparently
this is how you include so we're gonna
include math basically saying let us
access the math library and this will
now let us use the kösem be able to use
cosine here because uh it already knows
what it is
check out the code and understand how we
can find the jump method in the action
module that makes it with the rabbit and
cricket classes see how we defined the
jump distance random number okay
create a module martial arts module
martial arts fine I Mexico later period
all right and aligns 8:15 please
including martial arts
let's say but see what happens here
undefined might say included for
it's on line 8 and 15 so we have martial
arts here i'msorry so do we need to I
believe we may need to declare it here
this is what I think we need to do I
just looked at the line for getting
light shifted so we need to include it
in each one of the classes cool so check
out the code in that er we've we've
extended the here and and with the
present allowing it to use and now
function right so this is kind of a
similar way to there and to basically do
what we just did
we've set up an application class in
that there at a public method called
print' status and then
see how if the patient that puts you
want to do some stuff and this is all
systems go and then we need to end it
and don't forget to use public key rings
that should be good
below your public method out a private
method called password that returns a
super secret password one two three all
right so this is just a password and
this returns one two three four five see
if that works
let's check out the e-string
strike foot's oh we also need to end it
now we need to return okay
create your own module called languages
so it's another included constant called
fav C equals and for the sake of
argument we'll just put Ruby in your
favorite program which damn did you
create a module called languages yes but
I spelled languages wrong so there we go
with that
BAM and finally let's include our
languages model into our master class on
line six so that our favorite language
gets printed in the console so here we
need to include include this module
languages because otherwise you won't
know what famous for a favor is BAM into
programming badge we're killing it that
was the end of our object-oriented
programming - and next up just a sneak
peek is our very final section of the
introduction to ruby banking on earth it
looks like we're going to be doing a
little bit of calling methods on our
actual classes and stuff so a little
more object-oriented programming when we
finish this section the next one up
there's Ruby on Rails which is just like
Ruby my understanding is put on like
steroids it's just same thing like
JavaScript and then there's jQuery
so anyhow anything constructive always
welcome guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
