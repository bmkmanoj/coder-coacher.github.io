what we ended up doing was we just did a
little bit of basic HTML this time we're
going to jump into the JavaScript what
we're going to do is get our free code
camp status right below here I believe I
already created a h3 so we're going to
target this h3 using jQuery and then
we're going to output the status and put
a link on it as well so let's go ahead
and get our document ready where and
close this up right now zoom in a little
bit and we'll try and comment this as we
go along
so this basically just means a run our
jQuery ah
lately I'd like to put my comments in
caps it's just a preference thing
there's no really reason other than that
so if you're wondering why that's all
that's going on to bring that I
basically just tell our JavaScript a do
some stuff or jQuery X with our dot
writing function so the next thing we
want to do is we want to put more
comments say we want to get the free
free code camp stream info and status
API call more or less you probably do
that a little bit better the way that
we're going to get that is by doing a
get JSON call we're going to pass in a
URL here and then we are going to run a
function that's going to take in a
parameter called data 1 and with that
we're going to do some stuff what are we
going to do
and what is this URL let's go ahead and
do this so I'm just going to create VAR
URL is equal to and the way that you're
able to get that
is by going to HTTP API twitch TV /
Kraken / stream / free code camp so this
is going to give us all the information
and we should go ahead and show that
real quick in our JSON so this is all
the info that we're getting about free
code camps twitch channel a lot of stuff
here now according to this they're
currently streaming if they were offline
it would say null so if we go to twitch
twitch TV slash free code camp they
should be online right now we're going
to check you'll see right now four
people are watching and they're online
cool so some guys working on algorithmic
too bad for him my shits already done uh
yeah that's so what we basically want to
do is target our FCC status that we
created now as I was saying our the
stream status would be equal to null if
it was offline so all we're going to do
is say if data one dot stream is
strictly equal to null we want to run
some code if it's not else do this so
all we have to do here is target our FCC
status so let's go ahead and select our
FCC status like so
and then we want to output some HTML to
it so right here we'll say something
like free code damp is current currently
and we'll put all the caps offline and
we'll go ahead and do the same thing so
we're going to put a different statement
in our else we're gonna change offline
to online now let's go ahead and save
this and if everything were is working
as it should it should say they're
online cool and let's go ahead and fix
our spelling mistake here as well all
right what a the last thing that we're
going to do in this video is we're
actually just set a link to this the
easiest way you do that is just to go
into the HTML and create a anchor tag
here and we'll just go ahead and put
twitch.tv slash free code camp comm we
really wanted to do it really low
legitly as we should let's go ahead and
do this and get the whole HTTP save
ourself a little bit headache here so
now what we're going to go ahead and
just paste this in here all we're doing
is create an anchor tag around our h3
that we're changing then that way
regardless of whatever is there there's
always going to be something they
they're either offline or online and
this is going to work just fine and when
we do it here it's now going to take us
in our page here I should and why we're
at it we're going to go ahead and set
target equal to blank so it opens up in
a new window
it's going to save that and when we
click it it's going to pop it up in a
new window so that was our second video
here kind of showcasing how to get the
free code camp status in the next one
what we're going to do is get the
followers using a get JSON API call
using twitch API so if you guys found
this video helpful as always thank you

watching
hey guys thanks for watching the video
my good friend Matt at engineered truth
has a three-part interview with Quincy
Larson the founder of free code camp go
ahead and check that out and so you'll
get a lot of really cool stuff thanks
for watching and I'll see you guys next
