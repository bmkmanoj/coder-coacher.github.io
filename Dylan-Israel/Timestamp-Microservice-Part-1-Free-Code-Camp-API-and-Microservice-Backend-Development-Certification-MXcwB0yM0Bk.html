in free code camp and one of the API
projects for the back and certification
we are doing the time stamp micro
service now let's talk about what this
is before we jump into anything else
what we're trying to do is we let's jump
to this link right here is whether we
put in it what they call a natural date
which is December 2015
something like that it returns the date
in its natural format as well as in its
UNIX format now if you're not sure what
UNIX is it's basically a way to do date
in JavaScript that is takes like seconds
from 1970 and then you do some math to
get a date out of this number here but
what we want is that when we go to the
two and end point that are our node.js
application will return this JSON data
so if we go ahead and pass in this
string right here into our browser or in
our postman which we'll be doing it
should be returning a certain date so in
this case it's going to return this info
and all that's we're gonna be writing
the code to do that right now
that's all this entire project is it's a
really good project to get started to
get comfortable with building out your
first node.js application it's got two
things that we wanted to do one you
input a UNIX date that number then it
returns the UNIX date and it returns the
natural date and - we put in that
natural date and from there it returns
the UNIX of natural and I guess three if
it returns something that's not valid it
should return null shouldn't just make
up some so let's go ahead and jump
into this now if you're not familiar
with this editor or how this is going to
work
let's start off by creating our app KS
now some people may call this server Jas
but I'm just gonna call it a pas from
within our
J yes yes we are going to have to do a
few things before we get started let's
bring up our terminal if you're using if
you're using digital code studio you can
just drag and drop it in here Adam can I
make this full screen there we go and
ctrl + that might be too big and what
we're gonna do alright guys so the first
thing that we're gonna do is we're gonna
install NPM so that we can install some
dependencies that we're gonna need if
you're not familiar with dependencies
basically to make our node slash Express
app work our back-end service work we
have to we have to basically just load
something set we need to use it's kind
of like how you would import bootstrap
or or another like angular or something
like that except a little bit more
complex so let's go ahead and install
NPM you look at my notes here and I'm
still relatively new so I don't have all
these commands memorized but I imagine
you use you do these things quite a bit
it'll be easy enough so what we want to
do is NPM in it and that's going to
initialize our package JSON if you're
not familiar with package JSON it's
basically and we're just gonna continue
oh we have to name our timestamp so just
in this app dot J yes I think this was
actually I think I wasn't supposed to
create our App JSA so you'll see we're
going through a bunch of stuff cool so
we have our app dot j sr package dot
JSON you saw me skipping through a lot
of stuff there it's basically just a
bunch of kind of a pseudo code but a
bunch of details for what we're trying
to do you don't really need to worry
about it too much you'll see here I made
a mistake you don't necessarily have to
go through the terminal to fix this but
instead let's go ahead and actually just
rename this file to timestamp
for a package.json pretty cool so we
passed it in there don't worry about
that
so in our app J yes we have to begin by
instantiating those those dependencies
that we wanted basically the packages
that were going to use because we're
gonna be using course we're gonna be
using something called body parser and
we're gonna be using something called
Express now you don't really have to
know what any of that means just kind of
understand these are the standard files
that you happen to use when you're when
we're getting when you're making
applications most of the time with no
js' now from here what we have to do is
we have to go in and install those
dependencies the way that we do that is
NPM install and one second let me look
at my notes here and that is NPM install
- - save and then the name of the
package will start with Express and
notice that we're doing it on the root
directory so we're gonna do that it'll
take a second or two let's run in
and we're gonna do the same thing for
course and body parser now so we're
gonna our no modules we got some more
stuff in there next thing we're gonna do
is NPM install - - save and this is
going to be cores and the the gist of
Express basically will make our life
easier we're gonna use it a lot for
handling HTTP requests or API calls and
stuff like that
cores allows us to make cross-origin
requests this is gonna basically make
our application not reject request if
they're coming from different places and
then body parser be fully honest with
you I still don't fully understand why
we use body parser but I'm sure somebody
in the comments can tell you why I was
just told by it's a body - parser tilled
by individual who engineered truth who
gave me a rundown of node that this is
helpful to have so we're doing all our
setup right now and I I don't want you
to be too intimidated if you're new but
just kind of accepted that this is part
of the process that's that's the gist of
it but we're there now we're we're there
for install so we installed everything
that we wanted the next thing that we
have to do is we have to instantiate
those dependencies so we want to well
put we'll put some comments as we go
along here basic required imports basic
right imports for node Jas and what
we're gonna do here is we're gonna
create an instance of Express so VAR
Express is equal to excuse me require
we're basically requiring an instance of
express that we're gonna use later and
let's go ahead and pass that in so the
notice that we're going to be doing this
for all the dependencies we just added
so i've body parser this is going to be
equal to require body - parser and then
we're going to do the same thing for
korres where as far Korres is equal to
require and in here we are going to
passing korres cool so we've basically
created an instance of we've
instantiated body--it parser korres and
a couple other things the next thing
that we're gonna do is we're gonna
create an instance of our app alright we
didn't create we've basically in
variables set these things but now we
have to kind of link all of them
together in my comment here so we're in
credit instance of express for our app
that we have in a variable here so we're
gonna call this VAR app is equal to
modulus quartz and this is equal to
express so we're basically creating our
express application that we're gonna use
down the road here and then we're gonna
say look our app dot use our body parser
dot JSON again this is just more
instantiation of stuff we're we're doing
all the setup guys we're almost singer
though so app dot use chorus alright
boys we are there so now we have to
check is everything working properly we
because we installed some stuff we did
live stuff before we move farther with
our logic and everything let's see that
were actually we're actually getting
this to work as we want it to work right
so we're gonna what we're gonna do is
down at the bottom and keep in mind that
you should have your have this is the
last thing that you're doing is we're
gonna take our app and say listen on the
port number this is port 3000 and we're
gonna have a callback function you could
define this to be a
bunch of different numbers I'm just
using three thousand so to find a
function here that's going to listen
when that three thousand port is hit and
we just want to console that log working
let's save that and now in our terminal
what we want to do is launch our node
server all right so let's test our node
server again make sure you're in the
root directory so this is my file path
you should have something similar and
the way that we can launch node is just
by saying note we're now in here and
what we want to do is we want to call
our file so it's actually ctrl C if you
want to exit out so I'm gonna do node
and I'm gonna do app dot J s okay so we
got an error here let's look at it here
app dot user is not a function okay so
we have a little bit of a little bit of
a mistake there you see we exited out of
our server because we're back at the URL
path the next thing that we can do is go
ahead and make sure we don't have any
other issue so we're saying no dot dot J
yes and you'll see now it's console
logging working so that means that we're
in there however if we were to actually
make changes and say it's working we
want to change that you'll notice that
when we let me fix my quotations here
you'll notice that when we save and we
were to call no or a the only way for us
to get this update it's actually close
this close the app as we just did but
now if we go it but we don't want to
have to do that for every single time
that we're we save our application so
instead what I want you to do and I've
already done it but you can install
something called node Mon which
basically every time you save your app
dot J s file will rerun your node server
and update it otherwise we're gonna be
working with old data to do that you you
would put in the command npm install -
save - g and then
no daman that's all you need to do to
get it installed so this already have it
installed globally I'm not gonna worry
about that but now when we hit node Mon
it's going to launch our server and now
if we were to change this back to
working and save it you'll see it runs
again and now we have our updated
