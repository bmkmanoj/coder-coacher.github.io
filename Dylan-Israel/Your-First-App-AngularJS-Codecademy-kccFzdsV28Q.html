Coke Adam eats fennel you while
we're gonna learn angular tonight let's
go oh I can't wait
all right so angular works off a
model-view-controller type of thing what
we're basically gonna do is first create
our application you can see right here
we have it set up we're gonna go ahead
and run that make sure we get our
checkmark close so we're basically just
starting off here they gave us a little
bit of something we're also gonna go
ahead and create this body ng app ng app
it is basically just gonna be us telling
it what is going on here so what app are
we looking at we're looking at my app
and notice how this is the name of the
module for it and this is our app go
ahead and run that one more time all
right so what's up next so next we have
to get set up the controller the
controller is the way I like to think of
it is how the where we do things this is
how we send the data the controller
gives us the data and also we send the
data and do things with the data that's
how I like to think of it so what we're
gonna do is we return it the variable
app we've created where's the app dot
controller we're gonna name it we're
gonna name it main controller so this is
all we're doing here we're naming it and
then we're gonna go ahead and an array
we're gonna find scope scope is gonna
kind of be like our data and then we're
gonna run a function that does something
with that scope so from there what we're
gonna do is that's going to be our
function essentially and then we're
gonna close this statement so in here
you're gonna see that we have a scope
that title so we're basically saying hey
you know for data go ahead and set that
title of the data to top sellers in
books that's what we're basically saying
here so scope dot title dot air excuse
me equals top sellers in books oops
try to save it excuse me no it's go
ahead and run that oh let's go ahead and
try with single quotes maybe that was my
mistake there make sure you spell
sellers correctly as well huh
so we've app dot controller main
controller comma oh it looks like we
have to put our scope variable and
single quotes as well I think that might
fix our hair here what in the hell
oh I see what's going on no we're good
all right so we don't have a closing
bracket for this that's where our air is
here all right let's go ahead and run
that finally one more time
what the so we have app dot control
our main controller comma the array that
takes in our scope call a function we
pass in scope here we get scope dot
title top sellers in books let's see if
it's this liner here run that I
don't think that's the line so that's
good to see
what happens when you put this in oh you
know what it might because we didn't
close our body tag as well let's go
ahead and see if this does it
yeah let's see what's going on here
what
I see that well give that a pass I
understand what we're supposed to do I
don't quite sure why I didn't work
though so we're creating our module both
of you Charlie remain controlling view
index on each you'll have access to
scope or our data or the things we're
gonna change the data we're gonna change
between the controller and the view view
is essentially how it's gonna display if
you're logged in you're gonna have a
different view than what it would be if
you were logged out so think of it that
way now if you do it if one setting is
checked that's gonna display differently
in the setting this uncheck so just kind
of think of the view in that way into
controller chains about value of title
to your own string so I don't know that
we so this is our index this is so
basically this is our HTML this is our
controller this is we're gonna we're
gonna change it now it should change in
the main controller so in index we
should change our type when we set our
title here this should get our title and
we're gonna say the scope dot title
equals top sellers of books
what's going on this should work that
should work see what's going
Oh ginger on strings so let's go ahead
and say I see what's going on here
all right so we'll say Dylan Dylan is
not yet a dev sadface will say that my
heart is broken
so you'll see that it changed because we
set it in here likewise any properties
attached to scope will become available
to use in the view in the controller
attach promo to scope and set its value
to your string set promo attached promo
to scope let's see here control let's
see if this is attached ingress so in my
controller with your domain controller
controller manages app stator here we
use the property title search string and
attached to the scope okay so I think
what we want to do here is target target
scope dot promo and we're gonna set it
equal to a string value of hello hi well
said it was a little bit will do that
Dylan wants to be a dev team hire me as
a dev sentai all right now when we run
that it should display that and wherever
the promo section is it doesn't look
like we've called it anywhere quite yet
so in the view add an h2 element and use
the expression display promos that's
what we're gonna do right now so we're
gonna go ahead and go in me I think we
can do it if I understand correctly and
again I have limited experience with
angular I thought about to our tutorial
from a friend and co-worker so let's go
ahead and go here and basically what we
wanna do is you wanna say hey man we
want use angular so that's where you're
throwing up the brackets and check out
what our promo
is baby dammit oh I don't think inside
the div class in the view so JFK index
not Jas so apparently this isn't what
they wanted to just do in the view under
the h1 element add an H Illinois use an
expression display promo on the page I'm
pretty sure I'm doing that let's see
here
that's our exact code what the
that's it that was our exact code so I
think maybe there might have been this
might have been a cook add anything
where you need to put a space after so
this was our exact code so let's go
ahead and continue on the important
thing is that we kind understand what we
need to do here so now we want to add
more data to the controller and display
them in the view in the controller
attach another property of scope name
product so we're gonna attach a new
property to our scope so scope and the
property then we're gonna say product
and what we're gonna do here is we're
gonna set it equal to the object and
within the object we're gonna have a key
value pair going on here we have name
and when you call a dot name it's gonna
output the value the book of trees and
then we want another key here called
price and we want to put a value on that
of 19 notice how we don't put a thing on
here so let's go ahead and run that so
that's our scope dot product cool the
index so in our view here inside the
p-class title we want to put product
name so it's gonna work exactly the same
except now we're gonna call product dot
name said just title and that's because
we have an object and we're gonna find
the item the key to call the value of
that object so name the book of trees
price 19 an index of a show peak less
title so it's where is our title control
left title there it is
so then in the entry class 'title access
products name with project name so if
you remember we just do the brackets
like so and then we can do product dot
name oops sorry
I've been using an IDE a lot more lately
so I've been controller saving
everything all the time so it looks like
the book of trees came up and people
asked price display the price so if you
remember it again that's just gonna be
product up price and it should come up
as $19 so let's go do this will do again
I apologize for that let's go ahead and
run that very nice it looked right here
so we have the title and then we have
nineteen cool so currently the product
fresh shows up as the number of
inventors formats currency or other
thing change the date in the crop
controller let's use an angular filter
to format the data so in our index.html
what we want to do is use we want to
change it using a angularjs filter cool
so it looks like they have some part of
the library built up to work s currency
let's go ahead and run that
and you'll notice that it's set up as
our currency with a dollar handsome
sense behind it that's very helpful I
really do like that comes there with a
few more bills built-in filters all
right cool so let's learn some let's
learn a little about the filters so a
scope top product add a third property
named publish date or pub date so the
way we add another property you just put
a comment after the last one here and
then we're gonna call it pub date this
is our key for our value here called
which is a new date object and the date
object takes in three parameters one the
string 2014 followed by the string o 3
followed by the string oh wait very nice
very nice so we run it I think we should
be good here whoa hey no semicolon the
semicolon let's see here baby hey cool
so in our index dot HTML we want for our
date we want to go ahead and set that so
we want to display the now I think
what's gonna happen here is we're not
gonna actually display it correctly it's
gonna come out pretty ugly so I'm gonna
say product pub date so call the product
object and call the key for our pub date
when we run this it's gonna output this
very ugly ugly thing here now format the
products so by piping it to the date
filter so I'm not familiar with that
term piping but I would imagine that
this type looking slash and then we can
say date might fix it good for them
look at that April 8th 2014 I like that
and then format using the upper case
filter so if
I'd imagine we would probably put a
comma in an uppercase let's see if that
does the trick it does not so look it
out puts it right here so we broke what
were you're doing so maybe it would be
another pipe here if that doesn't work
we'll go ahead and test a so that seems
to work all right so to call multiple
filters we now know that we just need to
put another pipe as they called it so in
the controller delete the scope dot
product object so we're just gonna go
ahead and delete our entire product here
and then run it
now what it wants us to do is create a
new scope named products so we're gonna
recreate this and we're gonna we're
gonna set it equal to an array of
objects that's what's gonna happen here
so because we're gonna multiple objects
we're gonna set it equal to here's our
array we're gonna just make some space
here and then in our objects we're gonna
separate them like so and then we're
going to put in some information now I'm
just gonna copy and paste one of these
and then we'll go on from here now from
here we have we have a name so we're
studying the name key and we're sending
that to program or B programs all right
I like that then we're gonna put a comma
to separate the key and value so we're
gonna go then put price eight we're
saying the price of it comma I'm gonna
set the key to pub date I'm just going
to copy this last part in so we have pub
date and then we have apparently the
cover URL the relative URL because as
you can see there is no there is no
other things going on there's no WW is
the relative URL so we run that let's
see what happens
all right so in the view inside div
class main delete the div class call
medium 6 so we have call medium 6 and it
wants us to delete the class all right
so let's go ahead and find this and the
next div the next ending div I should
say excuse me and replace it with the
HTML type in the contents okay so it
looks like they just want us to add this
class right here sorry it's taking me a
second to read through it so you just
want to go ahead and add this new class
and we're gonna add the directive
ng-repeat so ng-repeat it's kind of like
the for each loop of other languages
essentially what its gonna do is iterate
through our array of objects and then
output it so remember our product here
products we're gonna eventually iterate
through that so it's where do we iterate
through ng-repeat is in Java this would
be an hi perhaps for iterate so
basically for each item in our array
products output the product name output
their name followed by the price
filtered by the currency so put it in
the currency form and then publish the
date then filter that so that it looks
like a date and then also make it
uppercase so let's go ahead and run that
so you'll see here now we have our first
book with the price and our second book
with the price pretty cool
all right the problem now is that both
products have the same image let's fix
this so inside our div we're instead of
hard-coding our image source in there
what we actually want to do is we're
gonna create an image tag and then we're
going to use the directive the angular
directive ng das SRC and we're basically
in here can do exactly we've been doing
except now we're using a directive to be
able to display the cover so what's
gonna happen is angular's gonna find
that URL in the ink in the JavaScript
object and then use it to display the
HTML and now we have two different
covers pretty cool so in the controller
we want to add our favorite books add
two of our favorite books to the scope
products alright so I think think about
this let's see here uh from memory we
will do name Ender's Game comma and then
in cover
excuse me price so far they've done
nothing no decimals so let's go and
enter some decimals and then publish
date let's go ahead and look that up
real quick I'll just say 19 1995 that's
my best guess
did I cover just because I don't want to
look for an image we'll go ahead and
follow the the same URL path is this guy
and also just in the interest of time we
will go ahead and copy pasta this one
more time
we don't forget our comma here it's
gonna run that so we just created two
new objects in our products array so now
it's going to iterate through that
because in our index dot HTML we have it
set up to iterate through every product
in products so you'll see that we have
multiple into 3 4 so we have 4 which is
what we have in a products we have four
products cool so the controller scope
dot products are a add a new property
called likes to each element set all
likes properties to 0 so in the
controller here we're gonna then add a
new property and it looks like we're
gonna add it to to each one of these so
we're gonna set lights 0 and we're gonna
copy pasta
copypasta
copypasta what's going to run that
go so we've added a new property to our
products class here
all right products array so in the view
under peak last date let's go ahead and
type A rating element so we're gonna go
ahead and set P dot likes the ratings Oh
Susan
so under date is actually what we're
looking for we're gonna create this
let's go and just copy that in so inside
the class likes it's going to dislike
products lice using the expression cool
to be also not fully what sure what
they're talking about here but let's go
ahead and find that out in the view
under close date all right so I believe
ring here I think this is I'm not sure
if that's what they where they want that
also I'm looking at this I'm pretty sure
this good needs to be it in there it's
gonna run
huh
I'll see where we messed up here
oh so yeah so that needed to be fixed we
did that they don't have uppercase on it
I don't know why but then here is our
rating and let's do this last part so
our rating was below the paragraph but
within there but I thought we did that
div class reading likes an A+ so let's
go ahead and take out this mg - click
because we didn't do that so ng - click
is everything you think it would be it's
a click parameter so you'll see right
here and nothing's happening when we
click it now what we want to do here is
then call the directive ng - click what
we're going to call it +1 on that index
so today right now
so you'll see every time we click this
is now increasing cool so let's go ahead
and move forward index is kind of like
this it just does what it's on that
object so in the controller in the scope
products array add a new property name
dislikes to each element set dislikes to
zero all right so we're just gonna do
exactly what we did a second ago called
set Dix dislikes zero from here we are
I'm gonna run this make sure we did
everything correctly all right so we set
a new property to our array products in
our controller and now what we want to
in the view so we're going back to the
index HTML document add an element P
dislikes and add the products just like
- all right so we're gonna add it into
rating outside here so we're gonna
dislikes we're gonna create a P class or
say closed equals dislikes and display
products dislikes using expression I'll
go ahead and say dislikes
excuse me product dot dislikes it's
gonna run that and it should display our
dislikes so wait here we have 0 this is
our dislikes cuz our other one we can
click so back in our controller we're
then gonna attach a new property called
-1 so let's go ahead and start here
comma the new property - 1 from here
we're just going to set it set name -1
set it equal to a function that adds to
a products dislikes property that's good
for plus 1 function and do this so here
we have a plus 1 function
all right all right I like this so what
this is going to say is scope dot plus
one so if you remember back in the HTML
we have this plus one function this is
say on click run the plus one function
with the current thing that we're
iterating through so what we want to do
here is we want to change our plus one
function to say say look change our
scope dot products for the index that
we're on for the item that our angular
basically the array that we're on target
the array that's all that's happening
right here target the array item we're
on and say dot dislikes plus or equal to
one set it equal to itself and now when
our page reloads here I didn't do that
right all right I think I dropped an S
here so I apologize for that
let's go ahead and run that one more
time perhaps I still did not do that
right
yo man what's going on here I'm pretty
sure we're right maybe they were honest
alright a noose actually let's go ahead
and see I think they wanted us to add
the UH yeah they want us to create a new
one that makes sense
all right so where my mistake was was I
was thinking they wanted to add it to
the plus one they actually want us to
create a separate function called minus
one so let's go ahead and do the the
thing that they skipped over here so
basically what happened was we just
called our directive here called ng -
complete so we're gonna erase that what
we want to do any our paragraph dislikes
here is they want to call ng - click so
on click when you click something via
our angular application here we want it
to run the minus one function and run
that on the current index of the array
that's what's going on here
now I run this
oh and then make sure you output our
stuff so we won't fit output product
dislikes and run it
cool and that's it man we've earned our
first lesson completed our first angular
application things to keep keep in mind
you're gonna be storing a lot of odd
vets in a race you're going to need to
fully understand the controller in view
view is essentially how the page
displays and under what circumstances
controller is the information that it
sends to that view and it's going to get
a lot more complicated as I understand
it so hope you guys found this helpful
this is really other than to our
tutorial my first time and I really like
it and I can see how I will continue to
focus on angular so thanks for watching
guys don't forget to Like and subscribe
and support me on patreon I appreciate
that time happy Cinco de Maya baby</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
