into bonfire or reverse a string so I'm
gonna reset this I was working on a
little bit let's clear this code so
what's going on right now is forgetting
we have our string function declared
here but we are not reversing it
so let's they have a they have a couple
suggestions here we could probably break
it up into an array you stop reverse
join so let's see what string not split
is suggesting so example is using a
split so type a string Oh brave new
world nice flavor
so how do what we want to do is
basically parse this string and put it
into Java so parse string JavaScript so
how do we do that let's look at some
examples JavaScript string split our
string into a char JavaScript
just split it by an empty string cool so
we're going to say STR is equal to so
we're gonna say our string is equal to
the string that we put in dot split and
what are we splitting it to we are
splitting it two and we can just do our
that's it let's see if this work first
so it's Jerry's and we're splitting it
by every nothing so basically because
we're not splitting it by spaces or
anything it's going to every character
do that and let's say let's say we'll
save our reverse by reverse you know so
Co split so we're storing it into a
single array and then we'll say for for
now what we want to do is we want to
reverse an interior so this is an array
that takes in h-e-l-l-o so it's got five
index values and then we want to say for
for each loop reverse JavaScript so do
you undo so we want to use the rehearse
okay that's all we have to do so they
already told us that's a good job so
I'll say reverse is equal to reverse dot
reverse now let's change this up we'll
just call this placeholder so that
things don't get too complicated with
all these reverses going around here and
then we want to return littler although
in theory let's just see if we can do it
like this
SGR STR STR STR check out that so let's
see if that will work and then when we
run it the first output should be a
string so it looks like it prints out
the array so now we need to use joint so
first thing we did will say STR is equal
to our array dot join and here this is
going to when we run it for an out
should be praying out hello let's see
here
Cole string object alright so let's see
what they say about the global string
object string text
it's what's going on here so let's close
this lets check out our global string
object real quick
just concatenate in it let's see here
join so let's see this one here
alright it looks like we may have to do
it like this so you can STR is equal to
the STR dot joint but then we have to
take out the separator so you see right
here it says I'll print it out with
commas so let's go ahead and see if that
will do it there we go
cool so let's put in some comments real
quick so about what we did and also we
need it's funny that s said that works
so we didn't even run this so let's
rehearse the string and this is our
string is going to be greetings from
Earth very cool very cool
oh so you're right we should get hello
and then we show you whatever good news
our worth is okay so let's clean this up
and we'll just put some comments in here
I explained what we did so split the
string into characters for each space of
that so basically every character you're
splitting it here we want to into an
array of characters for each space of
that as a start up reverse we then our
use array function reverse to reverse
the values of index from first to last
and vice versa
so cool that's what we did here and then
here we reset to a string using our
a dot join using arrays join function
and removing all right and adding the
separator cool so that's what we did not
too bad bonfire reverse the strings
phone about maybe ten minutes on this
and you know let's go ahead and I guess
we can tweet that out real quick but
that is kind of a real quick intro on
how to reverse the string so if we go to
our map now we did that in what 10
minutes is that is that all that was was
right there let's see here oh no no we
still got more to go
all right I was like oh say goddamn line
so we're still in Reverse the string it
looks like oh no I think we're actually
done let's see say I'm dying to know
about these things so I'm trying to do
one video for you okay so we're done
with the bonfire reverse a string
definitely take a look at the comments
if you kind of if I kind of went through
that a little too quick and I'll see you
guys the next video where we are going
to factorial eyes a number and in this
case this is actually really helpful so
all this stuff was getting getting it
comfortable with numbers you're gonna
need to know that for programming in
general and as always comments questions
concerns that anything constructive is
always appreciated I'll see you guys the
next video thanks for watching the video
don't forget to Like and subscribe
that'd be great and leave me a comment
letting me know what you liked about the
video what you didn't like about the
video see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
