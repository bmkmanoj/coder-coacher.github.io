doing the weekend livestream the AMA all
that sort of stuff so for those who
don't know every thousand subscribers or
every arrow and on the weekends I
typically do do one livestream kind of
combining them all in one I've been a
little bit busy I go back to school on
Monday
I love a video talking about that why I
decided to go back and get my degree on
Monday being released as well so today I
want to kind of talk about a little bit
about progressing as a developer cuz
that's something that I don't think
people think about quite often when they
already have a job sometimes and I've
seen this in certain developers that
I've worked with in the past
and it's it's a very strange thing where
there's two types of developers good and
bad and I'm at I'm lucky to be at a
company where I don't I consider all the
developers that I have worked with
in-house very good but I've worked with
bad developers in the past people who
just people who just don't they got a
job and that's okay they they're gonna
just wait so that they get the time and
eventually it'll get more money instead
of actually deciding to to actually go
out there way to progress and I have a
video talking about what I learned in my
first year as a developer and I talked
about five or six things that I that I
did while I was still studying on and
kind of me going back to school for
those who don't know I'm finishing up
I'm I was a computer science major now
I'm a software development major because
of the program I like
much better should be done within a year
maybe less depending on how quick I can
work through but that's part of my plan
to progress as a developer in the
various and what's it practical but in a
very job oriented direction it's the
weakest part in my resume and that's
where I'm looking to supplement it so
that's one of the things that I'll be
doing in 2018 to to essentially really
just get rid of doubt and allow myself
to maybe take opportunities I wouldn't
normally be able to get because I didn't
have a degree just followed your angular
random quote machine project and really
makes a lot more sense to me then react
us that's great man I honestly if you
like that project then my course will be
a great another introductory section for
you by the way I'll be giving away I'll
be giving away my JavaScript course I'm
not gonna have time to finish it it has
five and a half hours of content in it
and I want to say basically breaking
down javascript piece by piece what the
function does how to use it and
originally I was gonna probably put
another five hours of content do some
vanilla Jas projects and unfortunately I
just won't have the time so instead of
hoarding these videos and then one day
coming back I will this weekend slowly
be working up some stuff and I'm gonna
put it out for free on udemy so look
forward to that all of a video
announcing it so if you want something
to kind of help out help your learning
curve it's a free JavaScript course that
I'll be sending to you guys so how about
older guys like me you want to become
holders is there ageism or is that just
something in my head I think ageism is
something that's that is a true thing in
every industry however it shouldn't stop
you I think that goes there their
benefits behind older developers there
are benefits to hiring younger
developers but honestly if that's what's
stopping you you're it's gonna
you're gonna have harder things in life
than ageism in the workplace it is
something that exists across the
spectrum of work right we've looked at
stats I'll say that I don't think it's
something you have to worry about I
think you just need to prove that your
skill set should someone learn two
languages at the same time um probably
not I don't think there's it's a hard
question to answer because once you
learn one it's very easy to pick up a
second one so I think it's probably
better to focus on one but when I was
trying to teach myself to become a
better developer I did like seven
different languages like cook at me and
I found that really helpful so it's a
most people would say no though and
Michael if you're worried about ageism I
have a video saying titled are you too
old to learn to code addressing that
topic specifically in detail and I
encourage you to watch it
what's your experience working with SSH
FTP and Linux I don't have any Linux
experience I will be getting familiar
with it in a course I'll be taking but
FTP I mean I've had to upload things
that's basically all he tv4 put on the
server call it a day
they add my new PC is not here yet this
is my old PC hopefully we can do a full
one our last year without it crashing
it's gonna be a couple weeks but I think
two more weeks till it gets here
I so I bought it for my buy power which
is where I got my last computer or the
one that I'm using now and they have a
promotion where if you're not in a super
rush to get it where delay sending you
your computer because so they can get
the people who are in a rush and they'll
give you a five percent discount so I
chose the five percent discount
it's a twenty seven hundred dollar
computer so you know it's like a hundred
and twenty-five bucks or so off of it
and I was uh I decided to take the five
percent discount so it'll be it'd be
probably bout two more B's
hello Dylan I'm close to getting my
friend certificate for free code camp
however I haven't finished high schools
that's something that the web industry
would care about when hiring have you
not finished high school because because
why like because you're like 16 or
because you're 30 I don't think it's
something that they would care about I
mean it's here's the thing I'm going
back to get my bachelor's because some
people do care so does it does every job
care no I I make more than most people
I've worked with in the past who have
bachelor's so it's really about your
skill set are there going to be
companies that care yes 100% I've had
people tell me that they've we're very
interested in me they love my youtube
channel they love my projects
they love my passion and they somehow
they miss the fact that I didn't have a
degree in the middle the phone call said
oh oh you know what I'm so sorry we're
actually only accept people with CS
related degrees so it does happen as an
employed angular once c-sharp def should
I learn angular 2 plus or react I just
say jump to angular 2 man it's probably
gonna be easier transition for you but
there are a lot of react jobs but I
think angular 2 will be a pretty easy
transition for you what's going on Casey
uh should I learn in Java for Android
studio or unity honestly I couldn't tell
you I thought I thought Android was
moving to Kotlin though but uh but um
Jarek when it comes to your your high
school diploma why not just go get your
GED man it's a single test that you can
take as far as I understand go and knock
it out you'll feel better about it man
like part of the reason I'm going back
to school so I stopped thinking about
going back to school it's that simple I
am so sick of having this internal
struggle with myself upset that I never
finished my bachelor's were
read about how it's going to affect my
future all that sort of stuff so instead
of actually worrying about it for the
next two three years and life's only
gonna get more more complicated life
will it's only gonna get harder right
you know marriage kids mortgages all
that sort of stuff let's go let's go and
I encourage you to do it as well so we
took probably take a little bit of
studying I can't imagine it's gonna be
that hard and go get your GED don't
worry about in the move on to the next
stage of your education and life if
that's what you're worried about
yeah but FinTech one thing I would say
even though I would recommend since you
have angularjs experience going to
angular 2 is what I did when I saw
angularjs in PHP that was my stack that
I was working with I decided to learn
react when I was when I knew when I knew
I was gonna be leaving and part of the
reason I didn't focus on angular 2 was
the react was growing all the search
stuff but also from a practical
standpoint I thought that might get me
more jobs if I was playing around with
react because I had angularjs experience
maybe I could squeak my way into an
angular 2 role which is what I did
coincidentally while still opening
myself up to other occupations other
other other roles I should say your PC
in good condition now no not really
but it can run the webcam and everything
am i still practicing algorithms kind of
I actually started doing some on the
beta free code camp so I'm uh
I'm very interested I'm very interested
in in uh in doing their algorithms that
they have on there I'll probably
actually make a course I'm thinking of
doing a hundred algorithm course where
it's a hundred different algorithms
where I solved them and I also will have
like in the beginning of the video where
it's kind of like okay this is what I
use see if you can figure it out and and
then if you can't you know you watch the
solution what not when it's the beta
so it was supposed to release on
Christmas but I reach out to Quincy
about getting him on the channel and he
said that the bugs are holding them up a
little bit and that the the new release
date is for the first the goal I should
say the goal release days for the first
it's gonna come any day now guys that's
really the truth of the matter I have my
bachelor's in geology I'm self learning
web development I wonder if my degree
will be any benefit during the job hunt
it is a stim degree it'll be a benefit
in the fact that you have a degree a lot
of times you need that check mark right
it will not be a benefit in terms of
skill set but it will be a benefit in
the fact that you have a degree it does
nothing but help you now in terms of in
software and tech the only way that it
itself is a benefit is if for some
reason that geology is somehow related
to the company that you're interested in
what are your thoughts on game
development
everyone who I've ever talked to is
worked in game development and everyone
who I I know who started that it's a
very stressful occupation you have
timelines you have crunch times it's one
that's most stressful and and by the way
very low pain and consider considering
all the other jobs out there because a
lot of people have this mentality of oh
you know cuz we're all we're a lot of us
are gamers right a lot of us grew up
playing Super Mario Brothers and Final
Fantasy and all these games and still
still do right we have this idea that
hey I want to build games man that's it
that sounds great and then you get
around to it and then you go into the
industry and you so much competition
it's very hard to get started and it's
not the money isn't all that great for
higher stress I would not necessarily
recommend it based off my conversations
but would that mean said I've never been
at a game developer or gone dove into it
but that's just what I've been told
having talked with people who've worked
at game companies as well as um have
actually ran game companies so have I
ever thought about creating a startup
company yes I have a startup company
that I've thought about creating
I have not done any graph ql1 the
startup companies I've thought about
creating is a coding box if you're
familiar with loot crate think like that
except development-related where every
month you'll get a course you'll get
like a t-shirt and like three or four
like mil a pin a sticker and then maybe
one other random items like a mouse pad
or something he'd be like $20 a month
and every month you just get a mystery
box and be themed right JavaScript
typescript HTML CSS and that would kind
of be that's kind that was the one thing
that I was pretty close to to starting I
start working on logos I started
designing I start coming up with an idea
of how I started pricing it out and the
big thing was shipping the big thing
came down to shipping and how I could
make that work and but yes I've thought
about it where you know $20 a month to
get a course you get maybe a shirt and
then three or four knickknacks and it's
probably gonna be five dollars for
shipping but yeah that was the closest
thing that ever came to actually
thinking I started working out the
details and I decided not to do it but
it is something that maybe down the road
I just don't think there's a big enough
demand that's the truth of the matter
have I used dotnet core yes my current
work uses it but I don't I've rarely
touch it cuz I do front-end but yes
should I go for the Maron sec should go
for both that's crazy as it sounds I I
would say that learning C sharp and
dotnet and I think it's it's all is all
very there's a lot of jobs in that high
pain wants to although the the con to
going in to a like c-sharp or Java field
is those are the languages that are
taught typically by bachelor's and
master's programs and so you're going
against people who are more
traditionally trained than in things
like JavaScript how long did it take you
to build your first proper website I
haven't built a lot of websites if you
go to coding tutorials 360 calm that's
my first angularjs site and that's like
my introductory project and that took me
probably like three days three days
putting a couple hours a day
if I want to be a web developer would
still be worth it getting us yesterday
getting a degree will always be a good
decision if you can limit the time and
you can limit the money because it
itself does nothing but help you it's
the it's the process and the costs of
Gideon said degree right so are you
gonna finish it in four years or less
first thing you have check the reason
I'm going back to school through WGU is
because I can take as many units a
quarter a second complete the classes
that I I think I can immediately take I
can like say so I'll give you a perfect
example
I work as a front-end web developer I
took the pre-assessment I start class on
Monday the first I took the
pre-assessment for my two web dev
courses
I got an 80 and an 82 on both of them on
day one I will be taking at least one of
the I'll take the first web dev course
once my mentor approves it and from
there I immediately well have knocked
out three units on day one if I if
assuming I passed that I'm making the
assumption that I will and by the way
I'm gonna study also today tomorrow the
next day I will then go and and do the
do the second web dev course which is
six units and so let's say it takes me a
week to do those two courses in a week
I've knocked out nine units nine units
in a week and I didn't have to do any of
the assignments I don't have to do any
of the prep work because because I I'm
in a situation where I know some of the
material I know a lot of the material
and they have pre assessments to show me
that and I can as well as much work as I
put in I can what's my girlfriend
yelling at me I can go and I just got an
angry face on Facebook from my
girlfriend I was like what is going on
you know but uh what made me decide on
WGU the the way that you take your
credits is comp the competency based
units where you don't have homework I
mean there are assignments help train
you if that's something that you're
interested in and I'll be doing some
this weekend even though I pick out a
80-plus on both of the assessments just
because I want to make sure that I pass
it the first time also they have
certificate programs I I have a video
coming on Monday diving into this but
they have certificate programs and that
are built into the so I'll have five
certificates up to if I choose to have
five I think three or mandatory of
compte IAS one the ciaw web one and ciaw
web two or something like that but
really it was just the cost and the time
that to graduate building a website or
building an app building web apps should
always be your goal right web apps are
more fun in my opinion the fact that
they have also the the software
development now I can't say that this is
different from any other program but
from the content of my previous computer
science program was just a lot of theory
very dry very boring and not very
real-world and having real world
experiences and seeing the curriculum
for the software development at least at
WGU seeing that what they're actually
teaching or is more relevant right aux
course the UI course project management
course a communications course a a sort
I'm looking for a two web dev courses
you know to Java courses and just things
that are a little bit more relevant will
I be doing the Georgia Tech online would
the Masters I might we'll see how the
WGU goes honestly guys I don't enjoy
school I it is going to be time and
money and I will do a master's program
if I think it's financially worth it is
a master's degree worth it right that's
a question and it can be but you have to
be after your money right so like it's
no coincidence that my boss has a
master's right it's no coincidence that
his
says a masters so it's just one of those
things where are you gonna go get a
masters quick and cheaply as possible
right if you can I say go for you if you
have the time and energy it does nothing
but help you but again it's about
limiting the cost and the cost for this
is time and money so if you are going to
go and get a bachelor's you are going to
go and get a masters you need to make
sure one that you get you get your money
back and the effort that you put into
that because every hour that you're
spending studying for your bachelor's
for your masters it's an hour that
you're not learning to code that's the
truth no matter and that you're not
learning the latest language to life the
latest framework the latest technologies
and that you're not learning relevant
skills but you are puffing up your
resume in a traditional sense which is
almost as important in my opinion all I
ever get in AI machine learning deep
learning if someone wants to give me a
job I never I don't really care what I
do how much YouTube will I be doing
videos I'm making a couple videos this
week I'll be doing one to two videos a
week so a little less than I what I
normally do but um I'll definitely have
some videos my opinion on suicide kind
of against it uh it's kind of a long
term decision for a short term problem
most of the time but that's all I really
want to say about that suicide is bad
okay how hard would it be to create a
patreon a clone uh it probably wouldn't
be that hard the hardest thing that
you're going to to do graduate schools
accept degrees from WGU yes WGU is a
completely accredited university like
any other State College or anything else
to create a patreon cloade the hardest
part is going to probably be be handling
the finance aspects of it but you'll
probably be using like a third party API
like PayPal
or stripe or something that handles a
lot of that for you and you just have to
sync up to their stuff but that's the
thing guys is on its kind of strange
right like it's just it's not how hard
it's gonna be all these stuff now at
least for me and I don't say this as
somebody who is like oh I'm the world's
best develop or anything like that it's
not that any of its hard it's just sixth
time alright so so that's the thing to
keep in mind is could I do a patreon
clone yeah I have no doubt in my mind I
could sit down and do a patreon clone is
it a large project yes it is it's a
large project it's gonna take time is it
beyond my skill set absolutely not
but it is a large project anything is
low webapp now especially in the front
end it's not that any of its hard it's
not-it's top being hard a while back
real programming that isn't you doing
algorithms and stuff like that is no
longer hard it is just takes time
sometimes more sometimes less but
actually figuring out what it is I'm
building for work or what it is I need
to do it's no longer hard it's kind of a
strange thing be honest at times dealing
I got a job shortly after your
restaurant review thanks really a
content man hey I'm glad I'm glad that
helped man uh I'm always glad I'm always
happy to help for those who don't know I
do mentoring sessions similar to what
the mysterious druid talks about where
where um I will review your resume
review your github review your Layton
LinkedIn answer your questions it's
about an hour long I charge $90 an hour
I do about one to two a month right now
I'm thinking about running a special
down to $60 for a short period of time
just to I need to get a little bit more
money in my pocket right now so if
that's something that you're you're
interested in maybe I'll you see a video
and then in the beginning where I say
hey for the next couple weeks I'm doing
a low cost low cost being $60 an hour
which may sound like a lot if you're you
know making if you
you're struggling and get by but
otherwise if I don't charge money for it
I'd be doing it all day for free so here
boy your boy would be at out there
trying to get some money otherwise but
um well yeah so one of the things I
think is really helpful is that just
throwing that out there if anyone's
interested so I do I like competitive
programming yes but do I do it
absolutely not
uh low time it's hard right so i I've
gone to a couple I've gone to a couple
so what I'm looking for a couple
hackathons and I love them I absolutely
love hackathons the problem is there's
far and few between at least in the
Tampa Bay area right now ever heard of a
hundred days of coding challenge yes I
have
I haven't ivan partake in it though
embarrassed ass but what's the
difference between a web app and a
website far and few between so the gist
of it though forties is is a web
application typically has a lot more
logic in the JavaScript aspect my web
site is really I mean but so a web app
lives can live in a web site but in a
traditional sense a web site is more of
a static HTML page while a web
application has some sort of tasks that
it's trying to accomplish and logic
that's built into the JavaScript where
you're trying to solve it a good example
of a website might be my web site coding
tutorials 360 calm where it's basically
just static data that's there while a
web app would be something like TurboTax
where you're entering inputs it's it's
rendering outputs based off those inputs
and it serves a function to help you do
your taxes right so that's a simple
example of maybe what a website the
difference between a website and a web
application is
big app laravel or some JavaScript
framework like react I'm guessing you're
talking about choosing between the two
just a fence do you wanna learn
JavaScript or do you want to learn lair
ville would face book be a web app yes I
would consider Facebook a web
application it displays ads to you based
off of your predefined criteria it has
it gives you the ability to post photos
comment on other things I mean at the
end of the day a web app is a website
and a website really is a web app but
typically when you say when you're
trying to make a comparison that is to
compare some it's it's complexity right
so it's like saying well if I were to
say like my cat right I have three cats
and I'm a human they are a cat we are
both biological beings but I am a
higher-order biological being because I
have the mental capabilities and the
physical capabilities that are greater
than the cat like we both fall into the
same category we're technically both
biological beings but I have
capabilities that are much more complex
and I can accomplish much more than the
cat I don't know I may have just
confused you with my cat analogy but the
point is a web app is very similar to a
website but there's a lot more logic
it's a lot more functionality
just got my cats looking you think
you're smarter than me huh I got nine
lives bitch what would be the most
effective way to learn coding through
your Deming courses using coding doing
the videos daily on udemy and then also
doing your own projects after
immediately after finishing the udemy
courses yeah 40 s I would say that would
be a a clear way of defining a web app
yeah doing projects by yourself so a lot
of the issues that I have with people on
udemy 'us oftentimes they just do the
udemy and they never build anything on
their own so I would say do the courses
on udemy they're super helpful they're
gonna expose you to a lot and then going
up build features and that's part of the
reason I add additional features after
my course on angular is I want you to go
in there and I want you to tinker around
on your own a figure a figure it out on
your own and and learn how many hours a
day do you code to really learn concepts
although I haven't been coding lately as
much because I'm my computer's been
breaking and all this other craziness on
the weekends uh I I have been usually
doing about four to eight hours
depending on how how much I'm digging it
and on the weekdays an hour maybe two
just kind of fence I bounce back between
algorithms projects YouTube I just try
to keep it fresh and fun for me what is
the best book to learn this in
JavaScript honestly I don't think you
need to read a whole book about this
this just refers to the surrounding
context so let's say my apartment would
be this right this is my apartment I'm
in my apartment so now let's say I'm in
a room in the apartment the room is now
this now let's say I'm the heart
of Dylan this is now Dylan there you go
I saved you a book uh uh I also you
couldn't tell you I don't read books and
Cody
when it's part two coming out when my
computer six I'm going to be releasing
the JavaScript course for free though
it's about five hours of content just
sort of breaking down a little bits and
pieces JavaScript so hopefully you guys
will find it helpful would it be
possible layer on top of a site like
YouTube where the layer could put a
timing feature
I watched YouTube videos when going to
sleep I'm sure it's possible there might
even be something in the YouTube API to
help with that we got our boy Ricky
motha f'n Garcia in here if you're not
if you're not a suberino to Ricky's
channel go ahead and drop
rikiya like one of the one of the
channels I watched pretty much every
video he puts out I loved his Saturday
live streams he also does live streams
where he seems to be in a different
coffee shop but with the same shitty
internet connection you need to stop
going to this to the shitty internet
cafes Ricky I'm getting sick of it I
turned it Ricky's a static image and
then he's talking but all I don't see
his mouth moving I'm gonna sick of it
Ricky you need to start getting you need
to test the Wi-Fi before you go these
these cafes all right how to contribute
to open source projects I would say when
you're just starting out worry more
about building your own stuff
contributing open-source will always be
a little bit skeptical but free code
camp has seven different projects that
are newbie friendly for for you to work
on did I get any gifts for Christmas I
got a couple I got a couple things the
the biggest thing that I bought was my
twenty seven hundred dollar computer for
myself um the the next thing that I the
next thing that I bought was C I bought
some fill cue lights for pack so we got
all the lights hooked up and a couple of
Google Wi-Fi
another similar question does using a
JavaScript front-end framework affect
customer experience better it can't I
mean it it just but really it's you get
in theory you can do everything in a
framework that you can do in vanilla
JavaScript but I mean yeah I mean I I
think John I think so if you're talking
about a page that doesn't have
JavaScript verse the page that does have
JavaScript yet that logic allows you to
make a more user friendly site by
dynamically displaying error messages by
disabling buttons dynamically all in
everything that goes along with that
what looks more impressive on the resume
open source contributions around
projects your goal should be both to
have both a lot of times people are
looking for a one-off answer once better
than the other than this or another guy
do it all both looks great your own
projects looks great because you built
something from scratch you didn't follow
a course you have something unique and
passionate your own project is amazing
open source contributions great as well
so like I encourage you to do both it
one sec guys I gotta use a little boy's
room
where is he gone I'm back don't you
worry my child we shall answer your
questions for another 24 minutes
approximately thank you for everybody
for tuning in by the way it's it's
always great to see so many people who
are trying to learn on Saturday before
we go back to answering questions let's
do a little bit of a shameless
self-promotion if you guys are
interested in an angular course I have a
great entry-level project that's three
and a half hours of content it's my
first course I've ever released it's on
udemy I believe there's a link in the
description if you're interested in the
bro do you even code shirt there should
be a link in the description as well and
if you want to support me you can at
patreon.com slash correct Orioles 360 as
well as donate your heart earn money
through Super chats you don't have to do
any of that I appreciate you guys just
showing up and watching the videos
sharing the videos liking the videos all
that you can do to help out and that's
free that's free and we'd all like free
especially if you use an adblock you
should definitely be sharing and like in
the video but yeah that's my
that's my shameless plug to myself so am
I happy with mother growth my channel um
so YouTube's an interesting thing
because most content creators myself
included have a love/hate relationship
with YouTube I feel like because almost
every one of my videos gets do monetized
and it's sad which is unfortunate
because I really don't have
controversial videos but my channel has
been growing in recent times I have been
you know uh I have to do a video I think
in May about it you so I have right now
I'm pulling it up right now to show you
guys or to talk about it
my views are up by my watch time's up by
about two percent my views are up by
about four percent for the month and my
subs are up about twenty seven percent
I'm getting about two thousand subs a
month how important is the LinkedIn
profile extremely it's a must-have do
you think 51k is little for a front-end
developer with three years experience in
the Midwest Ohio I've had the same
salary for three years if you've had the
same salary for three years you need to
be talking to somebody about another
company support your boy god code cut
Thank You Ricky Ricky's over here
donating his money I appreciate that but
uh I would tell you right now that if I
worked at any company that didn't give
me any sort of race after one year it
ain't gonna happen in here too because I
ain't gonna be there but yes fifty one
thousand is extremely low in my opinion
I work in Tampa in the Tampa area and I
make about 50% more than that with about
one year and one year experience when I
got that salary so but I don't know I I
particularly don't know the Midwest Ohio
area but I'm telling you I think it's
probably similar market maybe a little
less jobs but I would say you should be
willing to leave for a higher salary
elsewhere
for and and honestly Christopher I'm not
saying this like pick on you but you
really only have yourself to blame
having a skill set that is that is super
in demand and you not having a respect
enough for yourself to go and get a
different employer as a developer you
should never be having the same salary
year after year you could probably leave
and get a $25,000 raise easily
if you're doing a angular course which
is quite old in udemy or do they update
their courses some people update their
courses
it just kinda fence but yeah it is bad
to do outdated like why why are you
doing angular 2.2 when they're in
angular 5.1 it also depends on how
significant the changes were right but
yeah I mean honestly there's something
wrong with asking for a promotion or a
raise
tell them like look I think this is
where I'm at and see what they say and
if you don't like their answer just
start applying I mean it's uncomfortable
it's super uncomfortable right but you
know it's less uncomfortable the idea
that you're getting paid 20,000 to
30,000 dollars under what you should be
but that that all comes down to you it
really does you have to be after your
money cuz nobody else is you know it's
very rare that your boss is gonna come
up to me like hey I'm gonna give you
twenty thousand more dollars thanks for
killing it if that's your plan you're
more likely just not going to be getting
raises in the long term when I
interviewed for my current role they
asked me how I like to be rewarded for
my hard work and be be recognized for
being successful I said like I don't
need anyone to pat me on the shoulder
but large stacks of money is a great way
to reward me it was this honest about it
because I don't know about you guys but
I work a job because I need money that
doesn't mean I don't like my job that
doesn't mean that I don't like my work
or anything like that but the sole
reason I get up every morning and go to
said job is because said job will send
me a check every two weeks when they
stop sending me the checks every two
weeks I stop going to said job and my
goal and so should yours B is to be a
Ella / that is well compensated in that
term and the fact that you have worked
at a company for three years and you
haven't gotten a significant raise the
developer you were three years ago is
nowhere near the developer you are today
one should hope anyhow I could tell you
that I as a developer my skill is three
times as good as it was
well back as I was maybe a year and half
ago tips for a LinkedIn profile for a
beginner I have a whole video about it
I've videos called like tips for
LinkedIn when you have no work
experience I would encourage you to
check that out
any good book sorry about programming I
really don't read books about
programming
and that's an honest answer - so some
people may feel uncomfortable saying
like yo man do you want to reward me cut
the check right and some people may say
say yo man I don't know I'd feel really
uncomfortable saying that Johnny why
like what they asked it just be honest
honesty's the best policy guys in
everything he's okay - going to see us
with no coding knowledge how so you can
do it man most of us weren't born in the
womb being able to solve you know
algorithms okay and building our first
web app at age five nine I didn't start
look I didn't I didn't write any code
till I got in to see us myself into
college myself so hey our boy Romans
here
how you doing Roman but oh yeah man so I
wouldn't worry about getting CS no
coding knowledge now my advice to you is
to start practicing and learning to code
before you go into the CS program if
possible but you know it's always easier
said than done
but I think I think it's one of those
things where we're on a practical level
you'll do much better in in compute in
your computer science if you've gone and
and studied development before you start
right so I was reversing stringing the
Loom son how long have I been coding now
oh professionally like a year and a half
in reality probably like three and a
half four years
best code editor for a beginner best
creditor period is just Visual Studio
code in my opinion I've been loving it I
encourage you to check it out after
finishing front-end on free code camp
which to my next step be a chart from
the bottom now I'm here I would say
build it build out your own projects
that probably be a pretty good one for
you to start what projects I work on my
personal projects
I mean YouTube's the biggest one but in
terms of coding projects I'm currently
building a dev tools web application I'm
also building a pokémon pokédex using
the Pokemon API and and what's the other
one I was building Oh a full stack mean
voting application should I learn
WordPress no should be decent and at
algebra that would be my my advice I
think that's the basic math that you
would need you need to be able to do
algebra for most at least front-end
roles back in may be a little bit
different if I want back-end type things
are you working on
is it a waste of time to build a
portfolio from scratch with no
bootstrapper used in this trap I don't
think there's anything wrong with either
one it's just different one's gonna get
you familiar with bootstrap which is
used and common by a lot of companies
another is you're gonna just get better
CSS and so you definitely shouldn't use
WordPress have I use CSS Grade I'm not
what technology is what I recommend to
learn for a beginner searching to find a
place in web dev I did a video titled
about the top skills you need to be a
front-end developer and I talked a
little bit about why I chose those
skills but the gist of it is is you're
gonna need HTML CSS JavaScript ya get
and then you're going to need to pick up
a JavaScript front-end framework either
angular or react and then if you pick up
react or gonna have to pick up a few
other libraries that it uses and such as
redux and other things of that nature
but i would say that is the bare minimum
to get started with web dev favorite
JavaScript framework I'm really liking
angular the more I dive into angular the
more I'm kind of loving it it's been fun
it really has so I've been I've been
like an angular but I only play I only
built like three or four mini projects
maybe five mini projects Windows Mac or
Linux and why I personally use Windows
I've always used Windows but if if you
were to get any benefit out of an
operating system you'd probably do best
to learn Linux because it's a skill set
it's a skill in itself being familiar
with Linux that other developers aren't
going to have it's also something that
is used with servers quite frequently
and between all three operating systems
you probably already know Windows you
probably already know Mac or one of the
other you know that you could swap
between those two but Linux is the one
that is going to be less known and in
some cases will help you land a role
while the other ones don't help you land
anything
still worth they learn jQuery 2018 I put
that as my in my list I put that as my
sub-optimal uh my supplemental there you
go supplemental skills
I think jQuery is just something that
you're kind of expected to know and
touch with it's not something that I
think is going to break the bank I think
you should focus your time on angular or
react that's what I think I know and
that by the way it can just be you can
look at the market for what's paying
well and where the jobs are at and it's
reactor it's angular and it might have
jQuery on there but nine times out of
ten they don't give a about that
and you know just look at the job market
right it's easy enough way to know what
to code is you just look at the job
market
I already told you that you should be
using the visual studio code text editor
I say should but that's what I would
recommend have I got the new computer
yet no I save 5% by letting it ship
after two weeks so probably won't be
here for two more weeks yeah I'm gonna
trust me man I'm dying just as much as
you guys I have several projects on here
that's one of the things I have to do is
I have to actually go you get my get up
you can see my github be blowing up with
 on it so it's gonna be fun
what was your first contact with
development in general and what moment
do you consider the one that you got
interested starting to learn more really
the thing that kind of made me really
start to love webbed up web dev is
specifically building projects when I
when I built my first project which was
the open weather API project from free
code camp org it was something that is
the first real thing that I built that
wasn't just like solving an algorithm in
Java and I absolutely fell in love with
it that was that was like like I'm
getting somewhere
progress is being me I'm like I was just
really enjoyed building stuff and that
was it that was kind of the aha moment
where I was just like I loved it after
that any idea for the final year college
project I would say one of the cool
things that you could do is something
cryptocurrency related part of it is
because well there's it's a space that's
exploding right now in terms of jobs
part of it is something that I'm
interested in but I would say trying to
do some try and do something that's hot
a nice final project that will help you
land a job that's my advice don't do a
final project that you necessarily want
to do because you think it's easy or you
can get an A do a project that you think
is going to in
press employers in a minute area we're
okay
this is something that would show I'm
interested in finding for instance good
because there's a ton of money in that
space so might be something that would
be kind of how I would choose what would
you be doing if you didn't code probably
something equally competitive that I
think I could make money at digital
marketing might be something that I
would be doing electrician would be
something I'd be interested in just
because I think I would choose something
that would it so here's the here's the
really integrates I don't know that I
could be doing anything else that
wouldn't be in software in tech because
the way that I got started was I just
looked at the top 20 jobs and like 15 of
them were in software in tech so I
choose I guess we if we say I don't go
into any of the other 15 and I don't go
into project management our business
analyst for a company I I guess I go
into healthcare
but I wouldn't interests me my whole
thing is high salaries a large job
growth and a lot of it lots of available
jobs what's the average yearly salary of
front-end dev usually makes it depends
on the region but I would say that a
fair starting average salary my first my
first full stack role in the Tampa area
I got I started at 62 and I think that's
probably pretty accurate for most people
not for all but for most but also it
depends on the area we just had a guy in
here who said he was making fifty one
last three years
do you ever run into issues of the
tension and focus while coding only if
I'm tired but I I'm pretty good with my
sleep schedule and I think it's a good
thing to have is a solid sleep schedule
so that's usually the only time ever
start having sleep if I if I am just
tired
I don't dingy enough sleep that's when
issues start happening
alright guys I got about five more
minutes so if you're holding any good
questions that you want answered before
I take off please say them now or
forever hold your peace
until next livestream would you enjoy
programming audio drivers I don't know
I've never done that probably
interesting to see what it is
have a good one Roman
you don't need to worry about typing
type speed or anything like that as a
developer what are your thoughts on it
sloth slash advice on aspiring
developers branding themselves in order
to help them get a job I think it's the
best thing you do it's one of the best
things I ever did with my youtube
channel I'm able to get larger salaries
and better roles because not only do I
show passion and interesting project I
am essentially marketing myself at the
same in the same way how do you how to
find projects of free cocaine front-end
build your own define define what you
want to build and do it
I only learn lamp stack should I take
the time to learn mean stack if you want
to have some fun but there's more jobs
in lamp stack probably projected to hit
100,000 subs well I'm grown by two
thousand subs and say it doesn't
increase it's like three years two years
now two years from now allegedly if I
grow by two thousand a month and I don't
increase my growth at all I'm 16 I would
love to be a web developer however
however yes degree where I live is way
too expensive what do you recommend that
I do I recommend that you go and perhaps
if you want to get a degree you could go
and do two things one you could go and
get an associates in information
technology and you could go into the WGU
program where from there they they have
a couple of requirements but that
associates will knock out a bunch of
courses in WGU and then you'll play a
flat rate of about thirty five hundred a
semester but really what I would
recommend is for you just to become a
self-taught developer and perhaps go to
a boot camp and then if you choose to
after you hit the working world when you
no longer have to take out loans similar
to what I'm doing I'm paying for school
all out-of-pocket don't need to take out
a loan and I so I won't have any debt
from school
but that would be my recommendation
that's what I would do if I was 16 I go
the self-taught route and I felt like I
needed a boot camp to tie it all
together I'd do that and then I would go
and hit the working world and from there
I would decide if I wanted to go back to
school how often are the livestreams I
usually do one on Saturday am I glad
that I ended up third on on just 20
YouTube channels that's what Eric said I
didn't really follow it too much up but
I mean it's cool I mean I I think it's
cool it's always cool people
appreciating you and and voted for you
and recognizing you and stuff like that
you know come in third add 20 people
ain't too shabby
that's bronze baby we placed we got the
medals am i idiot for paying first yes
sir you know but you could be an idiot
if you make sure that you stay at a job
for longer than a year
and they don't give you any raises and
then that Cs degree just you're paying
debt on it for a decade instead of like
three years but a lot of people I mean a
lot of people need that structured
environment it's hard to on self talk
around it's not for everybody man and a
lot of people they can't handle the
failure that goes along with being a
self-taught Deb there's a lot of
controls that I got that I wanted that I
got turned down for because I don't have
a degree so anyhow on that note guys I
appreciate you all thank you so much for
watching don't forget to support me on
the channel by liking the video sharing
the videos subscribing if you are not
already subscribed and commenting I like
I read every single comment I respond
back to a lot of them and so I do a lot
of a lot of you guys I've asked really
cool everyone's sharing their inputs on
here it's a nice little coding community
and I appreciate that I appreciate that
you guys do that so don't forget to
support me on patreon is that something
you're interested
as well your boys going back to school
got to pay for it out of pocket so any
help is appreciated I will see you next
time have a wonderful weekend your boys
going to be posting a bunch of old code
on his github maybe I'll do a maybe I'll
do it I'll do it my own github video
github review the dive deep into it so
you guys can see what sort of nasty
projects I have on there in an upcoming
video so I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
