backing core objects the are you back in
JavaScript corner objects let's go ahead
and jump right in we're talking about a
race here so arrays are pretty great you
can create an array by just saying new
array what two keywords are needed to
create an array array and new array this
little outdated you can also just set it
equal to brackets and that will work as
well so document that right are one so
if you're if we're trying to output the
one index remember arrays always start
on index 0 that would be the number six
here I took to access the index outside
of the array returns a value of
undefined so if we were trying to access
index 10 because there's only three
index Lots it's not going to have
anything it's just going to turn back
undefined
you can also declare an array of
variables and display please insert the
missing characters output the third
member of the array so what we want is
the brackets and then our third member
would be the second index let's see here
let's continue on I'm not even gonna
read this we'll go back if we make a
mistake by entering the variable example
new array we create an empty array which
can be filled anytime later you don't
have to fill an array immediately you
can create an empty one and do something
with it later just in quit no problem
thanks thanks for the add Matt on
Facebook yeah well good it fish is up
and gesture Jarek we'll talk about how
you can better your channel moving
forward all right
the length property so we've talked
about length you can also do it
on a it is a function and object or a
variable so it's not I don't want to
call it a function but maybe it is I
think it's a property so it's like let's
see let's see what happens yeah all
right so it's definitely a variable then
no why are we gotta go back I gotta read
more about the lanes property it's just
like I've used it all the time built-in
Emily pressures the line throw bears
always one more the highest array index
is dot length cause the fun it's a
function really wait an object it's an
object it's a property as a prop our
properties considered objects hey one
more game a league I don't know man
we'll see JavaScript scream cat
basically takes one array and combines
it with another to make a new array so
let's see here
not too bad associative arrays
let's see here you can set something
like this where you kind of create a key
value pair and then pass that in to find
that so in associate rate index numbers
are replaced with strings associative
arrays oh if you use the name index
although I've never done that
and my personal coding or work so I'm
not quite sure how how helpful it is but
I'm sure it is sometimes in order to use
associate arrays associated name is put
in the brackets cool parentheses
brackets the math object so math is all
I see so these are considered objects
I thought the math would be considered
library I guess is math object so math
basically just you know get things like
pi get the max number then generate a
random number so which is falling does
not exist messed up by math dot ABC so
these are all the math objects I highly
suggest if you're new to JavaScript of
printing this out and adding it to your
adding it to your kind of cheat sheets
when you're trying to look and have like
a little booklet of it in the math
object which of the following methods is
used to calculate the square root so I
believe it's square root there you go
the math object last number put in
calculates the number and output it and
all that started all that sort of Jess
what's the square root of 81 that is 9 9
times 9 is 81 so the math object will do
the square root of it like so and then
the date object you have set interval so
a set interval will actually do things
every millisecond so 3,000 milliseconds
is actually one sec all right three
seconds excuse me so we want to call the
calc function and then run it every
2,000 milliseconds or two seconds
the date object let's see here so uh the
date objects another object is just
quite a bit when dealing with databases
and storing dates which is pretty common
I I do this quite a bit so you'll have
to manage your date objects you'll use
things like filter to output the date in
the format you want or to convert the
date and the the correct way that you
want what information results from
creating a date object the current date
and time unless you set it to something
so if you just create a brand-new date
it'll take the current date in time so
you can get get full-year get month
these are all great methods as well to
just only get a part of it so fill in
the blanks initialize days recommending
so we have our date is equal to a new
day and this will get the current date
as we're saying and let's see the quiz
here so given the right below please
complete the expression to be alerted
with Apple so fruits and then we want to
call the last index Apple or the second
last second index go
what is the following result alert of
math square root so square root of 36 is
6 and please fill in the blanks to
output the current minutes so Lert date
dot get minutes and then what is the
output of this code so new rate on the
one index would be B and then fill in
the blanks to get larger it's a value
apply constant so we want to alert math
dot pie which will alert the value of
pie from the math library cool so that
was pretty good
as always guys don't forget to comment
like subscribe and share the videos I
appreciate you guys for watching in
support and those who support me on
patreon comm slash coding tutorials 360
and as
always look forward to our weekly Friday
interview / podcasts that we do with
devs called behind the code where we
talk about a little bit of everything in
their specialties and all that so it's
our new series comes out every Friday
check it out I'll see you guys in the
next video thanks for watching
special thanks to our sponsor dev
Mountain if you're interested in a
coding bootcamp why don't you check them
out where they include housing alongside
their tuition so you can get up go and
immerse yourself in the environment if
you want to support me go over to
patreon.com slash coding tutorials 360
so we can put out more content thanks
