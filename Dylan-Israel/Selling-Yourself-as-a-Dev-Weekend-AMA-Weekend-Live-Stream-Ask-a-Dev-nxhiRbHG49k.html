weekend livestream we are back for a
little bit earlier today about 7:30 a.m.
eat est we are going to be starting off
by talking about a little something I
think a lot of people struggle with and
it's not that hard to fix if you if you
make an active attempt to do it and
that's basically what I'm cleaning
selling yourself as a developer and I
think this is a important aspect to have
and it's something I've struggled with
in a sense to be humble that I think
I've left money on the table in the past
because of it so I mean by selling
yourself as a developer and for those of
you who are new to the weekend live
stream every Saturday we do a live
stream where I usually will start off
with the topic in this case selling
yourself is a developer and then as you
as people funnel in will start taking
questions so I'll just you know it's
basically a little bit of mentoring it's
kind of how I look at it where you know
nobody was really there for me when I
was trying to get my start and answer
some questions so that's what this is
all about it's about answering those
questions so and we do that every week
for about an hour
sometimes a little bit more so selling
yourself as a developer we're when
you're an employee when you're trying to
get a job of any type you have to have
your pitch right you have to have your
you're sort of you know your bullet
points about why you're great and you
say Dylan I'm not great well you need
change that mentality cuz no one wants
to hire somebody who's not engraved
right so either you really are just
awful
or you're great ok so and what I what I
sort of mean but
that is when an employer has your resume
there may be things on there they don't
understand are all that great they may
not understand that having a YouTube
channel why that's a great thing they
may not understand why the three code
camp certificate what that entails so
it's up to you to say you know take the
free code camp certificate you know it's
500 hours of coursework it is you know
10 projects 30 algorithms a bunch of you
know courses and you sell them on the
skills that you picked up and how that
led you down this road you say okay well
I started free code camp and I did all
this stuff that got me introduced to
HTML CSS JavaScript jQuery from there I
started building things in angularjs I
then got my my role here and then I
started doing react and I started doing
this angular 2 and then you start you
have to sell them on you as a developer
and if you already don't have those
things
pitched in your mind about who you are
as an employee who you're trying to
represent yourself as it's gonna be hard
so I I just want to sort of make a
general announcement of saying like like
if I were to you were the employer
I am the employee and you're trying to
get you and they say hey don't tell us a
little bit about yourself you know well
okay well I'm self-taught dev I was in a
computer science program but I really
really was miserable up there in it it's
okay I had a little bit of humor by the
way and I told myself I was gonna soft
offer out and that's why I started doing
things like free code camp which is an
open-source boot camp it's 500 hours of
coursework yeah yeah yeah oh right and
start building projects and I have my
youtube channel which I really love it's
a passion project of mine where I'm you
know I'm touching you know I'm I'm
having some sort of influence and
helping those who are you know below my
level or want to learn now you know I
have a million minutes watched every
month you know throw that million out
there that's a big word right people
like that million minutes watched every
month and I've volunteered through
co.org and I go to meetups I meet up
some on the regular and I'm basically
looking for an environment
where I can progress as a developer what
I want to do is I just want to make sure
that the developer I am a year later is
going to be twice a developer I am today
and that that would be my one minute to
90 second pitch about so tell us a
little about yourself and then I might
go into like oh you know I also write in
a book and I have some udemy courses and
then I've my girlfriend I've been dating
for about eight years and then the women
in the room was there saying women it's
like eight years and they say yeah yeah
you know we're gonna settle down finish
three cats and that's really me in a
nutshell
but you have to have that you have to
have that sort of pitch ready you have
to practice it you have to make it feel
fluid and a so obviously I'll be true as
well
so um something something to consider so
but I do feel like especially at any
junior level role that you need to focus
on you and selling yourself there is a
cod look at these black eye
circles on is Jesus I look like I'm
walking dead but I would say please
please please focus on having that ready
because at the end of the day you have
to sell yourself if someone they are
giving you a job and you need to be able
so you could be the best developer in
the world with the best ideas and if you
don't if you don't brand it properly if
you don't package it properly properly
if you give to somebody it's it's just
gonna it's just not gonna work out
that's the that's just a tough reality
you know
so just so they consider walking down
yeah
all right um feels good to wash down
after coding for almost three hours a it
ain't one of those type of webcam show
thing I'll say ah let's see a little bit
little you got here so I was this if I
sounded through my stuff like this hey
there recruiter I'm experiencing DevOps
by learning myself to become a web dev
here with my portfolio would he still be
looking into my portfolio PS no
experience didn't get worked up working
yeah man I mean there's plenty of places
that want developer chef what DevOps
experience all those skills they all
help now I don't know that you're just
gonna reach out to your recruiter and
they're gonna get you a job
usually it's hard for her to do anything
unless you're an easy sell that's kind
of my opinion about recruiters I am an
easy sell
for any junior level role I am
passionate I can I have an active github
I have ton of side projects I have my
youtube channel I interview well for the
most part my communication skills as a
developer are probably in the top 10
percent so i'ma need to tell so
recruiters like working with me the only
thing that they don't like working with
me is that I cost a lot of money I get
good people all the time recruiters all
the time reaching out a lot of phone
calls first thing I say is if you can't
get me this salary range we have no
point to have a phone call about 9 out
of 10 say that can't alright cool so
that's the only thing recruiters don't
like because the recruiters want easy
sales and it's harder to sell something
even if you're a great product in this
case I'm the product right or you're the
product a recruiter their product is an
employee a potential candidate even if
you're a great product not everyone
wants to spend money on the high-end
products like they don't you know there
is a point there so um like I don't
accept roles that are at market value I
don't want to be at market value I want
to be above market value and a lot of
recruiters want to get you at market
value or below
good value if that's the case that's
cool you're just not gonna be working
with me so just I mean when you sort of
take that mentality of you are the
product even as an employee being
interviewed by the employer you need to
you need to sell yourself that's the
truth no one saying lie but you need to
present yourself in a good light and you
need to give them the information about
why you're such a great product have I
not been sleeping no I usually do I went
out drinking last night uh but I got
sleep I probably went to bed at 10:00
ish and I got home around like 9:00 and
then I read a couple chapters of the
book I've been reading and then yeah I
know as far as just alcohol this really
tired
what's my IQ I don't know I've taken a
couple of those online IQ tests and I've
scored very high but I couldn't tell you
out so it was a long time ago well you
can do that now because you have
experience what about someone who
doesn't work have work experience as a
developer well I I'm not telling you to
take no one so look you think I was
arguing for above market compensation
with look man I got no experience what
is 70,000 so I'm only 90 90 90 no
experience no come on man you know we
all have to start somewhere my very
first internship was two hours away and
I was going to pay $12 an hour two hours
each way so I was doing this stupid
internship for three months and it's $12
an hour two hours there two hours back
two hours there two hours back I know so
I was getting up at like 4:00 or 5:00
a.m. every morning driving there's awful
um but I did it because I wanted the
experience and I did because there's my
game plan on how to become a developer
and then from there I took a role I
start freelancing I got paid $15 an hour
my first freelance gig then I got paid
$20 an hour and then I ended up
as a technology trainer like a technical
writer sort of roll what's going on with
my hair here a technology trainer over
20 to an hour and then I got my first
developer job but um but yeah you don't
just start out I mean you don't
necessarily start off at you know six
figures or at eight you know 35 an hour
or whatever it is whatever you consider
what a large amount of money but you do
work you're at are you sure you don't
want to go back to university I'm so
unbelievably positive I had that
conversation yesterday with my course
mentor bless his heart I understand
where he's coming from
but like here's the thing man
realistically in the next two years two
to three years I'll probably be making I
already make what probably might at
between YouTube and like courses what
that degree would have given me in terms
of stuff sorry but in terms of happiness
I definitely do not want to go back to
school I mean I knocked out three
courses in in three months and then I
had to Morris Kanaka I just couldn't do
it boys I'll be honest with you man
I need is it was taken away everything
from my soul and what I see this is
what's crazy is it was actually exactly
what I wanted this is this is itself how
much my brain is just like anti
structured waste of time is how i anteye
anteye degree programs is it was exactly
what I wanted it was a quick route and a
cost effective route to get a degree I
would give it an I still given I intend
but it's just not the right environment
for me to excel at
oftentimes we try to put ourselves in
these boxes that the world has said this
is how you succeed this is what's right
this is what's wrong
and we try to conform ourselves to that
and I forgot that the way that I've been
able to succeed it's like going my own
route that the most successful that I
have ever been in my life is by just
blazing my own path and you definitely
don't do that in college of any type so
you know how am I gonna make up so so
well you have to what you have to do is
when you when you make these decisions
and I'm writing a book about it's called
going rogue the self-taught develop for
flavor right and so you might see me
doing some live streams on Twitch
writing it and whatnot but the thing the
thing you have to consider is okay I'm
not getting a degree I'm already working
developer but let's say I'm starting
from the get-go right I want to be a
developer I'm not getting in degree how
do i how do I break that door down how
do I jump right in and gets charged well
you have to do other things you have to
go a non-traditional route and does that
mean that you just took a four-year
shortcut and saved yourself 40 grand no
but it does mean that you have I mean it
does mean that but there's a four-year
shortcut you have to make up for that
how are you gonna make up for that well
I'm going to do some personal branding
I'm going to I'm going to write a book
I'm going to build courses I'm going to
have a YouTube channel I'm going to
volunteer I'm going to get certificates
but to get into management positions you
kind of mean to that degree yeah that's
fair that is something that's more than
likely to be a requirement but the more
I think about it the more I just want to
work for myself one day right so five
years from now ten years from now when I
probably have the amount of years that I
would need to be in a management
position I would probably with YouTube
with the udemy courses probably then
books you know in a good in a good
month right now with YouTube with
YouTube ad revenue with courses
affiliate links I'm making like $1500 a
month and so that's a pretty solid
amount of money to be making I'm not
even three years into YouTube and so
let's let's say you know the channel
growth doubles every year something like
that I don't think that's too too too
unrealistic you know the money starts
piling in and so that money that I
wanted for management and all that I get
that from you too but really what I just
want to do I sort of code man as crazy
as that sounds I just want to code I've
started projects I've I know I just want
couldn't be happy I guess and so when I
was doing these things
am I not possible of forcing myself to
go through this program oh no I
definitely could do it I've the classes
I'm finishing you know in the class
every two three weeks cannot afford it
no paying it out of pocket you know
didn't take a single dollar of debt to
do it can I can I have the time no I I
mean I slowed down my progress every
morning I woke up worked on it every day
I came home I can't worked on it you
know was it hard no passes my final
every first time passed it like that but
is it the best decision for my career
and that's debatable because the best
decisions I've ever made for my career
is placing my own path and so how do I
make up for this I'm no longer going
down the school route well you do it by
you have I'm launching my first web
application in the next three months
like actually launching it it's going to
be a long term project I maintain
continue with the book continue with the
courses that's all I just do the self
taught right so let's see here
what does the right pay for a no
experience that was actual number that
can be considered decent that varies by
location and varies by skill
honestly I'd where do you worry less
about pay and just more about experience
so you can always try and get paid well
but I would say take a role list even if
they paid you minimum wage as long as it
had you know front-end engineer software
engineer in the title and you were doing
that sort of stuff I would say take that
role three to six months and start
applying elsewhere forever real a real
salary how many years before you
consider yourself a professional I think
your professional once you get hired by
somebody else or you have web
applications are deployed and effective
and making you money Dylan I'm working
for a small family business which I love
they pay me ten dollars an hour and I'm
doing some pretty complex projects
creating managing five websites how do I
get them to pay me more I mean you could
have a basic conversation about what
your market rate is but what I would
suggest you even more so before you have
that is to have another offer in hand go
to them say have apply elsewhere it
sounds like you're doing some great
stuff apply elsewhere get an offer that
day talk to them and talk to them about
that exact thing and if they say all
right well based off what this offer has
you're gonna get around 20 an hour maybe
double your income either take that
offer or you know if you really want to
work with these people catch them and
ask them to match it and a lot of people
aren't about matching it but you can you
can ask you can just hit them with the
ultimatum
and go oh no I ain't going back dude let
me tell you so the one thing that I'll
say I got ad this I guess just so I got
two certs out of it out of going back to
school and but the one thing that
I am I got out of out of all of this all
this last three and a half months of
just sort of soul-searching with college
well not is that I got the answer that I
am NOT going back ever again we're not
going back remember you remember the
remember the guy and lost and and he
said we have to go back oh yeah you go
back and everyone's looking at him like
crazy just invert that situation
look we're never go back go back
that's for those you were like 10 or 15
you may not understand lost reference
that's okay just roll with it
so yeah man so I mean it's basically a
$3,500
learning experience that said you know
what I got I got my answer and and now I
now I know what I have to do but I uh I
God there is one awful situation where I
might go back I have trouble saying no
to free things so if a company came to
me says it came to me and said huh hey
see even everyone says no I pilled heard
that never let me go back to college but
if a company told me look we want to
make you this position but we need you
to go get a bachelor's in some
just any it doesn't matter from
what school doesn't matter what it's in
but some we're gonna pay for it
that would be the only situation it's
and that would be a great situation to
be in like hey we want to give you this
fast salary this phat title all that
sort stuff but we got it we just gotta
get you this little degree
I'm company policy or something like
that that would probably be the only way
I go about it but but I yeah I don't I
don't I receive you myself going back
but that's really that was kind of the
benefit of going back and getting that
answer right
oftentimes we the things that bother us
most
in life are the the items that we never
did those things that could have been
whether you were successful or whether
it was a failure it's the not knowing
that is the problem and now I know that
I am never giving a degree so I have I'm
okay with that and this goes back to the
video about what I did when I turned 30
I did I did read about five things I
wish I knew and even then like so one of
my points was just love yourself with
who you are and accept yourself for who
you are and what and you know who I am
is not somebody who likes college it's
not somebody who succeeds in college and
and survives it and finds a lot of value
in it and so it's very hard for me to
get motivated to go and really get that
piece of paper that's how I kind of look
at it at the end of the day so but that
was kind of was it I've not heard
anything about the CS program for rwg
you when you're looking on stackoverflow
through these road jobs should you apply
to these senior dogs if you're
comfortable node rectangular bit anymore
now you never heard supply jobs takes
two to three minutes of your time but I
mean I personally am of the belief that
you should be working in house for the
first several years of your your your
career I think it's good for your career
I think it's good for your skill set and
I think you'll learn a lot more and it's
gonna be very hard to get remote roles
when you first get started
do you love spending money tell us a
little bit about your financial habits
so I am very fiscally conservative I
would say I have paid I have zero debt I
have one credit card which is there to
build credit I
my car's paid off I have no student
loans I have
I've zero debt lifts quite literally
there is not a dollar of debt there's
not a dollar of debt for me I save fifty
percent of my income I buy things cash
I'm a big believer I'm a big believer
that if you can't buy it cash you don't
you shouldn't have it so yes I say that
you have to buy cash I'm going to be
buying a new car relatively soon April's
gonna take my my current car and I'm
gonna go buy myself a Honda Civic Sport
it's like a hatchback Civic basically so
that's the car I'm gonna be buying
myself and I'll be financing about five
grand of that the reason I'm financing
the five grand yes I want to build
credit because that's the world we live
in but I'm a big believer that if you
can't buy a cash you don't you're not
ready to buy it like like like like if
you can't if you have to finance your
phone I'm not saying you don't find
answer your phone but I'm saying if you
have to because you can't save $900 or
$800
then you need to you need to consider
not making such bad financial decision
saying you don't need the phone you
don't need $800 $800 phone so but yeah
so I save fifty percent of my income I
buy things cash I you know do grocery
shopping April and I don't go out too
often the one area where I could
definitely improve upon is I got to
lunch with my co-workers every day spend
anywhere from 10 to 20 dollars on the
lunch usually on the lower end it's very
rare for me to spend $20 on the lunch
well yeah I mean I invest I play around
with investments go from there
but that's just I'm I save money I'm
currently paying for both of us April's
unemployed so
that's something that is draining in the
investments a little bit as well as
coach right college just cost me thirty
five hundred dollars in the last three
months so the egg theory huh
but yeah uh this no this is the
essential oil diffuser the thing that
you think is thrown at the steam I mean
just kind of cool you off I guess that's
not its point do you feel there is a
stigma against web developers we're in
software engineers are developing in
languages like Java C++ C sharp F become
superior already complex uh no I mean I
worked with the bulk of my work is to
c-sharp devs working with dotnet core
which is specifically designed for you
know web development and managing data
all you're basically talking about there
with java c CC felicity sharp is be able
to do the backend so what you're really
asking is there's stigma against front
end versus back end developers because
the bulk of what development is now web
dev so no I don't think so
imagine I do think that do you think
that where you might be interpreting
there isn't that they are web developers
and then you have the the C the C++ to
c-sharp what I think you're saying there
is web developers by and large
especially on the front end have usually
less traditional education sometimes and
so because of that you have people who
have maybe more traditional education
because you know Java C Sharpless are
things that taught in a computer science
program a lot of times and you know
traditional object-oriented programming
languages and so you have computer
science majors first the
rogue devs you know and so do CS majors
have a problem with the rogue devs and
although I would say most of the time no
I would say there is some sort of some
sort of correlation with that and more
so than other than the other Matt
because I have seen but but this goes
for any IC I hate making this point
because we're talking about a very small
percentage of people there are people
who have chips on their shoulders all
the time there's a guy who I on LinkedIn
the guy who basically said I know you
know delivery drivers could could make
coding tutorials all he does on LinkedIn
is post about how bad coding boot camps
is this guy is clearly a senior
developer he's doing great for himself
but he clearly has a chip on his
shoulder about whatever so there are
people like that if I ever worked
anywhere you knew more than than the
senior dev oh that's a very loaded
question
I mean there's certain things I've known
more on certain topics my last workplace
the senior dev was a better developer
than I was but he definitely didn't know
angular very well and he wasn't
JavaScript to have you smart of PHP dev
so there's things they even knew I was
probably more familiar with I think it's
a better way of putting it I think
you're trying to say that well you ever
in a situation where your boss was an
idiot and you knew better and I don't
really like to look at it that way what
I would like to say is that there's so
much to know and software that it is not
beyond the realm of possibility that
when it comes to certain subject matters
that that you'll know things and they'll
know things and even in my current
situation my tech lead is brilliant he's
just a super smart guy on a different
level but then there's things that I
know that he doesn't know right just
even
things like yo you don't have to do this
in the HTML little things so when you
say like you know are you in a situation
where it like oh man my lead is an idiot
or might my senior dev I'm working with
this how does this guy even half senior
and his name I haven't been in one of
those situations but there are times
where you'll know something they won't
know they obviously know things you
don't know and I think it's you have to
have a healthy approach to that and not
just look if someone's an idiot or not
which is kind of hook that question is
asking how much does it cost on average
for living in Florida I'm not quite sure
how the way that but it is much cheaper
than Los Angeles California how's it
going well man no speaking if you've
made it this far
yeah so some of you guys have been
bitching about my live streams going up
and being taken down the weekend ama
stay up but the me where I'm doing some
free writing or I'm doing some some live
coding I take those down because it's
bad experience I'm often listening to
music in the background but but but but
but but I have now set up restream which
will stream it to YouTube and to twitch
at the same time and so although I would
be taking the videos down on YouTube
I am leaving them up on twitch.tv slash
Dylan Israel that's it all that's and
you can go and watch the live streams
that are there so if you really want to
watch the live streams that is an
alternative for you it's also a great
way for me to build my Twitter just
saying but uh but yeah so uh if you go
to twitch.tv slash Dylan Israel you'll
see that there's now the live streams
that are being there blast you have been
up there so that's something I wanted to
announce I'll probably do say something
in upcoming video value as well
do you consider yourself runner
front-end or full stack uh well although
I am employed to do front-end I am
learning to do the here's here's the
thing uh when so I consider myself full
stack I am employed as a friend and
engineer most of us will at one time be
full stack with our roles but the
problem becomes not ru full stack but
and this is something I was talking
about last night at the bar with my
co-workers is in reality we have four we
have four front-end devs that might work
and then we have about 20 full stack and
I used quotes there in full stack
because most of the full stack devs
don't do front-end they're all back in
dev so are they truly full stack now can
they jump into the JavaScript can they
jump into the HTML yeah they can jump in
but they're gonna butcher it most of the
time and that's not to say that about
everybody but it does happen
so do I consider myself full stack yes
would I go into the backend and probably
butcher the the backend as I'm you know
would it work yeah would I would it be
the most monstrosity of codes you know
probably to someone who's a backing
developer yes obvious so do you consider
myself full stack I build full stack
projects outside of work
so do I use any UX UI techniques for the
job now this is something I want to take
a course on actually on udemy is I want
to get better at UX UI cuz I'm I can't
design for it's very good resource
understanding this and when to use them
for JavaScript this just really deferred
refers to context I think to understand
this is just try to understand just
start using this and seeing how it's
what is connected to what it's related
to and it'll make a lot of sense
we're starting a live episode show and
want to get off Facebook live extreme to
our on-site Plus YouTube twitch is it
difficult
no you just use a restream probably and
then you might have to use some API
stuff yeah this my company a monster no
actually this is the best company I've
ever worked at I have nothing but nice
things to say about my company although
I am a little bit frustrated with them
on on something on something right now I
don't want to throw my business out
there why do you choose to sell your
courses on udemy and not make a website
and marketing it I very well may make a
website down the road really oh you know
ten dollars a month get all my courses
15 dollars a month to something like
that but part of the reason was I wanted
to before I have that have at least 10
courses out where you're really getting
a nice value and I also wanted to put it
out there oh is my computer monster yeah
I got a beast of the computer I have 32
gigs ram I got a liquid cooling I also
have a 12 core AMD thread Ripper and
then I have SSD and it let me I'll give
you a little peek it can you see that
through there all right and I got my GTX
10 atti over there and I got room for it
to grow if for some reason I need more
than 32 gigs of RAM I can add another
two and they ahh but yeah so I have a
pretty beastly computer but yes so um
that was that was a that's a treat to me
yeah I'm most I can change all those
colors if I wanted to but
um but yeah so I probably will
eventually just launch a $10 month
platform you some sort of teachable or
something like that but uh by the way
that computer was $2,700 a lot of
straight cash started out there
technically technically to build credit
I financed it for three months by
basically about I bought it cash I paid
it off in two um but um but yeah so I
probably will but I on udemy
I mean udemy school because for one they
have a lot of tools built in and they
they introduce you to most of most of
what you're gonna be doing on on udemy
is going to be what's what you're gonna
be doing on udemy is you're going to get
money from let me see if I can pull up
my revenue report just to show you
you're getting money from me selling my
own course but there are situations
where let me show you how much where you
can make money from udemy itself right
so like udemy organic you know meaning
that people just discovered it I've made
a couple hundred dollars I've made
probably about a fourth of the money
just for I beat people discovering it on
udemy so there is that aspect of it as
well so not only do I get that extra
money but I also get people that
normally wouldn't discover it do I
much not anymore no I do have a
Playstation I've uh yeah I've
PlayStation Pro I have my computer that
could play anything on Macs right but
now I don't really game too much anymore
how did you become debt-free do you have
a lot of debt when we started working
I've never had more than about seven
thousand dollars in debt and a lot of
that was car debt credit card debt and I
just paid him off one by one
when I had credit card debt I had like
three thousand dollars for two thousand
dollars
I borrowed it from my brother I closed
the cards because I couldn't be trusted
so I was like 20 by the way this was a
long time ago and I paid my brother back
slowly but surely it's something I've
always appreciated that he did for me
and now I have one credit card that I
got maybe six months ago just help build
a credit again and yeah I just been
paint building my credit back up just
pay it off
what PC do I use at work I use a windows
don't you think it's cheap I think of
course should be worth some $50 at least
you think what it's worth well it's
gonna be worth but uh what are people
actually gonna pay for it so I charge
anywhere from ten to fourteen ninety
nine with my coupon code it's a possible
credit ecommerce website using note
among Adobe as back in yet why would it
be
um how long we've been going guys
we got another 20 minutes hi what do you
think about the Mac versus PC I'm
needing a upgrade bad with some in stats
for deaf computers this great thing
about web dev you don't really need that
big of a computer that great of a
computer I also think this whole Mac
first PC thing is just something made up
by by people who have no idea what
they're talking about it doesn't really
matter what matters is you getting your
job done in in whatever environment
comfortable and is if that's a Mac
excellent if that's a Windows cool um
any live streams coming this weekend
I'll probably be live streaming me
working on some projects yeah don't be a
shell don't be an apple she'll don't be
a Windows shell it's okay to like won it
over the other but uh how deeply take
your angular core suppose the next
project actually just the course just
came out I have a video on Monday
talking about it it's angular 360 part 2
and there we talked about components we
talked about services we talked about
pipes we we do unit testing and Jasmine
and Carmen we also use github to push it
we use bootstrap for and I'm probably
even one thing out but we it's a
six-hour course building an awesome
cryptocurrency project so we're hitting
all these cryptocurrency api's they're
sort team there's filtering we also
built a chart that shows a year of data
on Bitcoin
it was a really fun project so it's out
right now if you want to use if you're
interested in it I'll throw a link up
and chat that you can get it for just
ten dollars six it came out six hours of
content though and then it was it was a
lot of fun it was a long project though
so it's in chat there for you if you're
interested
let me actually go and throw it up in
the description too for those of you who
will be watching this at a later date
yeah it's uh there's a is a really
enjoyable project should I leave my work
from home from home internship because
I'm not lean you think me I'm gonna
college undergraduate I'm a little bit
lost about what you're trying to say
here man all right I just added to the
description you might have to refresh
your page here live what's going on
Victoria what online degrees do you
recommend for non-us resident start from
day sighs seriously guys I I don't have
any input for you internationally at all
because I don't I don't know anything
about it I've worked with very few
international developers what do you
think of Linux I think it's a great
skill to have on your resume especially
if you're interested in DevOps and it's
something I can make you stand out
that's pretty much it
I've seen roles where they would like
you know as a preferred skill if you're
familiar with Linux it's always a great
thing to have it's always a great thing
to have those preferred skills cuz that
means you stand out amongst other people
I use angular all the time
hey man appreciate field thank you sir
just our free code camp nice I can't
wait for them to release their new stuff
man
oh my god I think that might be
something I do this weekend is is uh I
for a while I've been wanting to film
some videos for free code camps channel
do a little collaboration try and steal
some subscriber Reno's but yeah angular
is in typescript
I have three videos I want to do one was
about one was a dull on video one was a
ask the Deaf type video and then one was
a project-based video so there's three
videos I want to submit to the channel
would I recommend angular react uh it
seems like there's a lot of push for
react right now so
get that free full the free full stack
bootcamp a general assembly that sounds
like a pretty good deal what is the new
stuff for free cooking if you go to beta
Duff Rico camp you can check it out that
name sounds very familiar with suppose I
mean let me Google but yes I am familiar
but I cannot picture here right now okay
yeah he's the he's a react guy right do
I workout now I need to I beat you so
bad yeah those algorithms can get get
you man it's part of the process
Wescott host a great web podcast called
syntax FM do i watch coding phase I do
not
how much how long they take for you to
get comfortable thing you learn how much
knowledge do you have did you acquire
per prior to angular are you talking
about you either wondering look too so
just a painful picture I built my
current website coding Toros 360 dot-com
that's my one and only angular project
that uh got me my first job as a as a
full-stack developer and then I just
became familiar with the on the job and
my current role I actually thought I was
getting hired for an angular 1 role but
I never coded it in angular 2 and I
showed up and I yeah you're doing
angular 2 so I have all right uh
and then I just I just learned I did
some courses and I served building some
things and that's that's the the gist of
it so I had zero prior knowledge of
angular 2 when I got it my angular 2
role what happened to my podcast what
happened was I I hated doing it so one
thing you have to learn about yourself
is is when it comes to like I have no
problem working with the team but like
when my side projects are my side
projects and so I didn't like
necessarily working with anyone else on
side projects you work remotely in a job
I did not do I have any place learning
Python for David sighs machine learning
no all right now this is your
replacement for jQuery I'm not so sure
about that
Oh God it's all a replacement for jQuery
I mean that's the truth is they're all
trying to get rid of the jQuery got orig
I wrote there's this project that some
jQuery a night I am is a she C sharp net
application there's some jQuery and took
me a while to get back up and running I
don't ever write any jQuery I do
everything and angular now um legislate
God it's been a minute like it's almost
like a flashback like I was like you
know we all like talk on jQuery but
like jQuery runs a ton of the web still
the jquery's on
why you making fun of my dark circles
when I was out drinking last night I'm
sorry I rarely ever drink and just
actually I just always have dark circles
they're showing up better today
jQuery and PHP for the win PHP still
runs like 90% of the web how crazy is
that I guess it's just old websites
that's that's the only thing because
like I saw a stat that's like PHP runs
like 80% of the waif and 90% of it is
PHP 5 but uh alright guys any any last
questions before we wrap up this this
week's weekend AMA give you guys five
more minutes sound off
I gotta go upload some videos rumor on
the street is that dole on video my
kidding Mike beginning recorded I think
Ruby will come back now hey now so I
don't know what what that character is
but I says 100 something I appreciate
that thank you for the 100 Indian rubles
or rubies I appreciate that small token
appreciate your sign I keep doing what
you're doing thank you very much I
appreciate that man um how can I become
as awesome as you well you need to just
work hard that's really the gist of it
work hard every day have a game plan
execute it
um on that note I think they might be
what I do my video topic on someone
asked me the other day is how to work
hard and I think I might I might have
that be my free cocaine video topic is
how to dedicate yourself to working hard
and long and and I think I'd be a good
topic and I think that might be what it
is
so I usually like to I usually like to
end these on a a topic on a on a sort of
final thought if you will and so I think
today's final thought is going to be two
we talked a little bit about selling
yourself we talked a little bit about
about knowing yourself and so I think I
think one thing that a lot of people I
struggle with and I'm I'm there too is
being able to love yourself not the way
you're thinking but actually love
yourself for who you are and once you
kind of have once you have that and
accept yourself you can sort of see your
your strengths and you can see your
weaknesses once you've sort of accepted
yourself and then you can play towards
those strengths and try to avoid your
weaknesses so I just kind of have have
everyone you know look at yourself in
the mirror a little bit today and and
and ask yourself are you happy with your
current stage of life and if you're not
have very honest conversation with
yourself about how you're gonna change
and so that that's gonna be my final
thought on it on that note guys I
appreciate you watching don't forget to
check out the twitch channel if you're
interested in the live streams where I'm
doing my coding and things like that

patreon.com/scishow
Toros 360 check that out and of course
you can check out my new angular 2
course for just $10 using coupon code
coding got six hours of coding magic I
might say that we're gonna be building a
