alright guys so we are trying to
recreate a random quote generator you
can see mine here that we're about to
build and I'm going to show you how to
do it relatively easily you're going to
have a heading you're going to have kind
of a little brief setting I put a
picture in mind for some selfless
promotion it looked a little bland and
even though I'm not really worried about
CSS too much we still want it to look
kind of nice you want to have a button
here that when you click on it displays
a new quote in my case I did videogame
quotes I just gave it a theme that I you
know jobs done Warcraft - welcome to
summoners rift League of Legends you
know gotta catch them all this is
debatable you know is that that's a
video game quote but I put it out there
you must construct additional pylons a
lot of these I got for my good friend
van so thank you to van for that but
we're going to basically recreate that
and you're going to see from here this
is their example
and I kind of just took some artistic
styling on my point and did it myself so
they have uh quotes from the medical
field so let's go ahead and jump right
in alright guys so the way that we're
going to start this quote generator and
the way we're going to kind of do these
videos are we're going to start with
HTML right end the video so we're going
to knock out all the basic HTML then
we're going to knock out the CSS and
then we're going to knock out the
JavaScript because you're going to need
to know some jQuery and JavaScript so
before we get that do all that just
quickly add jQuery to the JavaScript and
also over here we want to add bootstrap
here save it and while we're at it let's
go ahead and name this Q gen quote
generator alright so if you remember so
the reason we're going to do that is we
just want a bigger screen and it's just
kind of easier to go about this so if
you're over from bootstrap when we're
working with a responsive
design and there's a few things we want
to do so typically you don't always have
to do this but you pretty much always
have to do this for my understanding
it's a container - fluid this is just
going to be the general div that's going
to contain everything and I believe you
could do just container as well so the
first thing I did was I created the h1
and I had this I put a random quote
generator so that was our h1 and if you
remember there was a list of quotes
below and not list of quotes but a like
a sentence so that will say that's our
motto
or something like that so I just gave
this as a paragraph and in this case I
put some some of my favorite gaming
quotes of all time cool so there's our
paragraph what else do we need we needed
a button class and oh I also put an
image so this is just me you don't have
to do this but if you want to throw an
image just spice it up a little bit
let's go ahead and throw an image it's a
white image so it's not gonna show up
too well right now and then I needed to
throw be our slash here because actually
this let's do it without that goes and
this button is something straight out of
bootstrap part of the reason that we
took it so we're just going to take a
button and in my case I put the new
quote if you wanted to put something
else you could put HelloWorld or
whatever and that's how you would change
this quote but a new quote is a is
perfectly fine by me so what did I do
next I wanted to create a container that
are a div below it that would store the
author that stored the author and the
quote in a box with a border just to
separate it from everything because
that's really the main focus here you
click
gone something a new quote comes up so I
just created a div here and we'll give
this a name in a second and then inside
here I gave it I created two spans and
the reason for this is we want one spant
the way I did it and there's a better
ways of doing this but the way that I
set up my JavaScript is I have two
arrays one with the quote and one with
the author and then one spans for the
quote and one stands for the author so
that gets different styling that's just
how I did it there's definitely a better
way you could probably do a double array
and that would work even better so I
just created a span and I gave it a
class of class is equal to quote and
this will be when we do our CSS and then
we give it a class is equal to author
cool and then for my div here for the
styling I just named it quotes and then
I also gave it the clot the JavaScript
class excuse me the bootstrap class text
- Center and I also wanted this button
to be down below so what do I do after
my image I just put a br slash there's
there's better ways of doing this again
but I'm always just trying to go right
through everything so and then last but
not least I added a second div here and
see if we can do just text centered here
so I think if we do that we can take out
all this because we want all our text
recenter and so this was basically how I
set it up I know it doesn't look like
that much but it is pretty pretty solid
and what it is that we want to do we
have our heading we have our saying we
have an image we have a new quote and
right here below we have our spans and
divs set up so that it will add the new
quote so why don't we just search some
text in here and just so that we can see
it because right now we can see pretty
much anything so hello world and we'll
put - the world and this is the extent
of our HTML that we're going to be
setting up it I know it doesn't look
like much and it's not it's it's kind of
more of a practice in how to set up
JavaScript and and jQuery and work with
it there so let's go ahead and so next
next what we're going to do is we're
just going to style this a little bit in
CSS for watching the video don't forget
