almost 200 videos up on Cody and I feel
comfortable enough to say hey if you
want to support the the channel here's
my patreon account and here are a few
goals and rewards and stuff like that I
apologize if I'm sniffling a little i'm
actually still battling a really bad
cold but I'm trying to stay productive
and this is kind of an easy video to
make up very low low mental capacity so
the cold medicines not killing me too
much so if you're if you're not sure
what patreon is patrons like a third
party site that's somewhat affiliated
with YouTube and other sort of content
creating sites and basically what it is
is I have a profile and I set up goals
and a set up rewards for people who want
to financially support me and in return
I put out more content better content
and things like that so we'll go over
the rewards first and these are little
things at the end of the day I don't
expect any of this to influence anybody
in terms of rewards except that they
want to help me out and the way I have
mine structured personally most if not
all will do a donation to co.org which
helps spreading helps to spread I should
say the education of coding to the less
fortunate to women who are very you know
a minority in the engineering field and
just help spread coding resources for
the world essentially so co.org is run
by like Mark Zuckerberg and bill gates
are very involved in this organization
and its at the same time you could help
me and you get to help them so let me
just go over the rewards then we'll go
over the goals real quick so rewards are
kind of like if you donate this amount
of money um this is what you get so a
dollar it's typically uh not much I can
give you for a dollar you lad you'll be
added to like a wall of things so you
can be like oh look
I'm here with all these other great
people have decided to help you at the
end of the day if you can donate a
dollar a month that's appreciated I've
donated to so few people in my life I
understand it's not an easy thing to do
everyone's out there trying to get that
try and get that dollar so at the UH
Susan the five dollar level will make a
one dollar donation to co.org every
month also I'll be creating a monthly
newsletter for exclusively for all of
the patreon supporters so one dollar you
make one dollar donation and you know
patreon ticks are cut whatever it is I'm
not even sure and then so i'll probably
end up with like three bucks at that
point and i'll make a newsletter that's
going to go out and you'll you'll get it
and so it's just a little more stuff
going out there so now we're at $25
phones and you can donate whatever you
want I believe at 25 a month you're
basically a baller I don't know how you
justify it but I appreciate it oh um and
for that we're going to actually make a
five dollar donation to decode org help
and I'm also gonna give you exclusive
access to blooper reels so this is just
a little thing you won't see me kind of
messing up in my videos especially I
have a lot of let's talk code videos
that just never got put out because I
was just you know I one of them i'm
pretty drunk and be honest and the other
ones are just kind of they didn't make
the cut but they were funny so that's at
25 so if you're really ballin out at
seventy five dollars per month and you
know you're going to get all of the
above but we'll still make that five
dollar donation and any tutorial that
I've ever done we're going to teamviewer
skype and there's a limit of five on
this because I five people did it that'd
be great and will spend about an hour or
so competing compare programming
on teamviewer skype so this is kind of a
way to not only help yourself if you
need you just need someone to kind of
walk you through the process of how to
solve something and you get to you get
the newsletter and we do a five dollar
donation in your name so all this is
just a few rewards but let's talk about
the goals like let's talk about and
goals are kind of like milestones when
we hit this amount this is what we're
going to do different or this is the new
content that we're going to create and
push out so let me go ahead and I don't
actually know how to get them all the
display on the public page but if we go
two goals you'll see right here so I
have like three or four goals at seventy
five dollars a month this is a sif once
everyone helps out contributes if I hit
$75 I'll be every once a month i'll be
doing a blog that's going to cover
programming topics my personal channel
my personal life so you'll get to know
me a little bit better if that's
something you're interested in but at
the end of the day it will be it'll just
be one of those things where I put out
more content and if you want it there
you want to know what's going on I work
at a software company i'll probably be
talking about my work and things like
that so god bless you if we get up to
one hundred fifty dollars a month that'd
be great so I'll still be doing the blog
but I'll also be doing a what's a month
the live stream for at least six hours
of me working and programming and
answering any questions and working on
side projects and tutorials and even
recording video so I'll be doing live
streams once a month at that so at three
hundred dollars a month I'll actually be
doing all the all of the above so you
can see once we're getting to that point
this is going to be adding a lot of
different content I'll actually be
interviewing front-end developers web
designers data center technicians and
just anyone who works in the general
software and technology field this is
going to be really helpful but it's also
very time consuming us so that's why it
said at three hundred dollars a month so
if I could ever get to that point that
would be amazing I work with about 20 to
25 developers who who major in various
things are
who work on various things are all very
specialized in just contacts i have in
my personal life so again this is just
extra stuff i'll still be of course
putting it out my videos i don't
actually expect anyone to donate $75 or
contribute $75 anything like that but if
you can that would be great i do take
pride in my channel i'm always trying to
improve it again i'll probably be
reworking this video down the road I
just wanted to put something out there I
wanted to stay productive and just kind
of let you know that I've been going
through a lot of personal stuff lately
and I haven't excuse me I haven't been
able to upload as much as I would like
to just battling a lot of things in my
personal life and I'm kind of less six
weeks going through that now life is
good like this life is always good and
so I'm just ready to get hit the ground
running and I thought I'd throw this out
here let people know what that this is
out there if they want to help if not
just keep watching the videos keep
liking keep subscribing if you're not
already subscribe share the videos tell
your friends but again guys this is just
something extra I appreciate it yeah
it'll keep me on the straight and narrow
when I know I have to meet these goals
and deadlines because you guys are
expecting a certain amount of quality
for me so with that being said I just
want to say thank you guys for taking
the moment to watch this and I hope you
end up deciding to contribute again you
don't have to always see as always I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
