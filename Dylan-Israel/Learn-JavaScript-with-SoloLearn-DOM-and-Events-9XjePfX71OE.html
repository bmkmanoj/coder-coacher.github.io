aim Dom and events
do that again we're back in JavaScript
doing dominant events oh it's a long one
so I am this is something I expect to
actually learn quite a bit about so we
might slow down for a second so the Dom
refers to the document object model
which is basically the structure of HTML
and how things work within it so you see
a nice little thing here is a document
that outputs the HTML you have the head
of the title all that sort of stuff so
it's a document object model cool the
Dom tree as we just saw here has what
you can call child nodes and siblings
it's kind of a tree so you can imagine
what will link to what so the following
HTML element is the parent of h1 so the
parent would be body because all these
are nested within it no really damaged
to understand
body has two children one parent yeah
one second I think I made a grave
misunderstanding so let's check this out
so HL has two children head and body
which makes sense and then oh woops
because the paragraph is nested between
it so it's paragraph sorry guys it's
just a little bit of a brain fart
document object the innerhtml refers to
that almost all up the inner inner HTML
property can be used on almost all HTML
elements to change the content so
basically they will be added to you can
change the value like the text value of
usually inner dot HTML select all that I
play the document object is the root of
the Dom inner dot HTML is a method body
is I think it's a very property there we
go yeah I'm selecting elements so
elements you have ID
you have class names and you have tag
names right so let's go ahead and
continue on so fill in the blanks set
the element and change the content to
high so we have a variable in our
JavaScript we're setting here and we saw
want to select the element ID which is
equal to text and we want to say Oh B
dot inner HTML equals to hi so you can
kind of see how you would link things
via via by tags and things like that get
elements by class so you can do that by
more than just a single tag at a time
you can do it by entire class names as
well so in this case fill in the blanks
like all div elements and it can go for
any tags right so we want select all the
divs and we then want to alert the
content as a third div so we want to
select the third div which would be
index 2 and output whatever it is
eh email game gets the text Kanna node
in the Dom have multiple parent nodes
can they note in the DA have multiple
parent nodes
don't boo I
are they still considered parents are
there multiple levels if so yes I
advanced no well let's go back and read
this real quick alright so there's only
one parent noted then you have previous
sibling next to me okay there we go that
makes sense
changing elements get elements by tag me
fill in blanks to select all images on
the page so we're just like IMG and
change their SRC attribute so we wanted
to be the iterate through the for loop
and these are great examples of things
you may do granted you probably won't do
anything in vanilla JavaScript anymore
you'll probably be doing an angular or
react but you know it all helps go ahead
and set the value there cool changing
style you do that with like calling
style so you're calling this tag for
this item that you grabbed so let's go
ahead and change the background color of
all spam elements so we select a span
and then we can say for that span ah on
each element will pass an X here go
ahead and change the background color
cool adding and removing elements great
text to node so you select the text
around this now this is something I
haven't used before create clones and
element returns the resulting node
creates an element and create text node
so this creates a new paragraph and adds
it to the existing thing so here we
append a child here we create one
so basically we're creating the HTML
content and then we're appending it okay
that makes sense so fill the blanks to
add a new element to the unordered list
with ID list so document dot get element
by ID and then we want to create the
list element and then we want to go
ahead and append it what let's look at
this one more time fill in the blanks to
add a new allied element so we want to
you get to create this we append this
let's see here document dot add new
element to the unordered list with the
ID list like you meant thought element
by ID oh this is my idea now that's
alright
you all don't pinch I'll second air so
this creates it
it's lighted last night no way this yeah
this is Lauren no I'm doing fill in the
blanks I knew a Lionel
alright so we got let's look back real
quick so any new removing elements so
did we do this one no this is someone
alright so let's review right so create
text note you create an element then you
append the child well I think I was
creating in the wrong way so you want to
create the element the Li because we're
appending the ally so you have to create
it first I get it I guess oh I thought
we had we were actually trying to get
the list item first okay and then we
want to get the element by ID want to
get the list that we're trying to target
and then we want to append to that list
got it got it that makes sense
removing elements it looks like you can
probably just remove it if you get the
element by ID so we want to document in
our document we want to remove the child
of fill the blanks remove the note
element from the page par is nodes
parent so I removed the node element so
we not we don't remove so we get element
by ID node you want to remove elements
from a page parson to its period yeah
they're good no no document dot remove
child from node what
feeling the blanks to remove the note
element from oh oh I see I see I see so
we we already did our documents so we
have to target the node and then we want
to say look pars the nodes parent remove
child no duck wait I'm sorry I'm getting
confused here remove the child which
one's the parent so par part where's the
node element from the page so I believe
here we got part is the parent and there
we go and notice a child okay
we're placing elements you can also
replace the child shows use to replace
nodes
I guess replace child works for
everything let's see here okay it
doesn't matter what it is it's all
replaced child that makes sense I guess
I guess you wouldn't want to just
replace a child or a parent creating
animations animations are something that
I am horribly bad with and I need a
better understanding to creating
animation relative to the containment of
the position attributes must be set to
relative that makes sense
set interval is how often that animation
runs or how often something runs right
so if it has ten thousand it's ten
seconds every thousand milliseconds is a
second so the following code defines
timer that calls move every 10
milliseconds however this makes our box
move to the right forever because we
want that to end we then would have
clear interval with stops the set
interval function so cool so it's a stop
a set interval you have to clear it
handling events so events these are
things that are used like ng click or ng
change on in angular so the type
function executes events is called an
event handler so what handles your event
do you have that handler
handling events you call functions you
can do other things as well so button
call function buttons click so we have
on click and then we won't call the funk
funk so let's fill this right so on
click go forward so onload similar
window dot onload these should be used
to do something ok
fill in the blanks to call the clear
function after the body is loaded so
onload clear it yeah let's see if we get
this one without there's okay and
multiple event handlers to be added to a
single element in angular they can so
I'd imagine that would be able to in
JavaScript vanilla JavaScript cool event
propagation a paragraph is inside
alright let's let's read this real quick
there are two ways of event propagation
and propagation in HTML Dom bubbling and
capturing event propagation allows for
the definition element order when event
occurs if you have a PLM inside
development then the user clicks a few
element which elements click should be
handled first and bubbling the innermost
element has handled first and outermost
elements have a second and capturing
that almost elements handle first and
then there okay
paragraph is inside a div element you
want the paragraphs click event to be
handled first you should use bubbling I
believe it was and then you can set that
here click my function true will be
capturing so click and then we want to
set it to true if we wanted to use
capturing propagation cool I know that
I'm have to look into that a little bit
more so image slider you create a simple
image slider let's see what happens here
we have an array of images array ifs
image locations so fill the blinks to
define it or a sort of our our and then
we have our brackets like so pretty cool
and then let's continue on here well
will be the context of the paragraph
after user clicks twice so it's the user
on click clicks test tests gets the
element of text which is 20 our get
element by ID which is right here and
then we get the value here which is 20
we divide it by 2 that's 10 then we
divided by one more time by 2 that's 5
cool form validation oh my goodness
there's a lot of stuff going on in forms
and I can tell you right now that one
page is not good enough there we go
hi module 7 quiz 7 questions a lot of
stuff in here a lot of a little more
technical stuff that kind of am guilty
of breezing over in my sis and my
JavaScript stuff may be coming to
framework dependent but we'll see so
fill the blanks change the content of
all the paragraph tags as pages so
they'll learn so you want to set that to
P and we want to say document so get all
the paragraphs documented I get all
elements my tag by ID and we want to go
ahead and set the value to solo learn
cool was output of this code get the
element by ID test and alert has child
has nodes
and that'll be true because there is a
paragraph and they fill the blank
stretch colored paragraph with ID to to
read so document dot get element by ID
p2 and then we want to say D dot style
dot text color equals red there we go
wait a second fill in the blanks to
change the color of the paragraph with
ID - so documents like get element by ID
p2 and then that's color their style and
then color
whoops so there's no such thing as text
color it's color
can you handle multiple events the same
hm
yes and fill in the blanks alert a
message when the button is clicked so
button on click display a message and
then a function to find the function in
your JavaScript and wham-bam
a display and learn when the mouse
pointer is over the div tag
I believe that's hover hover doesn't
look like hover
I don't remember what that is so let's
let's look up real quick
hover JavaScript event handler
onmouseover that's what it's called its
onmouseover a little bit cheating there
