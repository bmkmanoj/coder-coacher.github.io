back in our part 8 or some like
that the weather
so what we're we basically have two
things left to do we're not gonna do too
much styling that if you want style this
way the only really user story we have
left is to basically make this
Fahrenheit and Celsius and clean up a
little bit and then also we're going to
then based off the temperature put out a
different background so in this case
we're gonna have to change up our our
variables here to do a few things so the
way that I did this was I called this
function to fixed and what to fix is
gonna let us do is it simply going to
make sure that we only have two places
past the decimal point so you'll see
that our F temperature here is doing
that and then we'll go ahead and do it
on the C temp as well called thought to
fixed to two places and when we save it
we have eighty seventy four and it's 27
23 so that's that's probably the last
bit of code other than maybe
concatenating a string on here so that
it actually so Celsius or Fahrenheit and
it looks kind of nice so we can go ahead
and do that next okay so next what we're
gonna do is we're just gonna clean up
this button to display the Celsius
degree and the Fahrenheit degree so and
this you'll see that's still working we
have it down to two decimal places we
could probably even get that down to one
let's get down to one on both of these I
think they look better no one's gonna
say eighty point seven four degrees all
right so it's working everything so what
we want to do is we just want to add the
Celsius Marine do this using the hex
code so if you're not sure like Oh what
are those special characters how do I
get them in there just going W
three schools and you know type in like
HTML Unicode and it shouldn't be taken
careful for you so in this case all we
have to do is when we out put it in our
jQuery for instance our Fahrenheit temp
we just want to format it so that it
inputs some HTML along the way so in
this case we're just gonna put the
Fahrenheit which I put up here and you
know I don't mean these memorize so no
judgments that's going to save that and
you'll see now we have the Fahrenheit
maybe we want to put a little bit of a
space so that looks better and then
we're gonna do the same thing for
Celsius so we're gonna done the Celsius
here too probably wanted to do that in
the same spot so if Tim that's good
because it displays automatically so we
have to actually do it again right here
so first thing first let's do our C temp
and this is going to look very similar
but this is basically just gonna put a
so yeah here's a little bug so this
works fine we're in foot space so
because I put it on the outside it only
works at one time and then it loses it
you see okay so next up what we're gonna
do is we're just gonna go ahead and put
that in for the Fahrenheit one more time
excuse me and that should
let's see here in a space save it one
time and you know what it seems like I
have to click this twice because the way
I coded it so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to swap my statements here so
I don't have to go see what the issue is
but it probably has to do with me
display like I could just change the one
right there as well because what's going
on is it's basically the bullying's off
by one and so we could change change it
there or we could just do it like so
you'll see it's actually it was checking
one extra click but all our degrees are
working nicely although we have left now
is to find out what units this wind
speed is in and then we'll change that
in a second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
