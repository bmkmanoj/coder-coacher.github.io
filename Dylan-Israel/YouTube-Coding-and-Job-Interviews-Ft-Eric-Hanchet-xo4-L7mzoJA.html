we're gonna be interviewing Eric who has
a lot of cool information to share with
those he's gonna talk about his first
interview experience and how awful it
went which was I found probably the best
part of the interview it's just funny to
me he's also going to talk about his
experience in QA doing you know
development he works at a gaming company
gaming being gambling we're just kind of
interesting we dive into that a little
bit and we just kind of shoot the
about a lot of stuff that I think
everyone would care about so I hope you
guys enjoyed this interview it's an old
one from about two months ago I was
moving and so I apologized some people
were looking for this and I have a cold
during it so if I sound a little
congested that's why but as always guys
thanks for watching the video and let's
go ahead and jump right into it alright
thank you for being on the show
if you want to kind of just give a brief
description of your channel so I don't
butcher it go ahead and describe for us
if you will yeah hi so my channel my
name is Eric Hanson and my channel is is
all about JavaScript frameworks so it's
it's actually used to be just Java
secure frameworks but I was talking
about frameworks and all so what I do in
my channel is I do tutorials kind of
like your channel but I focus mostly on
a few frameworks that I really like and
that includes ember j/s and a rally yeah
so and then I'm also trying some new
things out I'm doing some interviews I
interviewed you a little while back I'm
also thinking of other kind of
collaborations and different things I'm
trying to some I'm new to YouTube I only
started really a couple months ago I
mean I had this channel longer than that
but I've only got serious in the last
couple of months so I'm just trying to
learn all about it and figure out how I
can have fun and teaching people how to
program nice any you named ember and
another framework any any other
frameworks that you're looking to expand
to in the future well I I did a little
bit
so I'm looking at mostly the single page
application frameworks that you've
probably heard of the ones that they're
more focused on you know you load all
the JavaScript in your browser and all
the navigation everything's done inside
there and it only goes back to the
server for certain operations so I've
touched a little bit on react I had one
video on that and but it's mostly just a
rarely an ember and then I did a series
of like JavaScript basics I'm so I did I
did touch on a few topics but that's for
the most part as the ones I've been
working on
screams JavaScript if I did something
similar and they do very well did they
did they work out for you just thank you
you know I haven't looked at the
JavaScript I only had three or four
videos kind of what spurred that on was
I was in my day job my nine-to-five I
work on Java which it's not to be
confused with JavaScript and so really I
had always done a little bit of web
development but I never learned it
really well until about two years ago
when I just deep dived in and I kind of
did it a little bit backwards a lot of
people learn the basics of JavaScript
first and learn learned that I knew a
little bit of the basics but then I
jumped right into one of these
frameworks which I don't necessarily
recommend but it kind of worked out for
me as for the views on those I yeah I
don't think they did tremendously well
but it was more for me
what speaking of like the basics of
JavaScript um as you know I do a lot of
videos on codecademy they actually
released a second JavaScript course
recently it's like in the the official
beta I guess and its introduction to
javascript apparently like their
original JavaScript wasn't basic enough
I guess and so I I it surprises to me
that they felt necessary to write a
five-hour course going more into the
basics while other you know we do these
basic videos they don't do that well I
think maybe they might have spent some
time making some content people they
don't want but what is kind of what is
the always I'm curious to hear like
especially when channels are very early
on like our our own like was the end
goal for your channel what like what
would what do you
trying to is there something you're
trying to build up or like me achieve by
having a coding channel and that's it
that's a really good point yeah anytime
you start something like this you kind
of start it for fun but it's always good
ideas like what's your goal what's the
end goal and definitely so I mean to go
back up one step further before I
started my youtube channel I was a
blogger and I still am a blogger so I
really got into the idea of teaching
people how to program first on my blog
little information about me I'm a
student as well as a full-time developer
and I'm working I went back to school
graduate school to get my MBA and in the
MBA program they had a personal branding
class funny enough and inside that class
you had a I had always blogged I started
a blog and I know ten years ago on on
just like a personal blog and I wrote in
it a few times and it didn't go anywhere
and then so I really hadn't done
anything until I took this class a
couple of years ago and it forced you
every week to go in and create at the
beginning two classes one blog post a
week and then near the middle of class
hit they do two blog posts and the end
of class had to do three blog posts a
week and then throughout the semester
they made you do videos so they really
they really put you pushed you towards
doing videos on YouTube they didn't
really teach you anything about YouTube
or any of the strategies that you're
really familiar with on how to create
thumbnails or how to create headlines or
things like that there's like we want in
the semester we want you to do a number
of videos talk in front of the camera
about the topic about what your blogs
about and teach people so that kind of
really started off with me and the idea
of like wow this could be something I
want to do more often and I just got way
into that class I was on top of creating
all these blog posts I created more than
my fair share of videos that I needed to
do I was going on Twitter every day
because the part of the class II had to
create a LinkedIn a Twitter account a
Facebook account if you didn't already
have one and they wanted you to promote
your posts and all these different
places you had a tweet three or four
times a day funny enough so I was like
really into it I was like tweeting and
turning it like the people I would
there's these famous programmers on on
Twitter and YouTube that
a lot of people know about so I would
like tweet them and I try to get them to
retweet my content and it made me think
wow this could be something interesting
and then I started listening to Pat
Flynn Flynn with smart passive income
and so kind of opened my my eyes to the
possibilities of not just teaching
people but also making an income from it
so after that class ended I had a
handful of videos and I had a ton of
blog posts I continued on with the
blogging but I didn't do the videos as
much but I started experimenting with
like affiliate deals I signed up for
being an Amazon affiliate then I started
looking into Udacity or not Udacity but
you to me and like how I could create an
online course and then I was approached
to I won't get too much into this this
is another story for another time but I
got approached by a publisher
Packt publishing and I created my first
book which was really awesome at the
time called ember.js cookbook and I
learned all about that process but a
little bit earlier this year kind of
fast-forwarding I found that I was
getting a little bit tired of blogging I
mean the time it takes to create a blog
was especially nowadays the ways I did
it was you would create this huge like
5,000 word tutorial with all the
screenshots he had to have the code up
on github you had to put a demo up
somewhere so it was a really grueling to
put those up every week and I was
starting to do less and less of that and
I thought you know what I'm kind of
getting burnout and blogging how about I
try YouTube but I still kind of like
this idea of where it's going so then I
kind of switched over to YouTube and I
did this this thing called and this also
probably goes to where how this all
started I started doing this thing
called
vlog every day in April and it's it's a
hashtag some there's some famous
youtubers that do it I follow this one
called amy schmittauer
that does it so I started blogging every
day in April and my goal was can I get
like a thousand views and I was able to
get a thousand views and I actually I
didn't vlog every day in April I only
created like 20 videos but it was like
wow this is I can create a video you
know editing timing everything in in an
hour sometimes less well it takes me
like two hours three hours
create a blog post and so I just and I
really I jumped into Adobe Premiere and
how to use it and how to edit it and I
really liked it so that's what I've been
kind of doing now the end goal and to go
back to your question was I'd love to be
on top of doing the 9 to 5 I love to
have a little side income and to be able
to do this more more or less than more
than a hobby I should say more be able
to create value for people are listening
to me but also to create some money on
the side which is ultimately my goal
nice
is there any reason that you decided to
do content in web development and
JavaScript instead of because you're a
Java developer is there any reason
you're not focusing on Java yeah that's
interesting about that cuz when I first
started I was like well I could just do
Java tutorials I mean that's what I do
in my work but then I was like I was
just really interested and I've always
been really interested in web
development and I thought well out of
the all the jobs out there yeah there's
there's definitely a ton of enterprise
development jobs but there's quite a few
people looking for web development I
think that's where the future is I'm
looking at the new releases of Java and
and the stuff out there and I just don't
see as much stuff happening for good and
bad on the JavaScript world side I mean
every day is every few months we hear
about this new framework or this new
technique and things over said quit rate
this is more like it it seems like these
frameworks in Java yeah things are
happening in the Java side but it's just
not as quick and it's just something
that really interested in me nice tell
us a little bit about I know we we
briefly talked about what you do at work
but you don't go into too many so you
kind of give us like a day in the life
of a Java developer that's a good point
yeah so I so I have a combination of a
few things I do my work and so I I
maintain this old legacy system which a
lot of times developers end up having to
do this you're gonna go into a job and
there's going to be code that has been
written years ago and you have to
maintain it so literally the code that I
work with is a combination of something
called base trans basic which is an
offshoot of basic
and Java and some C++ so we have several
hundred customers that are running the
software throughout the world and
they're literally some of the pieces of
that software was written in the early
80s and it's just been ported over and
over and over again to these different
systems so it's and yeah we'll have
comments in there and in things in there
from people like 20 years ago so it's
crazy but yeah I maintain that software
it's a lot of it is is it support or
somebody if so there's a problem at a
customer site and there's an escalation
I'll have to take care of it there and
then so I kind of 30% 40% of my time is
just dealing with that making sure that
system was working making sure if
there's any escalations luckily we have
don't have any new enhancements for that
because it's such an old system I'm the
newer and then probably 40 the other 30
40 percent of the time is dealt with
working with this newer system that is
we've been slowly upgrading our
customers for the last six or seven
years it's written in it's a java
application its uses application server
called JBoss and and I think that the
latest version is they have a newer
application server but most of it's in
job JBoss and Tomcat and so that's a lot
more than a traditional software
development lifecycle that you probably
see in a lot of companies out there so
we have requirements documents we have
sprints we have stand-up meetings we
sometimes we do so you guys are doing
using like Atlassian suite and doing
agile and all that sort of stuff I'm
more agile in fact we've been trying to
move more to agile but when I got there
it was more like very the the process
was more like the waterfall method
meaning we had a very strict set of
requirements a very strict set of
testing and implementation and then we
there wasn't much iteration going on and
a lot of that was due to the fact that
in gaming which is in gambling that
video games
the industry is really and highly
regulated and if you ever want to talk
about gaming slot machines table games I
could talk today's about that cuz I'm
pretty knowledgeable about it but it's a
very it's a highly regulated industry so
when code comes out of a company that
deals with that's works in the gaming
industry it has to go to these what are
called gaming laboratories and they do
is they check your code to make sure
first that you're not doing anything
funny in it that you're not putting in
backdoors for your friends to - you know
for slot machine to pay out more than
needs to go but they also just check the
quality of the code and that process
takes months so when we get software
done or finished our enhancement for one
of our products it goes to these
laboratories and every jurisdiction out
there has different rules for their
gaming so different things have to
happen and then it finally gets to the
customer so if they find a bug when it
gets back to the customer and they find
a bug we have to start that process all
over again to get that bug fixed and get
it back out to the gaming laboratory -
backed out to the customer so it's not
quite as easy as in web development
where if you're in a live site and
there's a bug I mean someone can go and
fix it and get it deployed back to
production in days gotcha that's
interesting I a lot of people especially
when you're kind of starting out
programming I think there's this
misconception that you're gonna be
creating something brand new well a lot
of the jobs are hey you may be doing
that but about half your time you're
upgrading the old system or maintaining
the old system and so I'm glad to hear
cuz that that's that's how it is at my
work we're or my old work I just got a
new job but we maintain our old software
and sometimes new future updates
meanwhile the other team go goes and
it's building the new s is that the the
field will be using it seems to be a
common practice among software teams a
lot of times oh yeah especially the new
guys if you go into a new team ya don't
expect you're gonna be the architect and
starting to design new programs or new
enhancements so oftentimes they'll be
like we have this piece of crap that
you've been maintaining for 20 years and
Bob is doing and now you're gonna be
doing it so you're gonna learn exactly
how to fix the batches
and get it out the door that's what I
think my new position yeah you know
you're gonna just spend three months
learning our old system so that you can
do this tiny feature update or fix
something that breaks on it when it
happens and it's and it's not as bad as
it sounds I mean it you yeah you learn a
lot by just going in and learning these
old systems and learning how it works
and getting your feet wet and and if
you're in a good organization that that
prides itself in its code quality then
you're gonna have people looking over
stuff that you put in the bug fixes that
you have and you're gonna be able to
collaborate with them and hopefully they
have some way they're doing like
continuous improvement processes and
they're deploying and and you have a
test suite and you're running tests as
well so you'll learn a lot especially
the first few months and so your
previous job were you able to do some of
that then well so my current job title I
I as of to stop this coming Tuesday but
next Tuesday I am moving to Florida for
a web engineer position that I accepted
and so right now I work at a software
company but I the only that I don't
write any code that's problem and so
like I asked to be promoted like three
months ago didn't happen then I took a
better position basically but uh the the
I've done wire framing I've been like
user stories and user flow I helped
develop like the registration
application that for upcoming this is a
lot of my job though revolved around
creating content for we have like 1,200
employees and so just creating content
so that the new employees understand how
it works and updating features and
getting requests and dealing with
clients and stuff like that and a very
like project manager feel job to it at
time so was it it ended up not being for
me unfortunately it couldn't work out
where I was at but that's interesting
yep priority there's a lot of ways to
get into the software industry I mean if
being like a project management a lot of
developers or you know some developers
actually move over to project management
I know myself personally after college I
had worked
at a small company that I was doing a
little bit of web development but most
of my time was writing code for this
really proprietary a home automation
system and so I didn't learn a lot I
didn't get to use a lot of stuff I was
when I was that I learned in college but
when I when I left that job it was like
in 2009 and the economy sucked and I
live in a town called Reno Nevada which
is you may have heard of it hopefully
good things we actually have a small but
good amount of software developers in
our town but at the time the economy and
especially arena was hit pretty hard and
job market was really bad we had one of
the highest unemployment the nation's I
could not find a job so I ended up
taking a QA job doing Quality Assurance
which I don't I don't see any problem if
you're a software developer and you just
want to get your foot in somewhere or
maybe you're not even a software
developer you've never worked there
maybe even trying to get into QA and
trying to learn how it is because you
learn about like white box testing you
get to work really close hopefully in
the organization you get to work close
with the developers you're talking to
them and so I learned I did that for two
years to two and a half years almost
before I moved into doing Java
development what I've been doing now for
quite a few years oh yeah definitely and
it's one of those things I think I'm
kind of a good example if I took a job
as a software company to kind of learn a
little bit more about agile and at
anything else that could be thrown my
way and that in itself has helped me get
my developer job and so there's nothing
there's nothing wrong with project
management or QA either if that's the
route you're going down to I I would
have I would have accepted like a
project management position because even
if your ass knowing software is valuable
as a project manager when you can say it
looks up in me I know this
isn't gonna take a week to do it because
you understand software and understand
the environment so project management's
create as well so it's it's it's very
interesting because uh I think a lot of
a lot of people are just learning out to
code don't realize that this is another
path you can take yeah
yeah for sure it's definitely yeah
there's more than one ways to go at it
you want to be careful though that
you're doing like Quality Assurance and
not just doing data processing because
there is a little bit there is some
level so like if you're going to a
software company and you want to get
your foot in the door and you don't and
you can't get you can't land that
software developer position you could
try QA and that could work out for you
it is gonna be I mean
caveat emptor though if you get into a
QA position you're gonna have to really
show the people in your organization
that you know how to code you might have
to do some networking I know I had to
talk to some managers of my other
departments and get to know them a
little bit better before I was able to
transfer over to it and was it wasn't an
easy it wasn't easy at least an
organization I was in but then you don't
want to jump into like text I mean tech
support or doing data entry that that's
probably the hardest to move up out of
to get it from like being like a pure
tech support on the phones then move it
into a software developer session but
yeah it's there's other ways in other
past internships of course is a good way
to go now that we're kind of on this
topic what would be your piece of advice
for people who are applying they're just
applying applying applying can't seem to
get that entry level you know software
gig do you have any sort of advice
thinking back to when you got your first
you know opportunity how you got your
foot in the door how you said alright
cool I'm finally here I can finally
start getting some relevant experience
then that's interesting so how so you're
asking how would I so if I'm if I'm I'm
the average guy I've been studying up on
front-end development maybe I went to a
boot camp or I just self-taught and I'm
trying to get I'm trying to get a
developer gig of some sort what what
advice would you have for them yeah it's
well first it's gonna be tough that I
mean it's this is a very competitive
market so there's a lot of people
playing for positions in to be a
software developer so you're competing
not against just you're competing
against everybody that went to college
and graduated with a computer science
degree you're also gred competing
people who graduated and didn't have a
CS degree but thought it to get into
computers you're competing against
people are coming out of boot camps so
you want to find ways to differentiate
yourself from your competition so of
course I'm having like something either
if you if you're trying to playing and
playing over and over again see if there
maybe look at the coding bootcamp boot
camp Brad I know you and we've talked
before Dillon your friends have gone to
coding boot camps and that seems to be a
pretty solid thing you may want to take
some Community College classes leads at
least get down some more basics that you
want to do maybe education is the way to
go I know I think you and me disagree
about going to college but I think we
both agree just learning more either
self-taught or taking classes is a good
deal and then building up your github
profile seeing if you can actually put
in some projects that you've worked on
in the past and then if you're getting
interviews right you know start studying
for your interviews so if you're getting
interviews right exactly all the
questions you got asked which ones you
knew which ones you didn't know and then
start using that as a basis if you're
going for jobs that are asking algorithm
questions then you may want to pick up
cracking the coding interview if you're
asking if they're asking if you're
playing for jobs and they're having you
take do take-home tests then then you
need to look over the take-home tests
that you've done and see why you didn't
get it maybe ask a friend just just
continue to practice those over and over
again I know some people say to
specialize like try to find like if
you're in web development
be on Rails develop or you can or be the
best JavaScript develop your can like
Miche down to maybe just a framework
ember j/s or angular and learn that
really really really well so that way
you may have some knowledge in that some
people say to create and these all these
different approaches may may work for
you may not but I've heard you know try
to create a personal brand I and I
talked to early about creating a
personal brand and starting to blog you
may want to try to create a blog or get
on you
to start creating YouTube tutorials see
if you can get employers to come to you
I'm I've definitely since I started
blogging and doing YouTube I've had a
lot more opportunities come my way and
I'm pretty happy in my job so I haven't
taken up on on on any of them but I have
I've had those hopper teas come my way
because of where I am and and how I put
myself out there also I would argue just
having any sort of relevant couple years
of software development experience you
can probably pick up a job for
relatively easily at this point
especially especially you say you're
working on your MBA oh my god
you're probably in like the top 5% of
candidates most of the time but yeah I
mean that's that's interesting too I am
working my MBA so I I have to make some
decisions - coming up where I want to go
in but I'm pretty happy with my job
right now um so far yeah I was thinking
more in the lines of your because I
heard this before my fad people tweet me
and say I've you know I've watched
because I treated I write a lot about
and talked a lot about amber Jas and
I've heard people tweet me say hey I've
really want to get into a job as an
ember Jas developer but I live in
neighbor you know Nairobi Africa and I
there's no jobs near me what am I
supposed to do and I keep applying and
everywhere I go I can't get a job so and
usually these people don't have that
much experience so if you're trying to
get the experience first off then then
some of those techniques I talked about
first will at least get you into the
interview and hopefully get you get you
that job and then you can build up a
couple years of experience and then you
can and the sulfur feel especially
amongst young people there's a lot of a
lot of people are moving around a lot of
people stay at a job only for a few
years and then move around so that could
be one strategy yeah I mean I at the job
I'm leaving I was there for 10 months
and I've put myself in position or I was
willing to relocate even for you know a
nice pay bump and the experience is more
so what I'm looking for so that's
there's it's very interesting how you
have to there's just mindsets sometimes
that I went and got an education of
coding boot camp degree
and I still can't get a job it's all
well you know they'd one doesn't you got
a degree now you get a job now something
you got a degree now you got to work at
getting the job and it's all rough
sometimes especially for people aren't
prepared for that I suppose yeah I mean
to go to that point when I graduated
with my college degree I told you I got
a job doing software automation writing
in this very specific programming
language but I had a quite a bit of
journey because I when I graduated
college I had I had a computer science
degree but I didn't know a lot of the
stuff that employers were looking for so
this might be go against my advice going
to college I did it did open some doors
for me going to college but I but some
of the jobs I was playing for we're
looking for people that knew a lot more
so I I struggled like the first few job
interviews right out of college I just
bombed I went for a whole day interview
at GE General Electric which is they
have an office near Rena where I'm at
and I remember going into the meeting I
I knew I knew they asked me a question
pretty easy like find the highest number
and a list or something like that and I
and I did pretty well during that part

changing in the probably Pat's list and
I hadn't studied my linked lists can you

yeah so I I was this whole day interview
I was in one whiteboarding session after
another whiteboarding session and then
they started getting in people from
other departments and they were quizzing
me on classes I had taken like it two
years ago they asked me a bunch of
operating systems questions which I sort
of knew and then I'll wrap the story up
but I went to lunch with them during the
center because there's a whole day
interview and literally everybody was
talking around me but no one was talking
to me so I'd be like hey guys how's it
going and like oh we're doing good blah
blah blah so yeah I could tell like that
