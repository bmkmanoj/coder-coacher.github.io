assumption that you've kind of been able
to sign up for an account through c9i oh
we're gonna continue from there all you
need is a github or something like that
or you can enter it in pretty
straightforward but once you're at this
screen we're gonna create a new
workplace give it a workspace name we'll
call this backend underscore YouTube
underscore version and then this
description will put whatever back-end
FCC cert YouTube version this is just
for me to know which ones which because
I obviously do this before I go and
record it we're gonna create a blank one
so make sure you select blank and I'm
gonna go ahead and pull this off to the
side over here
so it's gonna take just a second to load
don't know don't worry about that so
let's follow what it's asking us to do
so first we have to install something
called how to NPM this is basically our
first package as far as I understand I'm
still new to this I'll explain it the
best I can as we move forward so we're
going to install the how to NPM package
do that we're new NPM install this - G
means global meaning the how to NPM
package is going to be accessible
anywhere so we don't have to keep on
installing it that's that's my basic
understanding of it so how to - NPM and
give it a second so now we have
installed this on our server and now
we'll have access to it how do we run it
so next we want to run it right how do
we do that we simply call that that that
command how to NPM or that file and
we'll get this environment here pretty
cool so far so we're gonna go ahead and
just pull this up X out of this readme
we don't actually need it at this time
we can close this pane as well all right
so we want to start with install NPM
oops just being a little weird right now
it's kind of refresh the page it looks
like it's going a little crazy right now
just a zoomed-in so something's going a
little weird on here on the how-to and
p.m. so we need to we need to go to
install NPM that's where we're gonna
start basically sorry I got a little
buggy there I'm not quite sure what was
going on here just throw that up here
alright we just want the one page
alright so what we're gonna do here is
we're going to get a couple commands we
have this NPM help and we'll show NPM
how we have print verify and solution so
if we were to wanted to remember what
the instructions were for what for for
what we're doing we'd simply call the
file how to npm call the package and
then hit print and it would give us our
instructions that get one more time this
basically tells us to exercise
instructions how to - npm verify will
actually give us our will tell us like
did we do are we correct already and so
those are your solution is not correct
and it looks like it'll also give us
some hints on how to proceed so this a
little bit you says right now that we
have the we have version 2.1 5.9 and we
needed for point 0.2 to continue to do
that so we're gonna use the command npm
install and PM - g so it looks like what
we can take from this is that this
global is going to be used quite a bit
and this NPM is kind of the precursor to
doing a lot of this stuff so this will
take just a second to install so we're
gonna upgrade our version right now to
the latest version all right there it
goes and now when we do NP when we do
how - - - and PM well let's go back so
how - - - NPM verify it's saying we have
the most and bam our solution is correct
so we have to run that real quick
and we'll see now we were on how to NPM
we now have completed for that task so
the next video we'll dive into dev
environment I'm going to try and do one
video for each one of these sections
just because I think it's important to
kind of break it down piece by piece but
as always guys don't forget to Like
