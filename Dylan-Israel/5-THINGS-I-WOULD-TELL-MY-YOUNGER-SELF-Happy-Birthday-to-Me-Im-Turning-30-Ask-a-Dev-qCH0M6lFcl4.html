it'll be my birthday I'll be turning 30
and I thought there should be a good
time to share a little bit of as our boy
ty Lopez likes to say knowledge but what
I what I'm going to with today's video
is about is just reflecting about if I
could give five pieces of pieces of
advice to you or to a younger version of
myself what they would be and why and I
think it's kind of important and I try
to stay mainly on software when we when
we have our videos and I think you can
apply a lot of this to software but a
lot of this is just good stuff that
actually if you implement you'll be very
successful in life in my opinion if
you're watching this video you're
probably looking to better yourself in
one way or another so there's a a nice
bundle called win at work right now
where you can get a lot of different
ebooks based off a lot of the same
topics we're gonna be discussing how to
hustle away your debt Survival Guide in
your 20s managing for people who hate
having bad bosses getting the guts to do
the things that you want a bunch other
with you'll see a few that are on here
but for $15 and getting in like 20 books
even if you just get two or three books
that are value I think you'll learn a
lot in the process so I just wanted to
do a shout out to that and if you're
interested ant there'll be a link in the
description that you could you can
purchase this at and it's for a limited
time for about two weeks probably about
a week when this video goes out and as
always you'll have the option of
deciding if you want to give me all your
money or if you want to give a Humble
Bundle or a charity all your money so
that you can help some people out in the
process so I won't start this video off
by saying that regardless of age you can
give good advice I give bad advice you
know if you're 40 doesn't mean that you
can witch 10 years older than I'll be it
doesn't mean that you can't get good
advice from a thirty year old and if
you're thirty doesn't mean that you
can't get good advice from a twenty year
old I know in my life as much as I love
and respect my my mother and father that
with the rapid change in the world in a
they just don't understand and they have
actually given me
horrible horrible advice and it's caught
it's caused me issues and as as their as
their son it took a very long time for
me to to say like to realize that they
actually knew worse and I knew better
which sometimes it's just how the adult
decision you have to make sometimes but
yeah so I just want to say that because
I think a lot of times there could even
be wisdom in like a five-year-old or
they like say something because they see
the world in a whole different place but
it's up to you to sort of think about
what that advice is and really you know
don't take it out what it's worth
listen to it analyze it and go from
there so just because it's coming from
someone who's older or someone who's
younger doesn't mean it's good or bad
advice
so excuse me so the things that I wish I
knew if 10 years ago or 20 years ago
where as a young man was first be
willing to take risks and blaze your own
path and what I mean by that is a lot of
times we're ingrained to at all risk is
bad right all risk is bad and so it's
like take the safe route hammer Hammer
hammer safe safe safe route everything
else you're gonna be a crackhead on the
streets and these are the only paths to
success these two and all 98 other ones
will make you a crackhead on the street
and you'll be homeless you'll be
miserable and doing things that you
never thought you'd do for money and so
what so what I'm trying to say is that a
lot of times the the world is painted to
be this black and white thing where this
works this doesn't work or that this
will give you 2% return and is very safe
so this is a good choice but this will
give you a hundred percent return but
hat maybe
is twice as likely to fail and a lot of
times people won't even take that and
make educated risks and it's kind of sad
and something that I ever since I
started taking an educated risk on
things whether it be investing whether
it be education whether it be YouTube
where I'm you know investing my time
money energy I is worked out very
successfully for me because I found
something that I enjoy more than forcing
myself into the the way the
quote-unquote way that things should be
done in the way that you should be
successful in life and the paths that
are already set up in so I would say to
you that and there's nothing wrong if
you go down a more traditional path of
investment life whatever it is but I do
want to make the first point known that
there are many paths to life there's not
just one or two and things aren't black
and white the world is you know shades
of gray and that goes for your life as
well and so if there's something that
you find that you're not enjoying find a
way to make it better or find something
that works better for you so that'd be
my first advice is blazing your own
paths and be willing to take educated
risks and I kind of put that in the same
category because I think they are
somewhat related at times so the second
thing I would say is learn about
investing and learn about saving money
this is something that is unfortunately
not talked about very much
my father is by most people's standards
wealthy and he never really sat down and
talked to us about it so it doesn't
matter if you come from a background
with money or if you come from a
background without money it's one of
those things where it's it's kind of
almost a taboo subject to talk about
right so like I have no problem talking
about my finances talking about how I
invest my money my salary now I don't
necessarily talk about my salary not
because I have an issue with it I
actually have note would have no problem
it's that most workplaces don't
appreciate that why I don't really know
but hey that that's choices so as an
employee I make sure not to talk about
that but um you know like every every
year for my channal anniversary I go
over my YouTube analytics talk to you
about how much money I make on the
YouTube channel and the reason for it is
I want to I want people to get a better
understand
of investing and get a better understand
and this is something I'm learning
everyday by the way not like I'm an
investment King and I'm making buku
bucks I'm not but I want to say learning
about saving first save money second
with the money you're saving invest
money and a lot of you right now are
probably saying well Dylan I don't have
any money to invest with right
I would say that you could probably get
5% of your check want 1 add every $20
you make and learn to investors like oh
well what deal that's a that's a hundred
dollars a month what am I gonna do with
that or that's you know $50 a month and
my advice to you is if you're motivated
and driven I'm guessing it's not always
going to be 5% of your check eventually
you're gonna make more money in the best
time to learn how to invest is when you
don't have any money right so because
you can only lose that 20 or $100 or $50
whatever it is so take the time right
now while you're down and out or if
you're not down and out start educating
yourself about how you can make $1 be $2
and continue this growth yeah that's
really the only way most people are
gonna stop living paycheck to paycheck
or be able to be financially independent
and it's a if you start early it's
exponential growth with investments and
I would highly encourage you to to
educate yourself about how you can
invest your money and figure out a way
to to save your money a lot of us are
all about how can we cut back our cost
right how can we how can we lower so we
have more money there's there's there's
a limited returns right you shall have a
thousand dollars and Bill's at absolute
most you can cut back a thousand dollars
and realistically you probably cut back
about a hundred dollars of your bills
because we're most of us are already
living lifestyles that you know we're
not living luxurious lifestyles for the
most part and the reason I bring that up
when it comes to investing is a lot of
people look at the world incorrectly of
how can I lower my expenses which is
good you should do that but there's
limited returns while the return of you
increasing your income through investing
through work and things like that there
really is no cap to that and so that
should be one of your
priorities as you as you today
as of today if you're not investing you
really should start getting Guinea
together so number three is always have
a side project and hustle and this is
something that I I is not only for a
professional aspect I've talked about
having a side project and a hustle but
it also will help you in many other
avenues of your life right so one if you
don't have any money to invest that
hustle most side projects and hustle if
handled properly we live in the days
where you can put something on the
internet and make money it's really kind
of crazy right and you'll learn in the
process you'll work on your career
you'll become you'll have you'll be
putting yourself on you'll be working on
something that will make you a better
better person a lot of times because now
you're you're so sort of getting
passionate about something and that's a
lot that's something a lot of people
lose in their life is say they lose the
passion of what they you know what they
love their job for or what they loved in
their life and you know what they live
for and sometimes these side projects
and hustles they can kind of remind you
of that I know it has for me with like
YouTube I really love love this stuff
and being able to do what I do with it
and I I just couldn't recommend I wish I
would tell myself and does have to be
the same side project for you know from
the day one to the day you die it can be
and that be a beautiful side project
right but at the very least start a side
project for personal development and and
do something with it and always have one
and if it dies I'm sure you have a
million others ideas that you've thought
of as time has passed where you're like
oh I wish I did this stop wishing about
doing these things actually do them so
that's that's number three is have a
side project and always have a side
project Hey
number four and I put on here don't
watch TV slash play games and what I
mean by that is have better time
management I actually watch TV and I
play games but not to the degree that I
used to right so I probably play I watch
about two hours of television a week
and maybe every week I've about two
hours it's about three or four anime
shows that I watch and then there is the
occasional movie I watch with the
girlfriend on movie night so in total
for the week I watch about four hours of
TV and so maybe in a bad week six hours
but I really have trouble sitting down
that long so don't think I'm like a
Puritan where it's like no TV no video
games oh my god no but I will say that
as a as a child and a young adult living
with my mother and I picked up many bad
habits such as eating fast food first
three meals a day and and watching you
know ten twelve hours of television and
stuff like that
and if that's what makes you happy I
understand but a lot of times many
people are unhappy and they're just a
zoning out through video games and
television and they're never you know
whatever it is about their life that
they don't like they don't actually get
around to ever trying working hard to
make it better they instead just sort of
treat it treat their unhappiness by
filling their their their their moments
with video games and TV and I'm guilty
of this as well which why I have this on
here I use played you know 10 12 hours a
day of video games while still working
and like going to school I was miserable
all the time and it was just sort of an
a way for me to escape and a lot of it I
the only real way to escape long term is
that you actually change your situation
and so just be weary of your time
management is what I'm trying to say
because a lot of us waste a lot of time
like if you started thinking about how
your day is going to be and what you're
gonna do and how it's going to help you
in the future start thinking about how
you can be productive to accomplish your
goals not other people's goals but your
goals you know well where you're saying
a lot of people have trouble finding
motivation when you start thinking about
how your time you know if I spend eight
hours playing Final Fantasy I'm not
saying don't play Final signs if I spent
all day at eight hours playing Final
Fantasy how does that help me tomorrow
to accomplish what I want to accomplish
and if it doesn't am I going to be okay
with that long term
a lot of people aren't but let's still
do it anyhow so just be aware of your
time how you're managing it and and move
forward and these are all and by the way
guys if you think I'm attacking you or
anything like that I am NOT these are
all things that I personally have done
and I'm sharing with you what I know so
I that's why I feel like maybe if I'm
speaking a little direct some of you may
take offense but it's because this is
these are things that I mistakes I've
made
I'm aware of them I'm aware how to
overcome them at least in my case so
that's number four the fifth and final
thing is be okay with who you are right
so um as my cat destroys the cat pose my
look hey buddy someone's trying to film
video over here but be okay with who you
are and what I mean by that as a lot of
us are especially and this is this
varies for other people I probably don't
have it that bad but I felt it's all
about perception right and how you how
you perceive people feel about you I
know that as a child I and as a young
adult I always felt I always felt like
there is an issue with my hobbies I
always felt there's an issue with me and
that I had to kind of hide that oh well
you know I played Japanese RPGs I watch
animes and these things are a little bit
more accepted nowadays than they were
before and I know that like as a child
trying to get my my siblings to play
video games or try to get my dad to play
video games with me it's like my dad I
think played video games with me from
the age of like six to seven and then
after that kind of was done with it and
you know but you you love what you love
and in a lot of people's cases it could
be something such as sexuality it could
be something such as you know where what
your background there's a lot of things
in life that if you wanted to be
self-conscious about and if you wanted
to to worry about and and create
problems for yourself you can and a lot
of that just stems from you not being
okay with who you are as a person you're
not being okay and socially
loving yourself and saying look man
there's nothing wrong with me I have no
problem being a dork being a geek right
I'm over here with the I like like you
could look at me right now and be like
this guy probably works with computers
and it's true I do right and so like
it's okay to look and be like okay you
know and and and be like alright you
know you can have some fun with it but
the point is is there's no problem with
who you are I guess I have a bad example
but try to try to just love yourself a
little bit more because at the end of
the day that's probably who's gonna have
to do it and I'm not talking for all the
pervy people who think I meant something
different but uh what I'm trying to say
is that as an individual a lot of times
we were also self-conscious about who we
are and we don't ever just accept
ourselves and even if you're unhappy
with where you're at in life it's
there's a difference between trying to
do better and accepting where you're at
right like I want to be much farther
along in my financial career my career
all this sort of stuff and doesn't mean
that I still don't like myself so try to
like yourself a little bit more you're
okay the way you are it's really the
message of that and if you want to be a
better person that's great but still
just kind of appreciate where you're at
and because at the end of the day only
you can really love you so that that's
my that's my five things I hope you you
found something in there that maybe you
can work on and these are things that
these aren't daily fixes these aren't
you know this isn't you can start
tomorrow and do all five of these things
but the the real testament to to these
items is all five of these are lifelong
changes these are all things that you
need to implement on a daily basis to
really have effect right it's like it's
the big example like I give to people
about working hard all of us can work
hard but for how long right the people
that that get that are successful in
life are the ones who never stopped
working hard the people who aren't the
only were able to work hard for six
weeks right so all these
our hard work because these are these
are lifelong or decade-long changes so I
hope you take advantage of what little
knowledge I have and maybe at 40 if I
sell have a YouTube channel
I'll tell you what I learned in the next
10 years then maybe I'll be like damn
dude I didn't know when I was 13 so
