actually for loops and iterators and
Ruby uploaded and a different video than
what it's supposed to be and
unfortunately I don't remember where the
file is there if I deleted it so we're
just going to go ahead and work our way
through here so a little bit rusty with
Ruby I ended up in an internship and I'm
doing that about full time during summer
side of it but messing with through
because they mainly use HTML CSS PHP for
the WordPress so but luckily since we've
already done this section I do have the
code that worked for it so we're gonna
be able to take a look at it and then we
do it so all I'll be resetting the code
as we go in here so we're in the loop
chat iterator section so let's see here
alright so this is what the while loop
is so a pretty standard wall counter is
less than 11 print the counter and then
set the counter in the end the wall okay
so cool so in this case one one to ten
all right so let's start our next lesson
right here all right so the while loop
and that is currently an infinite loop
correct it so it will be an end so in
this case let's see here
so when we start off we have Walt I is
less than five it prints I longer it
never actually adds I so it's just is
going to be zero and so it's going to
continually be be zero and it'll be
infinite loop so what we're gonna say is
I plus 1 and I don't remember if there's
a semicolon at the end of this so and
then we get 0 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 this isn't a
loop so we're gonna reset the code I'm
going to fill in the blanks so that the
loop breaks when the counter is greater
than 10
so we look at our code here when it's
greater than tenth let's say double
equals looks like that will work and
then we can say counter is equal to
counter plus one I know they have plus
equals I just personally like counter
plus one just because it's more visual
for me anyhow okay so we do it like this
change so 11 that's my fault so we could
have also done less than or equal to 10
or a greater than they equal to 10 so
that would work as well so and more
let's see in here we are asking the loop
for the first exercise and let it
rewrite it using the appropriate
assignment operator so in this case they
want us to use the plus equals so plus
equals 1 so what this is saying is that
this counter is equal to counter plus
incrementing it by 1 there we go take a
look at example so for num and 1 to 10 1
to 10 print the number okay seems pretty
pretty standard so make it print numbers
1 to 15 including 15 change the dot dot
into 3 dots so in this case dot dot dot
1 to 15 and you can see that when we
change it to 3 dots it only goes 1 to 14
not including while 2 dots
include 1 second-hand clothes
all right girlfriend's sleeping bed so I
apologize if I'm speaking a little on
the quiet okay so and this is asking us
to build our own own forty loop using
either the dot dot or the triple dot
syntax so we want to go up to 20 there's
two ways we can do this that the
standard way would probably be to
include it so we're gonna say for enum
in one dot dot dot dot dot twenty foot
but it's numb and and then that should
work so we get one we start out one go
all the way to twenty we also just for a
sec argument let's reset the code could
have done it like this Suriname and one
dot dot dot twenty one puts um and and
what's I saying is saying that you get
the same result we increase it by one
here so that we get our valued results I
find the other one a little more
intuitive personally okay so let's see
here
place I'm just for the other with the
appropriate keywords so let's what are
we trying to do here so in here we're
sitting I is equal to twenty where you
want to use the loop do method we're
gonna set decrement I by one print out
the number I so this in itself will
allow us to use our a print statement
with that and then break it if I is less
than or equal to zero so that should do
just fine so you see it goes 19 18 17 16
so this way it doesn't drop a line each
time
one of the weird things about rubies is
how how many different ways you can
write the same blue so I don't know how
it's helpful and I'm sure I'm sure they
have their reasons all right so here in
next we're going to add a line to your
loop for your print statement use the
next keyword so that you skip to the
next iteration on the number is odd so
um next if all right so let's the area
loop do and we're going to get the odd
numbers sorry okay so next if I modular
2 is equal to 0 sis I'm not sure if next
if skips it or does it let me see here
all right
so we want to set that equal to 1
because I believe we want the even
numbers okay so next if you're saying
when the next one in line is even we
want to print it that I want you look
two means there's a remainder so it's an
odd number and then if that's the case
we want to print it out if I understand
it correctly well let's see if it's odd
skip it yeah so if it's odd skip it else
print it ok so that's how you look at it
because you see right here we're going
backwards by 2 so 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2
0 so cool all right so uh create a ray
called if I remember correctly I did
just see it for a second I believe
that's how you set up an area okay
so let's gonna reset that oh.nothing
reset alright so here we are using the
dot each operator so we're saying for
each value in the array do X where X is
equal 10 so if I understand this
correctly we're gonna have one line that
prints 10 20 30 40 50
oh no it's adds 10 it's plus they're
equals to 10 okay so let's see 11 12 13
14 15
okay so in this case it's going to add
10 to each of them X means a variable is
equal to that plus 10
okay so cool I got a little confused
there because before we're actually
using the same X like if you were to do
the counter but in this case we're
taking a new X being 1 then 2 then 3 &amp;amp; 4
then 5 and being able to add them print
them out so it's not it wouldn't be 11
then 12 plus 11 23 and so on and so
forth see here in this case they use the
dot each meant it on the odds array to
print out the value of each item in the
right in other words multiply each side
by 2 so let's see here we have odds dot
outside each and in this case they've
wanted to do some stuff so we're gonna
say I don't want we loop another way I
like to do on a battery so that's what
we're gonna do so we're gonna say
outside each do value I just like the
great value for whatever their inputs
value and then we have to end our for
loop
and that should engage to see here all
right you're now double the value okay
so good time is fine and it wants to see
you print there we go
so we get our two or six or ten fourteen
they're a team used to dot x operator
print out a string of your choice any
number of times you like so let's see
here we have just scoops excuse me
let's just do ten times can't really
good turn off all print 3d since I said
we got to write even sure it's active -
and that to be honest we do Ruby really
really shove a space on that if we're
gonna do it ten times
undo that use a while loop to print out
the numbers one through fifty
inclusively me name to included I
believe X yet because excellently would
be not to included while example it
counts down you'll want to count your
way up alright so simple enough
I don't know maybe from previous
previously me doing I said while I is
less than or equal to 50 because we want
it is we want it takes or 50 to remember
we do it like this I don't put a space
at the end so it's a little easier to
read and then we're gonna say I equal to
I plus 1 and that should work
let's try this
maybe because eyes let's see here I
guess we can just print it like that I
guess I was trying to use the previous
example but apparently this works we
forgot to set I also so let's go ahead
and do this we'll say I is equal to 1
now we should go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and it
goes all the way to 50 see at the end
here not too too bit so this 3 sets of
code here now rewrite your wall loop
using until so we have I is equally I'll
say instead just swap it out until I is
equal to 50 do this let's see
straight less than agriculture that's
over yeah I know until it needs to be
exact that's what I thought it's no
poncho oops
the back keeps on sending me back a page
sometimes okay so until I is equal to 51
so we have to increase it by one because
we want it to print out 50 so do this
until you I hit 51 and when it hits 51
don't do it that's why it has to be by
one more there we go now print out the
numbers from 1 to 50 inclusively using a
for loop instead of until ooh all right
so we'll just do like this for I let me
get rid of our eye here because in for
loop it already already kind of creates
it you can think of it for I in and
remember one dot dot includes print I
and I believe for loop also increments
by one unless otherwise stated so yeah
there we go and then we and I was this
is just the one to fifty it prints out
for whatever reason I think it's just
part of the I eat you so let's kind of
reset that I use the loop iterator to do
so it's just so so I is equal to zero
and then we'll say do and then we'll
just say print print Ruby exclamation
point and then we also say interruption
there so let's go reset our code here we
use the loop do it or in so in this case
we need to actually set a counter so in
this case we'll just use I will say loot
do will increment print it I guess we
could
because we wanted to run 30 times so
like it does it there's a couple ways
you do it but they're all going to
really result the same we'll do a little
different just for sake of it
do Ruby exclamation point print it out
and then let's see here
make sure to type the string exactly as
shown really explanation point and then
break if I 3 and I remember correctly if
I remember correctly what's gonna happen
is it will print out 30 and then I'll
break the loop so it may be printing out
31 we'll see right here in a second let
me have to put the eye in front of it
see yeah I think we will actually could
be wrong so there we go so it prints out
30 just for the sake of argument let's
see what would happen we did it the
other way I believe we get it oh no I
guess it works out either way I thought
it might print out one too many times I
think if we counted here we'd actually
see that it printed out one too many but
I'm not gonna do that
all right and then in this case we're
gonna use the times iterator so if I
remember to print it out 30 times so
it's 30 times and then we'll use that
too oh sorry I got legal edges come on
guys
France 3.2 times 3 no times print
is that right I messed up here I forgot
how to do the time 30 times so in this
case let's just go let's look at our dot
times it's not that complicated though
the dot times are ready so we'll go back
here okay so we just needed that and you
know that should work now
Oh wrong one so go back to our 24 1830
dot time so we have to put it in our
brackets here thought that might have
been what it needed to be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
