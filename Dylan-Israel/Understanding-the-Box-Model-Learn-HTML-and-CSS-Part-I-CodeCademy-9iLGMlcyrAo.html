gentlemen we are back in learn HTML and
CSS part 1 the CSS box model
understanding the box models so let's go
ahead and jump right into it so it looks
like we're basically gonna try and have
a better understanding of divs and how
their containers or containers being
boxes and it looks like we're gonna be
doing some styling here that is going to
add this to all of the so what we're
gonna do right now is we're gonna add a
border to everything so that we can see
how the divs are working so basically
everything that has a border is where
this element in this case these are
where these list items these are yeah
these are list items this is where it is
and the same thing with this image and
these divs as well so it's really giving
a better idea of what we're actually
manipulating in what areas with these
divs and these elements so now that
we've added this to our styling let's go
ahead and jump into our content header
right here and we want to go ahead and
change the the div to divs height to 320
pixels so what we can do here is simply
use the height property and we can set
it to 320 px
okay
I'm not quite sure why setting our
content header here is not working
let's get the code cuz I don't know why
this isn't working I wanna see what
we're doing wrong
cuz I know how to set heights of things
um so maybe they meant a different class
so perhaps they make content box
well then content body perhaps
let me try running this an index that hm
forget all that
alright so run this once now let's jump
back into you know what all right that's
what we're gonna do
I want to restart this exercise so let's
reset fresh
I think it's bugged right now it's gonna
refresh this real quick
hi all right cool we're gonna run it
real quick before we get going here all
right now that that's failed we're gonna
jump into our style content header and
we want to run height we want to put it
at 320 px the little space here we
shouldn't have - all right so let's go
ahead and jump into get help
see what they're saying here there might
be a slight little bug because we're
doing everything right
something has gone wrong
interesting something is definitely gone
wrong
ah here we are
interesting so
it would appear that there is an issue
with their logic here we're gonna go
ahead and add an X on here and see if
this fixes our issue okay so they
basically just messed up on the back end
aspect of this when they're doing the
validation this is nothing other than
them messing up so if you get stuck on
this section you're gonna have to put an
X on here
they'll probably fix this shortly it's
still in the beta so to be expected or
the preview version so next we're gonna
set the navigation div to 100% just go
ahead and jump into style the width of
the navigation div here is this and
similar to everything else we're gonna
set a width here we're set to 100%
basically saying we want that Dave to go
all the way across very nice
so there's also a minimum width and a
maximum width so you'll never want it to
get smaller than something or larger
than something we're going to jump into
the paragraph tag here excuse me in the
this paragraph element in the CSS file
and we're gonna set a min width of 200
pixels we never wanted to get smaller
than that in terms of the width let's go
ahead and run that and then we don't
ever want it to actually get larger than
800 pixels so we're gonna set a maximum
width of 800 px let's run this one more
time very nice so you'll see as we pull
this over and over and over let's go to
the paragraph now so you're not a
paragraph on here maybe we have an
output at paragraph here it's not
you'll see the same thing with height
we're gonna set a maximum height for our
paragraph of 100 or excuse me a minimum
height so let's go ahead and find our P
tag one more time so we have min -
height 100 px run that now typically you
would probably you rarely would use
something like this you would probably
use responsive design which is something
that's a little more complicated than
what we're doing now using a column and
grid system from a library like
bootstrap but uh this will work for the
time beam and then we're gonna set a a
max height of 200 I'm just gonna do max
height we're gonna do 200 pixels run
that
look paragraph blocks I let me let me
jump in here real quick to the
index.html let's see the paragraph box
well this this thing okay
I say no cool cool cool
zoom out a little bit actually so we
have a min height a max height the next
thing we're gonna be talking about is
overflow the overflow property
determines what happens when we force
our content outside the size of the box
so this is kind of how you would create
scroll scroll like the scrolling ability
for certain things although that's kind
of an outdated styling so let's go ahead
to jump into the content box class and
we're gonna set the scroll or overflow
rather we're set overflow to scroll
so now you'll see right here with the
overflow we have this scrolling thing
that's why we weren't able to see the
paragraph before we didn't have sign
anything overflow typically it's just
hitting so now we have this way this is
nice scrolling bar all right so we have
a little bit of a hiccup because it's
still in preview mode now what did we
learn we learned a lot about width and
height and we also learned that
everything has a container a div is a
container and then we also learned that
elements have certain certain width and
Heights that you don't necessarily know
about unless you put a border to them
which we did we also learned about the
overflow which we learned a very basic
thing and basically how to make a
scrolling bar for it if you have an
overflow so lots of stuff we also use
the Select all astir that's the cool
stuff a little bit of a hiccup and the
stuff but it is what it is
it's a free resource so thank you
