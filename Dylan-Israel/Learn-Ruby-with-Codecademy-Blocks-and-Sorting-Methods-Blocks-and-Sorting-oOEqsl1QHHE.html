so why methods so we're finally getting
started with the methods that did sir
functions for anyway collar basically a
set of instructions that you have typed
out and instead of retyping everything
out and you know having to describe in
this case how to check if the number is
a prime number we just call it again and
again so that's kind of cool
so this case it checks if two is the
prime two is prime 9s not prime xi s
prime 50 wants on prime and then you so
much prime all right
so onward and upward in two methods
blocks and sorting
alright it looks
when we append the method I guess or the
definition all right so it's just threw
me off a little bit this almost looks
like a for loop it's kind of a bad name
if you ask me but uh what I know all
right so we're gonna create a method
called greeting so def greenie it should
use puts a printed greeting to the
console so outputs welcome to my first
visit and then we are going to end our
method and then you can see her
eventually it's gonna be cold down there
all right so welcome to my first method
perfect alright so now it's asking us to
call it um so on line five here it says
easy as this so we're calling it right
now
so array of 10 it's the name of our
method we're going to call it and it's
gonna print out 1 through 10 BAM
simple enough next section more complex
methods cupertino parameters and
arguments so now we need our parameter
here is n and basically what's going to
happen is anytime we're gonna need to
include a parameter from somewhere maybe
we can just make it up or maybe we'll
get it from another method and it's
going to then run its instructions and
do what it needs to do so we want to
call it and do that yeah cupertino and
then they want us to pass 8 in it so
here we go and so 8 to the third power
is 512
let's see 64 times 8 that seems about
right
Splatt let's see what's going on here
oh this is interesting uh all right so
the splat argument is when the you have
an asterisk above something here and
you're not sure how many arguments are
to come so this is going to let's see
what up and this bros is going to be
called you can see there's more than two
arguments here so it's gonna go greeting
which is what up followed by Justin Ben
Kevin Sorbo so see bro some eh what up
Oh Kevin Sorbo is one okay cool that's
uh it makes a little more simple let's
learn return so this is basically your
first getter and I gather there's
getters and setters and getters are
where basically it will get a value for
you in this case our return of value so
that's why they're usually called
getters
alright so let's just do it together
deaf at and it takes two numbers there's
arguments so we're gonna say num1 num2
and then we want it to return num1 plus
num2 and then we need to end it so you
see that no code actually comes out
because we didn't call the add function
or the add method and because of that it
works there's nothing wrong with it but
uh we haven't used it yet
alright so practice makes perfect
find two methods editor we need a
greeter so def greeter it's going to
take a single parameter
called name and it's going to return a
string greeting the person so this is
return I Blair and then pound squiggly
name exclamation point and then where do
I end it and it doesn't want us to use
print work foots all right and a by
theft by force three question marks that
takes a single parameter number and
returns true
so Risa if number a modulo 3 so if this
number divided by 3 has no remainder
whose equal equal to 0 we want it to
return return true else else return
false and then we need to end it and
then so I believe I did that right all
right so now we're going to go on to
blocks it looks like blocks are like
nameless methods let's see here
okay so it's just built into the
language basically like The Times method
it's considered a block and that's what
we've been doing so far
so how blocks different methods in this
case I don't think we can edit the
blocks so um yeah so blocks are
basically built in and methods we define
ourselves that's kind of the best way to
think about it I think it's probably a
little more complex than that but
there's so many libraries that you just
have to sum it up like that and you'll
get more familiar with this time goes by
all right so currently the second each
will print out five times itself or five
for each item modify the block so I'll
print each item array multiplied by five
see if that works
Oh
so we'll say aye times five ceiling me
all right and there yep so the dot each
isn't change but we alter the output in
this case so you can see it prints out
one two three four five and then it goes
5 10 15 20 25 simple enough excuse me
so now we're going to be sorting in this
case they have something called a story
method so my alright dot sort let's see
if that works and it does oh wait I
think we need the exclamation point
it still works but uh the exclamation
point if I remember correctly
all right so this the exclamation point
actually replaces the original so let's
let's reset the code and so let's try
this we're gonna show the difference
here this is kind of important so my
array that sort and then we'll call my
array again and then we'll call my RA
sort so I plan that will call my whoops
all right so all right so print I don't
think this is gonna work I think I might
have to
I do work okay so in my rebus sort you
can see it goes one two three four five
six seven eight nine but right after on
line seven when we pray again you can
see right here that it actually isn't
sorted for it doesn't sort the actual
array so the array remains unchanged but
when we then do it with the exclamation
point it sorts it again and then you can
see right here that it then goes through
and changes it permanently because of
the exclamation point so just something
to keep track of foundations all right
so we want to sort it alphabetically
let's see what okay so I guess this sort
saw I was thinking there's alphabetical
but uh book sort so for Strings so sorry
alphabetically that's kind of cool to
have that built in very intuitive which
isn't always the case sometimes the
combined comparision operator so we need
to compare book one to book two in that
order
alright so so we'll say like underscore
one just the underscore two
so in this case it returns a one so what
does that mean if it returns zero the
first operation book 1 equals the second
it didn't return 0 because it's not
equal 1 and the first operand is greater
than the second and negative 1 second
operative so in this case I guess book 1
is greater than book - all right
whatever you say boss all right so I
don't know that we would be using that a
lot but I'm sure there's a situation
where you'd use that I sort your books
and descending order on line 8 use an
example of sorting on ascending order in
line for as a guide so let's see so
we're going to be doing books dot sort
exclamation point and then we need to
call upon the two parameters first book
second book you and we can name these
whatever you want and what we're saying
here is so what happens here
this puts in ascending order saying if
this one is its take it's taking the
first value which would be in this case
Charlie Lynch Chocolate Factory
and comparing it to warrant piece and if
this is less than it's going to move up
to I swap places and then it's going to
run through the whole iteration of our
books array so in this case we just
simply need to switch second book the
first book
does this is going to be checking I
think this will work I may be wrong but
uh some more complicated than that so oh
that works um after I saw this I thought
maybe okay this is a this is the code if
you didn't know that you could use the
comparison operator this is what you
would have to actually write out so it's
you can see this a lot simpler than what
we're working with there so basic
methods create a method welcome and all
we wanted to do is put out
welcome to Ruby exclamation point and
then we want to end it and then we want
to call it well so what there goes
welcome to Ruby
all right methods with arguments in this
case you want to change our welcome
method add a single parameter name
remove your foot statement and replace
it with turn hello comma pound name and
they don't want a crappy thing so and
that should work just fine oh we need to
because we changed it we need to supply
with the parameter in this case we'll
say Dylan it's down there you go hello
Dylan now we need to we're gonna review
our blocks real quick add a block after
done Ishaan will splice each item by
itself and puts the result into the
console
so I had a block okay so here's our
array and then there's that are some
equal to zero and puts the results of
the console okay so we then need to run
through spot sizes easier is usually
what I would do here and I will say some
think of a sum plus size and then we're
going to end it and then we're going to
print the sum so in this case it should
be 3 6 10 15 yes what did we do wrong oh
it needs to be multiplied by itself each
item size believe
Oh
looks like your block doesn't print the
square of each number to the console
using puts
huh alright so my array let's it you
also do it a different way we need to
call it the placeholder which in this
case will do sizing it size and then
we'll say here we want to add a block
that multiplies each item by itself then
puts the result to the console
foot size see if that works
there we go okay so we're just going to
be multiplying the size we didn't need
this sum I got a little confused by the
example my fault for not reading the
instructions all right some next is
sorting and we're going to use the dot
sort to sort the fruits in descending
that is reverse alphabetical order you
can use a combined comparision operator
example above or an if-elsif-else
statement so in this case we're going to
just use combined comparision so fruits
dot sort then we're going to do we'll
say free one fruit two and then we're
just gonna switch it over you see right
here this is ascending order in this
case what we want to do is descending so
we're gonna say fruit one and did want
to print it out so there we go
starts with pairs and works it way its
way down so those are intro to methods
blocks and sorting
and the combined comparision oddly
enough they actually never let me use
the sort method in so I always seem to
want you in class to create your own so
that was kind of weird and nice at the
same time so we're gonna be ordering
your library next in the same methodical
sorting section so that's what we have
to look forward to next you see things
are getting a little more complex but
we're still only writing about 15 20
lines of code at a time and I look
forward to the more complex stuff and I
hope you guys are doing well thank you
and if you have any questions that's
always just comment on the videos down
