in code combat doing backwards forests
defensive planes wood we're gonna use
argument streams and basic syntax it
looks like we need to equip our trap
hammer here instead of our sword let's
go ahead and get started so the
villagers must survive that's our main
goal here all right let's get started
guys so what we're trying to do is
basically build a wall here in here
before the villagers go to time so if
you remember correctly we got this nice
little tool which we can say hero dot
build X Y we want to put a fence and we
want to put at coordinate 40:53 and then
same thing here at 3919 and that was
3919 when we run it they should he
should go build this fence first not
today son not UI
that's it pretty cool so we're building
fences now looks like we're picking up
some boots boots are good leather boots
we'll see what they can do for us right
up next we're at the winding trail basic
syntax arguments and strings so this is
going to give us +2 movement speed it's
also going to give us our move XY which
do we have of that now what we have in
our current move is it's going to earth
before we could only move right or left
now we can move directly to a location a
definite coordinate location so like
what we were going to want to first do
is move here move here we want those
gems so we're gonna probably build a
fire trap here talk this guy out
get those gems and go back so let's
let's see if we can so let's see what
happens right now so the first thing is
you'll see right here we set the path
they're moving she's moving right there
cool next what we want to do is hear it
I move X Y and then what is this at 35
36 59 36 59 and then next what we want
to do is move to 37 14
that was 36 37 14 14 let's go ahead and
run this
I make sure we're doing things correctly
so she should move up it's going to then
move down you're then going to spend a
pause this we're going to build Hiro dot
build XY except instead of a fence what
we wanna build is a fire truck let's see
it was it capitalized fire trap
oh let's let's go and run this to see
what happens it may say that fire trap
doesn't exist okay let's try it like
that run again see a fire traffic just
like that no did we not learn fire trap
yet I thought we could thought we could
do that okay so Jason OH
we didn't build in the right spot so
that's 782 25 my mistake just go 7225
it's gonna run that
we're gonna build that guy so what we
can do here is we're gonna run up and
then run back down and let this firetrap
kill him so we're gonna go here uh move
X Y will move to about like 73 738 17
338 and then we're gonna want to move
will move back to about right here 53 18
so hero moves XY 53 18 now let's go
ahead and run that and see if our game
plan is working get the first game jam
you're the second gym move and build a
fire trap move up to top this guy a
little bit maybe a little too much
backup damn
alright so apparently we can get a leg
off our own fire trap so what we need to
do is we're gonna actually probably move
it to like 32 let's change this to 30 we
don't want to go out too much because we
took a lot of damage there so we're
going to we're actually gonna go ahead
and chain
I didn't mean to change that value this
should remain 25 so we're gonna go up
not as far but we're gonna go first then
build the fire trap and we want to
change that to a 32 and just so that
this looks a little cleaner all right
now it's running now I think we should
we go get a gym good gym pass this build
a fire trap
boom alright cool now all we have to do
is move back to get the gyms so this is
at 70 360 all right that's why we'll say
70 360 all right I think we're golden
hair gets Jim gets Jim so with you go
the trap let him die oh the trap give
the rest of the jumps very nice all
right looks like we're getting a new
item also all the chrome 4matic on -
pretty cool
so because the backwards first gonna
take a little longer we're only going to
be doing about three of these at a time
compared to the five that we were doing
before so patrol buster basic syntax
arguments and some other stuff
alright so we're gonna be oh we're
getting into else else if an Lu so we're
getting our loot but we're also gonna
get if and if-else and we're gonna need
our sword this time through your hero
must survive in clean code
all right so close your harem let's
drive you now have access to the
powerful if statements check your tool
water low right for extra information
okay so we're basically to check if an
enemy exists it's a wall true and then
we're gonna say look if there is an
enemy we want to attack otherwise we
have nothing to attack that's basically
what we use in our if statement so we're
gonna say hero dog attack enemy that
should be it
so now now right now we're not getting a
message like hey we don't there's
nothing to attack it doesn't exist this
is saying look if the enemy exists if if
it's an object if it's not undefined if
it's not null attack so right here we're
finding the enemy but in this downtime
it would have been brief very nice
so we could also dumb an else statement
to do something but we did nothing else
to do Google so we'll continue on in
backwards forest in the next video with
dumb biter
