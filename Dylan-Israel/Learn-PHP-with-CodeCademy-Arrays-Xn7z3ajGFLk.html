gonna jump right into it first slide was
nothing it was just showing us the basic
syntax and slide to hear it one sad to
go tues me two more items to our right
chips insults tuesday chips and sausage
all right simple enough just like pretty
much adding it to any other array all
right now let's create our own array and
I'll say friends set it equal we have 20
array here don't forget semicolon at the
end and in here will say that Gus
all right and as always for whatever
reason the PHP is having having an issue
with my browser so we will save submit
and that should work alright alright so
in this case um it's showing us index it
starts at zero of the Linux I'd start at
zero theory on line 8 through Center a
name tens use echo to help with the
third item intense so we'll say that go
we can just call it a tens and we want
index too because that's the third item
saver sweat BAM prints out 30 cool go to
update your previous code to use the
brackets in fact shows apparently this
is the same thing so we should still get
30 just a different syntax to be aware
of online a there is a line called
languages or an array called languages
change an item language I array take
your pick will change PHP to we want to
learn about just heard of job
we want to echo oh you know I don't
think I want to start code that right I
wanted us modify any of okay yeah I want
us to do it this way so languages 0
equals java and then it wants us to
print it then use echoed apparently we
just echo languages and let's see if
that works so that's just going to print
out array so I don't think that's going
to work
alright let's see
alright so we can see that it's working
like that let's go to the Q&amp;amp;A forum see
what they say what the issue is here
so looks like we are going to need to
print out all of them okay so what's
going on here so couple different ways
we can do this we've read a forage but
we haven't gone over that yet in in here
so we'll just do it the long way and
we'll be going all the way up to floor
for our fist item
save some at oh let's refresh the page
interesting we're still having the same
page here and no it's only printing out
Java it's not printing out the rest of
us let's go back to the forums see what
the issue is here
oh my god so I have done this so many
times so uh definitely make sure
announced for languages alright so we're
going to refresh the page and you can
see right there
okay wants to modify all all right DARPA
died push okay so yeah I guess we have
to mop I of them so then we're going to
reset that too let's see see see sharp
and we will do c++ then I saw then
finally bring this for we will do there
a hack one jack or something like that
that Facebook Fitz will do that and that
should finally take care of this so to
go along and we need to but hey so here
we are in the last slide it's go ahead a
roof Python from the languages array
using dot on set so it looks like to
according this documentation on set and
then we call the
lips and we're going to say index
variable to all for Python I'm sorry
three and so python is going to be done
and this is a little bit uh I guess a
for loop example that will probably get
into next time around so that is our
introduction to arrays and PHP up next
we have 4 loops in PHP so we'll get
started on that section next
