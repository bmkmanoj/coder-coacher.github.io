symbols names movies is the next part
this is basically showing us what we're
going to be building and we will just
give us what would you like to do type
add to add a movie update a movie - Lee
a movie
Oh just display see what there is to
display so just place memento Primerica
Nishat are cool simple program gets a
little bit of user input and goes from
there so we want to create a hash assign
it to the variable movies so alright so
movies - putting your favorite movie is
the key it's a number in you so my
favorite is let's see what's my favorite
would be yeah ice actually my favorite
movie a rock is homologue - and me of
that 10 perfect movie the perfect comedy
alright and then we're gonna put
wait did that work that's all we got in
there oh yeah this is a choice
really this challenge there we go some
user employed look I'm a movie person
all right so booked all right the case
statement so the else is what the case
statement will do if it doesn't match
any of its win statements in that case
in this case the value of language below
your exam is extinct I would create a
case statement so we have our example
here say case or choice
and that should work
so some use their input but they're cool
all right now we'll start with the add
branch all right so we're gonna put it
once this room is to add it all right so
put a movie please
and then we're going to say choice
oh nice nice title the title equals it's
chump next prompts they use this place
next from Caesar for the rating of the
movie and then we'll call it and all
right so let's say we push it up push
that let's see here
so say movies title equals see here some
user input
oh no no no okay cool
okay so say you chose to add add movie
please what would you rate this movie
about a seven
thank you the movie was that cool it's
not home alone - second best movie home
long alright
called on to symbol not to I on Yuri so
let's see if we can call it like this
I'm not sure if we can't actually we
don't need to do it like that which seem
to FX we go back
all right so that's all we're gonna do
we're gonna go right here time about to
Siam and rating die too and see if that
will work
we'll say all you want to say we already
did home alone so let's do Star Wars I
guess we'll get that line thank you well
so everything an if-else statement to
the branch of your case the movie isn't
already in the hash that is
let's see it
all right so we need to check to see if
it exists so first thing first we need
to check if our original thing movies
your short idle dot to your sport
you want to do this house will probably
pistol it out cool so let's go ahead and
give that a shot
see that fixes it
I some user input so we want to do home
we want to add rather and then we want
to do atom way we please we're going to
say home alone to say that this what
would you rate this movie I thank you
the loser sad well that's interesting
so their code works but I don't think
that's what it's supposed to do but
we'll continue on for now let's see so
we run to update actually let's try
something real quick
so we want to do Omaha air ok so we just
got this nailed backwards so basically
what we need to do is I believe there's
a question mark at the end of it so
let's see here this is good to do too
because uh our coats not working so we
need to check the home to five with this
movie already exists ok cool
so that works so we go on to the next
one good so now we're gonna do the
update basically what we just did with
update remove the foots for updated all
right prompt the user for a movie tile
store it in time
all right so chop all right and then if
movies all right so then it wants us to
change the rating value of the title so
puts us a new rating cool and then we're
going to say probably create movies
title equals I don't know if this will
work but it might
it should I think so let's see here we
try some and statements again so and I'm
just looking a little messy in here but
if we were in a like ie a normal non
web-based program here we could be able
to clean this up a little bit but uh so
we want to update what title would you
like to update all below to give us a
new rating
eleven don't they so everything's
working according plans
all right so display so we we have add
we have display and now we need air
we're on to display rather tour is it
fits movies okay
so we're going to see movies on beach
and then we have our key value do this I
think I'm missing something you know and
go back real quick
Luiza each do okay and so we had to
change our values just because it looks
like then we have to cool so we say just
story today is on loan to and for
channel
I last but not least looks like we have
to update our delete method or based on
a message but part of our method here
delete her code here and that we're
gonna get Idol giggles it's a movie
movies rather movies
Yukos equals now
okay I don't think we actually need to
do this so looking at their example here
it it sounds like no harm will come if
we just delete it whether it exists or
not
oh of course
wait let's see here line 32 expecting
keyword and
Housing Association
let's see what's going on here
just expecting the keyword and let's
just reset this go
we'll say enter the title to be deleted
and also it goes hit stop and then we'll
say
oh I spent explanation for I thought it
was part of it but I'll see if this
works done - and that should work cool
you see right there it's nailed so we
know that it got deleted and nice work
forwards your program no it's a display
up to Anjali our Universal this acronym
spectrum out was crude create read
update and delete be familiar with this
set of scoops you'll see it and
everything from API calls to web
frameworks like Ruby on Rails cool feel
free to play around with it okay so we
recreated it it's a little bit different
than other stuff though it's actually
shorter I don't know which one's better
which one uses less memory but on on
pretty happy we did that pretty quick
and in this case we will just call
update we're gonna share our
accomplishment here close that and next
course is the Zen of Ruby so uh as Ruby
is a delight
RIA açelya Ruby's not ugly I'm not
quite sure what this section is habits
2020 parts so it should take a little
bit longer than usual but it's fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
