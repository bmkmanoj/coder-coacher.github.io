thousand subscribers and I'm really
happy about that it's taken a lot of
work and allowing you to help me to get
there I know some people have been
retweeting me on twitter if you're
interested in finding my twitter just go
ahead and go to my channel page same
thing with my facebook so we've been
sharing things liking things comets are
always great because they help them they
they helped me understand the material
better and they also help other people
who may have the same question so it's
it's been a two-pronged process of me
putting the material out there and you
know you the viewers and subscribers
liking it and sharing it with your
friends so I just want to say thank you
so where is the channel gonna go
currently I'm focusing entirely on free
code camp I'll be doing the occasional
let's talk code video like this will be
one of them this will be more about my
channel and about me so what I'm doing
right now with my life is I just got a
full-time job at a software company as a
technical writer and a technology
trainer so what does that mean well the
technology trainer is kind of I
basically am going to help people use
our software because I work for a big
organization and we have you know three
main clients and they have about 25,000
people that interact with the software
it's my job just talk to the other
trainers and help them understand when
we roll out a new you know new release
new think of as patch notes for the game
where I'm going to be there and be like
this is how the you know our software
works now and this is what you need to
you know help the people use it so that
there's that aspect of my job I know
there's a technical writing aspect where
I'm actually going to be writing the
documentation for the company that's
gonna you know when we're implementing
new features it's you know but doing
what's called wireframing and creating
scenarios and use your stories and
things like that and so off a few videos
about that in the future using programs
like balsamic and just teaching how to
kind of create that process so if you
want to have
more in-depth idea of how software
creation works when you know you're
working with a company that might have
25 programmers and you know in my case
and you know 5 customer service agents
and so on and so forth so that's just
kind of what's going on with me so I
apologize if my contact goes out a
little bit I've put out about a hundred
and seventy videos in about four months
so I've been putting out close to more
than one video a day more than one video
a day that number will probably come
down to something more reasonable about
three a week so still be putting on lots
of content I'm excited about it and I'm
working hard at free code camp to get my
web developer certificate then my front
end developer certificate and that's
very exciting stuff for me it's great
for the resume it's great for the
experience it's great for the channel to
help those out and i truly encourage
everyone to go to free code camp I'm not
you know sponsored by them although I
would love to be you know throwing it
out there you know not you know uh you
know hashtag Quincy Larson no but uh I
that's kind of what I'm gonna be
focusing on and down the road we'll see
where that leads to so if you're
interested in supporting me you know
feel free to you know retweet share calm
and all that good stuff I've also
started a patreon account if you're not
familiar with what patreon is it's
basically a company that's affiliated
with YouTube and we're like say you want
to help me out financially so that i
could put out better quality stuff i can
get up on my own camera as i've
mentioned before in videos i'm using my
my but Matt's camera I can get a 4k
monitor you know better microphone
although I have a great microphone now
um thanks to you know I kind of treated
myself to that and you know hopefully
the audio is coming out a little bit
better in the videos and I don't have to
wear my gaming headset anymore so those
a patreon you can kind of either do
monthly donations one-time donation so
you also go on the you know i have it on
the cards and stuff like that but don't
feel any obligation do that that's just
like if you're balling out and you're
like man i love this guy dylan and let's
help him out so he can put out better
quality content go ahead and do that
pre-shave that but that's kind of what's
going on with me and the channel where
I'll do another video at 2,500 subs I
expect that to take probably about four
more months of the current rate of
growth and I'm hoping that I have more
great news and more great things to be
talking about because I'm super excited
about the channel and I just falling in
love with programming and now that I
have a job at a software company I'm
very excited about my channel because
I'll have not only well I have a sort of
geological aspect on what to do when it
comes to programming also be able to see
things and understand things that I
would never be able to do in the normal
workplace so they're in my normal life
from ass classic standpoint I have an
understanding well what what actually
happens when I go in there and I see
these JavaScript developers these PHP
developers these you know front-end
developers the people who only work with
databases and dealing with the clients
firsthand that actually use your
software so it's going to stop being hey
this is so much theoretical and this is
going to be like look man this is what
happens in the real world and I hope
that that actually really helped you out
and eventually down the line I hope to
do some interviews with my with my staff
members and my co-workers rather and
once I you know I've only been there for
a week so hold off of a couple months on
that but once I get a little more
friendly with them I hope to actually be
able to take their wisdom and their
knowledge and maybe do an interview or
you know ask some questions like hey you
know what do you recommend in this field
and how did you get into this and give
you some insight about from people who
are developers in the things that you're
interested in what's the difference
between a front-end developer and you
know a back you know a full stack
developer and what do you recommend how
did they get into it I hope that that
will really help you in your choices
because I know a lot of you are just
getting started in programming and it
can be you know programming can go off
in so many different directions that it
can be a little bit intimidating at
times and you may just not even know
like oh man I just thought I'd program
that was it i just wanted to figure
things out so i hope to be able to
release some videos like that in the
future again guys thank you for the
support thank you
the love thank you for the comments I
really do appreciate them they keep me
motivated every day I go through at
least once a day and get back to almost
everyone on my comments unless it's like
you know okay ah but to like you know
okay thanks for you know thanks for the
okay um but yeah guys I appreciate it
and as always I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
