gonna be doing control flow with if-else
statements by the looks of it let's get
going so on line eight use the
comparison operators to compare two
numbers so we have all our operators
here they work pretty much how you think
it would work
we'll say one is plus two semicolon save
in some out
again we're having some trouble with our
PHP refresh the page and see because it
looked like our operator was affecting
see how it cancels this up we actually I
think we actually need this at least one
space all right so we have some items
here we want to set items greater than a
number 5 so our items variable then we
have an if statement saying if items
semi cone - don't say if the items is
less than 5 you get a 10% discount
so in this case you want to change it to
greater and this should print out you
get a 10% discount so yeah that's save
and submit
BAM we get to 10% discount pretty much
just as simple if else statement as you
would expect with the motion in a
programming language so under the if
statement on line 12 write an else
statement to capture people who are only
buying five items or fewer in their case
for that echo equi alright so we're
gonna be doing exactly what we just ii
go we're gonna say if cash money items
is less than five our we need space for
this we want its that go out alright and
we'll save and submit
and because items is equal 300 want to
just use else so else and we don't need
to do this so there you go
let's go on here I'll psycho you get a
5% discount
alright let's refresh and then we will
I'm going to actually reset the code as
you see it's working right here that's a
little try it one more time alright now
it works not quite sure what the issue
is on that might have something to do
with the brows or something else but uh
it's more importantly understand the
concept so if your condition is true
your code should echo the condition is
true all right so in this case we're
going to say condition equals two and I
will say
we want to echo out make sure you can
show Hollywood supposedly programming
prints out the kingdom itself oh so we
want I'll set this actually this would
make more sense just changes so we
wanted to print out the condition is
false so there it goes
see I believe her right again
on the end and now it should work there
we go
so we're going to share this as we
typically do and that was the
introduction of conditionals and control
flow for if and else statements next
section will be control flow with
switches so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
