nineteen I believe we're in the this
mean it's the war section of control
flow in Ruby so let's get started here
we'll be building if-else statements and
produce different results so here we
want to kind of look at what they have
and this is basically what we'll end up
doing so it looks like just being
printing getting user info like we've
been being able to down case it and then
this looks like if dot include question
mark is asking if input includes an S
and then if it does we're going to okay
mxi so if it does we're going to G some
of it into there so this means for
that's what I was saying I am then going
to output the user input all right cool
let's see so string please we'll just do
this means for like all right so you see
it works easy I guess so asked us to
print for the user input so we print a
regular statement then we declare our
variable user I'm just going input and
get stopped
we're gonna save and submit it this is
user input we'll just put my name Dylan
so alright cool let's see next we want
to call it down case method on user
input so make sure that include the
explanation place use this response item
place alright so just save all the time
copy and pasting this in here so we're
gonna say user input dot down is
exclamation point
user input is Dylan and you can see that
it got lowercase your time do I have a
little control flow
so if stream to check includes substring
so this is gonna evaluate if it includes
something and let's see here
seriously if user I'm sorry
put dot includes include rather question
mark and we're gonna say D oh if it
finds an S okay so directions say find s
now pretty string of your choice grants
their chains MS all right let's see here
so line five
let's see strings included so it's
saying oh okay yeah don't forget the end
statement alright so we'll say we'll do
my middle name because there's an
acident see I'm identified method
include okay and also make sure you put
an ad in there so little things there
you go
this contains an S and I'm a good ol nil
alright so we want to remove the print
statement we're now going to use the G
sub and here we are going to put when I
say user underscore input and put we're
gonna look at the example real quick G
sub and takes two parameters that V sub
exclamation point slash a slash that's
gonna replace s and there and then we
want to replace it with a string of th
so we're gonna put Christopher in here
again and you can see it for play see us
not only can also down paste it from the
previous example sorry next quick thing
sending up the else branch
else
we got print rather our know this is
there is a single s that sounds a little
better sound a little weird
alright so we're just going to do Dylan
this time and you can see there's you
know a s so they'll statements working
nice alright returning the final string
the earth th theory
alright how to puts statement that this
is a name space a comma
oops actually was it found user say
pound user underscore foot much Java
lately messing it up for period here and
that should do it I believe this here
my name this there there's not a single
lesson here so princess this is my name
dill cool congratulations it's gonna
make me have a lisp again if I'm not
careful and itial if statement to be
prompt the user are enough pondering for
now click Save to complete this project
okay so in here just go over real quick
a week got a refresher real quick
gets a chomp down case how they find out
if there's a letter in the string
probably use that for integers as well L
statements and then only puts it print
it out so we'll do it again Dylan and
then we're gonna share again to
encourage people go this great free site
and next up what do we have to look
forward to it's going to be a new
section loops an iterator so we're going
to be using the while loop that should
pretty pretty cool so a little bit of a
longer section so now we're going to
slowly just be integrating everything we
learn so I'll cover that next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
