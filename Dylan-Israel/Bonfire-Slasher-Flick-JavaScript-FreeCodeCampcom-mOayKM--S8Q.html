in basic algorithm scripting bonfire of
slasher flick so this one I stumbled
upon it I redid this several times and
this is a great example of just learning
what the documentation has to offer so
we've you sliced before and if you don't
remember a slice does slice takes an
array and will slice a portion of that
array from a certain index let's say
zero to two and just take that and you
know you do whatever you need it for but
splice is slightly different splice
actually will change the array so
typically what I like to do is I like to
create a holder array and I just set it
empty to to a simple array so to an
empty array what we can do here is
normally we'd like iterate through a for
loop and I would change this array and
all the sir craziness so instead what
we're gonna do is just take advantage of
something that they told us right here
which is splice after doing the
documentation splice will just simply
delete from a certain point and you say
how many do you want delete we want to
delete to index variables from the head
and that's what this goal is we want
delete from the head and it's as simple
as taking our current array calling the
dot splice and saying it takes in two
parameters to start pram like the start
index which we're gonna just say 0 start
start from the beginning accessible and
if you if you how many do you want to
delete and in this case how many
parameter and this is all we had to do
to complete this slab so one line of
code more or less but why does it work
so let's go ahead and put our one
comment in here so we takes an array
take an array call splice 0
is starting index index point and how
many is the number it's a chop so in
this case if we were to add a four on to
here when our input is going to be three
four cuz we're just gonna delete these
first two and then there's the three
four so a great example of how
documentation in going over a you know
these these helpful links I've spent
about 15-20 minutes going over them
before I even get started when I when I
don't know the answer instantaneously so
I hope you enjoyed this brief but very
quick and important lesson about using
the documentation that the language
provides to learn how to make code
better in your favor and there's
numerous ways you could have done this
you could have done a much more
complicated where we pushed into a new
array and then we iterated through it
and all the source stuff like don't make
it harder on yourself this is the most
efficient way to do it and also it's the
simplest way as long as you know the
documentation so I'll see you guys in
the next video thanks for watching the
video don't forget to Like and subscribe
that helps me out a ton and I appreciate
all the comments that I get and all the
questions I get in the comments and I'm
happy to answer them so keep them coming
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
