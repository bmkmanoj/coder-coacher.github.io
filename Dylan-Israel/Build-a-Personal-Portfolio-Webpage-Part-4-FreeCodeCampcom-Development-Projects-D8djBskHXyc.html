back in part 4 of the makeup personal
portfolio I apologize it's been about a
year since I've done part 4 part 5 but
we're finally here's but it's been a
long wait but I did finally get around
to it
so last video last three videos we did
this menu we did this page we did our
buttons we did a little about Me section
and then I think we stopped there now
what we're going to be doing in this
video is I already have these divs out
here and if I apologize some of this may
be repeat it's been like I said about a
year but we just have these two empty
divs here this is them in a little bit
and in our CSS we actually have just
backgrounds apply to us let's see we
have page three here a background URL
and then we background size so it covers
the from left to right fills the spot in
this case we have for the time being we
have I some height we just say look we
want it to be 1200 pixels then we have
some padding of about 5% now as we move
forward we refine this we will of course
clean that up as well what we're going
to do right now is we're actually going
to go ahead and add some icons to this
to begin with to do that we're going to
actually use font awesome if you're not
familiar with font awesome they are a
great tool to to utilize I'm going to go
ahead and you'll SPO s-- the link right
here and typically we have all this
actually in the head here but uh we go
ahead and just throw it up like so so
we're going to embed this link right
here
what's this a header you should actually
be head
and I believe it seems to be working so
we're gonna actually read this li you'll
see that we have these fun awesome icons
now what is this let's go ahead and pull
up fun awesome real quick just so you
can kind of see the resources that are
available these are all free hundreds of
different icons that you can do various
things with free code camps a I didn't
know that so free code camps one of the
new ones so you know god bless fun
awesome go ahead and donate to this guy
got eighteen hundred thirteen percent
funded for a thousand plus more icons
god bless you man good luck but yeah so
I'm pretty straightforward you click on
the stuff and then you get an icon with
little bit of details so let's go ahead
and show you how we do the one for
Twitter we're going to jump in to our
buttons here like so and you'll see we
have our anchor tag already set up right
here and these again are just basic
buttons that are styled from bootstrap
and in between there we're going to go
ahead and insert this this I class this
fall bought Twitter so this is the FA's
basically the default icon and then
styling that fought Twitter is the name
of the icon that we're inserting the
fall - LG is we're going to have a large
version so all these icons come in
various sizes I personally thought that
the the font awesome icon large fit with
nice sizing so you'll see right there
it's right next to I already have the
Twitter icon in there we want to give a
little bit of spacing just so that we
can when we save it looks much better
we're going to go ahead and do the same
thing for github and this Aria hidden is
equal to true it's just you can have
that in there not in there by default
it's in there we're gonna do the same
thing again for LinkedIn
and there's other icons out there fun
awesome is my personal favorite I
believe bootstrap itself has some anchor
angular material a lot of libraries will
have a lot of basic like very basic
icons available at all times so it's
going to save that and now when we look
you'll see we have all these icons it's
going to put space on that
now we're at it let's change our
settings here so this is an autorun save
it run it cool so that's looking all
right but it's a lot of blue going on in
there and you'll notice that each one of
these already have some IDs so the plan
here is to style it each one needs a
unique ID because that's just how we did
it at the end of the day we're gonna
actually end up reusing that so this
would probably be better to be a class
but we'll worry about that later on just
kind of work our way through it so let's
go ahead and pull up our CSS and we have
Twitter first and that's Twitter icon
again icon uh classes IDs are denoted by
the hashtag so we're going to view a
Twitter icon and these are all I got all
these colors from some website awhile
back I wish I could say who it was I
always like to give credit it had been
so long but uh now let's go and save it
and run it and you'll see that that's
the Twitter blue cool next thing we're
gonna do is just go ahead and do the
same thing for github and I called that
github icon this is going to again going
to be a color we're going to throw RGB
in there but you get the idea we're
basically just styling the buttons at
this point so this will now be the
correct purple excuse me I put put the
wrong color in there
this will be purple and then just for
the interest of time we're going to go
ahead and copy pasta the rest of these
in here as well save that and run and
now we have these beautiful styled
buttons with the icons going on on our
page here now there's a little bit too
much spacing going on here originally
when I did this I did 1200 pixels per
section that's way too much so let's go
ahead and see how I want to ended up
doing I think I ended up using a flat
percent of like 5 percent something like
that for each section so I'm go ahead
and pull up my page 1 here and yeah I
just put padding on there instead of
actually setting the high so let's
scroll down to page 1 this is page 1
this entire background and we have a
height of 1200 px now if we just remove
this and run it it's going to be ugly
and it's going to be on the bottom we
don't want that we want a little bit of
padding so we want padding only on the
bottom so we just do padding - bottom
and then I decided 10% was pretty solid
let's go ahead and run that like so and
then there we go so we have this nice
centered piece here with our icons good
amount of spacing we have our about page
and why we're at it we might as well
change each one of these to jump to it
so if you remember we actually set our
class page to here we actually should
probably make these IDs so we're going
to give this an ID of p2 ID is equal to
p2 and the reason we're going to do this
is to showcase how when we click on one
of these links we can jump to the
section so about me let's go ahead and
find about me in our menu anchor tag
we're going to head and give this an ID
and we're going to set this equal to
excuse me we don't need an ID where this
hashtag we're going to put p2 so I DP to
run this and now when we click on the
about Me section it's actually going to
jump to the div like so
we're go ahead and apply that same
functionality to everything else so I
believe portfolio is p3 so that will
just put hashtag p3 and then contact me
was p4 and we're going to jump down to
our divs so we have page 2 p2 and then
we have page 3 and we're going to just
give this ID equal to p3 and then same
thing for p4 given ID as well
p4 sort of it basically just setting our
anchor tag to jump to the section that
we want mr. jump do so this is empty
obviously and so is this one but we're
going to work on that right now so far
we have this nice styling let make sure
I'm not leaving anything out cool the
next thing we're going to do is we're
going to just put a nice little header
here I'm a big fan of like headers and
sub headers just because I think it
makes a statement but you don't have to
do any of that if you don't want to so
we have this padding top class let me go
ahead and pull it up real quick where's
our padding top class page limitations
OOP padding top so right here it just
adds a little bit of padding this class
we created here and we're actually going
to apply that to our div so we're going
to div within here and we're just going
to say let's set this equal to padding
top
go ahead and throw a div in here
and we're going to put an h1 in here and
it's going to be centered because we're
inheriting it from this text center
class which is a bootstrap class is
basically centers text unless something
interferes with it and we're just going
to put something like next-level
portfolio and then we'll put a h2 tag in
there as well and we'll say something
like portfolio best above the rest when
I originally did this because this part
was actually partially done a year ago I
must have really been feeling myself to
do something like that so we have this
nice little bit of padding and
everything's looking pretty solid we
have our intro here now how do we want
to actually display well the way I did
it was actually embedded the code pin so
that people could view the result go to
the code pin page and then from there
they could go ahead and view the CSS the
HTML and I'll show you how you can do
that within code pin right now but
before we do that we're actually going
to go ahead and create this div class
row we're going to make it so that if it
kind of organizes correctly so bootstrap
works off this grid column system it's
basically you set up some divs in rows
and then the amount of columns that you
want in each one in our case we're going
to have two items per row and we're
going to say it's about the medium size
so we're going to break those up into
sixes remember bootstraps this grid
system is based off of twelve so two
would be six which is why we're going to
set this up before we do anything right
now
now as we exit here we're going to go
ahead and pull up our pins in another
window so I can show you the process of
finding one in our example we will pull
up the what do we want to pull up we
want to pull up the twitch JSON API
something that was I recently fixed in
their videos so we'll see that this is
working in the bottom right corner
there's this embed link and we're going
to want to do is unclick everything and
then we're going to have just the result
like so and then we're going to copy
this text it's going to have HTML
recommended go ahead and copy that text
and we jump back in right here and what
we're going to do is we're going to
paste this in here like so and if you
wanted it to be taller
for instance in mine let's go ahead and
save this and then we can run it and
you'll see how tall it is now there's a
lot of different ways you can do this
you could actually just do just simple
images take screenshots I personally
prefer this now I don't necessarily like
how it shows a limited amount so we're
going to actually change the height of
this but you'll notice how it's taking
up half of our width here which is great
which is exactly what we actually want
it to do now when we go back to here
this is data height we actually just
going to go ahead and change that to 450
we're going to save that we're going to
run this as well scroll down here and
then BAM we have a little bit more so
people can kind of see what's going on
but you notice now that we're a little
bit worried that when we add several
rows of these that there might be an
issue so let's go back to our page 3 and
we're going to kind of fix the bad stuff
that I did before and where we set this
height we're instead just going to add
padding - top 5% and we're going to add
padding - bottom 5%
and for the sake of the video since we
all know now how to just inject this
we're going to do the same thing for
this other div and obviously you're
going to have different things and the
way the different different sections but
what I did was I ended up putting an
anchor tag here and I just set it equal
to wherever this project was located
like so I'll just go ahead and copy this
from here I actually use the fullscreen
page if you're not quite sure how to get
to the full screen you're going to
change view full page and then this was
the page that I ended up going to and so
right here and I set target equal to
blank so it'll open up in a new window
let's go ahead and close this now and
then within here I actually just add an
h1 tag for each one of these and this is
basically just the name of the project
so they could click it easily enough so
in this case it was twitch on twitch
twitch JSON or twitch API project it's
going to save that let's go ahead and
run it and you'll see now when we scroll
down now these are actually pretty
intensive so it takes a second to load
this see we have this nice big link here
h1 might be a little bit big so let's go
ahead and like maybe bring that back to
like it nh3 you can go ahead and change
that real quick to about an h3 and
another h3 save that and we'll go ahead
and put this in this as well I believe
in the example originally they had six
different ones so we're just going to go
ahead and copy over from the row on so
each one of these is going to have its
own row let's see we have DIF class
okay so right here that's one and two
and now when we save it we can go ahead
and run it and we should have six of
these in here now because of how we
really doing this it's actually going to
take a little second to load but not too
bad then we click this will open up in a
new window again you're going to have
all these be different things what what
can we do to kind of clean this up a
little bit we don't necessarily like it
on the sides this is not our preference
some people do like that some people
don't container or fishery check so
sooner so we're going to div class page
three and we're going to throw container
in there another container container
fluid takes me a second to remember so
let's see okay so you saw how this got
brought in that's nice but we actually
don't want the background to get brought
in so we just got to change up where we
put that in there and so let's go down
to our page three got this container
container fluid we'll bring things all
the way to the edge now that works
sometimes in our example I think we're
adding a little bit too much so what I'm
looking for so let's go ahead and run
this and this might work so you can kind
of see what's going on so that's not
centering anymore that's interesting
I'll worry about that later I believe we
can probably do something like this
let's go ahead and test
now this isn't something that I did in
my video so this is exactly how our in
my example how I would test for
something like this or actually we just
test with two and it should work or it
won't work we don't need to go ahead and
go through all that so throw this ro
that's one and that's to control see you
guy didn't control X put that in there
control V save it run it so there we go
it's a little bit centered now we just
had to throw it in its own div and
seemed to work just fine so let's go
ahead and do that as well we'll bring
these into the center a little bit it
looks like OBS is not connecting very
well
we are at streaming this live as we
record so let's go ahead and do the same
we can just do a simple container like
we did before so we did that there's
that I'll do a div class equals
container close the div and then we'll
go ahead and gut this
relax throw it in our container and then
we'll do it one more time for this last
section
save it and run it make sure everything
is looking the way we want it to look
pretty cool everything is going we have
our links underneath everything now I
notice that there's a whole mess of
stuff going on here so why don't we go
ahead and fix that on page two how we
did it was padding - bottom we had some
padding and we'll do padding - bottom
will do 5% same as the top so it's
basically just going to stretch it based
on what we have and then we see this
image it's going to run this so we can
see what it's going to look like you may
want to add a circular image I
personally am NOT like a big fan of
squares so I believe I gave this an ID
let's go ahead and find it so we have
class me let's go ahead and find that
where is class me now when you go ahead
and do border - radius and I believe 50%
will turn it into a circle it's going to
run that cool so it's a little bit
cleaner again it's all preference in the
next video we're going to do the last
section we're going to add five buttons
here we're going to add a footer we're
going to add our email and some contact
information here so look forward to that
sorry for the delay on this but I hope
this guy's helped you as you continue to
develop on and again this is just one
way you can sort of display your
