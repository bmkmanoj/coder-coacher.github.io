spent a little while look done any and
well so I apologize if I'm holding you
back
object-oriented programming one so let's
get it going here
let's take a look at how they define it
so it looks like a class they're
defining a class and then just establish
the name and the Creator then we end it
and then there's a def description here
alright this all looks pretty reasonable
and then we create a new language object
with the two parameters name and creator
and then we call our description all
right I think we can do that
let's see create class called person in
the out of here so and then don't put
anything between between class person
and district all right so we're gonna
have a class person and we're going to
just end it by the sounds of it empty
class initialize class alright so this
is a method for this class I believe and
we're not actually doing anything with
it yet cool so let's see here give your
initialize method a single parameter
name alright so we have a parameter name
looks that and what else are we going to
do we need to set the name
all right so I'm sorry this actually
needs to be within the message within
the class that makes more sense this
indent properly is what else is going to
say lieutenant all right so we're gonna
create a new person here called Matt's
and it's going to be Matt's is equal to
person the class or want rate dot new a
new instance of it and we want to name
it UPI row save continue well a lot of
code so let's see here check out the
code and see how some variables start
with them cash money
add to let the cells marks this global
instance alright so at this point you
should probably list is your first
programming language know the difference
between local variables and global
variables which is a quick a very brief
summary of the difference global you can
call in multiple methods while local is
a variable it will only work in that
specific function slash method call it
alright let's go ahead and continue on
all right take a look at the code to the
right the variable my variable is inside
a class so it's not reachable by the
puts method outside of it you can fix
this using either two global variables
mentioned above so let's the air class
variables instead like two instance
nothing relax us because there is always
shirking ah
so global variables all right so I
believe if we put this on it and I don't
think this is going to work we need to
probably put it on both the dates right
here there you go so because we made a
global we were able to get it outside of
just that class go ahead and add age and
profession parameters to initialize
method then set those equal to instance
variables in the body of the method all
right so we have name we have age and we
have profession and we just gonna set
the age the age and this is basically if
you're familiar with Java saying this
dot name is equal to name it's just
saying that this parameter is the
parameter that you're looking for more
or less I'm sure there's more complex
explanation that's kind of look at
create class variable at people and
obscure count on line three seven equal
zero on line three create a class
variable
people underscore count
that's our class variable or setting to
zero
apron people count on line eight so I
line eight and our initialize method we
want to increment it by wet one okay so
let's say that I'm straight count equals
add a fuel account plus one and you
could also do plus equals one but I like
doing it this one and return pupil count
like 13 so that our puts so line 13 we
want to and then on line 20 it should
print out a person and the number of
instances so say that so in this case
the number instance this is true it
prints it out and BAM we're good to go
well so since actually look familiar to
you
the raise bit which we'll cover in the
future lessons generates a new record
invalid air the users tries to create or
save an invalid directory all right here
to go cause this first hand look at that
a commute to which I got to come under
we have to find a class application act
as well as a super bad air class that
inherits from application air not that
we don't define the display air method
like sort of access to okay so to
inherit a class so for instance the
super class would be person and then
child would be our son would be child
like if the superclass is smaller then
dropping down one would be we be the son
and above may be father would be a
higher superclass which would be maybe
grandfather so if you were to think of
it like that it's like you all come from
the person tree and then you and Harry
certain things like maybe you're a man
or a woman or something along those
lines so you don't have to redefine
as long as it takes those parameters and
you can override those at another time
so that's why we can for Superbad air
call display air without having to
redefine create an application class and
everywhere to the right create your own
class my app that inherits from a plan
my application alright so we're just
going to create a class called my app
and inherit it to save that and so this
is our my app inheriting the DEF
initialize method from it let's try more
entertaining it's less realistic example
create a new class dragon alright so the
last dragon inherits the creature make
sure it'll dragon right
give your derived class of fight method
over ice creatures all right so I
believe all we have to do is define it
and it should override just by the
definition of what it is we're trying to
do here all right turn read spider so it
will unless otherwise defined it should
in this case we are defining it to say
look def fight needs there our function
fight needs to return something
different so we're going to define that
but if we didn't it would return punch
the chops so let's see what that should
work
all right so the turn death fight punch
- sure we're trying to restart our class
dragon so let's look at a hand here we
try to use their turn not foot we
inherit it class dragon just listen oh
this is Carly right here there we go got
make sure you compensation is correct
adda puts instead of breathing fire as
the first line of our dragons fight
method
replace the return statement inside
dragons definition of a fight with the
keyword super alright so I'll do super
here
please start translating nice I believe
we get rid of this let's see what
happens here so yeah so currently super
overrides it if we don't need that
because we don't have any arguments
check out see how we're trying to get
dragon to inherit from creature and
person will get a superclass michmash
for last class drink alright so this
doesn't work because they're not from
the same thing they probably have
parameters I'm guessing that interfere
with each other pretty classical message
and give an initialized method
alright so called trust message and
define initial takes two parameters from
two this here and then we need to pretty
pretty straightforward so far
give your message class a bad message
class variable instead of equals there
in the body of your initialize method
alright so that just sent equals zero
and set it equal to zero in the bottom
three initialize incrementing this value
by one so that each time a new message
object is created message all right so
we're gonna initially set it at zero and
then I believe we do it outside of here
so we'll do that
it could be wrong
Oh
oh yes us a yes let's go ahead and just
copy and paste this in here oh there we
go we actually needed to find in the
class that's what I was trying to do
when I incremented it but instead when
we initialize is where we increase it
within the class is where we create it
so now it should work they're real after
your class create a variable called my
message my message those new
equals message dot new and we'll say
from oh my go string from dealing and
we'll send it to girlfriend
it's early resolve my message Thanks
this should be good so we're not doing
anything with it yet but we did create
the object itself create a second class
called email email that inherits from
message so we're taking some stuff for
the message and give it its own finish
line so it just takes one parameter
subject so we're going to be overriding
the initialize now we're gonna set that
subject subject and then yeah good we've
been parented from our superclass and to
finish this up go ahead room a subject
prior but in that subject instance
variable from email okay they meet the
subject parameter so I really want to
remove that
come on shoes
email us and it should take just pass
emails initialize method to sing to
parameters press and add super keywords
only my encoding body scheme and all
conditional eyes method
alright so this is supposed to be super
did you change these two parameters for
me too all right I don't know why you
would need to do the super there you
should just be able to inherit it itself
but all in all that was our first
object-oriented example on Ruby so not
too bad let's see what we're working on
next it looks like we'll be building a
username or password things there's
something a little bit more relevant and
I'll see you guys next video and that's
all these comments questions concerns
anything constructive
always
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
