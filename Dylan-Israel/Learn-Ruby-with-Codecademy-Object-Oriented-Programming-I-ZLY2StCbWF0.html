spend a little while so dun na and so I
apologize if I'm holding you back
object-oriented programming one so let's
get it going here let's take a look at
how they define it so it looks like a
class so you're defining a class and
then just establish the name and the
Creator then we end it and then there's
a def description here all right this
all looks pretty reasonable and then we
create a new language object with the
two parameters name and creator and then
we call our description that's it all
right how they gonna do that let's see
here credit class called person in the
out of here so an end don't put anything
between between class person and just
check all right so we're gonna have a
class person and we're going to just end
it by the sounds of it empty class
initialize class alright so this is a
method for this class i believe and
we're not actually doing anything with
it yet we're going to save that cool so
let's see here give your initialize
method a single parameter name alright
so we need a parameter name looks that
and what else are we going to do we need
to set the name equals
alright so all I'm sorry this actually
needs to be within the message within
the class that makes more sense this end
up properly as well so it's going to say
went in it right so we're going to
create a new person here called mats and
it's going to be mats is equal to person
the class or want to create dot new a
new instance of it and we want to name
it UPI row button save continue well a
lot of co home son so let's see here
check out the code and see how some
variables start with cash money that de
let the cells marxist global instance
all right all right so at this point you
should probably listen your first
programming language know the difference
between local variables and global
variables which is a quick a very brief
summary of the difference global you can
call in multiple methods while local is
a variable it will only work in that
specific function / method to anyone you
want call it
alright let's go ahead and continue on
all right take a look at the code to the
right the variable my variable is inside
a class so it's not reachable by the
puts method outside of it fix this using
either to global variables mentioned
above so lets the air class variables
instead of like to instance nothing
relax us the fair is always shortly at
so global variables alright so I believe
we put this on it and I don't take this
no work we need to probably put it on
both dates right here there you so
because we made a global we were able to
get it outside of just that class go
ahead and add age and profession
parameters to initialize method then set
those equal two instance variables in
the body of the method alright so we
have named have age and we have
profession as our parameters and we're
just going to set them I h equal to age
and this is basically if you're familiar
with Java saying this dot name is equal
to name it's just saying that this
parameter is the parameter that you're
looking for more or less choose more
complex explanation that's kind of mind
look at it create a class variable at
people and screw count on line 37 equal
0 so on line three create a class
variable so people underscore camp
that's our class variable or setting 20
apron people count on line 8 so I'm line
8 and our initialized method we want to
increment it by wet one okay so we'll
say that people I'm straight count
equals at a people for account plus one
and you could also do plus equals one
that I like doing it this one and return
view count line 13 so that our cuts so
line 13 oh we want to and then online 20
it should print out a person and the
number of instance of the silica and
save that so in this case the number
instance this is true it prints it out
and bam we're going to go see also since
actually look familiar to you the Rays
bit which we'll cover in the future
lessons generates a new record invalid
air the user tries to create or save an
invalid directory all right go ahead and
continue on here to there cause this
first-hand look at that if a mutant she
got to come under we've defined a class
application act as well as a super bad
air class that inherits from application
air not that we don't define the display
air method like success to ok so to
inherit a class so for instance the
superclass would be person and then
child would be our son would be a child
like if the superclass is smaller then
dropping down one would maybe be the Son
and above maybe father would be a higher
superclass which would be maybe
grandfather so if you were to think of
it like that is like you all come from
the person tree and then you and Harry
certain things like maybe you're a man
or a woman or something along those
lines so you don't have to redefine
as long as it takes those parameters and
you can override those at another time
so that's why weekend for super bad air
call display air without having to
redefine create an application class in
everywhere to the right create your own
class my app that inherits from a plan
my application alright so we're just
going to create a class called my app
and inherit it's just this patient and
let me put anything aside because I know
under send it so it's going to save that
and so this is our my app inheriting
that def initialize method really let's
try more entertaining if less realistic
example create a new class dragon
alright so the last dragon inherit some
creature make sure it'll dragon right
give your derived class a fight method
over ice creatures alright so I believe
all we have to do is define it and it
should override it just by the
definition of what it is we're trying to
do here all right turn breathes fire so
it will unless otherwise defined it
should in this case we are defining it
to say look def fight needs their our
function fight needs to return something
different so we're going to define that
but if we didn't it would return punch
the chops so let's see if that should
work alright so return death fight punch
tool shop I'm sure you're trying to
restart through our class dragon so
let's look at a hand here we try to use
return not hoods we inherit it class
dragon just listen oh this is probably
right here there we go got make sure you
compensations correct all right Oh
adda puts instead of breathing fire as
the first line of our dragons fight
method let's dot
replace the return statement inside
dragons definition a fight with the
keyword super all right so we'll do
super here
please start racing high school believe
we get rid of this see what happens
there so yeah so currently super
overrides it if we don't need that
because we don't have any arguments
check out the code via see how we're
trying to get dragon to inherit from
creature and person will get a
superclass Mitch mass for class class
right alright so this doesn't work
because you're not from the same thing
they probably have parameters I'm
guessing that interfere with each other
create a classical message and give an
initialized method I so-called cost
message and define initial always takes
two parameters from two let's see here
and then we need to say f rom from a 22
and elevate it to end it one day so
pretty pretty straightforward so far
give your message class a a DAT message
class variable instead of equals there
in the body of your initialized method
alright so a dad just sent equals 0 and
set it equal to 0 in the bottom three
initialize increment this value by one
so that each time I new message object
is created message alright so we're
going to initially set it at zero and
then I believe we do it outside of here
so be at message is set it goes that one
I could be wrong though
Oh
huh
only SS a key yes for some so let's go
ahead and just copy and paste this in
here which copy save this is it worse oh
there we go we actually needed to find
in the class that's what I was trying to
do when I incremented it but instead
when we initialize is where we increase
it within the classes where we created
20 so now it should work they're real
after your class create a variable
called my message my message equals new
x equals message dot new and we'll say
from oh my ghost ring from dylan and
we'll send it to girlfriend
it's early result in hundreds from my
message alright so this should be good
so when I do anything with it yet but we
did create the object itself create a
second class called email email and I
inherits for a message so we're taking
some stuff from message and give it its
own initialized so we're gonna say just
takes one parameter subject so we're
going to be overriding the initialize
now we're going to set at subject
subject and then we end it and then we
also need to hit ya so good we've been
parotid from our super class and to
finish this up go ahead room a subject
prior put and at subjects instance
variable from email okay they meet the
subject parameter so I really want to
remove that confuse
email us and should take just past
emails initialize method to sing to
parameter space and at super keywords
only I including body schema and I'll
initialize method alright so this is
supposed to be super did you change
things on so it took two primers from
YouTube all right I don't know why you
would need to do the super there you
should just be able to inherit it itself
but all in all that was our first object
oriented example on Ruby so not too bad
let's see what we're working on next it
looks like we'll be building a username
and password things just something a
little bit more relevant and i'll see
you guys next video and ask all these
comments questions concerns anything
constructive to always welcome s thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
