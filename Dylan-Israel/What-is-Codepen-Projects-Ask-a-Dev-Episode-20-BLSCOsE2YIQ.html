code camp tutorials where I build out
projects and things like that you've
noticed that I've used code PIN in the
past and köppen has a new update called
projects now what is a project it's
basically a IDE where you can have a
full functioning project with a bunch of
files currently it's in beta it just
came out one thing to keep in mind and
so you can only have one project so
that's the downsize and you can only
have a maximum of ten files in the free
one in one project and you can only have
twenty megabytes in size but all the
same I hope that they kind of expand
this to maybe a little bit more
reasonable for the most part you're
never got more than twenty megabytes and
ten files on on a simple project but I
just want to showcase how cool this new
project setup is now keep in mind you
can actually drag and drop your folder
structure into here the it seems to be a
little bit bug to where the directories
aren't if you have something in a folder
right now you're not going to be able to
drag and drop it so we're not going to
showcase that but they'll probably fix
that shortly but let's look at the quick
example if they have a couple setups
here we'll do basic html5 structure so
you have your index.html you hover your
Styles index s CSS you have your scripts
index J s and you can preview it down
below reflect so you have this fully
kind of functional IDE and you cannot
search for your files as low which is
kind of cool
granted we only have 10 files in the
mean time but all the same pretty pretty
nifty I really like it and it's another
cool way of having a project and getting
basically having a more in-depth
portfolio but someone can actually work
through your code piece-by-piece in a
very reasonable way and it's a really
cool feature that I'm really happy that
they've implemented
although the downside of of being able
to and let me show you real quick we can
drag this over bar chart HTML and we'll
drag it over here and now you'll have
access to my bar chart and same thing
with our app
we're gonna drag that over so if you
already have like a project you're
working on and you just want to throw it
up online you'll have all your code and
everything they on code Finn relatively
easy and you know it's right-click copy
the relative path all these sort of
things and it really feels like you're
working in an IDE and it's really cool
feature and I love I love a lot about it
you know the HTML has a red tag CSS blue
JavaScript yellow so it's a really
intuitive reminds me a lot of a very
clean text editor and it's just a great
feature that they're using on code man I
believe it came out today or yesterday
but if you have a project and you want
to showcase it to an employer and and
granting you only have one but sometimes
that's all it takes I really encourage
you to take advantage of the code pinned
projects and if you have a cool project
you want to share with me and maybe I'll
share it with you know the audience put
it in a comment below I'd love to see
what you guys are working on and what
you're doing and as always guys don't
