part of the introduction to Ruby it's
called putting in the form
of form a formula so crap like that
who knows check out the code and editor
that's what new things can you guess
what it does click Save this man
so this trance get such mmm let's see
what it does and see where he goes I'll
get such op is the I guess this lets us
choose it gets our info city are you
from cool and you can see at the bottom
here that puts her first name space our
last name okay so let's see if we can
just a so uh print the question so we
want to print what's your first name
question mark okay cool so this prints
the first name now
Claire variable first name so first
learn T equal to its Chomp so that's
gonna ask us what our first name is it's
then going to chomp it that's not too
bad
excuse me brother refreshes himself
alright so now I'd print prompts
variables and get so Shawn these are
last name city and state preferences
last name rule okay so we're gonna do
the same thing that was basically in the
example let me seem a little weird to
just type this out but actually at least
in my case I find it much easier to
they're much easier to imprint it
long-term so next one let's say we need
one for city city were you born in and
then we're gonna call that city okay so
get stop chomp get that user info and
then we're gonna say print what all
right
all right it wants us to prompt them for
this state all right and then we need to
say state vehicle it gets dot shop that
should be put together first in jail and
say reborn it for you all right for me
in the output so now we are going to get
it all together there's some example
code here shows us to call that we need
to do the pound and percent hash tag
wherever people carnatic then some
brackets here shouldn't mean that that
so we're gonna do puts parentheses we're
gonna say this is my name and then we
got a call and now we're gonna say first
underscore name and then we're gonna
space don't worry about if you wanna do
the same thing good last name one in
same thing we it's our city we're gonna
do it no space comma than space and then
we're going to all state and add a
period so this should work I believe so
this is gonna ask Jen to isolate Israel
what's the very important that's Athena
and then you see it this is my name
Dillon is realized foreigner Pasadena
California cool
so formatting was straight so she first
to introduce one new method capitalized
capitalized capitalizes the first letter
of the string okay
and then
all right after each variable sign for
Sentinel add to the capitalized so let's
see I kind of
could be wrong but uh let's see
sometimes they'll tell us we messed up
but we're actually putting in a bit of
info sometimes I like to just test to
see if I'm on the right sure
oh okay so I think we need to add the
we're going to just straight out go out
and call it out like that we need to add
the exclamation point
oh that's interesting it says that we
didn't call them on state but you can
see we entered it here and it
capitalized it so let's go to the Q&amp;amp;A
forum just sometimes there's a little
bugs on the site and we're in section 6
7 I'm putting up putting a forum in the
forum matter
okay and just to be clear the reason
they give you all these examples here is
when you call the CAPTCHA lies with the
exclamation point actually changes the
original value not just alter it for
view so now our first letter of state
capitalized is now going to be a capital
C dot a let's try this one more time
because this should work oh we have to
call up case on state forgot some part -
all right and then we're going to call
state dot up case
exclamation point alright one more time
details map each all right I'll do
lowercase we want to see the change you
can see it not only up case it but it
did the first one as well alright and
the last part oh oh now it's just going
to let us shark code one more time so
we'll do this and we'll take a peek at
what our next section is cool and
cooling and share it I always share
every every little little one like this
just because I think a little bit more
coding in the world would be a good
thing so next is control flow in Ruby
you can see now we're moving on to if
and else if statements and it's only
called end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
