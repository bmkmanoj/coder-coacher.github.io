TL DR in this video we're gonna be
talking about angular current version
five points something if it's six or
seven and near-future most of this stuff
is backwards compatible you don't have
to worry about any of that but we're
gonna be talking about angular what it
is what it does and then we're also
going to be introducing you to the
important parts of it so what is angular
right well angular is one of the one of
basically two main JavaScript front-end
frameworks there's a react and there's
angular angular referring to angular 2
and above right angularjs is typically
angular 1 anyhow there's also view which
is another up-and-coming JavaScript
library framework there's a bunch of
JavaScript frameworks but there's really
two main ones that are dominating the
the market at this point in time that's
angular and react weird we talking about
angular 5 currently the current
iteration oftentimes just referred to as
angular so why use angular well same
reason use any framework you want to
angular a framework is supposed to in
theory allow you to write cleaner code
that is more efficient and sometimes
sometimes has better security and also
already has some resources there to to
make your life a little bit easier as
well as make your code more readable
so a framework will also gives us a lot
of ability to manipulate the Dom which
is something in vanilla JavaScript it's
a little bit harder than it needs to be
and so that's really why front-end
frameworks exist so that we can create
code that is easy to read that has
enhanced functionality that involves
quicker development that may allow us
additional features as well as security
and authentication and angular is pretty
good at all that so what are we going to
be covering well we're gonna be covering
angular's major parts angular any
framework is massive and in scope and
you know I just got done taking a 25
hour angular course not too long ago and
we're gonna we're gonna cover in this
one hour so all the major parts that you
absolutely have to know and that's going
to be components those are our reusable
parts those are reusable classes we're
going to be covering module modules this
is where we essentially create a list of
all the parts that we want to use and
inject it into things we're going to be
covering services how do we do Ajax
calls and how do we share functions
between multiple components between our
reusable parts that's what services are
for and then we're going to be talking
about pipes how do we format and display
data in the UI without actually without
actually augmenting the data that's what
pipes are for and they're very helpful I
found myself really creating pipes left
and right now I absolutely love them and
we're gonna be talking about routing how
to this is a I need to edit this but
this is a this is not that little bullet
point is incorrect
so how to actually showcase certain
things in a route so we want to you know
when our route changes angular and all
these frameworks are called single page
applications you never actually load the
page but you do have you know routes
where oh if my route is this please
display this component please display
this view please display this item to
showcase and so we're gonna show you how
to do that in routing let's go ahead and
dive right in
now I know you're the type of person who
wants to learn you want to learn today
as they say and you're so gonna learn
angular today and that's a great start
and if you're thinking about going to
another level
taking our education to that next level
might I recommend dev Mountain of dev
Mountain coding boot camp I have four
different locations and you say well
what if it's not in one of my four well
dev Mountain offers housing with their
tuition so you can get up and go today
and get started so check them out at dev
Mountain com
all right there's some things that we're
gonna need to install before we get
started when we want to develop an
angular application
one thing is you're gonna have Tech
Center the one that I'll be using for
this video and the one that I recommend
just because I'm a big fan of it is
Visual Studio code if you go to code is
your studio comm download it install it
you'll be good to go another thing that
I'll be using is a git terminal and you
can go to get - SCM comm to not only
install git on your peer but also get
the git bash terminal which you'll see
in a second one other thing that you'll
need to make sure you have installed
this node as well if you go to node.js
org slash en slash or just go to node.js
org and I'm sure they'll have your
language as well and you'll be able to
down the live it so you don't need to
get the current you can just get the
recommended one for most viewers I'm not
gonna walk you through how to install
that it's pretty straightforward you
download the file you keep keep clicking
next and it's installed and last but not
least we're gonna install the angular
CLI what is the angular CLI this is the
angular command-line interface and what
this allows us to do is get a angular
environment set up and running very
quickly in a short amount of time and
pretty much every time I start a new
project I install the latest version of
angular CLI so if you want we can go
ahead and walk it through this part just
because I think it's a little bit more
so all those instructions so I'm gonna
launch my git bash terminal and if you
have git installed at this point in time
and then you right click you so you get
bash this will launch it just on the
desktop we're going to install this
globally which means that we're gonna
have access to it anywhere in our
application and all we're gonna do here
is npm install
- gee that's that global at angular
slash CLI there we go
make that a little bit bigger for
everybody and this will take just a
second so if it's taking a minute don't
don't sweat it alright so after you get
done installing you'll see some some
stuff like this everything will be good
to go
looks like at the time of this video the
angular CLI is in version 1.7 point 4
now what we need to do is wherever we're
going to go and create our angular
application in my case I have a tldr
folder that I'm going to go to you're
gonna go to that folder killed er and
launch your git bash there we're going
to be using this command here ng new and
this is gonna allow us to create a new
angular application and all we have to
do is then name our app and I'm gonna
just go ahead and call it TL TL DR
angular and this is gonna the angular
CLI is going to automatically create a
working angular environment for us to
get started with to be pretty pretty
straightforward we'll walk through a
little bit more of what's inside the
application when this when this gets
done installing and what you need to
know about it when we get up and running
here alright so let's go ahead and open
our text our choice again I'm using
Visual Studio code and what we're gonna
do is we're gonna go ahead and open that
file that just got create this folder
that just got created and we're gonna
see a ton of crap in here and a lot of
it we're not gonna worry about but I'm
gonna give you a quick rundown on what's
going on here so you'll see this TS lint
TS config this is going to be to give us
some styling suggestions as well as you
know angular is written in typescript
we're not going to talk too much about
typescript in this application I'll have
a separate TL DR video I can I'll be
doing on typescript and then you know we
have our readme file for some
information about how to run our
application and then we have our angular
CLI Jason this is some of the setup here
so if you need to import a global style
sheet or anything like that you can do
that here if you need to import a global
scripts tag you can do that here as well
you can see the name of our application
as well and then when we these are our
node modules all the installs that come
along with angular and some end-to-end
testing so a couple more things to see
so this is our global stylesheet the
styles.css so if we want to apply styles
globally to our angular application we
could do it here and you don't need to
worry about that and then an index.html
you'll see we have this app root this is
our index.html is exactly what you would
expect we have a title here for our main
home page and then our app root allows
us to Alette this is what's injecting
the at some point we have to inject our
components into here so that's what's
going on here don't worry too much about
that for the time being and then assets
don't need to worry about that then app
okay I could have spent a lot more time
you know talking about this but really
all this sort of stuff isn't important
we have our package JSON where this has
our installs at the time of this video
it's apparently installing five point
two point nine specifically of things in
angular just for that so you know and
our dependencies and all that sort of
stuff let's go ahead and talk a little
bit about a component and actually get
this up and running so we could see what
comes by default with the angular CLI
project alright so let's go ahead and
launch the angular the default angular
project which we've made no changes to
quite yet you'll notice that I'm
actually now in the folder the same the
root folder TLDR angular that we created
all we have to do here is put ng serve
and what this is gonna do is it's gonna
launch our development server angular
the angular CLI creates a nice little
project for us where by default if we go
to localhost 4200 we'll go here we have
a wonderful little environment this is
what it's going to look like by default
when we get started with an angular
project it has some links to CLI
documentation the angular blog etc etc
and then the tours of Heroes example
now one thing to keep in mind is the
development server is really great so
that if we made a change to our
application like so and we wanted to
change welcome to app for instance yeah
to welcome you know hello to app and we
saved it
the angular CLI project that setup
automatically refreshes it so that you
know we don't have to go and click
refresh every time we save and make a
change in our application it's gonna do
that for us all right so what we're
gonna be doing for our application is
we're gonna be building a survey form
and then we're gonna have some services
connected to it but that's gonna cover
everything that I want us to talk about
so before we move forward let's actually
get out this HTML file you'll see here
that this is just the stuff that we
already looked at this isn't going to be
helpful to us we're going ahead and cut
that out but let's talk about how each
one of these components you'll see this
component key where this basically lets
us know what this is right and there's a
definite file filename convention that
goes along with this but this dot HTML
that's gonna be our view the dot CSS
that's of course gonna be our style
sheets one thing to keep in mind with
angular style sheets by default if we
have a CSS folder or a style sheet in
our component level like this it's
actually going to only apply even if we
create a name and ID it's only going to
apply it directly to the component here
it's it's the styles for this specific
component you'll notice suspect es file
we don't need to worry anything about
this right now all this is is some karma
and Jasmine unit testing all of a
separate TLDR video going over
specifically karma and Jasmine on how to
get going if you're interested in
testing specifically with angular I have
my part two course we write a ton of
tests we're building a cryptocurrency
front end application using a
cryptocurrency API and it dives deep
into that if you're really interested in
that so then we have our app component
in an app module we'll come back to app
module in just a second but this app
component now remember I told you this
is how we build our reusable parts
you'll see
we're at importing component from at
angular core all we're doing here is
importing this dependency alright so
let's talk about this decorator here and
what this basically is this at component
so you'll see that we have a selector a
template URL and a style of the URL when
you're defining a component there's
three main pieces the selector remember
in our index.html where we where are you
index.html where we have this app root
this is our selector so the selector
allows us to inject the other components
into a template into a view and then use
it and render it the template URL here
is the HTML content that's in there and
now remember we're going to be
connecting the the component logic to
the template but you know in our case we
could we had just the angular hello you
know welcome to angular in the three
links right we deleted all that and got
rid of that from the Styles URL this is
an array you can have multiple style
sheets in here if you want but this
allows us to have custom CSS for our
component alright so before moving on
let's talk a little bit about modules
what they are and what they do
modules give us the ability to at the
end of the day allow us to import a
group of items and install them into our
application basically say hey
declarations are going to take in your
components imports they're gonna take in
other modules that are going to be used
and then providers are going to take in
services and bootstrap our components
that will be automatically added when
this all launches and runs
don't worry really worry about these
three main ones here are the ones you
have to worry about for the extent of
this video and just get up and running
so declarations you have components
imports you add modules providers you
add services we don't have any services
yet but modules at the end a really are
just a way to add dependencies to your
application whether they're external or
internal that you've created to your
angular app
the reason you might use modules is not
only to organize your code better but
also to sometimes as applications get
more and more complex you may only want
to load 1/3 of your code unless they get
to the certain route in your code and
then you'll load the other 2/3 and so
your application will run a little bit
faster things like that so that's that's
modules and as we go and create
components we'll be jumping back in here
to add some stuff so let's get started
by creating by in our first app
component here we're gonna go ahead and
create a a heading and a title and we'll
get started creating our survey form one
more thing before we get started I'm
gonna actually install bootstrap this is
just gonna be for some styling and CSS
you don't really have to worry about it
too much more than that so to do that
all we have to do is make sure you're in
the your root directory and then go npm
install
bootstrap and its take just a second to
install alright after it goes ahead and
installs you'll see something like this
bootstraps currently in version 4.0
right now and well we have to next we
just have to add the dependency even
though it's added to our application we
have to add it to either one of two
places the angular CLI Jason we could
add to the styles here I personally like
to instead just use an import statement
in our global style say at import and
then just tilde will essentially hit the
root of the node modules and then we'll
say bootstrap slash dist
slash CSS slash bootstrap dot min dot
CSS it's gonna give us access to
bootstrap to use as we're building out
our components all right so our survey
form is going to be about crypto
currencies mainly because I already have
some crypto currency guys I'm familiar
with you don't have to know anything
about crypto currencies for this
tutorial so what we're going to be doing
here is we're just going to start off by
creating a little container this is just
some bootstrap and if curious how I
short-handed this built into visual
studio code basically has a Emmet
plug-in in the background
which allows us to type div and then
classes like so with the dot or the
hashtag for ID and hit tab and then it
will allow us to when we hit tab it's
gonna create that for us so we're gonna
go ahead and create this div containment
class then we're gonna create an h1 here
that we just put a crypto survey in it
go ahead and save it alright and then of
course we need to restart our server
which we haven't done yet so let's just
go ahead and do ng serve real quick
that's gonna launch hmm as well all
right it's back up alright rather than
switching between screens and all that
sort of stuff I'm just gonna put the
screen in the bottom left corner and
every once in a while I might pull it in
for major milestones of the video like
towards the end so you'll see here we
have our crypto survey it's h1 if we
wanted to we could add a class Tech
Center just to Center it make it look a
little nice so nothing crazy so far now
what we want to do here is we're gonna
ask we're gonna have three parts three
inputs maybe a name a a a drop down like
an input a drop down and then a comment
so three inputs but I actually want to
create a new component to do that so and
then also include views for the first
start off what we're gonna do is we're
just gonna create the component we're
using the angular CLI alright so to get
to any other CLI to generate a component
for you all we have to do is ng generate
component and then the name of the
component in our case we're going to
call it Krypto - form and this will
automatically create the component for
us wham bam go ahead and lower this jump
back into our application and you'll see
we have this crypto form component now
that has been generated in our
application so what gets generated with
it well we get a CSS file we get a HTML
file it's just gonna have some text in
here so you can see that it displays
we're going to get this testing file and
we're gonna get our natural
component here that basically everything
said about with the constructor and NGO
Nanette will talk a little bit about
what that is and how we're gonna use
that moving forward so one other thing
that happens in our app module you'll
see here we it automatically will take
and import our crypto form component and
add it to our declarations using the
angular CLI so we don't have to worry
about that if reason the angular CLI but
now that we have our component created
how do we add a component to another
application well it's pretty
straightforward right we we saw how we
did with app component so how would
crypto form component well do it well
let's look at our selector here we have
app - Krypto - form go ahead and copy
that and we go ahead and jump right into
our app component HTML put that hit hit
tab save it and we should see the text I
was in there and we do where it says
crypto form works right where you see
that there's something there very small
if you're watching this on mobile all
right very nice let's go ahead and
delete that and now we're just going to
create our form real quick
so we'll do a div we'll make it a row
and then we'll create a call I'm sick Y
filming this so I apologize so I'm just
an easy so we'll go ahead and create a
call MD - six we'll put a label in here
also be it with like font - weight -
bold to make the label there and this
will be for was this uh well dude name
and then in here we'll have our name and
then we'll have an input this is going
to have a class of form control all this
stuff is basically just basic HTML and a
little bit of bootstrap so it looks nice
and we're gonna give this an ID equal to
name so when we click on the label it
goes in there and we'll go ahead and
create another we'll save that real
quick so that should give us a little
label and a little form control nice
click name go in there cool I was going
to create another day of real quick
and then we'll
I did call - MD - six another label font
- wait - bold we'll call this for this
is going to be a drop down of some
crypto currencies and we'll just call
this kryptos and we'll say favorite
crypto and then we're gonna create a
drop-down so have our Select tag now
this will be we can get rid of name here
we don't need that but we do need ID
here for Kryptos and then we're gonna go
ahead and create an option and we're
gonna iterate through that in just a
second so one more thing that we need to
create for HTML is for that outlives
let's spread that out a little bit so it
looks alright
and of course I meant to add class here
equal to form - control this so let's
just make it look nicer all right and uh
well rabbit we don't need to have this
instance owner Oh we'll just have a text
input div dot row div call - I'm gonna
do - 12 and we can just go ahead and put
a label font-weight:bold this will be
for comments and then we'll say comments
and then we'll have a text area dot font
- wait - bold alright uh delete all this
other crap
all right cool so basically we just do a
little bit bootstrap a little bit uh-oh
this is a form control excuse me - a
form - control a little bit of mr.
Pelley
so we basically created a little bit of
HTML here looks clean it's nothing
nothing super crazy and then let's go
ahead and create a button I'll just you
if dot row and in here we'll have a hey
we're just making it uh doesn't matter
I'm like a button and we'll say dot BTN
dot B TN - outline - success oh and also
let's make it let's just make it block
level button and then here we'll just
say send or something like that all
right
uh it's not gonna look right if we don't
do this whistle do it so everything's on
the same page
all right cool uh and maybe we'll add a
little bit of padding to the top or
margins at the top so MT - - just a
bootstrap margin class very nice
all right cool so uh pretty basic so
we've created our component we're not
using routes yet we're not gonna worry
about that but let's actually and we
haven't done any logic in our component
yet we'll come back to that in a second
but let's go ahead and actually create a
service because we want to populate this
drop-down here with a list of crypto
currencies so how do we go in create a
service all right before we move forward
let's look at the the endpoint that
we're gonna be getting our data from
well beginning in from HTTP colon slash
slash API coin market capcom /v 1 slash
ticker and if you don't have a JSON I
have an extension called the JSON format
or you can just google chrome extension
JSON format it'll come parse like this
and so I highly this is just straight-up
text but sometimes they'll come back
it's one long string so you can't
collapse it I really like this plug-in
it's a great one but basically what
we're gonna do is we're just gonna go
ahead and pass in this name property
from the object but first we have to get
the service so that we we can actually
do the Ajax calls let's go ahead and
create our service we're gonna create it
just like how we did our component if
you remember earlier or we can do ng
generate service and what are we going
to call it well in this case I think
we're just gonna call it our crypto
service wham bam cool so you'll see that
we have created a crypto service it
added here now we're not gonna be
talking too much about good file
structure and folder structures there's
just no time but typically I would have
my own I would have a every one of my
components would have their own folder
and a service would have its own folder
model would have its own folder pipes
would have its own folder so on and so
forth
but for the sake of this video in time
we're just gonna go ahead and not worry
about that so you'll notice that when we
create a service a couple things happen
one it creates a test a test application
here for us to test the service we're
not going to worry about that again and
then it creates our service you'll
notice here that we have this add
injectable this allows us to create a
service at the end add a similar how we
have to pass in the the metadata with
the act component the @ injectable is
for services that's going on here and
you always also notice that now Oh
didn't at it that's very I thought it
was gonna add it so we have to add the
crypto service in order for us to use it
in other applications here to the
application so we're gonna import what
did we end up being crypto service
service if that isn't a bad name I don't
know what is so let's go ahead and just
drop off that last service real quick
crypto service
Shh I probably should have named that
Virgil service so from that what are we
going to name it right here just pass
that in cool so now that we have an
importer we have to add it to our energy
model though importing here without
adding it to the ng model does nothing
services get added to the providers now
our applications will have access to our
service so how do we make an AJAX call
from our service though because that's
our that's our end goal right that's
what we're trying to accomplish okay so
as of angular 5 the HTTP module slightly
changed and so we're gonna import in our
service the HTTP client and that's gonna
be from at angular / comment / HTTP now
one thing to be able to use this is we
actually have to import the HTTP module
in our app module here so that we have
access to this essentially alright so in
our component in our excuse me in our
module we're going to import the HTTP
client module from the same place that
we just did a moment ago for HTTP client
now this is gonna be at angular /
comment / HTTP and then now that we've
imported it we have to go to our imports
here and just let it know that we plan
on using it and adding it to our imports
so now that we've done that we'll have
the ability to actually use the HTTP
client now when you're doing a service
in the constructor if you're a
constructor basically all it really all
you really need to know about this if
you're not familiar with more
object-oriented programming is a
constructor essentially when we create
our crypto service these are the
properties that get created along with
it that it that are these are the the
dependencies that get added to it and so
we're gonna create that dependency and
we're just create we can just put HTTP
we're not gonna put anything as public
or private because I don't want this to
confuse anybody so HTTP
of type HTTP client now that we've done
that whenever you actually go and use
the crypto service we'll have the
ability to go and and use the HTTP
client module so how do we go about
actually doing that Ajax call it's
pretty straightforward
we're gonna create a function in here
called get kryptos and all we want to do
here is return this dot HTTP dot get and
then remember that route I was just
telling you about a second ago we're
gonna take this route we're gonna pass
this in like so and then we're going to
say what's the issue is getting this
here HTTP doesn't exist on type of
crypto service yes it does I think this
is just a little bit of the module issue
here sometimes when you add new modules
without restarting your server you get
some some little warnings we'll worry
about fixing those warnings later on so
what we're going to return here is
what's called an zero bowl by default it
returns a promise so the way that we
convert our promise to a observable is
we just use the concat method and what
we're gonna get back from here is a
response let me go ahead and wrap that
and what we want to do is take that
response and we want to take that
response and we return it back as an
observable in JSON form so now that
we've done that this will allow us
that's what crypto Rock cr1 yes crypto
so there we go to subscribe to that
observable in our component and then get
that data let's go ahead and see what
that's gonna look like all right so how
do we add this service to our component
well so exactly how we added HTTP to our
service is
now when we jump into our crypto forum
component TS in our constructor going
good we are going to first we have to
import that service so we're gonna
import the crypto service from dot dot
slash crypto service and then we're
gonna add it as a dependency and in our
case we're just gonna call it crypto
service and then of type crypto service
now by default we want it to actually
fire off and that's what this ng on an
it is essentially win the component
loads it will then fire off whatever
code is within here on an INT comes from
at angular core and you can just put
implement on knit as well as this
function name ng on in it to make sure
that the code gets fired off so all
we're going to do is say this dot crypto
service dot get oh and of course make
sure you spell crypto service or your
intellisense will not work it and get
does what's going on here no I spelt
alright okay cool get crip dose and then
what we want to do is we want to
subscribe to those kryptos and this is
going to pass back some data and all we
want to do here good time beam just make
sure we set everything up just want to
go ahead and console dot log that data
save it and everything should work
although this is giving me an error all
right so it looks like it's having some
issues detecting our alright
dependencies what we're going to do is
we're actually going to close our server
and then we're going to rebuild it the
reason for this is sometimes when you
add new add new dependencies to modules
create new components it angular
sometimes doesn't know they exist and I
think that's what's happening here so
HTTP does not exist on Krypto service ok
so my mistake here
is we have to actually jump back in here
and put this public property on
apparently for dependencies and this
will allow us to essentially have access
to our crypto service within it
otherwise I think it's assuming it's
private or it's assuming that it's it's
so I didn't want to do any public or
private aspects of our application here
but it seems when we do dependency
injection we have to actually add that
and so let's jump back into crypto
service and do the same thing public in
this case really only means that hey
other applications can use it even the
user can call this if they want to and
so now we'll have access to our
application and come at it also made a
little mistake here can kappa don't have
to do this in the application anymore it
used to have to in the old one but what
we'll have here is just this get call go
clean up the code a little bit no big
deal and then jump back into our crypto
form component which now you'll notice
and I'll go ahead and pull this down for
this you'll notice in the shot here we
get our hundred kryptos and we have
access to the whole thing that's because
the reason for that can cat map is when
we made the change from angular HTTP to
angular common HTTP they convert it from
promise to observable for you and so
that that's why we're doing it we no
longer have to do that so that's why
that function doesn't exist alright the
next thing that we're going to do is we
have to actually store this data right
does no good for us to use it in our
template if we can't store it and
iterate through it so what we're gonna
do is we're just create a variable here
and we're just going to call this crypto
array and what this is is is a property
of our component and crypto array is
probably a really bad name so let's just
a call this top 100 curve dos and
we'll just initialize it here and then
in our data instead of just console
logging it will say this dot top 100
crip dos is equal to the data in a
production level application we would
have some models and we'd be creating
some classes and maybe an interface
we're not worried about that right now
we're just trying to get the basics down
so we create this property and this top
100 Kryptos now that we have this well
we can actually use it in our
application so let's jump into our
crypto form component and what we want
the whole reason we set that up was for
this drop-down to actually populate with
values and the way that we can iterate
through an array we use this structural
directive here called ng 4 which will
let us do that and all we have to do is
say we'll say let crypto now that is our
element that we're going to be iterating
through of top 100 crypto so that's our
array and then using string
interpolation with these curly braces we
can just say crypto dot name that dot
name of course comes from the the
application that the that we are looking
at and you'll see here we have our 100
kryptos in order of I believe
marketshare and why we're at it let's
just have add an option here so that
it's not gonna select the very first
value but now we've set up our service
with a with the Ajax College do a get
call everything's working well save that
and bam so we have access to the top 100
cryptos very cool but how do we actually
store the data and pass data and you
know how do we how do we do that well
we're gonna use a something called ng
model so ng model allows us to create
essentially place a two-way binding so
that we can change a value in the
controller in our component and we can
change values in our template or our
view here and so do that let's go ahead
and jump into our form component we'll
just define an object real quick
and we'll just call this crypto survey
and this is gonna be equal to an object
and we're gonna say name and by default
we'll set it to an empty string and
again you'd probably be doing this in
class and then we'll say favorite crypto
I will set that to an empty string and
then we'll do comments and we'll set
that to an empty string so we have
another property like we have with our
top 100 Kryptos from earlier but now we
want to be able to target this directly
and change the values so how do we how
do we modify our HTML to do that well on
our input here we can use a ng model and
assign it and what we're gonna sign it
to is essentially exactly that which I
forgot what the hell name I just defined
it was crypto survey what an appropriate
name dot name so we're gonna save that
and you see we get this big scary wall
of text why did we get that well uh one
cuz I first forgot to put name but we
should get it I believe we should get
another wall of text ok now we get a
less scary was still scary wall touch
can't by the end you mouth this is a
known property of input all that means
is that we actually have to jump into
our app module and we have to import the
forints module right so they're assuming
that you're doing some sort of form if
you using andrew model you're probably
working with forms and they want you to
go ahead and import the forms module and
add it to your application and that's
gonna be from at angular slash forms
very cool take our forms module throw it
in there save it
and that should solve our issue moving
forward and now we can go ahead and and
everything works and you'll notice that
if we wanted for instance a set name by
default to Dylan we could change it in
our application and you'll see it loads
with Dylan and if we were to change this
it would affect this as well and one way
that will well show that is when we do
our submission so let's go ahead and
delete that and we'll just go and have
ng models to the rest of the application
like so so add it on the select and I
called that what did I call that
favorite crypto and I'm gonna copy that
one more time and then comments I can
remember comments where are you
text area alright comments cool so now
we've added we've now connected in both
directions our application here but
where do this we want this form to send
us somewhere right really what we want
this to do is we wanted to do it we want
it when we click this to have it call
and send some data somewhere in our case
we're not going to send anywhere we're
just gonna pretend like we are but how
would we do that well we can have this
click event here that then calls a
function that's called send form and
does some stuff in our case we're gonna
go ahead and create a function called
send form and all it's going to do is
console.log top-100 Kryptos cool and we
can see that just the two-way binding is
working just fine so that's like that we
go ahead and put Dylan remember
everything starting off empty will do
Bitcoin and we'll do like okay then I
don't know what to put in the center for
and cool when we send the form oh I
didn't mean top 100 grief trust I meant
crypto survey excuse me but you did see
that it locked out the top 100 cryptos
for that wasn't why I was gone for so
Dylan Bitcoin Sena forum and you'll see
in our application now that we've
actually modified the way that this is
gonna look 50 favourite crypto name oh
look we have a bug in our code favorite
crypto did not set its value the reason
for it is we didn't set our drop-down
value which is why you do these checks
which is pretty straightforward this is
just some HTML really at the end of the
day and all we have to do here is jump
back to option instead of every value
being that all we want value to be and
we'll just wrap this when we wrap this
like this what this essentially is doing
is done during property binding where
essentially if we wanted to pass in a
boolean that would be like that and not
it wouldn't be the string true and it's
the same thing for crypto dot name this
will allow the name to be put in there
not specifically the string crypto dot
name and then you'll see now we go ahead
and put something here go ahead and put
something here select bitcoins submit
our form and bam now we have Bitcoin in
there as we wanted before all right so
next what we're gonna do is we're gonna
go ahead and create routing and see how
we can set up our routes in angular this
is a you know pretty common property of
our thick item topic in single page
applications is a single page because we
essentially create these mock routes
we're only display certain things if our
route or our URL here is in fact a
certain path we're not actually
reloading the page we're just changing
what's in our view and so what's gonna
happen is from name favorite crypto
comments in stone form when we click the
send form we want it to then go and
change the route we're still gonna have
our crypto survey heading there because
our router outlet we're gonna add this
as our as our router as our route as our
view that changes based on what our
route is so how do we do that well first
thing we're going to do real quick is go
ahead and create a new component go
ahead and go to your application like so
I should have had this open my apologies
TLDR TLDR - angular get bash and ng
generate component and in our case we're
gonna just call it form
- submitted
and that's going to generate a new
component for our application cool
here's our component has all the same
stuff that we already talked about we're
not gonna worry too much about that
right now
instead what we're gonna do is we're
gonna comment out this app crypto farm
form and you'll notice that it's it goes
away right as we would expect right
because we don't have that anymore so
what do we want to do well we need to do
some setup well if you haven't noticed
by now angular works off a lot of
different dependencies and it has the
set of a lot of you know these ng
modules allow us to set up and say what
dependencies we're going to use and what
part of the library we want to use well
we're going to want to import the router
module so that we can actually use the
routes at angular slash router like so
alright up next what we're gonna do is
we're gonna go ahead and create some
routes like here I'm just going to
create a constant variable called routes
and we're gonna set this equal to an
array of objects these are really just
going to be our routes that we're going
to apply in in a second so you'll see
here we're gonna have an object there's
going to be a path which is a string an
empty string is going to be our default
path right our home page if you will and
then we're gonna have this component
which is going to take in what we what
component we want in our router outlet
which is essentially a tag this is where
we want to inject the our view where we
want that to be so in our case we have
our crypto form component we just
defined so we're gonna say look when
we're on the home page define define
this there and when we're on this other
route in our case we're just going to
call it submitted
we want the component to be our form
submitted component I apologize for the
bad naming convention I'm kind of making
up this tutorial as we go along but we
can talk about clean code in a separate
video and good naming conventions and
things like that so we have form
submitted component now the way that we
add our routes and able to use it well
as we all know we have to add our module
to imports and then we're going to have
this dot for routes for route here and
if you see and then we're going to pass
in our routes so this for route
essentially adds our application on the
root level all you have to really know
is this is a set up to do routes that's
really all you have to know for what
we're trying to get going and our for
routes not for routes and so now that
we've done that the one last thing that
we have to do is instead we just have to
create our router - outlet tag and save
it like so and you'll notice that our
app crypto forum component is now here
and we can go ahead and delete this
comment right because we are on the
index page and if we go anywhere else
you know it's not going to know what is
what that is and we're gonna get in here
there's a couple different ways that we
can solve this one we create a for or
for component but we don't need to worry
about that right now
that's beyond the scope of this course
but in our remember we create another
route which is just slash submitted and
now you can see our form submitted works
our form submitted component is there
and we're dynamically changing the
routes so that it goes and works
accordingly so how do we just link to
this and pass it how do we create our
routes to go and send to it well it's
just an anchor tag at the end of the day
really so if we go to our crypto forum
component we can go to right here we're
not going to do anything with this send
form component we'll just create a
router link on our
crypto form template and we'll just say
now they're linked and what do we want
it to equal in this case we just want to
equal to submitted and bam it jumps
between everything we want we can throw
this router link on anything that can be
clicked essentially gravity link can
also take in an array of values so if
you're gonna have different values now
this would work exactly the same just
something to keep in mind so if we click
send form it's gonna work the same that
way if you have parameters or IDs or you
have multiple thing things you can
concatenate that but it can take in a
string or it can take in an array all
right while we're at it let's just go
into our form component and just add
some text that makes sense something
like you know I'll just make this an h1
it'll make this like an h3 and while I
have the text centre class and we'll
just put some something like thank you
thank you for your input exclamation
point we're not gonna really worry about
too much of making this app look too
good but that's that's that's one thing
that I can that we can do to get started
all right so let's jump back into our
crypto form component and we're going to
jump into the HTML we're into just first
off we're going to display what a pipe
is one of the common pipes that you can
use and so a pipe just as a reminder is
something that you are going to use to
edit data or to to essentially filter
how you see data and what it what it
looks like and a good example that is
the date pipe so let's create a variable
here I'll just call it today's date
we'll set this equal to a new date oops
new date
there we go and we'll jump into our
crypto forum component I'm just right at
uh you know let's jump back here real
quick and then we'll create a new div
here and in here
I'll have a just put a little hh5 that
is today's date again we're not trying
to make this look the best it's mainly
about illustrating an idea
so today's date data today's date there
we go
Aiko so there's this very long string
Eastern Daylight Time all that that's
not very good what we can use though is
some built in pipes in angular to
actually go and filter this so that we
can get in the form we want without
having to manually change it so the date
pipe we're looking at that documentation
right now you can see that it comes with
several formats that you can use as an
example short is equivalent to month day
year year our minute minute and then
timezone all that sort of stuff
and then you have these are all
predefined because there's a lot of
different examples and it goes on and on
and there's a lot of documentation some
other pipes in here to keep in mind they
have the number pipe which is allows us
to you know do decimal places on our
numbers there is the two lower case and
to upper case pipe all that sort of
stuff there's also a slice pipe there
anyhow there's a bunch of pipes and you
can write your own we'll go ahead and
showcase how to write our own real quick
after we use the date pipe so we should
I believe we already have the common
module imported here but all we need to
do to use the date pipe you'll knows
we're using these and primarily in our
HTML so if we parse by date you'll see
we get the default one but now we get
this very nice
I did a very nicely filtered default
value now if we wanted to do our own
custom one we have this colon that comes
so the pipe as you might imagine is
denoted by this pipe and if we wanted to
add custom ones we could do it with a
colon and this essentially tells us hey
we're about to add in an optional
parameter to our pipe here like so and
we've passed in short remember we have
the short we could also pass in I
believe mm is month month minute Arden
was that minute that might be minute yes
minute I think mm is month which is the
fourth month for our use we'll just
passing short but that's how you pass in
optional parameters now let's go ahead
and create our own custom pipe all right
we're gonna make a very simple pipe what
we're gonna do real quick is just create
a a drop down here that has a boolean
value of true or boolean value of false
to say hey do you like crypto or do you
believe in crypto so we'll just do a
create a little div real quick make that
a row a little div dot call - MD - 12
and a label dot font - weight - bold and
love crypto something like that and
we'll just ask a question it'll be true
or false
do you love crypto and ideally you
probably wouldn't use a select tag for
this but we're going to select love
crypto and then in here we'll have
option value true and then we'll have
true here for now and then we'll also
have option false you know have false
here for now as well and what we're
gonna do is we're gonna write a simple
pipe that says if it's a true value if
it's if the value is true go ahead and
change it to yes output is yes if
the value is false go ahead and output
it to false all right so let's start by
creating a new pipe how do we create a
price at this point you probably guess
ng generate pipe and we're just gonna
call this bull bull yes actually it's
call it yes yes no it's gonna create a
new pipe for us jump into back into our
component for submitted and then you'll
see we have our test file and then we
have our actual pipe all right so let's
go over what's going on in our pipe here
so you'll see we're importing two things
for our pipe we have pipe pipe transform
this is our decorator and rumor how we
did slash date that's what this name is
for in our case is gonna be yes/no and
then of course we're exporting yes/no
pipe and we're implementing pipe
transform what is the transform property
coming from pipe all that is is
essentially our logic hey when we call
this pipe on a value what do we do with
it and so here we can go ahead and take
care of all this sort of stuff not
trying to introduce anytime script as
much as we can in this in this
introduction video so what we want to
happen here they say hey if value
meaning if it's true return yes
else we don't need a else right because
it's a return statement it's not gonna
hit this unless the sauce else go ahead
and return no and so now we've
essentially written our first pipe let's
go ahead and save this other file and
excuse me for having that and what we're
gonna need to do now is we're gonna
actually need to import that pipe in our
modules so that we can use it elsewhere
alright let's go ahead and fix our we
just have this very nasty little input
here and so let's go ahead and fix that
by just adding this class form control
which is again it's just a bootstrap
class form - control
which will just make it a little bit
more pretty cool so what we need to do
is jump into our app module and import
that pipe oh look it's already been
imported for us you'll notice that pipes
go in declarations as well just ask
components do let's go ahead and close
some of this and so what we can do here
is we'll just do some string
interpolation we'll put the string true
here and then we'll pipe it with yes no
and then we'll do the same thing what's
false so BAM so you'll see our values
here are actually oh excuse me so the
reason that this is returning yes and
yes
it's not because our pipe is flawed
because I made a mistake here so
remember we're expecting a boolean value
and when their strings they are going to
always be true because it's going to be
so you'll see yes and no and the value
here is true and false and so that's a
very basic pipe pipes are really
powerful like I write I use a pipe I
just called Keys pipe which essentially
if I have an object I don't know what
the names and the keys are gonna be I'll
do the keys and I can have access to all
the values in it and it's really dynamic
in that way something I use quite
frequently so when you're creating pipes
and you're really wait how do you wanna
think about pipes is when you're
creating something that's gonna affect
how it gets rendered in the UI you might
want to think about using a pipe rather
than writing some custom logic in the
component and that way you can reuse it
any of the other components as well all
right so I think we're gonna stop there
for this quick rundown of angular
there's a lot of other things we can
talk about in angular animations we
could talk about sending data from one
component to another and from a parent
to a child child to a parent we can talk
about how to you know inject services
and other services and we can talk about
testing
there's the list can go on and on
angular is very very long so if you're
interested in diving a little bit more
deeper deeper in an if' to angular
projects part one is a introduction
projects about three and a half hours of
content where we're going to be building
a personal portfolio we're going to
introduce it to a lot new concepts this
will expand on what we have and then
part two is a cryptocurrency project
where it's about eight hours of content
or six hours of content I forget what it
is it's all it's about twice the size of
the original project and this goes into
even more advanced details so if you
enjoyed this I appreciate you guys
