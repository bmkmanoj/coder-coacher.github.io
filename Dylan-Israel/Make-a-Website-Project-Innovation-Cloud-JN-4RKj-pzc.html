project just reminder you're getting off
some HTML and CSS they'll hold your hand
and these as much as the other ones so
we're on innovation cloud will be adding
a background image making a button and
adding a navigation menu and this will
kind of give you a preview of what is
supposed to look like give or take you
mess around with the CSS a little bit
but uh just make it look so what like it
should be ok alright so this says in the
header section add text for a heading
and a paragraph atelectasis learn more
write CSS styles i'll link it to the
button change the background image
alright so we go style they should be
well first what i like to do is see what
it looks like like right now this is all
that's there ok so do they have a header
section all right add text for a head ok
so fine header let's see what they have
this so innovation cloud all right i'll
end up quotes right and paragraph all
right and then blow that we're going to
add our paragraph or pti here I don't
forget to close it and this is going to
say come and write CSS to style the link
to the button let's see is this so if
you like me I like to look at my my code
every few seconds to see what is
slipping away so right now it's not
displaying probably because our font is
white so nothing to worry about so they
are fonts white so the first thing we
can probably do is add background image
Isis I think to change the background
image feel free user on your image so
let's see I think we can put this in the
header this image we use open it up copy
the image URL and then we're going to go
back in here Nazi header
alright let's try this out so background
ash damage pull in and don't forget the
RL put that in there semicolon at the
end now let's see what it looks like
okay so that didn't work body body so
let's go back and look at let's see
where they put their background image
now if you're not familiar with inspect
element this is a really great tool so
you can click this and then this that's
the header let's see and then that's
alright so it should because you see how
the headers are here so it should work
so we're probably calling the background
image wrong so let's look back I hear
background image URL alright it looks
right so let's go one more time and see
what it looks like let's check it suit
that saved it all right now let's see
nope still still nothing alright so
there is our background image okay so
maybe my memories i just used to sit at
my workplace background HTML there
should be CSS rally so let's hear
background ash image 1 URL it shouldn't
matter if there's a space there we never
tell
alright let's try this background dash
color I'll just make it red sea make
sure we're targeting the right area save
it refresh this okay so there's our font
there's our text we also let's try a
different image background image URL and
we get our own image from sunsplash
that's why should I call on my favorite
size for free all this stuff is free so
let's go ahead and take this zoom in
copy image URL put that in there and
also because it's so much larger than
the pixels were working with we're also
going to say background with melt
background we'll do like a header IMG
actually we're calling it in there try
this with one hundred percent see if
that does it that should make it so that
Oh No okay so now we want to look at how
do we make the background image the
waste of a hundred percent I thought
background ash sighs okay
it should be a whit sighs 100% one
hundred percent okay so what that means
I believe is that we're going to have
one hundred percent with and one hundred
percent height and I believe that of the
available container in this case being
the header so let's let's see how that
works so will refresh it there we go so
that's a little bit better and it should
adjust so it's it's going to kind of
elongated which isn't what we want so
let's get rid of the second one and see
if just the width works save Alice
refresh it so now it should adjust to
the width see how it just to the width
now the only problem with that is when
we get smaller it's going to overlap
like that but we should there something
else we can do for that if we really
wanted to get into it so now I wants to
style a button and our code is still
there
all right all right Souza so linked to a
button what might actually be the better
way to do it is to find the size of the
image now they think about it so if we
save the image and we see what size it
is because i don't know the ratios on
the top of my head open this up alright
so here is our image its properties and
364 third by 5466 so let's open up our
calculator most the properties alright
so 3644 by 5466 so 3 6-4 4-6 so oops
other way around excuse me what we're
going to do is set the higher one to one
hundred percent in the lower one so in
this case is the width so we're gonna
have 364 for d'Alene like five 466 and
so it has basically a 67% 66.6 % j so
we're going to go back to our code now
and so this is our width and then our
height we're going to set at sixty-seven
percent so we save that we refresh it
and now I know all right uh you are
saying there we can probably just you
don't want a hard coat it you want to do
percentage points but uh we would have
to let's try this position fishing
absolute and I think this may hold it in
place so yeah this is going to change it
a little bit but it's
no that's not working we'll have to come
back to that but uh as you can see
there's numerous ways where you can kind
of figure out how to tie it all in
together all right but UH one more thing
we need to do here is we need to write
CSS a style linked to a button so in
this case we're gonna listen let's
create our own classroom officer let's
see if they have one already uh
container there's it's right here so we
want to call our button was always the
generic learn mark-up thought BTN learn
more I had to be honestly I don't know
the standard syntax for CSS and HTML I
just use camelcase believes technical
name so just do whatever is best for you
but in this case free will do background
color and will do black you can also put
that in RGB and it's a hextech or hex
tag whatever the pound what's art and we
will do let's do background ash color
and we'll do a border white
order gosh color white and will also
give it a porter dash style solid so now
we have to call our button in here and
remember our classes button learn more
so in our container class folks will
call button class equals BTN learn more
and then we'll put our text right here
you learn more let's say / button and if
we really wanted to get fancy we could
call an a tag on it href and this will
let us open up a link and we'll just put
pound sign the time being we'll close it
then we want to close it right here and
if we wanted to open it up in a new page
we can do target equals a blank so that
will open up a new page so let's save it
refresh our page Oklahoma say dat so
there's our button in our container so
by looking at the previous one it looks
like if we want to do innovation cloud
here we might want to do something
similar to what's going on there we will
want to take this story x control x put
this right here and if we go to
container seer complete to the east
guitar am winning once yes you do so
maybe we may not want to style the
container but here is how we can write
style in here normally people don't want
you to do this i'm kind of ambivalent to
it i kind of don't think it's that big
of a deal actually we wouldn't want to
do the entire container what we could do
is this year we could you p style
current another paragraph here close it
and I saw you write CSS and you don't
already know style equals and bleep it's
want it could be text size let's try to
I think it's exercise to exercise and
we'll set it to 44 yet blue scales and
so let's save it just go to see ours
that's not right so instead strike font
save so there you go it's font size we
changed it up a little bit so you can
see our blue text here it's getting a
little bit of styling I believe from our
button class here we're using a
different background but uh well
anything else let's try to use the image
one more time URL I don't know why it
wouldn't work with that background it's
kind of weird just competing oh you know
what I put quotes in there that's my
fault Sterns from coating over the
weekend a little bit different so
there's our innovation cloud and let's
change the color and you should be doing
this again all in the CSS save so tech
system
sir
mission cloud hot dish like Texas going
let's see if things in to punish wait
okay save for huh what am i doing wrong
here so just real quick search font
color is us
oh you know what we don't have to do the
text whoopsies all right so just color
because we're just working with the key
tag so that should work just fine there
we go sanitation cloud connect your
ideas and we're going to actually have
to pdx because we want this to drop down
leave a little bit of a dramatic space
thing so we can just go ahead and copy
this over we'll just use style trying to
save refresh there's that and we in the
sake of imitating what they had here
let's let's get our button like look a
little bit more like what they're going
here let's increase this is 64 save that
learn more and I believe in our Styles
class for our button we had a black
background I don't think we'll need this
and we will do color ones safe now let's
go back to our local host you should not
cortisol so off
might say what are we doing wrong here
is it cuz we made it an HF it's
automatically blue and what we're going
on here let's try it here we have wrong
code in here you can go ahead and take
that out save us refresh dawn there we
go so that's a little bit more let's
make our font a little bit bigger font
size let's make it like 25 PX and will
suit border style and we want none let's
save that refresh what it looks like
learn more it's looking a little bit
more like it now let's see here what it
looks like I think it's pretty good
let's give it a little bit of padding
and lower this a little bit so we'll
lower that and we want to add some
padding of about strike 10 pixels this
should give it a little bit of space to
each dimension if we don't specify
pattie batch topic patch bottom it's a
little bit about 10 pixel above and
let's do like this mesh top and we'll
get a 10 on the bottom dash dash dot sin
3x and let's also we want to be long
gate it hanging back left we'll set that
it set that at 35 pixels like that you
look good and padding dash left and
we'll set that at 35 pixels as well so
it's nice and sunny
let's save refresh oh it's moving the
text see what oh I put two paddings Ash
left okay I was like that's weird I
should work i still pending the shrink
there we go save refresh ma'am if
nice-looking button and we're just
trying to get a little bit like what it
was before so where we're at this first
step I think we did pretty good
obviously you can always make it a
little bit better alright so next we're
going to work on the nav section here
which let's go back to our this is it
right here so they already have a class
called nav so what we're going to want
to do I just start off is create a UL
unordered list let's close it and you
can see you can see that we have five
list item so let's go ahead and create
that tell me we'll just copy that over
one too many alright and we're going to
put our code in here and schedule
sponsors and about and then we have
contact cool we save it it's going to
not look anything like this so let's go
to our nath have you well so let's go
ahead and view our code right now see
what it looks like so it looks like
there is a little bit of like a list
downwards but we want it to be side by
side so let's do this would you have
dot nap or actually they've already set
it up right here part of it so what we
want to do now is to text dashed in line
let's try this next in line I believe
this is it I may have the keyword a
little bit all nope all right I know
what I'm looking for though so let's see
here jai alai side x side let's see
display inline there we go alright so
display inline and this is going to make
it side by side it doesn't have lists
out none takes away any of the bullet
points that would normally be there
should work let's try this dot half Li
so any of the nav objects follow with in
the LI let's go ahead and save that and
now it should for sure work there we go
okay so we have our display now what do
we want to do we want to get the
background actually uh this is where
we're going to it right here um
background color except at the black
save it refresh so here's our black and
here we'll set color to white so we can
see our stuff let's go ahead and refresh
that so there is that and let's look at
the original think this so we want a
little bit of spacing we want it also to
be so when we hover over it it changes
color so let's go back to ours we know
what we need to do we are going to float
this left because we don't want it in
the center we wanted to go to the left
so let's go back to on where right now a
lot so we want to float it left say that
let's see if to make sure that's working
all right so it's float left we want to
give it some padding padding that's
right we only really need the right side
to have patty and we'll set that let's
say 40 pixels one save that BAM there so
now there's that now we need to hover is
it hover alright so let's remember our
hunger start of clothes these changes
real quick so
under color change yes Hubbard all right
there we go so in here what we want is
for the dot map li over I believe it's
guy I believe that's how uh we want to
set the background color and we could L
I hover should work which swarm set that
the blue um but this is more specific so
if there's any other lists objects and
our code we don't want it to do the same
things let's go ahead and see if so
there's that that's not what we want to
do we want each one of these to hover so
this is kind of working so let's see
what happens when we do you well but it
may actually only hover ill it might
turn the whole thing blew but uh that's
probably what's going to happen let's go
ahead and save and experiment so so yeah
that's what happened right thing so
instead what we would need to do is
create individual dibs dibs for each one
so this is what we're going to we're not
going to name them so they're so every
Nath that's a list item that's also a
div we won't like that give up so before
we go and type all this out it's always
smart to test it cuz we may have to do
it the other way around but this should
work
alright so that didn't work
let's just try that fresh that now it I
think it's working i just think we need
to break up the art now so all right
well it is working on the diff because
it's not we're not getting the other
values but how do we get this so all
right disoriented we are going to break
up our nav into separate classes so we
gon do let's hear now
now we could what we could do is break
all these up and dibs get rid of the
main nav div and it should work just
fine
ok guys so instead of trying to worry
about the tabs right now I'm sure we
could figure it out by I just decided to
change the blue real quick so however
sorry about the break and there but uh
let's get back to it see here in the
main section add an image so we should
write CSS to float damage to the left to
the text ok so let's write a image if
it's going to do that cloud image so
let's go ahead open that up this is the
URL obviously it's going to be too big
for us to use so what we're going to do
here is so dot cloud we're going to set
damage to do a background image and
we'll do URL put it in there semicolon
we want it to float left so we went on
the left-hand side and we want the size
the width of it to be 250 250 PX and
that should be good now we got to go
back into here and they wanted it in the
container section so here it is this is
also a container section
this will select the text I believe
that's the left of it so here we go
let's all give plus equals cloud or the
clouds cloud so our class equals loud
okay
put our ending do right here and so it
did here as well and so let's say let's
preview this I'm sick we shouldn't have
done that I know I put it there I save
that Turkish boss
let's do it this way image URL image'
SRC save and then this is a good name
formatting so BAM should be doing this
 alright and then we'll say we'll
just a class equals load and we'll take
this out of here save it refresh it
there we go so you can see it right it
floats to the left of everything if we
wanted to have it all blocked off to the
side we could I think this is good
enough for now justice kind of speaker
we took took a solid amount of time on
the first part of it so in the next part
in the main section we're going to
create the jumbotron so let's find made
here is made there any new so right here
we're create a div plus equals jumbotron
don't forget to close your game as well
and in here add text for a heading in a
paragraph so in this case will do code
we're doing code at amis
the web project section all right let's
make this an h2 want to look nice and
big /h 2 and then add a paragraph in
this div so let's p-type and /p and will
say I'll say thank you thank you oh how
will this hold your very name alongside
me alongside maybe one word so put dash
is I'm not sure I'm bad spot contracts
all right race is settling and put
damage in there and this is the image
call being that you are alright so let's
go to Jumbotron I'm recruit the I
created some stuff real quick right here
so we have color white for the tag h2
color white and then we need I believe
already created it down here as well
contain your Jumbotron position about to
know that's there's tron kelia they have
some jumbotron stuff here um explain
right okay uh where's our if some of the
stuff is in here so it's not kind of why
don't i don't like getting code and
stuff like that sorry how are you guys
so what we're going to do is to padding
dash left if we don't want it to be
right on oh no this is the kind that's
right this it's right align so we want
to give it a hundred pixels in same
thing for here I mean
so you think for the h2 we want it to be
padding Josh right and give it a hundred
pixels as well so let's save that and
see where we're at right so right now
you can't see it because it's white so
we have to put an image in here so let's
just do it in here class Jumbotron will
do SRC equals all right oops so I want
to I want it to be the triplet rock so
we'll put it in the giblets on here
background image URL let's get our UL
URL one more time and then we can do
this for the size so let's go to route
we can leave the height there I'm not
sure if these will interrupt each other
so background exercise if you cover it
will cover the width without change in
the picture enough there is another
image we needed to do here and I changed
it up here earlier as I thought about it
so cover will make it so let's see if
that I'm not sure if you can set a
height and a cover so you see right here
we're kind of on our way see these
images are now they're adjusting
accordingly without looping over so soon
back in here and what do we need to do
so let's take a quick look at so this is
looking pretty good so let's take a look
at what we want it to look like so we
want it to be centered it's not so how
do we fix that well there's a couple
things we can do for one we can let's
take a look at a CO kaput so we have it
out right so let's lower this h2 and
make that in page 3 or even h4 know what
to change our CSS is we change that
because that looks a little big in
comparison so go down to the jumbotron
and we're going to change that to me
h or this is a good example they should
put everything together so change it to
an age four and we also we can do
padding dash salt or how we want to do
is touch on each for Scott align Center
give this ear horizontally Center it did
I the outer solid dividing here for
foodage with one hundred percent and a
display table margin here alright so
let's do this let's do barge in dash top
audit so let's save that and we may have
to do margin dash bottom auto and what
this is going to do is in theory it
should Center our H for tech so let's
see if that worked it did not work
alright so what's what what happened so
save it real quick
oh whoops that's the two that's a 2 and
this needs to be it for and for make
sure your change in the right section so
right in desktop I see we don't want to
do pixels just because that be it's not
going to look too good unfortunately
because you know everyone's going to be
on different devices so we want to
either have a to auto or do a percentage
so doesn't move around ok so let's
try this let's to marking this top fifty
percent margin tennis bottom put that
out for summer
huh so let's take a look at how they did
it so we want to inspect the element
stay connected the h2 tag so text align
that's right but how did you get it down
sit here so diff Jumbotron
huh they should display block
I don't know what this margin d'etre Kid
Kash for and this was display block
let's look that up real quick so it's
good to understand
let's say here
so we just play it like a block just
look at okay so let's mess around with
that so instead of just being this let's
rh4 and won't do it like this so just
play lock so it takes up the whole
amount right there and then we want it
to with fifty percent weiteren zero
alright so you should Center this
isolation for all right let's try it
like this straight exelon uses sometimes
with images as well save I don't think
this is gonna work though so i centered
the text here which is nice but that's
not what we wanted so do it like this
cutting-edge top 50% I should do it
there you go so there's our patty BAM
all right so that knocks it down let's
see what else we got going on here so
we're down in the middle and next up it
wants us to I'll add a button that says
joint so we'll just use the same CSS
class where you use classes and this is
a bad example of a class a bad naming
example we can learn Marcos reason the
same style of bus so just put join we
also put a AAA traffic backup role foot
it's opening a new page because we don't
be in too I just wanted to use that as
an example earlier and then and our
button and in here we'll also do
style equals text actually let's see how
this looks like because I don't fully
around me the styling and then join and
we will put I'll do it like this
actually oh I always think its font dash
color but it's actually just a font is
its own element so we'll do font style
equals polar white and then we'll end
the far right here /font save it that
should change it to white cool and then
we want to probably shift this a little
bit to the left so how do we want to do
that so want to shift it we don't want
to add padding to the actual button you
want to shift it to the left so let's
let's see how would we do that
all right so really use position since
your nesslun that's what it was all
right ah so white and then God I was
feeling so bad chinglish left- 100px I
think you can do negative so let's say
that I'm almost positive you can
now what wrong wrong spot to put that in
the stall April's there we go font
doesn't have that property char position
s right 106 C
Oh
try this text align center that should
center
thing is if I give the button padding
you know what that / right there
means that everything we just tested may
not work so you see see that's aligning
to the right so let's try this let's go
back to the position dash left- 100px
let's try that
okay well uh just because we're in a
hurry welcome back to that time it
probably simply has to do with gotta
patti
can I do this or it cannot do it it's
here let's try one more searcher
build sack over fun
okay let's try this style equals and
then we want to set it to the width
nothing with the left and the right one
set to sixty percent social absolute 60
furs say I'm after you this natural CSS
oh there we go alright cool so let's try
the other direction at fifty percent see
see if we get that little line a little
bit better actually she'd been seventy
percent
and after get it just right that's not
bad there you go so let's ring it damn
so there we go and last but not least
create a div class called footer so
let's go ahead and we'll see i already
create this in here yes I did okay cool
so let me so what we're going to do is
set the footer with a hundred percent
because we wanted to go across the
entire bottom of the page so the
background color to black because that's
what it was give it whatever font size
you want and then we're going to add
some talk padding and bottom padding so
let's go ahead and put this in here
right now so it's a set the very last
day so we're in div class equals footer
and then we'll just put my youtube
youtube.com slash pizza poker 87 and
we're going to close the dip now let's
save it and see what we have okay so you
can see our font is there but we don't
have any color so because we're using
the footer there may be another way to
do this but uh for the footer already
have a flirt we should just change it
okay in this case let's just you font
style equals color white and we should
probably have to do this in CSS but this
will work as well / fun sit all right
now let's refresh our page and I think
we're done let's go ahead and look this
up real quick so innovation cloud
connect your ideas learn more there's a
button it's under target blank so it's
going to open up in a new page we have
our navigation here it's a little bit
different but
no we're still learning we can always
adjust it we learn about the hover and
changing the colors flowing the image
left we should another improvement on
here other than maybe centering these
and then having maybe up in the Texas
right here this is too close we need to
give it some padding next time that'd be
a great improvement for us Oh
unfortunately when we open the page up
this much you can see that our font is a
little bit relative so the way we did
our texts and this is not what we should
do so all we have it to the correct part
right here so let's try this let's do
because it's not moving in regards to
where it is on the page so instead what
we can do is set the stitches will help
right to thirty percent I'll set top
three let's say
eighty percent person and law down to
twenty percent and let's see if that
will at least save the button for moving
off the image oh no it's uh it moved it
up too much so we'll have to mess with
that and the next video but uh now I
think we did all right for how quickly
blew through this so definitely need to
work a little bit on positioning here is
our header at the bottom or a footer
rather but the way we got this to stick
is not how we should do it you can see
right there that is a banner year so uh
I'll have to look into how to make it
stick a little bit better and definitely
work on art naming our class is a little
bit veteran in the future but all in all
I say we're done on this project it's
not perfect but uh mrs. really free for
our own practice and in the next video
well hopefully we'll make it a little
bit cleaner and a little bit easier up
next let's see what we got going on
continue to move so if i remember
correctly it's a nike like so we're
going to be recreating this and I don't
think the images are going to be like
this I imagine they're going to have us
change the hues of the actual image
which is pretty cool so a lot of things
we've already done we're gonna get a
little bit better at hovering in
everyone these videos i hope will
improve so long as always leave
questions comments any concerns anything
constructive is always welcome i saw
just a negative G's all i asked for
constructive criticism is always welcome
alright guys thanks for watching and
I'll see you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
