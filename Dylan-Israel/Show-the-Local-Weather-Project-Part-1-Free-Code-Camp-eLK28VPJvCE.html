in free code camp doing the intermediate
weather project where we're basically
going to take JSON data using the open
weather map API and calling that to get
our data and then getting our geo
location to essentially get our exact
data so what are we going to be doing
here
so here we are in the open weather map
we're going to first go over the API
documentation in case you're not
familiar with this because this is my
first time using an API we're going to
be doing and getting the data in a JSON
format so that stands for JavaScript
object notation so let's go ahead and
move on to the APA API Docs so in this
one we're going to get current weather
data so first thing you have to
understand about API is the API call so
what happens with the API call
essentially what's going on is in the
URL our query string here is going to
let us review it here oh this one's
showing in here because we don't have an
API key and we'll show in a second so
this is going to you can search for a
city by city name you'll have to put the
your API code on here on the end and
we'll talk about that in a second we
apply city ID so every city has ID
because so you can get the city ID info
the other example is longitude and
latitude
so again in this situation we have to
show our our code for this to work and
then zip and etc etc and then you can
get this is all the data you'll get from
inside of it you'll get the coordinate
which contains the longitude and
latitude and then you'll get the system
and all as so on and so forth and these
calls can vary in size and what they
contain so again you'll have access to
all that but I believe I only use the
current weather data so you have 3 days
16 day
so all this other
documentation so the next thing that you
need to do is you'll notice that when we
were trying to call this right here it
wouldn't work so we had to use a so it's
like oh why isn't our thing working so
we have this app ID here right that's
essentially attached on the end and
what's going on there is we need our API
key to work so in this case everyone has
an API key so I'm going to go ahead and
copy this and put it in here normally
you don't ever want to show your API key
but because I'll be resetting it after
this video will be alright so you'll see
right here our API open weather map
let's go ahead and just pull this up
like so
so you'll see oh it didn't work but once
we gave it our actual ID you'll see that
we're able to get all that data now this
is the same data that we saw but now
same example data as right here
but you'll notice because of this Chrome
extension that I'm using it formats it
all nicely and you know the brackets
make a lot more sense because there's a
whole lot of stuff going on here so in
this case we have a weather we have a
weather that is an array that contains
one object and so if we wanted to access
this we'll show how to do that in the
next thing but this is how you're going
to be able to do it so you follow
basically the URL and you can make sure
it's working by just doing it in your
browser so next what we're going to do
is open up code pentaiah and we are
going to be showcasing essentially how
to call this API and also how to test it
because if you're new like me you
definitely need to test every step of
the way to make sure that you're doing
everything correctly all right guys we
just kind of showed how to get your URL
correctly using your ID so the next
thing we're going to show is let's make
sure we're actually connecting properly
to the API key so we have to actually
call it now in here so first thing that
I'm going to do is I am a big fan of
jQuery so that's kind of going to be
what we're going to do here so we're
going to just go ahead and make sure if
you're using code pin i/o like I am and
go ahead and add jquery save and close
and just because I'm a sucker for
bootstrap and CSS we're going to go
ahead and quickly add bootstrap save any
clothes okay cool so we're pretty much
set so how did I want to run this so
what I did was kind of a little bit fun
in the fact that I created a button that
did some stuff but I want to make this
video a little shorter so what we're
going to do here is just some simple
jQuery so if you're every jQuery we got
to kind of get the document ready so
that our code works and what's going on
in here is we're going to call a
function and then
all right I believe so this is basically
you forgot this is how we kind of set
everything up all right so what did I do
here what I did was I created a string
called var API just to set equal to what
our string was going to be now if you
don't remember what our code was you can
just go ahead and copy this over right
here so if we've already tested it here
we know that it works so we're just
going to go ahead and create this API
key if right semicolons save it what's
going on here
unexpected identifier
so of our API
or that matter sounds like it does
alright so far API not sure what this
air is about oh I'm missing a missing a
bracket oops okay
now we should be good all right so
really guys so we have our API you'll
notice that there is this app ID and
then this is our if you're ever curious
where you have to throw it in this right
here will be where you put your code and
documentation goes over that but that's
really all you need to know so the next
thing is how do you get the JSON data
which is this right here into here
essentially so a couple different ways
you can do this I did it in a get JSON
method and what we pass in here is our
URL in this case we just call it API and
then a function that takes a parameter
oh and Mike example I call it data and
this is going to run and then within
here we can do a few things so what do
we want to how do we want to display
this well we can simply do an alert like
so and what do we want to put in the
alert if you go back to here you can see
right here that we have with chord and
then lon so what we can do is data dot
chord dot
dated uh chlorine dot lon and you'll see
right here it's now every time we save
and refresh the page it's now launching
the alert so if that is one forty five
seventy seven cool and now we can get it
like this lat
you'll see sixteen point nine two
matching all right now that's the
hardest part if you can understand how
to get to here this will this is
essentially will tell you everything you
need to know to start programming with
the for loops and the if statements when
it comes to API now in the second half
of this video we're going to go and show
how to get your geolocation if you're
not familiar with that so in the next
thing we'll show in the next video will
show you how to get the geolocation
using am a jQuery method and then what
to do with those push how to concatenate
this so that you get your exact position
so I'll see you guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
