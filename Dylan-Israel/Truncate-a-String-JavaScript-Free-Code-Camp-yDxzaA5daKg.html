camp in the bonfire section basic
algorithm scripting and we're gonna
truncate a string so what it means the
truncate a string is kind of just to cut
it off and you know only take part of it
so there's a couple ways we can do this
the way I did is kind of what I think is
the simplest I'm sure there's other ways
so the first thing you have to know is
you have to we truncate it at this
number but when we're adding the dot dot
dot on the end of it you need to factor
that in so let's go ahead and just run
this real quick you can see some of the
pass returns string so what we want to
do is first say if the string dot length
is greater than num because uh we only
want to return the code if our the
length of our string is greater than um
because if I remember correctly a number
if it's greater than it you don't want
to mess with it like a seer
well actually may not need to even mess
with that
so if stringed up we may be able to take
this out but I'll just do it how I did
last time so we're gonna slight take a
slice of the string if you don't
remember how slice works what it what it
does is it starts at a point in our case
we're going to start at the first letter
and then we're gonna slice part of it in
this case we're taking the num and we're
gonna have two minus three so in theory
if we were to return this right now
you know what would happen is we should
get only B is on the at the end so a
tisket so we get eight letters so
there's arrow one two three four five
six seven so there's our eight and so
instead of returning eleven letters for
your attorney but that's not what we
so we want to actually do this to SGR
and we want to take our string then we
want to concatenate it with the dot dot
dot to give us our full 11 so this will
sell some of it but we have some special
cases here so now you can see we have
our full 11 spaces with the dot dot dot
so what do we what do we need to do next
so we need to set up an if statement to
only do certain things for if they have
three or more letters so let's set up a
global if statement are now global but
at inter statement says if num is
greater than three do what we did here
because that's that's where it works and
then we'll say else we can go we need to
set up some certain parameters so else
we just want to take our string and
slice it without without removing the
three from the number so because if we
remove it there won't be any string left
so in this case we have a a minus and we
remove it to one we still want a dot dot
but if we were to minus three from a
minus we would be in an empty string and
that's what we'd get a bunch of errors
so we're just removed what's included
start at the starting point and then
we're gonna same thing just concatenate
it with the dot dot dot so after we
concatenate it with the dot dot dot and
we should then we just have to return
the string and that should be it so
let's go ahead and put some comments in
here real quick and actually let's try
taking this out real quick so if you can
make your code simpler always do it oh
so I broke it so forget what I said
so slice the string three short of
number
and dot dot that too and of string and
then we slice string and then again we
just can cat a cat too
and so it wasn't too bad it took me a
second just to figure out the number
three but it was just more or less trial
on there so a lot of a lot of messing
around with arrays and strings this one
was just purely strings but as always
don't forget to thumbs up the video
subscribe leaving a comment if you found
a better way to solve this go ahead and
let me know in the comments thanks for
watching and I'll see you guys next time
thanks for watching the video don't
forget to Like and subscribe that helps
me out a ton and I appreciate all the
comments that I get and all the
questions I get in the comments and I'm
happy to answer them so keep them coming
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
