back in solo learn JavaScript doing
conditionals and loops let's go ahead
and drive through here we have the if
statement these are conditional
statements that if it evaluates the true
it right it does the code on the inside
so we're saying if and we have to
contain our in statement like so and
then our our statement and then where
it's got the code that's going to run
with our brackets what happens is a
condition tested condition is false
nothing happened oh that's basically it
let's see here the if-else statement so
if this fails do this the else statement
will always run if all the F else oh if
the if all the ifs fail so the else
statement is created to ignore the tell
JavaScript there you go
tell JavaScript to execute or something
is true um so let's go on here fill in
the blanks to have a valid if-else
statement so you always start with an
if-else never comes before that's
basically the point of this right here
it's saying if age is greater than 18
run this if it's not run this that's all
that's going on here the if else else if
statement so if you had multiple ifs
each if statement would run now if you
want one if to run and only run the else
if if this one fails that's what we use
an else if for the keyword is used to
end the else if statement so else will
end it else is always the final one guys
will sit here the final block will
assume another conditions are true
alright let's continue moving on so fill
in the blanks to create a valid if else
if statement so we have an if statement
elsif because the first if has to fail
and finally an else these are the orders
that if you're going to do an if else if
statement
the switch statement so switch name is
when you know what your values are going
to be you prat you pass in the variable
you're checking or the statement that
you're checking and then you're checking
the answer with the case so switch with
the switch statement can be used to
replace multiple if-else statements so
you don't want to have a ton of if if
else else else else all this sort of
nonsense so you can use a switch
statement instead you'll see right here
case one case two case three so this is
each case and the value of the case
we're checking so if days one write out
Monday and then break you always have to
put a break and this default is like our
else for our switch statement where if
all of them fail go ahead and go ahead
and go forward how many case statements
are usually used in the switch statement
one for each possible answer is usually
the answer now you can have multiple
case statements for single or multiple
outputs first multiple answer or for
multiple answers for a single output is
what I was trying to say um what's the
output of this code so X is three so
we're checking three with our switch
statement and then it's not one it's not
two so it has to be our default so it's
X plus five which is eight nice the
default keyword specialized code around
there no Matt match statement exactly
like an else right no match is found is
when the default is ran the for loop you
have that's where they put statement one
statement two statement three and this
one really for loop haves three
components that is correct that go
inside the for loop you have your
iterator you have your statement and
then you have your increment so here so
when you want to start a for loop you
use the word for and then you have to
put a semicolon what did I do here what
happened
so this is a semi let's go on a refresh
the stranger put Oh jump to Sonic for
loop alright here we go
so uh you need it for loop and the
semicolon will end the break statement
and then of course the brackets for
which we want our code to run in the for
loop now fill in the blanks to print
even values from 0 to 20 using a for
loop so you don't only have to increase
by one typically you will most of the
time but you don't have to so you'll see
VAR x is 0 so we've already set 0 we're
saying why X is less than this is a
weird way to write this but you can't
write it like this well X is less than
or equal to 20 we want to increase X by
2 and that will print us out 2 4 6 8 all
the way to 20 so the wall condition is
when you don't really know how long any
time just going to iterate and then you
want to break right and so once you hit
the value you're looking for is always a
boolean value so you're always
evaluating if it's a boolean or not so
until the wall evaluates the false or
not false or true or not true it's going
to always be running which is a great
way if you're an inexperienced
programmer to get yourself in a infinite
loop so we're gonna do a while loop so
we're saying while X is less than or
equal to 5
go ahead and what we wanna do here X is
equal to this what I'm gonna do I think
that's what we're gonna do so we want to
add it just like didn't really tell us
to add X to itself but kind of made the
assumption how many times will a while
root Lunt run if we remove the counting
variable increment statement so if you
don't if you removed the increment it's
going to run an infinite amount of times
which is why people do this accidentally
and then they crash their code pin or
something the do-while loop the only
difference between a do-while loop other
than the setup is the do-while loop will
always run
one time even if this wall even if this
right here starts off as false that's
the only difference between do-while
loop and a while loop breaking continue
the break statement jumps out of a loop
and continues Xcode executing the code
after the loop so say you already get
your value in your if statement and you
don't there's no reason for you to
iterate to continually iterate you can
use a break statement to save processing
time to save so things load faster this
is actually really crucial and you'll
use this for a lot of things as well and
the execution of the loop there you go
go all right and let's see the continue
statement we'll continue to the next
iteration of the loop without will
continue the next iteration and forget
the rest of the thing so always output
of this code so if I is equal to six we
skip that so some is I is equal to four
so sum is equal to four plus five when I
is equal to six we skip it and then we
do seven and eight
so nine 16 and 22 is all right where's
your boy bad at math no your boys about
in math so 4 plus 5 4 plus 5 and then
oh it's less than 8 so it wasn't what's
22 minus 8 is 16 7 plus 60 there we go
sorry I saw this was less than or equal
to cool and let's go on to our quiz what
is the output of the following code so
we have a variable X here it's set to 0
and we're saying while X is less than 6
go ahead and run this and so it's going
to be 5
oops it's going to be 6 sorry so guys
because it doesn't run on the sixth time
whoops
please fill in the right keywords to
test the condition so we're using a
switch statement here and we're checking
okay say and this is nice talking about
where you could have multiple values
that all have the same output so if it's
one two three four or five it's going to
say working days and then we get we need
to break it when that does it so it
breaks the case statement and same thing
with K six where we break it here as
well and then finally please fill in the
right keywords to compose a loop oh so
this is a do-while loop I put the
statement at the end like so so that
wasn't too bad that was our conditionals
and loops in JavaScript the thing is
about 10 minutes so obviously I've used
JavaScript before so I've been developer
in it it may take you a little bit
longer but it did cover all the basics I
would say of conditionals and loops so
they really leave too much out but as
