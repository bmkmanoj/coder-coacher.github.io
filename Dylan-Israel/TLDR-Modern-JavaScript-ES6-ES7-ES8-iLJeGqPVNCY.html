and this one we're gonna be doing modern
JavaScript we're gonna be covering the
features of es6 es 7 and es 8 all the
important ones the ones that matter the
ones that you might actually use in the
workplace in an actual project I am your
host for this evening as I will be for
every TL DR Dylan Israel C stands for
Christopher short for christ also coding
god uh listen there's a joke some people
don't like that joke
that's okay let's move on so what what
will we cover right we said some topics
but what specifically are we gonna be
covering let's make sure it's worth your
time right there's tons of tutorials out
there and we want to make sure that
you're you're learning everything that
you can so in this video we're going to
be covering constant light and block
scope template literals destructuring
objects destruction arrays for him to be
talking about object literals the four
of loop the spread operator the rest
operator arrow functions default params
export and import trailing commas
includes a sink and a weight sets
classes and then we're going to be also
talking about path start pat in the
exponential operator object of values
object on entries when we talk about
maps object get on property descriptor
and descriptors and that's it so we're
gonna be covering quite a bit what is
that about
threes say about 23 points these are
things that I find myself using on a
regular basis in the workplace those
ones that I think are fun and exciting
and so that's what we're gonna be
covering so that you can make sure to
write you know JavaScript in today's
standards are a lot of us learn a
language and we sometimes don't know
what are things we should use what are
things we shouldn't use and everything
in here is the latest in the greatest
and so I should get you up and running
so let's go ahead and jump right into it
you're the type that likes to learn
that's why you're watching this video
and so if you're trying to learn might I
recommend our boys over at dev Mountain
comm dev mountain coding boot camp they
got courses to learn you real well on
iOS development Salesforce development
software QA user experience design and
of course full stack web development
I've seen their campuses they're
beautiful and they free house so let's
start by talking a little bit about
constant lip because I think it's
probably the the most important thing of
the addition so constantly adding new
variable types in and moving forward
should pretty much deprecated using var
and replace it with let or constant but
understand why these were created it
specifically let you have to understand
what how variable hoisting works in
JavaScript so you'll see here we have
this if statement with this var and we
could set it to a value we'll just set
it to hello world we're not going to be
using that value but in our console log
here when we target example it may
surprise you that we actually get
undefined instead of instead of if if
this didn't exist example is not defined
or get in herre this is because in the
actual JavaScript what's happening here
is the variable var is being hoisted so
if our example is actually being defined
to here then if in our false statement
we are getting you know example is equal
to hello world
so that's variable hoisting and part of
the issue with this is it does some
wonky stuff that you may not expect and
we've been given stricter modes of
control when it comes to constantly and
they do what is so variable hosting is
function scoped and constant letter
doing what is called what is called
block scope and which means essentially
in this block of code meaning in within
these brackets this is where this
variable exists so
if we change this far to Alette you'll
see example is not defined and it gives
us much more control and it makes a lot
more sense right if example is supposed
to only exist between here doesn't make
a lot of sense to be having a logic
outside of our scope so that's the block
scope aspect of constantly and why it
exists one thing to keep in mind is that
you use let when you are going to be
reassigning values so in our example if
we wanted to have a let's go ahead and
delete this stuff if we wanted to reset
any value here so let you know time
equal today and then we could say time
is equal to tomorrow
you know we're gonna assign different
values with leh but const is kind of
short for constant and constabie equal
to five and so we can't actually take
example and set it equal to six even
though it's the same data type
this is not how constructs or you know
basically any primitive numbers
primitive our primitive types being
strings
bullying's and and numbers const you
cannot reset the value however when
you're working with arrays like so you
get a little bit more flexibility where
now you can actually add to the array
and so you can modify the array like so
that's fine and you can see here that
we're gonna long log it out so we can
modify the array and same with objects
but we couldn't actually go and say hey
I want to set this equal to an empty
object or I want to set this equal to a
boolean that doesn't work when it goes
with cons and the same again is true for
objects so if we had an object here we
can go ahead and set example name equal
to Dylan and that would work as well so
that's constant light and blocked scope
block scope as well so template literals
are a great addition to JavaScript so
say in the past we wanted to concatenate
a string like so you might have
something that looks very similar to
this we have a variable
variable last time we say hi my name is
Dylan put a space Israel put a space put
a period it's very sort of jumbled it's
it's kind of gross in that sense and
it's it's not as clean as it should be
so template literals gives us the
ability to use backticks in our strings
here as well so what we can do is we can
clean up a lot of this logic here and we
can just use this dollar sign curly
brace curly brace some kind of a first
name and then put a space and then we
could put last name and what we get is a
much more readable string however that's
not it we can also we won't be able to
see it in the console log here but say
we had multiple lines like so and we
wanted this to be on different lines
when actually renders in the Dom we
would have a multi-line string we don't
have to put those BR tags in or anything
like we would normally and so we get the
ability to create multi-line strings as
well as to dynamically inject our
variables to have a very clean string
that's easily readable and in and just
better visually I think an easier to
read it's cleaner code I guess is what
I'm trying to say so template literals
is probably one of my favorite additions
since es6 destructuring objects is a
another great addition to javascript so
let's take a look at our example here we
have personal information it should
probably be a constant just you don't
know so we have personal information
first name middle name last name and
this is a pretty long name all we want
to do is maybe create a reference to it
that's a little bit easier and so we can
do that by going and using these when
dealing with objects have these two
curly braces and we can say look for
first name middle name and last name set
it equal to personal information and
this will give us an opportunity
- then get these values easier and we
don't have to do all the values but we
are destructuring the object so that we
can okay well we're referencing this I
this object for these values and we can
also go ahead and assign aliases here
oops excuse me so you'll see I'll put a
: FN and you'll see now that I can
reference FN that way and we can assign
these values I mean we could do this for
any of the values and again we don't
have to do all of them but this is the D
structuring objects and there's D
structure and erase which we'll talk
about next
all right so D structuring arrays is
very similar D structuring object so we
have we still have personal information
except it is an array now instead of an
object and we're just storing the string
values in there but let's say we wanted
to create a reference to that we could
the the main difference here is that we
can name these whatever we want but they
do go in order of index values so you'll
see here F name would be first name
that's index 0 essentially and we would
set this equal and notice how we have
the parentheses are the the brackets
because we are dealing with an A or a
and this would just be equal to the
personal information and now we would
have access to F the first name and then
we would separate it by commas and it's
a middle name we wanted to anyhow but
that's these structuring objects at the
end of the day and again just one more
time it goes in order of operations so
zero index someone alright so let's talk
a little bit about object literals
another great addition to
Ekman script and one of my more and and
somewhat related to the previous D
structuring for how you might use this
so here we have four variables we have
my first name my middle name my last
name and then we have a shameless plug
for the Brody even code shirt phone case
mug and more link in the description
below so what is an object literal
essentially let's say we're creating a
new object here and we'll just call this
a example object
and we want you to assign some values
and in our case we could have you know a
first name which would be first a last
name or middle which would be middle so
we're great we're assigning our values
here and then a last which is last and
then shameless plug which would be
assigned to shameless plug so and then
everything would print out just fine
right we get our values so on and so
forth now this looks like duplicate code
really at the end a and that's really
what object literals allows us to get
rid of is it says hey I'm going to
assume that if we don't have this
assignment here that this is the key and
where the value is named the same
appropriately and we can eliminate these
values and so object literals gives us
ability to eliminate code unnecessary
code and does the assignment when the
name and the when the key and the value
are named the same thing from for the
variables okay so let's talk a little
bit about the four of loop which has
been introduced say we want to iterate
over an interval and I say interval
because we can use this for anything
that can be iterated over it's not just
a race so we have our string here for a
first of dyllan and then we have the
various coding statuses as you progress
through your software career for just
Yantra in turn developer and then coding
god the four main ones so the four of
loop gives us the ability to iterate
through all the elements in the iterable
so let's define it the first thing we're
gonna define is a reference to the
element so we'll go through coding
status so we'll say let's status of our
interval which is in our cases code in
statuses and then we're just gonna
console dot log that status and you'll
see we get our values and we do whatever
we want with that now we can do the same
for a string right because a string is
an interval so we'll say let char of
first and then you'll see here that we
can then target and do whatever we want
with this interval so if you're gonna
console dot log the value of first
you'll see that excuse me of char
because first is the interval will get D
then Y then he'll then a the N so that's
the four of loop the spread operator is
a great addition to JavaScript and
allows us to unwrap our array values so
let's take our example here our array
where we have three of the prominent
excuses I get from people who are trying
to learn to code it's too late to learn
to code no one wants to hire a junior
developer and then just the fear
uncertainty and doubt AI is going to
take all the jobs so let's say we had
this other variable here we'll call it
hate or two excuses and in here we have
an array and we want to not only have
our own values write our own default
values and we'll put something like you
know WordPress is taking all the jobs
period and complaining and but we also
want to add all the values from hater
one excuses and we use that with these
three dots this is the spread operator
what you'll see is when console dot log
out hater to excuses it's going to
actually connait all of that together
and it's going to unwrap the values in
one a right here too to go ahead and
unload them into another array and
that's really what the spread operator
does is it takes the values it unloads
them from the array and adds them to
wherever you need them to be at but just
unwraps it at the end of the day the
spread operator can be used with more
than just a race you can also use it
with objects as well so you'll see here
we have refactored our hater one excuses
to now have a key of excuse standard
excuse typical and excuse insane and in
our hater two excuses we have an object
now if we wanted to unwrap the key value
pairs in our object we would do the same
thing with the the spread operator on
hater one excuses and then you'll see it
will be added there as well so let's
take this excuse insane because one of
the things that I do typically in my
classes where I have default values but
I am assigning them through things
instructor through the constructor is I
will assign a just say will do fear
uncertainty and out here and it will
override the value of our excuse insane
although we're not gonna see it here
because there's so much going on so
let's go ahead and comment these lines
out real quick and then you'll see it's
gonna get overwritten so this is one way
that you can handle default parameters
as well as you unwrap these and then say
for instance excuse and say never
existed we'd have our default value so
if you do if you are unwrapping these
and the keys match whichever one goes
last is going to be the winner so keep
that in mind as you're using the spread
operator with objects so the rest
operator is a great addition to
JavaScript as well sometimes we don't
know how many parameters are going to be
passed in so let's take a look at our
function here at which is going to take
in a certain amount of parameters we
don't know it could be it could be one
and if we console dot log out ad great
it's gonna print out whatever in numbers
is let's go and put in two in here so it
prints out two but what if we had three
now nothing's putting out because this
function doesn't exist however it
doesn't it does exist it just doesn't
know what to do with that three because
there's no additional parameter here and
in the past we'd have to do something
like this where we could get the
arguments object of a function and
essentially you would see it's it's an
object that has oh the zero spot which
would be two and then the one spot which
would be three and we would then have to
turn that into an array and you you know
go from there it's not the best process
it's not something that is all that
great so the rest operators handled that
for us where now we can put the three
dots in our parameters and you'll see we
get an array of the parameters passed in
and doesn't matter how many we pass in
here or anything else it's going to
access all of those parameters and then
we can do whatever we want with it
moving forward so that's the rest
operator error functions have been a
great addition to JavaScript as well
you'll see here that we have this
callback
action that's going on here a lot of
this code has been eliminated with the
arrow functions now keep in mind when
you use arrow functions we are going to
be eliminating some things like this and
one or two other minor things that
you're probably not gonna come across
too often but this is kind of the major
one so how might we eliminate some of
this code with aerofoil functions soon
I'm dying over here
all right so we can eliminate this
function keyword and go ahead and use an
arrow like so and we have now created an
arrow function but we can actually
eliminate more code at this point by
eliminating this Brak these brackets and
put this on one line as well if we
wanted but when we eliminate the
brackets we can tell it to innately
return that and eliminate that semicolon
as well move lumina eliminated a lot of
code now reduce has a minimum of two
parameters but if we had one parameter
we could you do this as well as to
eliminate those bracket those brackets
so keep that in mind are those
parentheses that that those are arrow
functions how we use them and that you
know depending on how many parameters
you have and the complexity of it and if
you're having multi lines multi-line
logic in your application you may not be
able to write it like this but they are
very flexible error functions have been
a great addition to JavaScript as well
you'll see here that we have this
callback function that's going on here a
lot of this code has been eliminated
with the arrow functions now keep in
mind when you use arrow functions we are
going to be eliminating some things like
this and one or two other minor things
that you're probably not gonna come
across too often but this is kind of the
major one so how might we eliminate some
of this code with aerofoil functions
soon I'm dying over here all right so we
can eliminate this function keyword and
go ahead and use an arrow like so and we
have now created an arrow funk
but we can actually eliminate more code
at this point by eliminating this brac
these brackets and put this on one line
as well if we wanted but when we
eliminate the brackets we can tell it to
innately return that and eliminate that
semicolon as well move lumina eliminated
a lot of code now reduce has a minimum
of two parameters but if we had one
parameter we could you do this as well
as to eliminate those bracket those
brackets so keep that in mind are those
parentheses that that those are arrow
functions how we use them and that you
know depending on how many parameters
you have and the complexity of it and if
you're having multi lines multi-line
logic in your application you may not be
able to write it like this but they are
very flexible so let's take our add
function here that we've slightly
modified and now we're passing in an
array and it's calculating the values
what would happen if we didn't pass
anything in you know we passed in an
empty array
first off reduce would fail but in this
case if we just passed in no values how
might we solved that well we can use the
default parameters to assign an empty
array with a zero in it right because a
total should have a number in it and so
default parameters give us that ability
it gives us the ability to pass in a
value when no value has been assigned
now something to keep in mind is that
you can't go and assign a default
parameter and then assign a strict
parameter something like you know you
know example and then use example
because the reason for it is it won't
know what index you're referencing in
theory so it may think that you're
passing in a number so keep that in mind
your default parameters are always going
to come after your required parameters
when you're designing your functions as
JavaScript has been progressing it has
lent itself to be more modular in nature
meaning that you are going to break
everything out into pieces and you're
going to be able to import and export
things and so that's what we're gonna be
talking about next is import and export
it's something that I found very helpful
useful so let's say that we wanted to
store a very large data set or a class
or whatever it may be in another file so
we don't jumble up our code well we can
use the import attribute or the import
keyword to import let's say an array of
values so let's go to this data j/s file
and what we're gonna do is create a a
constant that is going to we're just
gonna call it data and this is gonna be
equal to an array and we're gonna throw
some numbers in here with our 1 5 6 7 8
and semicolon on here this export
keyword on this variable means that we
are saying that we are okay exporting
this out so another application can
import it and the way that we import it
typically your imports are going to be
at the top of the file you're gonna have
space between the words and we're say
data from and then the file where
they're coming from right so we have dot
slash in our case it's going to be data
j s but now it looks like my cuoco may
have broken now we are going to be able
to import the data from let's see okay
so coca doesn't like me using an import
that's what's going on here i have to
switch to pro i will in the near future
my friend but what we're gonna do here
is we're an import data from this
function and here we just we can if we
wanted to we create a reference to the
data no need to we're just going to pass
data directly into ad and now we have
access to it let's go ahead and open up
this file in a HTML page just so that we
can see it in action since quokkas
harassing us so earlier we talked a
little bit about export deep import and
there's another aspect of export that
called default and how it affects import
basically what default allows us to do
is allows us to export a file without
when we only have a single export and
then we can name it a little bit
differently let's go ahead and give a
example so we're
jump into data jas now let's take this
export off and just define this as a
variable and though we still want to
export it so how can we do that well we
only have one item in here that we're
going to export and in our case we're
going to export the default value which
is data this will allow us to export it
now this gives us a couple different
options when we import it we can import
and remember how we did the curly braces
and use that this actually eliminates
that but again we can just do one import
and we can name it whatever we want if
we wanted to call it my data and then
just do from like so from data AS their
data it would work just as well so keep
that in mind that's another way that you
can use the import and export with the
default keyword I'm not quite sure why
Coco decided play nice but you'll see
here that we're importing data we're
then getting the value if we wanted to
here we could console dot log the data
out which is coming from our data j s
file as well so a cool little thing that
we can do with importing exporting
allows us to really organize our code
very easily and a great feature and it's
worth mentioning that you can although
it's bad convention to typically have
multiple values
we'll go ahead and I don't know we'll
just create object first name that first
we'll just make it true that you can act
you typically would probably have a
different file for this but you can
moult import from different files all
you would do is a comma there and have
data too from our data set so it's worth
mentioning as we are content control Z
ctrl Z data to here you can see that
we're getting that object as well
another strange feature rather that's
been added to JavaScript is trailing
commas will no longer break your code
although I think it's kind of nice when
we add things that don't break code I
don't
like things that add for sloppy code now
people may disagree but so what a
trillion comments well we have our rave
we can go ahead and have this extra
comma here at the end and when we do it
with objects we have this extra comma
here at the end and we're not gonna get
any issues and we do with parameters we
have this extra comma here at the end
and nothing breaks and that's really the
trailing commas so just another feature
i guess of es6 plus arrays got a little
bit of love in recent times and what uh
what we had do in the past when we
wanted to check if a value was in an
array such as our num so right here we
would do something like this where we
would have we would say the array dot
index of and we pass in the value so
let's say we want to check five we would
get the index value of that now if it
wasn't included in there we would get
and we just want to know hey is it in
here is it not in here
so it kind of felt a little wonky let's
say we did seven we're gonna get a
negative one because it doesn't exist in
here there's obviously no negative index
well there's a much more appropriate way
of doing this now with the array method
includes includes is gonna return a
boolean to say yeah it's in here or it's
not in here
yeah not in there and then one you'll
see is in there so it's gonna return
true it's it's one of my more common
go-to array methods nowadays so we're
gonna be covering fetch real quick
before we cover a sink and a weight and
sort of really understand a little bit
about promises in the process so we're
not gonna be using quota to see the data
because fetch uses a global window
object which doesn't exist and so
basically what we're gonna do is we're
just to look at it in the browser but
before we do that we're gonna explain a
few things
so let's look here we have this API URL
which is gonna bring up if we pull up
the browser real quick it's just gonna
bring up some data right so it's gonna
bring up a JSON data about Bitcoin
nothing from an asynchronous location
from it's gonna be asynchronous so what
we're doing here in our get data
function is we're gonna fetch that data
on this URL and what that's fetch is
going to do is
going to go this location and it's going
to return a promise and we are going to
resolve that promise with this as then
function and this is going to send back
a response a promise of type response if
you don't think of that way and before
we can do anything with it we have to
turn it into JSON we have turn it back
into a JavaScript object so that we know
what to do with it and when that's done
because this is also a promise we are
then getting the data from there and
finally we're able to log that data
which we can see in our application here
where we open it up and we get that same
data so how might we do this a little
bit more cleanly using asynchronous or a
sink and a wait well we can do it like
so the first thing that we have to do to
understand what async in a wait does a
sink in a wait sort of go hand-in-hand
where if we are going to write a
function that we know is going to have
some asynchronous aspects of it and we
want to tell our code to wait for those
asynchronous aspects to complete the way
that we can do that is with async and
wait and so we can start by throwing
async in front of the function here we
have now made this a a synchronous
function although it doesn't quite do
anything quite yet now what we're gonna
do now is we're just gonna go ahead and
delete what's in here basically clean
this out and start fresh and we're gonna
create this constant response and this
is gonna store the the fetch call
essentially that we're gonna get and so
you'll see earlier we basically had
three parts we had a fetch then we had
it then and then go and get the data go
and get the promise of the data then
convert into JSON then do something with
it and we're gonna clean it up a little
bit with this fetch we're still gonna
throw in the base URL but because this
is a a synchronous call we want it to
say hey please wait till this is done
before moving on right otherwise
JavaScript goes it runs it go and run
the next line without this data being
back we can't have that we need that
data before we progress and then we can
go and do something like this we're
say Kant's JSON because that's that's
what we're gonna want we're gonna wait
that response remember the response
right here that we just that we just got
right asynchronously that we waited for
go ahead and turn that into JSON and
remember this is also an asynchronous
call so we need to tell it to wait for
that and then finally we do whatever we
want with the actual data which in our
case is JSON and save it and now we've
used a sink and a weight to handle this
asynchronous call and you'll see now
when we pull up our code again just go
to empty and clear that we still get the
data down below like we did before let's
clear this out just so it's a little bit
cleaner and we can get our the data that
we want at the end of the day using a
sink and a weight now this isn't only
good for for server calls although
that's most common you can also use this
when you're working with set timeout or
some sort of counting that's going to
happen as well so keep that in mind as
you're working with async and wait so
that's there's been a great addition to
JavaScript and one of the differences
between a set in like an array is a sets
are a list of unique of values and so
how do we go about making this set well
let's go ahead and just create a
constant here and we'll call this
example and we're gonna set this equal
to a new set like so and you can
initialize it with some values by just
putting an array in here don't say one
you know how much a comma three and then
we're gonna throw in a 1 comma 2 comma 3
again and you'll see that when we print
it out it's not gonna have those values
all right so let's go ahead and console
log of this value
and we'll just put example and you'll
see here that we only have a set of one
two and three and we could do this with
bullying's as well true true false and
you'll see we're gonna just have one
true one false so it is smart enough to
know hey don't if the if you even try
and Nishal eyes it with default values
or you are rather duplicate values it's
not gonna happen and we could do other
over arrays in here as well only not
excuse me we forgot a comma there we go
so and then you'll see if we put another
empty array in here that's going to work
cuz that's a new instance right so don't
get it too confused
unless we had a reference that was
storing that array value but these are
both unique values so what how do we add
and remove items so check if an item
isn't is in a set well let's let's dive
into it so adding this straight pretty
straightforward
you'll see here that we Ringo example
dot add I might have given it away add
and we're gonna add the number 11 to
here and you'll see that it's been added
and we can chain these as well if we
wanted to at 12 I don't think we can put
can we yeah no I don't think we can put
values like so in here and let's just
clean this up just a little bit we're
gonna a little off the page so we can't
chain them like we do with pushes where
you can just do one push not yet I would
imagine that they might add that so if
we wanted to add 13 we could do it like
that and then we have the ability to I
said add what do you think it's gonna be
delete a value which is pretty cool so
we're gonna delete a value in our case
we're gonna delete one you'll see it
gets removed from our list a cool thing
about delete is if we actually console
dot log this value you'll see that it
returns a boolean of true the reason for
that is we were successful in our
deleting and if we were to do the same
thing for our add so let's say we wanted
to add 15 it's not going to do it which
is
strange right because you would think
that it would return a boolean as well
it does not it just returns the updated
array so just keep that in mind but
delete does tell you if it's true or are
unsuccessful if it was successful or
unsuccessful but delete we're gonna go
ahead let's say we do it we do
I don't 33 it doesn't exist it's gonna
return a boolean a false it's not gonna
air out or anything
what's grant Turner boolean false let's
say we wanted to clear the entire set we
could do that with just calling the
example soon as we example dot clear and
now we would have an empty set from that
as if we just started fresh now the last
thing I want to cover with sets before I
forget here is I want to show you how to
check if a set has that value and it's
pretty straightforward
so before clear here let's just go ahead
and we're gonna console dot log example
dot has and this will return a boolean
as well so we're throwing the number
five its creditor and false right our
set note our set doesn't have the number
five anywhere in it but if we return the
number two we're gonna get that you know
and it's we have access to that set
value all right I might've lied about
the last thing so sets are an iterable
so you can iterate through them with for
each and four of and all that sort of
stuff you also have the ability to know
what the size of the set is and so you
can do that with size right so we have
our example dot size which will give us
the size of six for our set at this
point right one two three four five six
similar length except size but basically
have a lot of same functionality that
you would expect in an array with
slightly different names probably better
names in all honesty and a little bit
less when it comes to the methods so
classes might be something new if you're
not from a traditional programming
language or you aren't accustomed to
such a job to object-oriented
programming and that was some great sort
of synthetic synthetic since some sugar
to make it
a little bit easier to do
object-oriented program would be more
familiar and I'm struggling today guys
alright so let's go ahead and talk about
how we might define a class it's pretty
straightforward
we're in our case here we have our
animal Jas file and went to find a
animal class and so we've we've
essentially defined a class that doesn't
do anything at this point
so we have what is called a constructor
this is the values we want to pass in to
our class when we plan on instantiating
a new version the reason you make
classes is so that you can create
methods and properties that you can
expect from that class and that you
don't have to you know rewrite code and
you can instantiate data models and
things like that so in our constructor
of our animal we might have type and
we're gonna go with the amount of type
and let's go with wild and that would be
a boolean like it's someone's pet it
would be false if it's a wild animal
we'll put it is true and so we're gonna
say this dot type is equal to type this
refers to our class right so the class
property the type here is just the value
that we're passing in and this dot wild
is equal to wild all right cool so we've
essentially instantiated a class and
let's go ahead and use some of that
import-export logic we had earlier and
we'll export the class animal here and
now when we go into our example j/s
let's go ahead and import animal from
animal now what we can do here is we
create a reference to that class so we
go ahead and say cons what are we going
to call this we'll call it well name it
we'll name them teto last name of my cat
equals a new animal and we're gonna say
here that teto is a type of cat and it
is in fact although he thinks he is a
wild beast in fact it's not and I of
course forgot to start my coca alright
so
what we can do here is so far we've
given the animal class the ability to
have a type and you'll see it's storing
that value as well as to have a wild
property so when we reference Tito and
you'll see nice so now we have char
property so we could create as many of
these classes as we wanted to for
whatever I needs work we also of course
have the ability to reset that so let's
say Tito's like yo man I in a cat
Tito's like yo I am a beast baby and you
need to know it we could reset it to
beast if we wanted to right so you have
the ability to reset these properties as
needed on your you know because really
at the end of the day what you're
dealing with here is an object and so
you have it's much easier to think of it
so it's an object that we've been stanch
itted with methods and properties and so
you could pretty much do almost anything
that you could to to a class that you
could do an object so I mentioned you
know you can add functions to a class
let's go ahead and just give an example
of that so here we're gonna have a
little function that's called you know
it's an animal class so it's not
necessarily for cats so we're just going
to call this make we'll just call this R
or a little bit more generic and we're
going to take in some sound that we're
gonna pass in and all we want that to do
is console dot o we'll have it returned
sound returned here me will use a little
bit of those es6 templates literals here
and we'll pass in sound that's three
exclamation points so now our animal
class has this roar method that if we
wanted to we could console that log and
we could say this dot Tita
rawrr and then in here we're gonna pass
in yeah
can I read property Aurore no you should
be able to read property roar oh excuse
me love this T Tauri
there we go so hear me meow alright so
we can define functions and of course we
can reference if we wanted to for
whatever reason and we didn't want to
pass in a property and we just wanted to
say this is my type we could do that
bike by targeting this type as well so
the other thing you have to understand
about classes is you don't always have
to create an instance of a class you can
define classes and have static methods
and static methods essentially mean that
the class prototype animal in this case
has its own methods and we don't have to
create a Tito we don't have to create a
cat right so how do how do we define
those methods well we would use the
static keyword and we just define it
right
static might be favorite pet favorite
animal and we might pass in a string
here and that would be an old custom
type and then we'll say something like
return you know my favorite animal is
passing our value here like so I'm gonna
pass him the type for the period
semicolon and now when we go into our
example JS file let's say we didn't have
any of this we just call me this out
we'd still because we import an animal
we could say we could get the value of
animal dot favorite animal and then we
could pass in slip cat and you'll see
that it prints out just fine because
this is a static method this is based on
the class not a instance of the class
that we have created
all right there's also gets which are
important to showcase so let's say that
we didn't want to necessarily create a
property in the constructor
but we wanted to perhaps return a
concatenation of stuff it is true that
we could just return stuff like roar for
instance it's just a function but
there's actually a slightly better way
of doing and that's what they get so
let's say we had a get metadata and in
here we're just going to return back a
string that has the so kits have to have
returns you're getting something so it
has to return something and so we're
using this get keyword then we're gonna
return in this instance all we want to
do is for return type call in and then
we'll throw in a little bit of
something-something
and then let's say this dot type and
then we'll do with comma space and then
we'll say wild and then we'll pass in
the wild status this dot wild this is
going to allow us to know it's cats wild
or not and to your surprise you might
say well how do we call it well it's
actually treated as a property so now
when we want to console.log that
property we would take our teto our
instance of tito and then we would call
metadata on it and you would see here
that the beast while false and we would
have this for this metadata aspect here
now keep in mind that the get isn't set
up to take in values so you can't reset
it this is just a get and it will get
the data whatever you'd said that you
need to get right pretty pretty
straightforward and get it one of the
things about classes is that classes can
inherit other class or extend other
classes and what what that means
essentially is that let's just collapse
what's in here real quick collapse all
this to give us some more space and we
have an animal class but we want to make
something that inherits from animal but
has its own unique properties so what we
can do is we can we're gonna export this
class so we can create another class and
this time we'll call cat and it's going
to extend the animal class so it's going
to inherit from the animal class
and it's gonna have a lot of the same
properties of the all the same unless we
overwrite them so let's say that we
wanted to add for instance not only type
in a wild but we also wanted to add a
tail does your capital may be lost in a
horrible accident
I'm sorry sorry a little poor kitty so
we're gonna define our constructor it's
still gonna have a type it's still gonna
have the wild status but now it's gonna
have a tail property so we're gonna use
this super keyword and what that's going
to do is just going to take type and
it's going to take wild and it's gonna
pass it into the parent class the class
that we are extending right cat is a
child of animal and animal is a parent
of child and all the only thing that we
have to do here is we have to
instantiate this dot tail is equal to
tail so now when we save that and we
jump back up to here we're gonna first
have to import cat right because we
don't have access to it and while we're
at it we can go ahead and get rid of all
this sort of stuff
or better yet let's keep it and you'll
see that when we go and we add a tail
maybe it was just as one will say he has
one tail I don't know where I'm going
with this but you guys get the idea just
one tail and it said you'll see that
we're going to import cat and you'll see
everything works because we're
inheriting those methods while at the
same time we have the ability to have
new methods right and new properties so
we say Tito tail and it's gonna tell us
geo has one tail which means that Tito
is doing ok and this can go for four
methods and funk funk shion's as well so
one thing to keep in mind is that when
we extend a class we inherit whatever
methods are in that class but we can
also overwrite them so let's take our
roar class for instance and we're saying
okay well you know instead of that roar
I wanted to find a roar here that that
has a similar property same name same
properties and what I want it to do is I
want it to return
the Beast is here and then it will put
you know you know sound very exclamation
point something like that
and you'll notice that when we call it
now it's going to override it and put in
the new method because we have to we
essentially have two methods and the way
that classes are going to work is the
method that is nested the most the child
method the one that is closest to cat
it's going to fire off right so if we
have to roar methods it's going to take
cat / animal and fire off the beast is
here so that's a little bit about
classes to get it up and going so if you
remember back in our object class
tutorial part we talked about my cat
tito when we created this cat class and
javascript as a whole has been becoming
more and more object oriented and it's
got a little bit of love with the get
own property descriptor as well as get
on property descriptors which there's a
little misspelling here but you guys get
the idea and what they basically do is
they give us some information about the
properties of our object so let's go
ahead and console.log a value here and
this is a static method so get on
property descriptor is a singular
version right we want to say hey i want
to know the value of you know excuse me
on tito so we're gonna passing the
object and then we're gonna pass in the
property key which in this case is going
to be type and you'll get a couple
things as value you'll get the value you
get if it's writable if it's an
enumerable and if it's configurable now
that's good property descriptor now what
ends up happening is there's descriptors
as well where we want to get all of the
values and let's say we want to store it
right so we'll create a constant will
call this descriptors
and we'll set this equal to object dot
get own property descriptors and this is
going to store all of those values and
then we can target it as we want so in
in our example here with as we console
dot log of these values out with Tia
we're gonna get a very which is very a
very long list of descriptors here and
it goes on and on and on and you'll see
it's a nested array of objects so you'll
see our tail property value and has all
the same values and then there's other
ones but what it has done is essentially
given us an object of all of those so
that's just scripter and descriptors in
in JavaScript and I believe that's was
that in ESAT hey guys I just want to
