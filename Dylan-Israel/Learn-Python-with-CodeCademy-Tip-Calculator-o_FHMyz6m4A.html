calculator as you can see if I've done
this before I started reviewing for a
Python course on here but you know let's
get started so we'll just be resetting
the code as we go so declaring two
variables as easy as just naming it and
giving it some sort of value in this
case we're gonna say meal is 4450 all
right cool good to go we're gonna give
another variable and instead of equal to
a decimal decimal aa decimal value of
0.675 oh excuse me
Oh point zero six seven five others
otherwise it would be 67% tax and we all
be homeless basically gonna reset that
stand we're gonna set a standard tip of
15% which is equal to point zero one
five all right
no no it's point one five excuse me Oh
point one five and in my look I uh I was
to continue on and
this on on line seven we're going to
take our meal and reassign it to a value
of itself times the tax okay so we are
gonna say meal is equal to meal meal is
equal to meal plus meal times tax
good and finally let's see what our
total value is here so a sign of the
variable total to the sum of meal plus
meal times tip all right so we have meal
plus meal times tax plus meal tip and
that should give us this should be our
total rather sorry set this is a total
and save and submit turnout 54 18 so 54
63 so let's see here let's see if this
fixes it
total to the sum of meal plus meal times
tip oh we're not including
what's going on here so a mealtime chip
meal plus total equals so meal equals
meal plus meal times tax I sign the
variable total and then total okay so
they want to do like this equals meal
plus meal times two so apparently they
want you to tip on top of the tax there
we go and we just finished the tip
calculator so a little basic sort of
thing you could write a program for this
probably for the web I don't know why
you would but hey why not so up next get
a sneak peek at the next video we're
going to be doing strings and console
output so we've really only been working
with integers and pretty pretty basic
stuff as always constructive criticism
is appreciated and I'll see you guys in
the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
