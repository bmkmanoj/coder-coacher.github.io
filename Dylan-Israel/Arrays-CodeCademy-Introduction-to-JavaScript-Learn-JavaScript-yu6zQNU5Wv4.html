back in Codecademy introduction to
javascript doing their their basic
course and we are in arrays and loops of
rays a razor another type of another
data type technically I believe they're
an object but a crucial absolutely
crucial thing you'll be using all the
time in JavaScript and in any
programming language so what is an array
an array is basically just a list of
object at least of it data so there's a
you'll see right here repelling the
class you'll separate it by comma this
would be index 0 this would be index 1
index 2 so arrays go based off start at
index 0 so make sure you code for that
later on let's go ahead and jump right
in though so you would create it simply
like any other variable so we're gonna
start a variable and we're going to call
it bucket list and we're gonna set equal
to an array of strings three strings
inside so in my example we're gonna say
100 k subs that's on the bucket list
will also say manoj int wah no um a
24-hour coding stream and then we're
gonna say 5 500 patreon subscribe
patreon supporters will put that on
there so we have three things in here
index 0 is our hundred K sub call it
index one is our 24-hour coding stream
and then index 2 is our 500 patreon
subscribers now let's go ahead and
console dot log this out so we can log
out the values just by doing calling the
variable and printing out like we would
anything else I'll get a list of our
stuff so this is everything that's in
there cool
arrays are denoted by these brackets as
well if you haven't noticed now say we
only wanted to select a single item from
the array we can do that as well so
let's create a variable called list item
and we're going to go ahead and set it
to the first item of the array or index
0 so we're going to say bucket list and
again we have the brackets with our
array and wheres a bucket list 0 and
then we want to go ahead and print out
that first item you can do it like so
it's going to run this so there's our
hundred K subs first item now we want to
go ahead and reset that value we can do
that as well and we just will target
list item will reset it equal to bucket
list to the third item or the second
index spot like so
alright oh and then we'll go ahead and
log that out solo console dot log one
more time the list item to get the third
item out or their second index spot so
500 patreon support supports brother
should be supporters try to log back in
my position three to the council oh
excuse me they want us to log out the
third item or the index three this will
not work because there is no index three
we're going to get an undefined air
I'm not be sure what's going on here
this should work just fine
yeah this is what they're asking for now
set the list item variable to the third
item in the bucket list the third item
in array will be a position to yeah try
to log the item at position 3 to the
console we're doing that
yeah it's good and get the code i think
the browser's being a little weird oh I
see what's going on here they wanted us
to actually set the list item value to
the third position then reset it sorry
about that a little bit of
misunderstanding of the instructions
let's go ahead and create a list item
city goes first and higher we got start
all over so we'll do list item so we'll
do VAR list item and then we'll go ahead
and set it equal to the first item in
the array which is bucket list 0 I
should solve that and use console to
print out list i know we have to go one
by one here i think so gotta run that
it's weird that they give you the code
but doesn't actually fully run now we
want to go ahead and set the list item
third item in the array so it'll do that
one more time so we're going to target
the second index as we did before I'll
be good go ahead and run that so we
should oh they're giving their examples
out and now we just want to go ahead and
target list item and we want to set that
equal to bucket list third index that
doesn't exist or is undefined at this
point rather
and we'll get our undefined and we'll be
done with this little hiccup that we've
had here now a race like every
everything else already have some
built-in functions that you're going to
be using quite a lot if we wanted to
find the length of the array we can
simply call dot length on to our array
like so now you'll use this lot a lot of
the times now keep in mind that the
length is always going to be one more
than the final index number cuz lengths
starts at one and goes to whatever how
many items you have in it while your
indexes start at zero so something keep
in mind not to mess up your math find
the length of your excuse me this needs
to be our bucket list there we go so the
array then dot length so we have a
length of three one two three and it
goes up to index zero our index two in
this example now say you want to add
some things to an array it's pretty
simple all we have to do is say bucket
if the array and in this case bucket
list dot push this will actually add the
item to the end of the array push ads
the item to the end of the right to this
third index spot and then a fourth index
fund and so on and so forth so we'll go
and just put hello and then we will go
ahead and do bucket list dot push and
then we'll put world as the second one
in here and this will add it to the end
of the array let's go ahead and run this
so now we have a length of five because
we've added two items to our original
three index spot and just to check that
everything is good and it's added we'll
go ahead and console dot log it out and
you'll see our five values one two three
four and five cool
now say you want to remove the last
value of an array you can do that using
the pop method so to do that just as
simplest push no parameter to include
you just simply do pop and it will
remove the last value so our world will
not be in there anymore and hello will
be the last value push you supply
something to add to the array pop over
to the end of the Loray pop will remove
the last value on the array definitely a
crucial part of a race now what did we
learn here we learned that a razor list
we learned that they start at index 0 we
learned that we can get the length of it
which is always going to be one more
than the last index and we also learned
that you can add on to the end of the
Ray using push and you can remove the
last item of the array using pop so I
hope you guys found this helpful as
always thank you for the support don't
forget to Like comment and share and
support me on patreon it's appreciated a
ton and keep up the grind keep up the
hard work I know this is an introductory
thing and if you're if you're struggling
with it it gets easier it'll start to
click eventually good luck guys thanks
