we're doing the HTML and CSS section as
you can see here we are on Waypoint 41
we're gonna go to 50 taking that focus
factor I highly recommend it so a lot of
CSS stuff has to do with padding and
margins and it looks like that's what
we're gonna do right now so your green
box class so let's look at green box
we want to give it a margin of 20
currently if we look at our green box it
has a margin of 10 so what happens when
we change this to 20 it's gonna give us
a little bit more padding this around
the edges around the whole thing so
check it out again 10 change it let's
see what have 120 you can see right
there it's just massive let's change it
to 20 and we're good so that's one your
green box flash should give elements -
15px Martin all right so you can also
just as negative so here's our green box
and we'll do
- 15px and you can see right there it
gets rid of our let's go back to here so
20 so what's going on here is we're
going to minus 15 pixels around the
whole thing and it should basically pop
it out a bit cool run that that's too
your green block slash should give the
top of they'll miss 40px honey
so padding is basically oh you just say
it's padding is great padding is almost
seems margin except it gives it a little
bit more so green box won't change the
padding alright so you can do general
padding so padding and we could do like
40 px and that's going to be padding
around the whole thing
but what we want is padding - top and
you can see right there we added 40
pixels to the top and then we want to do
padding that's right
40
so 20px for the pan - right
panning - left is 40px and then padding
- bot that is 20px - bottom
oops you see it's not designed to be on
center but that's how they want it to
look cool so that was three I believe
around for you know trying to do ten of
these so I apologize I wish they had
this numbered a little bit differently
like maybe a number up here would be
good so your green box class should give
the top of elements 40px margin alright
so we want to for our green box give it
a margin - top 40 PX so there's our 40px
margin and then left elements so we want
to do margin - left and we all set that
to 40px as well you can see it adds it
on the screen and then we want to do
margin - right
and we want to do at 20 px and then we
want to do margin - left and we want to
do that 20 px also so I believe we did
that old
so this is 40 oops
and the bottom elements oh I did that
twice god I really wish they would have
named this would have been so much
better if they named it margin that spot
instead of bottom no I I believe this is
our fifth one now that we're on so again
we're working with padding so having
this kind of the inside where margin is
kind of the outside margin is how where
do you want stuff in relative to other
objects or if you won't look at it that
way versus where do we want our specific
object to have room that's how I would
think of it so now the green box classic
at the top elements 40px panty
all right so padding - top and we'll do
40px and then we'll say padding - right
and we want 20px
and then bottom of the elements so
padding - bot tum 20px and then padding
- left for a fee X
cool so I was five
we're already halfway there we're doing
about one a minute so it's not too bad
your green blocks class should give the
top of elements 40px of margin your
green box class oh here is so we were
doing margin again so margin - top going
on 40 40px margin - right and 20px gonna
do margin - bottom 20 PX and margin -
the left 40px cool that was six I think
I'll give you the body film and
background color alright cool so now
we're just gonna do some CSS so we want
to say look for the body we want to by
default have a background - color of
black and there it is so that was seven
could h1 element alright so I'll create
an h1 element that style an h1 element
so h1 / H 1 and they want it to say
hello world so they want us to change
the background color to green there's
our hello world give your body element
the font family property of Manos face
so we'll do we're gonna set the type of
font by saying font - family and it's
gonna be I believe it to put this in
quotes Manos face could be wrong
actually let's take away the quotes I
think I'm thinking something else there
we go
yeah I'm wrong alright so Manos face and
then we also want to inherit the font
Manos face from so we can just put body
h1 actually no it's gonna inherit it by
the way that's thinking week we'd have
to recreate it and then do body h1
because this still needs to be part of
body so ignore what I said so h1 only
should inherit the color yeah your body
element like give your body element the
color property of green well when you
just do color green
there we go so they didn't want us to do
the background-color who's just wants to
do a color I believe that was eight
let's check real quick so just yeah so
we have two more to go cool
so probably talked prioritize one style
over another so what they basically
wants to do here is create a class so
what CSS the more specific one yeah
so dot pink - Tex
the more specific one is the one it's
going to inherit from and well then
we'll say color pink and then we'll say
h1 class equals pink - text there we go
no so change it hello world
not bad color soon pink and black and
last but not least we want to have h1
element should have the class blue text
so blue dot blue - Tex
and then we want to say color blue and
what it basically wants us to do here is
that you can actually set up two classes
so maybe it inherits things you got to
put them in order so we want blue we
want it to be blue so we need two blue -
text but we still want it to inherit
from pink text not that there's anything
in there in theory now but there could
be in the future so when we run it our
Texas blue but it's still it's still
part of the pink text class as well so
that was our ten examples I believe 41
to 50 we did about ten and a half
minutes so we knocked it out in about
one a minute there's about 70 of them so
we're on track to finishing it in about
an hour in ten minutes when it was it's
at originally three hours so great
