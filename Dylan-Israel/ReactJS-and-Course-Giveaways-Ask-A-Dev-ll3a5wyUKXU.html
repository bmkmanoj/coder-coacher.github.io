we're gonna have a little bit of a round
robin of react you get it round relevant
up your handy how bad jokes aside
alliteration bad alliteration aside I
want to say thank you to our next
sponsor Steven Grider who has been who
is a very successful course trader on
udemy he will be donating a single copy
of each one of his courses which is 11
in total most of them are react focused
and as I've discussed and we're in
discussed in this video I'm beginning my
react journey moving forward but uh
eleven courses
thirty five thousand reviews eighty
three thousand students it doesn't
really get much better than night he's
got a four point seven rating all those
courses are you know four point five
four point seven on average I guess
before so every Monday Wednesday and
Friday if you guys want some react
courses or one of these courses I should
say starting with this video by the way
modern react with Redux will go ahead
we'll get started with his most common
course that is the one that we will be
giving away in this video to a lucky
winner who all you have to do is say
react and like the video that's that's
kind of the catch so let's talk a little
bit about react and again thank you to
Steven who's doing that that's really
cool right yesterday or I guess it was
yesterday I kind of discussed how I was
planning on learning react react
reduction react native and what was on
my mind and just to kind of rehash that
in case you didn't watch it
I am enrolling in it starts on the 24th
of the 25th of this month the nanodegree
program over at Udacity Udacity for a
while has had these nano degree programs
and I've really wanted to do one for
awhile and the react Jas
one had caught me it's a $500 flat rate
it's expected to take four months at 12
hours a week so quite a bit of content
cover it we will in there you cover
react Jess you cover react and redux and
then of course react native so you're
and you're going to have three projects
built out by it as well as the mentors
along the way and that's type stuff so
it's a five hundred dollar flat rate
this was actually the first course slash
program I've ever paid for I some people
are pretty surprised that I've never
bought one course on Udacity or udemy
ever to my detriment probably I probably
would have learned a lot more a lot
quicker if I did and I wanted to I've
been I've been kind of blazing my own
path with self learning for so long that
I sort of see react being the I need to
supplement my my work learning with
additional market skills that are out
there and react is the one that I'm
trying to add right now and luckily
having arne been developer I can I can
spend that money on on something I think
will give me a better return I could
probably go about it doing other courses
and just like the ones we're talking
about you know that he's got fifteen
thousand ratings on this course for a
reason right
but I actually wanted to go down a very
structured path I wanted to do the
nanodegree program so that I could
review it as well so it's kind of add
some content there and give a very
honest feedback if you're not familiar
with the nanodegree program in the past
this isn't one of them but in the past
they actually have a flat monthly rate
one like a full sack one for three
hundred dollars a month and what's cool
about that is if you complete the
program they guarantee you a job
they guarantee it or your money back so
it's pretty much zero zero risk as far
as I'm concerned and if you can't come
into a boot camp you can't commit to CS
degree I think that's probably your next
best bet you can also of course your
courses but I think sometimes people
need something a little bit more
structured and when they guarantee you a
job I don't know how you can really
argue with that but it is it is
a lot of money especially when most
people who are trying to learn code
we're trying to just do better right do
better because things aren't going too
well I know if you asked me why I was
delivering pizzas if I could spend $300
on a course I'd laugh in your face look
so it's definitely times it's changed
slightly and I totally understand that
but that that's back to react so what
really attracted me to react is react
native I'm really intrigued to be able
to build an application for the web and
compile it into an Android or iOS app
which is my understanding of react
native as well as just a more
lightweight thing than angular uh last
month or so maybe two three weeks I've
been jumping back between learning react
learning angular for learning and react
learning you look forward well what I
was finding was that all the free online
resources are outdated and there's a lot
more and I kind of do need a path on
where to go and where to learn and what
to learn and and my hope is that this
nano degree program is as up-to-date as
possible I'm a really upset if it's not
I think it is it's a new new program I
can't imagine that they're going to be
teaching stuff that's three six months
nine months old right in what
development that's a common problem
right where you want to you need to
learn a lot in web development because
it's always changing right one minute
Bower is the best package manager before
you know it Bauer's redirecting you to
go use web package it like that right
it's a little bit crazy and it can
change on a dime and that's kind of what
why I'm going with RAC on that same
notation where before angular was vit
was dominating the market angularjs at
some point in terms of the front-end
frameworks and they made a big
transition in angular 2 and there's this
sort of hey angular 2's and alpha and
and most people are like we don't
want start angular just that's going to
be deprecated in your project so let's
go into a different direction
react gained more market share and
people realized wow this view only
library is really really helpful and
mind I know very little about react
other than playing with it for about a
weekend but I liked what I saw and I
enjoyed it and from what I've seen
looking at the job market the react
developers are paid very well and are
very high demand which is another reason
that I'm very attracted to it to kind of
supplement my learning with work in case
you know whatever can happen does happen
I'm a little bit paranoid about that so
I'm always trying to study and make sure
that that's never an issue but anyhow so
that's my two cents about react I
definitely wanted to give a shout out
not that he needs it to also steven
grinder who is killing it in the the
udemy game and who was nice enough to
donate a copy of his course so that we
could give away on every Monday
Wednesday and Friday video and if you
ever confused about what videos are
going to be on there and that's Monday
Wednesday my time Eastern but I know
half my audience is in a different part
of the world so you can just basically
keep an eye out for videos that aren't
algorithm based for the next twenty to
thirty five days because I'll have an
algorithm video for code fights coming
out on the days that isn't a Monday
Wednesday Friday Monday Wednesday Friday
videos are typically ain't going to be
you know let's talk sort of advice
oriented or topic oriented or experience
oriented videos as long as they're not a
sponsored video as Monday's video was
we'll be giving away a course so thank
you to him thank you for watching the
video that's my thoughts on react and
why I am dishing out for my first course
instead of coming for like a five dollar
course if the reason I'm doing a five
hundred dollar course but I want I want
the structure I want to be able to
evaluate the program and and give
feedback so that you guys who you know
when you are scraping together your your
money and five hundred dollars is your
last five hundred dollars I can tell you
if it was worth it
and what I got out of it and or you can
at least make your own judgment for what
I got out of and give you a clear
explanation about what it is and what
its value delivered so that's my
thoughts guys don't forget to join our
Facebook group codec and caffeine and if
you want to support me at patreon.com
slash coding tutorials 360 it is
appreciated I'll see you guys in the
next video and don't forget to use the
word react and like the video if you
want to win the course I guess
hey guys thanks for watching the video
special thanks to our sponsors dev
Mountain if you look for a coding
bootcamp or tuition and housing is
included definitely check them out
appreciate it and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
