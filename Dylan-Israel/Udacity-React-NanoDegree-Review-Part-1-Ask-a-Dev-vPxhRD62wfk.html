react now degree program it's
specifically just nano degrees in
general and what to expect as you can
see I'm logged in I recently purchased
the react now degree this unlocks in -
three days basically on the 25th I am
able to access the content and this is
my first nano degree programs actually
the first course I've ever paid for but
I'm pretty excited about it and so why
did I why did I do this well why did I
take the react now interview program
what would the skills that are being
taught in it are some of the most
in-demand and highest paying skills so
that that's one reason I decided and
learned that and what that is is react
react native and Redux from here we'll
actually be building three projects and
that's pretty cool then even though it
says two projects here you're actually
build three and on top of you get extra
curricular stuff as well so extra
lessons in es6 which is something I want
to get better at asynchronous JavaScript
which is really important getting github
and then personalized feedback in which
you get practice for the interview help
you network and resume feedback which is
all great stuff minutes one of the
reasons I'm really attracted to the
nanodegree program one of the other
reasons I decided to actually take this
program other than I wanted a very
organized route I've been doing the
self-taught cop this is still
self-taught to a degree but it's just
kind of pulling from YouTube and from
from wherever to kind of put my
knowledge together I wanted to kind of
be able to sit back and this is what you
know somebody tells me it's important
let's study it and take their word for
it and I think I think Udacity is a
great place to do that and I think
they've shown that over the years so
you'll see we have an introduction
probably breaking down the course kind
of how blows your quizzes you'll have
projects you'll have you know coding
challenges then we're going to go over
the fundamentals then we're going to get
into reacting or duck
then we're going to get interact native
racket is pretty cool it's kind of what
attracted me to react in the first place
if you're not familiar with what it is
it essentially is the ability to write a
web application in react and then have
it compiled down into an iOS or Android
app so basically you get kind of a
two-for-one which is one of the reasons
I think direct developers are in such
high demand another thing that I was
really that that got me to sign up for
this is that not only do you have not
only do you have live feedback if you
have if you're struggling from the
people at Udacity to help you through it
you also have 24 hour project review
what that means is say you build a
project that you can you can submit it
and a reactive l / will review it and
give you feedback about how to better
improve it and that is a huge benefit
because it's the small things in these
projects that will make you stand out
and you know maybe you're doing some
some syntax slightly incorrectly or
maybe you're maybe there's a chance for
you to blow a potential employer away by
implementing one quick thing that you
maybe missed in the project or you know
just got dropped last week or whatever
the case may be but that's what I'm
really looking forward to look maybe
somebody bounce questions off of and
someone to review my projects moving
forward as you can see I still have a
couple days I wish they opened up now I
really do it's kind of its kind of like
danville I guess I'll just work on
angular for the next couple weeks
couple days rather but I'm really
looking forward to it just as a reminder
it I'm not sure when this video is going
out but as of the 27th of July this is
only three hundred dollars normally it's
five hundred which is another thing that
I kind of lucked out on and got you can
see they give you this nice countdown
say sorry but I'm pretty excited about
it I'll be doing multiple videos
reviewing the program in each section I
think is I think that's how I'm going to
do it is what kind of consider this the
introduction section because I imagine
that this is going to not the react
introduction section it's going to be
fairly decent I might
- I'll probably combine this part of the
video with this part just because it's
going to be pretty basic and then I'll
do a video for the reactor Redux
and I'll do one for AK native and now
I'll do an overall one but I do think
that it's important to kind of do a
multiple review process of this so that
you guys can track my progress it's
expected that it's going to take if you
devote about 12 hours a week and they
say somewhere between 10 and 15 is what
they'll recommend but about 12 hours it
will take you four months complete
that's why their their rubric I'm hoping
to get it done in two that is my goal -
or less and I think if I if I work at it
steadily and already kind of work as a
developer and in JavaScript frameworks I
might be able to pick it up quicker than
someone who's maybe starting from
scratch but I'm really excited about it
and if you haven't decided what you want
to do I would say consider the
nanodegree programs not this specific
react nanodegree program but there are
other ones that are like $200 a month
$300 a month but they guarantee you your
money back if you can't land a job
within six months of completing the
degree that's how confident they are so
it's really kind of a low-risk
high-reward situation and I know if
their inner dollars a lot is a month but
you do get the feedback you do get
someone to bounce these ideas off of and
you do get help along the way and a job
you know they make you job ready which
is one of the cool things you know it's
crazy thing is that here we have a nano
degree program with the career
personalized feedback where they're
reviewing your resume the helping you
practice for interviews and they're
helping you network these are all things
that colleges don't do or do very poorly
like who's really got a job from their
college office or an internship or
anything like that it's very rare
everything I've done successfully in
these three areas has been my own
research and feedback and YouTube and
things like that and I'm very glad to
see that a secondary education place is
going to get you help you with that and
it looks like there's eight projects in
this section as well so by the end of it
you'll have eleven project
or 10 and this is a misspoken but I
think it's just an air here so you know
a lot of projects if you do the
extracurricular and I encourage you to
don't take a don't take something like
this and not do the entire thing because
what you want to be is the best
developer you can be and if they're
giving you these great resources please
take advantage of them there's a lot of
people that go into boot camps that
think that oh I'm just going to go to a
boot camp I'm escape by that's not how
this this this software game works when
I interviewed on engineer truth channel
someone commented sounds awful to have
to be learning all the time if that
sounds awful to you this is not the
field for you because that's really what
it takes to be a successful developer
long term and it should be enjoyable to
me hell sounds like the place where I do
the same thing every single day so when
I go home and I study these things that
I'm working with new stuff at work it's
exciting and when you get this extra
curricular stuff you shouldn't look at
it like oh man oh you got mono
degree I don't need this no you should
be excited to become a better developer
and in return your stock goes up your
value goes up you make more money you
can get you can become a better
developer get a job quicker all this
sort of great stuff so take advantage of
that if you decide to rack now to refer
but that's my sort of introductory
review my next review i as i mentioned i
will review introduction and react
fundamentals and it sounds like if I
understand correctly I'll have a project
built at the end of this and on the
project built at the end of this and I'm
a project bill at the end of this and if
that's the case I'll be showcasing each
one of my projects in one of those
videos in a final wrap-up video but as
always guys thank you so much for
watching the video for the keyword today
we'll use nanodegree let me know your
thoughts in the comments don't forget
for the keyword is for the giveaway

you next time
thank you so much join our Facebook
group coach at caffeine and this Court's
out
and patreon let's stuff also bye guys
hey guys thanks for watching the video
special thanks to our sponsors dev
Mountain if you look for a coding
bootcamp or tuition and housing is
included definitely check them out
