about what I do on a daily basis as a
developer and I've been we're kind of at
a crossroads at my current project where
we have finished one module or one
application and we're getting ready to
move on to the next step the next phase
if you will and so I think it's a good
time to reflect upon kind of the whole
life cycle as well as what I do on a
daily basis without going into too much
detail about where I work and what I do
and things like that because that as
with most most companies they don't want
you talking about your work in detail
specifically software as well as one
probably more so but um I work at a
company that traditionally helps run
military training events and so their
service company and what I do is I
develop software that helps facilitate
that I'm building enterprise level web
applications that are going to help with
that so that's what I've been doing for
the last eight months or so seven months
and what's going on now is I think I
think is it's taken us about that long
to get to where right now so depending
on what it took what does a typical day
look like for you well it actually
really depends where you are in your
project right if you're at the very
beginning stage of the project you may
have a day that is a little more
communication-based than your average
day and why that is is you may still be
gathering requirements from from the
client from whoever that may be from
from saying hey I want to make sure that
this is so this is the idea are you
going to need these features if so you
know this is how we think to implement
it is this correct and so you might have
a you might be sending emails back you
might be having phone calls having a
little bit more meetings than you
normally would
I mean depending on what type of company
you're right yeah you'll you know if
it's an agile environment if you're not
familiar with agile it basically just
means that your your development process
this is a real summed up version by the
way so I very summed up but your
development process can change on a dime
more or less and then there's a
waterfall which is like we did this keep
it moving we make any changes that's
like the two-second difference but if
you're an agile team you'll have scrum
in the morning where you're basically
meeting up as on four with all the
developers in your team and discussing
what you're working on and if you need
to pull anybody to help you with it and
things like that
that'd be maybe the morning of your day
and again if you're in the beginning
cycle of your project you may still be
doing wireframes or user flowcharts a
lot of the entry level documentation
that that goes along with starting a
project and this also depends on how big
of a team you are so in my team I'm a
team of about three to five because we
have part-time devs and we have interns
so that's why I say three or five but
work with three full devs myself
included that are working on this
project on our specific module on my
team and so uh we're small team by most
by most accounts so we do everybody does
a little bit of everything but if you're
in a larger team if you're let's say
you're on a 10-person team and you got
you know three or four teams with ten
people on it and you have a devs op dev
ops team or dev ops section and you're a
team a and you have your nine other
members there may be actually a single
team member that suing the the
wireframes a single team member that's
doing the graphic design a single play
but on a smaller team you're usually
going to be doing a lot of everything
because even though later on in your
career you'll be a specialist you'll
know like for me I'm a full-stack
developer I'm still doing technical
documentation I am doing
I'm requirement gathering things like
that wireframes these are all things
that on a larger team
maybe the ui/ux guy would do or the
technical writer would do as well so
you're going to be picking up these
skills as well on a smaller team which
is why I encourage people when they're
just getting started to work in house as
well because simply as a remote
developer you have a very specific task
as well as the fact that it's going to
be harder to get a remote job I think
you're going to learn a lot more being
in in-house Pam so depending what part
of the process you're at you will now be
doing the requirement gathering and the
wireframes it will be doing a lot of
communication back and forth with the
client to make sure that before we write
I line a code we know what where we're
going and what we're doing in and what
we need to make what we what we need to
produce for the client that's what we're
that's what we're looking for here now
let's say you're done with that phase of
the project you're going to be coding
you're going to be building out it
depends on how it how yeah what the it
depends on what the development cycles
like there's a test-driven development
where you're actually just writing code
to pass the tests that are going to be
used but we didn't do test-driven
development we just developed right away
I don't know what the opposite of
test-driven development is just
developing um but in our case we did we
did a lot of the project set up I had a
very minimal code base to get set up
with as well tried to say about five
thousand lines of code not super minimal
but not an overwhelming amount a lot of
it's just same old same old for the back
end but we got starting we started from
scratch so it's basically zero lines of
code after about a month and a half of
me working there so the next sort of
stage of development in your day you're
starting now starting the project that's
kind of like prep work and you may go
back and forth between the wireframes
and the user flowcharts and all that
sort of stuff and the design during your
next stages but not as much so you're
actually coding it you're going to be
building the bulk of the application and
when you think you have
the idea captured you're going to have
like a QA server or a way to show the
client QA being like a quality assurance
server where you're going to upload it
you're going to the client actually
click through go through it hey it's
just exactly what you wanted all right
cool at that point they'll say yes or no
it'll probably throw a feature in there
that's going to break your codebase like
you're at it and you have to design
around it it's and no matter how
detailed you get in your requirement
process the client will always as the
juices are turning as because at the
other day this is what they're
passionate about a third project they're
hiring you to deliver a product that
they can't make themselves and so when
they don't usually and they usually
don't have a technical background or
they build it themselves so sometimes
they'll think of additional things as
you're working on it as I continue to
think about it that you didn't factor
into your codebase and you'll add that
in as well so you know depending on what
stage right you do a lot of coding and
with that coding when you get to sort of
milestones in in your current stage you
actually do a lot of testing as well and
again this everything I'm talking about
you're saying wow man we're talking
about like design we're talking about
architecture we're talking about
wireframes use their flowcharts all this
sort of stuff and coding the database
the front end the back end that's a lot
yes that's one of the benefits of being
on small team you get it you get exposed
to a lot of things and when you are
larger teams there may be a guy that
only does the testing and the guy that
only does the UI in UX it all just
depends so you may be doing testing so
at night when we were about halfway
through our project currently we started
implementing a lot of tests we started
implementing unit tests which are
essentially testing the functionality of
your functions and code so if I have a x
to function it would then if I pass into
is return for if I pass in three it will
return six on I'd write the I would
write tests that would test to make sure
that it's working as expected that would
be a unit test and then there's
end-to-end testing an example this for
angular would be protractor where it
actually will launch a mock version of
your way
application and you'll have typing code
saying what did she do and how it should
react it will click through this mock
version and go and test your code and it
will fail or it'll pass and so a lot of
tests were written in the middle of our
application and you maintain it as you
go by you check to make sure nothing
breaks because as your as your code base
is developing as new features being
added as features our grid functions are
being updated and changed ship breaks
it's just part of the process that's why
even though clients sometimes want you
to update the code in the middle of and
a potential event you should never do it
because you never know the code base is
so complicated that maybe your tests
weren't written written perfectly and
even though your tests were passing so
that some sort of limited use case came
and crashed during whatever you know big
event was going on even it so but so
that's what the tests are for you do
some testing now let's say you're
getting towards the end of the
application or at least the end to a
major milestone where now it's time to
move on to a different project so you're
going to be finishing up a lot of a lot
of your application a lot of the
functions some of the nice to have
features if there's time that's when you
start implementing those like you know I
want this to actually float to the left
and then be dragged around I want a nice
animation for this just sort of nice to
have but not really super similar to
feature requests that we couldn't build
in that weren't absolutes you know I
think I don't absolutely have to have
this what's a nice to have this might be
the time you actually start doing some
of that now so you're basically wrapping
it up right you're finishing things up
things that you may have put off that
you knew you could fix a lot of the
small stuff we're like hey this doesn't
look all that great let's go back and
you know mess with the CSS a little bit
change that up you check when the
finishing touches on it if you will and
this is another time where you're going
to now start hammering in your own tests
not only do you have tests written that
are passing on whatnot and front a
front-end back-end tests all this source
up you're actually going to be going
through the application and you're like
I am bug hunting right now there is a
bounty out for bugs and I plan on
collecting you know I mean so that
that's that's really where I've been out
for the last two or three weeks where I
am going through our entire module or
entire application and I'm trying to
find any bug I can and in whatever use
cases there may be right and you have to
get really creative so because how if
there is a way to break it a user will
find it so don't ever think that Oh a
user would never do this that's too
random I shouldn't waste the time to do
it no waste the time and do it because I
promise you they will find a way to
break it so you always have to think of
all the use cases and then what ends up
happening is or what I expect and that's
where we're at now right or we're
getting ready to move on to the next
application of the next part of the
process and so what ends up happening
now as you go when you go through the
process again with some new application
and during this application what's going
to happen is the client is going to be
thinking about oh you know what we've
been using this for a while we came we
got some feedback we need you to make
these changes so then you jump back into
the project and you you wireframe it
again and say all right these are the
changes that you requested this is how
we perceive to look is this how it seems
in your mind if it's not well this is
why it has to be this way you start
working through it start changing the
database in the front end and it's kind
of like a non endless cycle but that's
kind of I I know this video is titled
what I do in a day but every day is
different because it sends where you are
in the project that's why I gave this
sort of long 12 minute answer about what
my day was and I really talked about
each about the day but eight months so
that's that's what I do and on a daily
basis it just depends what part of the
project you're at right it's not a
matter of making a simple webpage
anymore
it's a matter Billy an entire web
application that has a front end with
various JavaScript frameworks of
back in with various databases and
middleware that connects them and then
it has about adding features finding
bugs writing tests designing it all that
sort of stuff and I love it and I think
you guys love it too so that's what I do
every day
