be talking about arrays and specifically
how the push and pop method works and
just one or two things that you can do
with them when programming that maybe
they know about so let's go ahead and
just create a basic array that's gonna
store four integers so we're just going
to call it VAR array and we're just
going to set it equal to an array of two
three one and four so there's our basic
array storing four numbers so how does
push work so push allows us to add to
the end a new item to the array so we
can simply go ahead and call array and
then dot call dot push on it and then in
this case we will just continue our
trend here and we'll just go ahead and
add zero to it this is now gonna now
gonna have our array values are going to
be two three one four and zero
that's how push works now pops say we
made a mistake and we wanted to actually
pop this zero off so or pop the last
number off so pup will allow you to pop
the last number off so in this case if
we actually call it ray dot pop our
array would now return one excuse me 2 3
1 and 4 and our zero would now be gone
so that's basically how array push and
reg pop works just a quick note some
people may not know this may not be very
intuitive but say we actually wanted to
pop this number but store it in a
variable we can simply do that by
creating a variable in this instance
save our store and in this case we'll
just go ahead and set it equal to array
dot pop
and it would store the number that were
popping so if this helped to kind of
clear up a few things about how pushing
Pop works in a raise in JavaScript and
generally in any sort of language thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
