I can't resist this alright so um you
said that you were struggling on your
portfolio for we dive into that when you
tell us what you've been up to
yesterday today for with your code okay
so when I struggled with today haven't
shown any this isn't shame shown don't
you oh you want to show it you want to
see it
there you go oh okay otherwise shine
what's showing on there so it's show
okay I know I just wasn't looking on
their way over here okay okay so see how
these two things learn next to each
other just like this okay that is what I
struggled with because I quite literally
for the better half of my day this was
up here and I could not get it separated
from my picture and I had it in one of
these things in here I had a margin Oh
remember the margin we put in there is
separate it hmm
okay well when I put in the background
the background didn't fill the margin
space so then it didn't look connected
right here like how it was on the
example so I was like oh
and so I was going through each one I
was looking at my code and being like
okay this goes here this goes there this
is what this does so I have a pretty
good idea of what all of my CS does and
I have a pretty good idea of what all my
HTML does there's just there's probably
a few things you can notice right off
the bat that are still that I've stolen
struggling with
like ie my picture how it is further
down than it is here that is not
intentional ah those are little details
I wouldn't worry too much about I know
I'm gonna move forward and I'm wait for
like you to go through it yourself and
be like oh this is where this is um but
also like right here on the right you'll
see that my background for whatever
reason over here like all right oh you
guys can't see it on this side but I'm
here on the right you can see it yeah um
and yeah so okay well let me let me tell
you why that is because that's I could
be unique to code pin we're going to
find out right now where and we can
inspect real quick using the inspector
to see hey see what this is this is
actually considered the HTML block and
what you're targeting is your div one
block see how so it's HTML that's the
width you see it getting highlighted
here
should I get my HTML block background
color well how do we target elements
this is ID this is an element right
so oh so I do HTML yes so you do
something HTML
- color I know you don't want it blows
very example so it so that you can see
that see the difference yeah oh my
goodness look at that all right mm-hmm
and then I changed the text fonts and I
cannot tell you how many times I changed
the scholar scheme color scheme I didn't
want to do purple because the example is
purple it pissed me ha ha ha because I
feel like Purple's the only color that
goes and I really wanted to do green but
oh the green is just so out so is this
your background color right here yeah
well let me show you something to you
that's it use saturation lightness zero
comma zero point zero let's run that
real quick
so that made it see-through so remember
what the hell it was 50/50 you have to
look up I might have with my color
scheme back what's the idea oh also I
need to get rid of this but there's
multiple ways to do colors right now
you're just so like let's go to a color
wheel Oh quick
I'm not actually images well if you
don't like the green you can go ahead
and find another green no I know I tried
supple green that's what I'm saying
oh so you just rude I went through the
color wheel and just couldn't decide on
a color are you sure you just don't like
the color green
dislike the color green all right I
thought I liked green but I may not why
doing a blue color scheme I didn't like
that all I want to do is the purple I
don't even like the purple look at the
the example I'm like I don't like this
okay maybe I'll do with a white and
green so why we're at it let's look at
what you'll be doing for the next part
of the portfolio just so that I can
maybe give you some hints okay
sorry guys my neck is I slept on my neck
wrong I don't know what I did to be
honest I woke up in pain so I created
divs already for each of those options
so there's nothing that I'm yet alright
mm-hmm okay
so this is a heavy penalty have you come
over horizontal rule the HR tag nope
why don't we do something a little bit
different today let's go through w3
schools and we'll just go over what's in
HTML like what the link and we're going
to do the same thing for JavaScript once
you start working with it so that you
know what's included in the language
because a lot of times people don't know
that should exist so let's see let's see
if we do it from here and uh we'll go
through and you tell me if you
understand it and if I think you do
we'll continue it and we're just going
to go through the HTML section on html5
section on oh cool on w3 schools all
right so this is the basic setup of a
HTML page right we've gone over this you
have your doctype HTML this business is
html5 your HL attack the head tag and
then what's this title tag do again it's
the time at the top good all right and
then you uh how many many of the body
sinks one through six and then the
paragraph tag
cool so that's basic stuff
ijuin hi
a big papa
let's move on introduction simple HTML
page where you know that we talked about
what all these elements are the HTML tag
is the root element just keep that in
mind
hi everybody
ah most tags web browsers that structure
this is a good image to have in mind
because it gives you an idea of how that
your normal structure of a page will go
and not visually this part but kind of
container wise like hey this is here
this contains everything and then you
have your head to head kind of throws me
off because I like having that visual in
my head when I'm sitting up my my um
like I like having it written down in my
code so I can see it not having it there
just kind of I'm like okay well what we
can do is we can get you set up with a
text editor moving forward how would you
like you undo it after yeah after I
already started it
yeah after your portfolio factor your
code and give you my tips part of your
part of your your part of your task will
to be albula
moving it from code pin to the text
editor right
that may mean throwing in your doctype
tag HTML tag the header tags with links
to the style sheets as well and we'll
we'll go over good file formatting and
folder structure as well
sorry I forgot that we're a Youtube
couple channel now yeah you wish just
three of us I've seen a couple youtuber
channels they're actually pretty good
someone just got their kids taken away
all right so no not that one I'm talking
about
Milo see YouTube HoloCam it's just so
wack the cell use notepad so when I say
text editor the text editor is basically
something that you can write your coding
a very basic one there's IDE S which are
development environments and they're
kind of like fancy advanced phones get
him down please
Milo we what are you doing we don't know
yeah let's get down come on yeah yeah
all right
this just shows you something that you
can write you can use something that's
no pal I'm going to get you set up with
a better text editor than notepad when
we when we get going you're not I used
to do it in notepad not like do it but
code back in high school that's what I
use okay so with the texture you can
basically open this up into any any
browser open up your text page like this
and you'll see it's just the file opened
up and now let go that's good enough
let's continue on we're gonna go pretty
quick through this if I go too fast and
there's something you don't understand
stop me because I know you've already
been working with HTML I just want you
to get comfortable with all of HTML yeah
I know I absolutely agree okay
cuz I I'm not the thing is is like I may
not know HTML well enough to know
I'm missing something okay we've covered
comfort headings which covered
paragraphs now anchor text this is what
we do to make links right right and then
everything between the opening anchor
tag and the closing anchor tag and the
way that we set where it's going is with
the href tag and then we have images
what's that anchor tag exactly you're
just holding that that place it there
like it's like a claw and it's holding
the link there you mean why is it called
an anchor tag yeah well what's the
function inputting the function of an
anchor tag is hood to connect you to
another page okay so that's like a
wormhole sure it's a wormhole baby all
right so we've talked about the alt text
what's the alt text you for a new engine
oh it's like quizzed a baby quiz so fast
question it's not fast it is August pop
quiz day all right
hi Rex um it is the label when you leave
over it oh it also worked it's the
alternative text it'll show up when it's
not there we'll say that's close enough
and then you can set that you can
manually set the width in the height if
you manually set it it will adjust but
if you set both values it will adjust
both values and will be distorted if you
don't set the correct ratio yeah we can
also do that in CSS with just the width
or the height good and it's better to do
that in CSS yes I agree
all right so heading so h1 tag the P tag
what's the BR tag do I don't know yeah
it's a line break so let's say you want
a parent so yeah so you have a paragraph
but on one line you want it to drop down
you throw BR in oh it's not like the
okay so it's not like the JavaScript
arif with the new line
well that's that's another way of doing
it so so welcome godless monkey I got
monkey okay so the break is a prick oh
and there's there's just the BR tag
there's not an ending BR tag right okay
because it line break there's no reason
in it so we're done
ah that's cool so just BR all right um
we've talked about the HTML H ones pair
got how many times so they can go over
 paragraph tags oh I do know what
a paragraph tag is we're gonna make sure
um so here's something that's kind of
interesting you can declare um and this
is good practice to declare what
language an HTML document is in en-dash
us is typically what we do right English
in USA yeah so I you can set the
language here and there's I mean that
like I said there's screen readers and
stuff that this is important for I
believe there's SEO purposes as well I
didn't know all of the title attribute
in Omaha since I've touched this so the
title attribute the title hi Darrin the
title attribute oh sorry buddy
um is something that you can a science
that when you hover over it you'll see
I'm a tooltip and so that's what you
that's how you can do it you can do this
for almost anything that's awesome I'm
gonna start doing that the now keep
in mind that that this is will only work
on PC because there is no hover on your
phone right so that's one one attribute
they can that you can use Oh see here we
talked about the HRF size attributes the
alt attribute
you know I didn't know this
what didn't you know it's not deprecated
all right nothing
double quotes are more common when using
attributes doesn't matter them alright
alt okay other things that we can use is
we can use the disabled value to disable
an input element input element would be
things like a drop-down a text box text
area a radio button we can actually
disable oh yeah I I briefly touched on
that and then okay
of course the inline styling as well as
continue on headings we've already seen
all those okay horizontal rule so a
horizontal rule is a line that goes
across read the entire container so if
you're intending to container takes up
50% of screen it will go for that full
50% you can style it as well
so like when we were looking
at here this is a horizontal rule that
someone styled just a line that goes
across horizontally and you do that with
a suit with a single HR tag there's not
a closing tag there's just the one tag
see horizontal rule talk about the head
element
cool paragraphs do you want you don't
want to take nonsense all right
we've talked about the BR the line-break
the new line whatever you wanna call it
with puri pyaar redefines pre-formatted
text fix what's fun it is a fixed-width
font so if you want it to be formatted
as you have it in here you can use the
pre tag I haven't used to protect too
much in my life but it basically it's
the same thing as just text except it
includes line breaks and it includes
spaces properly see how this is spaced
we don't have to throw any be ours in
there so pre tag will let you do that so
how are we format inside the pre tag is
how it shows up yeah what is you charset
utf-8 it's has to do with what type of
characters are using in HTML you don't
need to worry about it man it's all
 it's just but it's just
 technical stuff man that's all
it is but that's not very helpful
sorry guys mm-hmm
California is calling we want Dylan buck
they've been trying uh alright um
there's background color we've talked
about the style that you attribute
before so text color font family font
size text align you can just skip the
whole styling section yeah you got that
down no it's just if I use CSS almost
point about you know in the style
formatting well it's it's the same words
I know okay
so you know how to make text bold and
CSS text italic this is Supes subscript
and superscript I didn't yeah so if you
want words to be let me show you in here
so you can wrap this subscript with the
sub tag when am i moving back to here
that in LA when they offer me $150,000
salary by the way I'm no wearing to
worth on are $50 thousand dollar salary
right now so I don't think it'd be
anytime soon um or if my parents start
getting a little old uh um okay so you
Stu italic with a high tag you do bold
with the B tag you may have seen this as
strong it's better to do with yeah I see
you're a strong I like it yeah B is
better for bold
B is for bold yeah eyes for italic sub
is for subscript so we'll drop down like
that and sup is for superscript it has
an opening and closing tag Dean's a
120,000 the price has gone up
alright uh yeah okay and then you can
there's marked I haven't I don't know
what marked is so let's let's try this
out so we'll create a paragraph tag here
and this is exactly how I learn new
thing and I don't know everything there
is about
to know about anything so I just know
what I know and so let's do a test let's
run this see what mark text looks like I
was deep
so mark will highlight text it looks
like as bait
all right so mark you understand mark
will highlight text so that's how we
highlight it I think I do know that I
might have forgotten that which is
equally as likely and then there small
which is a way to do smaller text in
what you have see how it's slightly
smaller and then there is deleted text
if you want to throw a line through it
I've seen that before what's the point
in that
so I mean let's say we're making a note
taking application yeah and we want o
don't cross it out when we're done
that's an example that's a mind you a
lot of these things are just tags for
CSS that you can already do yeah yeah
okay so the next thing is inserted text
let's see what insert Texas is the I NS
- yes
I'm buying a new cord tonight
inserting text is underlined text I
guess and all right so we went over all
that
any questions so far no all right
quotations you also do quotes so this
kind little seaside you do this you'll
see you can throw quotes on something
it's kind of weird zine okay hey is that
a is that you and busy no I think and
boom we're change this thing so zoom it
you'll see right here we have quotes
this is kind of strange to do it like
that
I was told in college you strong and em
tags instead of I and B tags is using
BNI tax frowned upon in the industry
know totally judged that's just some
 I told you uh and honestly
let's see here if you want to know let
me let me show you right now difference
I think you might have it backwards if
anything between I am and yeah so
so apparently b and i are the old way of
doing things you can use strong and AM
tax it doesn't matter though
that's the truth of the matter until one
of them becomes outdated so much that it
doesn't affect anything which on things
to have it so there's also block quote
which is cool so like you also hear I
just feel like the less you have to
write whether it's from like two
characters to one character the whole
thing about keeping your code as simple
as possible alright same exactly
so here's block quote where you can see
it kind of treats it as a quote it's
indented outwards yeah oh that's cool so
blonde cold yeah I like I don't I'm not
familiar with this site tag I'll see if
it reads that we can read up on it the
site attribute that is that it looks
like it's citing where it's coming from
so I bet if we were free if we hovered
over it we could see where it's coming
from like oh you can't see it it's not
hovering no not however if we looked
into there
I'm not sure how what I know this goes
in their nails apparently so we cite our
source in the HTML if we want to have to
look into site more but you when you use
blockquote
now you know hopefully we run into it so
I can learn as well
yeah block block block quotes great man
when I was a I was a datacenter blogger
a texas tech blogger i use it all the
time alright so um you have this
abbreviation tag here i'm ordering
something ii or all fear
ours are screen that we were looking at
my my corns that and I haven't been
wanting to buy a new one because I'm
going to buy a new monitor but I think
I'm just going to buy it since I'm
starting my side project okay so yeah so
this is this scent this is for a
abbreviation you could put the title in
it if you want to hover over it to see
what it is so now we're combining things
but basically this this lets the the
HTML document know that this is
abbreviation and we're just adding a
title tag on here to show what it is oh
that's actually super cool because it's
like when you're writing it in a
document or you have a full name and
then you put the clothes and you like
abbreviate it so the rest of the time
and it's like doing that HL is so cool
alright I'm a writer guy so that to
me seeing writer like things and
anything else is just like oh okay so
you have this address tag as well that's
cool um little laid out in the address
format oh well yes but you have to put
your tech you have to put your own stuff
in here but it will make it a little bit
italic and you'll line break it but also
just lets the HTML document know that
this is an address hmm um it's just not
another tag some of these tags will feel
like they don't really do um so is
a tag like CEO searchable SEO yeah
sometimes some more these tags are
better than others so site you can see
that normally I'll make it italic but
this is also another thing that in in
the background let's let's the search
engine know that this is a you're citing
this I mean so someone couldn't say that
you're plagiarizing imagine imagine
these tags that look like look like that
they're not doing anything imagine that
and you the computer is trying to tell a
blind person the purpose of it and
that's what a lot of these tags do so
instead of just reading this why the
saying is this is citing a source the
scream and so similar to how we did with
citing our source
for the image or for the quote earlier
and the abbreviation so we're adding
additional context is what some of these
tags are doing visually they not
visually you're not going to do too much
bio directional tag what the is
this this is like one of those things
where they smoke a joint and then I had
to figure out how to get this
working alright so this is if you want
to reverse the direction of the text
apparently and they have oh my god I
could read that this line will be
written from right to left so you have
the BDO tag and the direction you have
to pass in the direction attribute to
get this to work
I bet for dyslexia people that thing is
amazing
Irish is like a music so we've already
talked about comments I've shown you the
shortcut you hold down control select
yeah I've been I'm used it a few times I
feel super uber like you legit now legit
yeah conditional comments um these are
comments that only show up if you're
working with certain stuff don't worry
about that that's pretty cool like
surprise comments are here
alright so HTML itself just regular HTML
has 140 colors that are supported by
name so you see when I put teal in and
the ugliest color I've ever seen in my
life showed up and I'm like that's not
deal so these are all the supported
colors in HTML all right oh you have RGB
as another way of doing color remember
that red green blue that's one way of
playing around with getting a different
shade of green
for instance yeah I actually came across
an app that does RGB
Raiders yeah so all you do is take a
picture of a collar and then it
generates the color for you
yeah like here's an example this is
black this is great this is a little bit
greater light great white there's hex
values which is what you're using
another example and there are hex values
that are the same as RGB values LLC CSS
stands for cascading style sheets inline
CSS you can exhale over here so shocked
by inline CSS this is enjoying would you
choose one type of color over another
um well depends RGB a so RGB hex and
colors are three different ways to get
the same with that color right now just
a straight-up color name there's not as
many options so that's one reason why
you wouldn't use that same thing with
RGB and the hex another thing is that
there's RGB a which still a x
colors more color yellow need but that a
is is basically for alpha or opacity and
so you can set it so it's only 50%
see-through and then there's hue
saturation and lightness which is
another way that you can do it and I
think there's something else the thing I
believe is something off that alright so
we've talked about external CSS this is
how we link our style sheets
this tells the the basically says hey
this is a style sheet and this href is
the file path to the style sheet okay so
the HRF the file path is it always gonna
look like that style saw CSS it's gonna
look different it's gonna depend on how
your folder structure is it depends
where your file is based off of where
the file that you're in is where this is
leaking
where you want to go okay cuz that's
what I was thinking because yeah I
remember having to link my and this is
something this is something you're going
to have to do in your in your document
yeah when you switch over to a text
editor yeah which is exactly why I
wanted to start being able to do that
because I know that that's a big part of
website development yes that's part of
it
okay not a big part but as I when I was
in high school of making websites that
was the trickiest thing for me all right
well you know about the border you know
how thick of the border
what type of border what color is a
border um okay this is all CSS as I say
yes so we've talked about padding this
goes all over I've really gotten padding
and margin down let me tell you I
with that every day
and I've messed with it so much I now
know margin padding high then you have
IDs right you're familiar with IDs oh
yeah I've used a lot of those as well
alright classes oh you know what I
wanted to talk to you about IDs and
classes okay um one how do you go about
naming such said things and two are
there predefined ones that I don't know
about no so well one you should name it
something relative I try but how do you
find the relativity and a div so Omega C
exactly yeah okay so wait wait wait wait
go to my HTML alright okay see you here
you have an idea yeah see that
I got about me about me P because I was
like this is my about me div okay but
this is paragraph is my about me like
literally so I put a P on there for
paragraph only I don't know if that
makes me sound can any wall so look at
my code and my IDs in my classes and go
oh yeah okay I see what they're saying
of course it just all in my head
you know sometimes I go back and I'm
like what the is this
I will calm down for a second there one
thing I would change about me is fun one
thing I would change is I've used camel
case that would be the convention okay
so you want to be able to see this real
quick and go from there now you could if
you uh you about me section would be
alright about me is fine if you want you
to even do about me diff um and then you
can do about me paragraph but if you're
going to use the same stuff for the
paragraph you should for another
paragraph you might want to use a class
right and I just happened I haven't been
in that second section you wouldn't
necessarily call it about me you'd give
it a more general name like um you know
got style yeah peace peace style one
piece l2 uh something like that
I usually if it only has two or three I
if it only has two or three things in it
I usually give it a pretty basic one but
you try to just be as descriptive as you
can but you definitely use camel case
okay good I cool so I was actually
reading an article on that and I was
reading the guy's article and like this
makes absolutely no damn sense he was
referencing other articles and I was
reading those articles and I was just
getting more and more confused
okay so you can also change these
elements together are you familiar with
that so this is a paragraph this is the
air class so the paragraphs that have
class air will be colored red however if
I were to create an h1 tag here and I
was to give it the class air class air
now we're to do tests okay Chris but
then what do you name it what will
happen when you will find a convention
that works for you like maybe you just
need something like classes there's no
such thing as predefined class in HTML
now the predefined classes are in
bootstrap which is a CSS sheet so one
thing you want to name a camel case and
you'll generally get better at naming
your variables and naming your classes
and Chris is right you shouldn't
necessarily include a description of
something but for me I might do if I
know something's font like fur
specifically for styling font I might
call it font style 1 something like that
anyhow um even this much is like font
color red but like in this class this is
a good example of this is a good example
of something that gives context err
color red ok so when it's an air it's
giving contact so hey this needs to be
right so see how this isn't red even
though we assign a class err maybe I'll
write an article on naming okay but see
how dark see how I see how our h1 isn't
right
even though we assigned the class air to
it well that's not a class is it taught
air yeah yes but how come it doesn't
have the same makeup is your classic
because what do we have in front of it
we have a paragraph tag so we're nesting
leasing so we only want paragraphs who
have the class air to be stopped that
way so this is make any sense to me
because a dot error in the paragraph is
not an attack it's not a what it looks
like it's a CSS style thing this is a
Stasi SS thing but what I'm saying is
this parrot this is a paragraph right
the P element yeah and then we're saying
this is a class and we're saying only
when it's a paragraph and class air do
we want to apply the styling it's called
its nesting your your CSS styling
all right
something that describes its function
whether raven HD welcome what one
hyperlynx whether van whether van thank
you
alright so we've talked about anchor
tags and you've we've talked about
pseudo-classes you're actually using one
in here yeah okay oh my next question on
this one is okay so these links I have
to be able to link them to my divs
how do we do that okay so I forget the
technical term for this but you see this
ID right here yeah what you would do is
similar to how we have IDs right with
the hash tag we would do hash tag about
me div we save it then when we click
home
I may have forgot to run the code right
holy
see how we jump to it it's gonna be a
little hard to see right here because we
zoom way in maybe they'll mess it up
better you see oh now we're gonna click
it and it jumps to it it jumps to where
that div is but you just you target the
about Me part you say hashtag I want to
jump to that ID can you do it okay cool
going over the free code camp beta
refresh my memory be this good thing man
all right so it's a little bit about
link colors an unvisited link if you
don't style it is blue and underlined if
it's been visited is underlined in
purple
and if it's underlined its actives
underlined right that's just nice body
so and then you learned about hover
already active we have more let's go
ahead we're wearing self right we're
bringing it up so you see when we hover
you you could set pseudo classes when
it's been hovered you also do it when
it's been visited meaning like hey if
this guy's that already gone there it is
now pink because we've already visited
this link I love that
it's so helpful
there's also by default its link active
so see when we click on it it's yellow
that's active so these are other pseudo
just so great as a writer when I'm going
through and like copying things and
visiting and looking through tons of
documentation having those makes it so
much easier for me to mentally keep
track of where and what I've read I love
it so all you have designers okay all
right so there's also the target for
anchor tags to specialize where to open
it the open the link um usually they
only bite self this underscore self can
actually just put self or you don't need
to put anything it'll by normally it
will jump page to page but if you want
to open a new window you can just use
the word blink I mean yeah I've done
that one okay you don't need to worry
about the other ones what no no really
well why not I know there's not enough
time
yes CSS is a rough man I'm pretty bad at
it to be honest with you I'm going
through some tough CSS coding and cut
economy hmm I wonder how far I got on
code Academy I think I got through the
CSS I actually like code academies set
up so you see how this works remember
this is exactly what you were asking a
second go see we have chapter 4 right
here yeah and this doesn't have to be a
div it can be an ID but you'll see we'll
jump it's not jumping there go
Oh see it'll bring it to the top front
and center you know that's funny
is like before I knew about these tags I
hated that but now that I know about
them I love them alright so this is an
example of a a full path URL you see how
it goes from HTTP a full URL right to
get what I mean by that now so full URL
means that we're passing in a URL that's
complete from start to finish from the
HTTP to the : w / / www this is the
entire path okay and then there's a
relative URL and we're going to close
some of these right here which where
this is going to go that's a relative
path it's assuming that based off this
slash whatever wherever we are which in
this case were right here that if we
click to that it's going to go slash
HTML / default dot ASP that's a real to
go through okay so you're staying within
this same website web site okay that's
cool yeah this is how is that better
than having a full yes a full thing
uh-huh um if you're in your the site and
the reason for that is because you're
going to be developing locally
what's going to happen is you're going
to use relative URLs because if you
don't you're going to have to go back
and change all your URLs that you put on
your entire why that would Jesus so
that's why you use relative URLs cuz all
you have to do is drag and drop and
you're done
okay now is that also more time
efficient when the code is loading yes
it's more efficient not necessarily that
this is going to load there's less text
so yes but it's not noticeable when
talking about code being efficient
you're usually referring to the
JavaScript HTML you're not ever worried
about but there's much more benefit to
doing it like this okay yeah HTML
encoder Academy was easy but it was
beneficial they touched on a lot of
stuff I think maybe a little bit more
than free code Campton gonna be happy no
that their bait has a lot more stuff as
well oh well there you go alright so we
know all that we've talked about the
alts source style source fault
my thing is formatting images okay so
okay yeah so and then you can also do
this for the so the source is
essentially where that image is located
right you can do relative pass for that
as well and that would be what you would
do we never hard-coded paths okay so
relative yeah relative verse hard coding
you never want a hard code anything if
you don't have to now you have to hard
code to an external site right because
we're not here but but within your on
yes I'd love to know why web dev jobs
are in the US are better paid than the
UK it would probably be a combinations
of um
technically more developed I read type
that into Google there are some good
articles on that
all right let's let's finish this page
I'll answer that question or box go to
box vo X they have some good
explanations on that as well
this is up that I throw this in
here why what's up
you can put coordinates in here oh that
is super cool like land coordinates
I don't know Ivan Ivan so there's shapes
you can start shaping things you know I
actually came across that some of that
writing and I I was like I don't know
what this is
all right uh we'll stop here for that so
we're gonna we're gonna continue on
going over all of this and w3 school so
they know what it exists here so let's
let's stand up for a second I think uh
James in a week you're emailed me about
another tutoring session sounds good man
ah not this week and though your boys
going to a hackathon it's a three day
hackathon he's gonna be busy I'm hoping
my finger is a little bit better by then
it's it's getting better every day okay
so so we asked hey why do you think jobs
and dev jobs in the US are better paid
than the UK I've talked to quite a few
I've uh I've talked to a few I know a
few devs in the UK and one thing I could
say is that I don't know that that's
always the case it depends your salary
depends on a lot of things cost of
living for one so maybe UK's cost of
living is a little bit lower it also
depends on what sort of benefits you get
because depending on where in the United
Kingdom you're living if you're living
in a very populated city you may be
paying more if you have better health
care you may be paying more taxes than
we are also it depends on where the
companies are and what they're paying
you for there's a lot of companies
salaries for junior level roles vary
quite a bit here so I think it depends
on what's what skills are needed in your
region and what's in demand and also a
junior developer compared to a senior
developer differs so dramatically that I
imagine a senior developer in the UK is
probably close to what a senior
developer in America is most of the time
so I don't I wouldn't really worry about
the junior developer role so much as a
senior too
paroles I hear that more companies are
creating HTML mobile apps over native
example uh yeah like react native and
stuff I have heard that um what is that
what does that mean um so my brakes
thanks for coming and watching us so
there are you tomorrow there are
libraries so remember we're talking
about jQuery the other day yeah and I
just explained to you the concept of a
framework a library very yeah and how
they do certain things for you
so there are things like that that react
native is one of them that when you
write it in a certain structure it will
allow you to compile it down into a
mobile application and then you won't
actually have to write a mobile app
separate okay that's what you were
talking to me about a while back yeah
yeah and so that's something that I'm
interested in game I am 48 years old am
I too old to change for asking into web
damn no no absolutely not
no I can't keep truckin man um just do
what you can dive in get internships
freelance
I think freelance would probably be the
easiest route for you to go to get
started just just because I think I
think that's probably a little more
realistic but that doesn't mean you're
ever too old man you got plenty of good
years that are you just gonna give up
but don't let don't let that that that
negative and I have a video coming out
in a few days
literally title I mean I think it's
final you never too old to learn to code
you guys see literally die salute you
there's there's so much you're just I
don't know I feel like there's like the
lot of combat between the generations
that are like oh you know some of the
generations feel left out of the
millennial generation but the thing is
is the millennial generation is changing
the
sure of everything and rearranging it
and anyone who resisting that change in
that structure you can they're having a
hard time dealing with it but I mean
that's the beauty of being able to
rearrange it and going your own path
because you're never too old and you're
never too young you're literally follow
your heart so here's the video that I
have coming out it looks like tomorrow
actually so it might be pretty relevant
to you I didn't cook soon enough yeah so
this one's called never too late to
become a developer and I talked about
some of those things that you know
reflecting back on how I felt the same
way I'm 29 years old and do I wish I
started much much earlier of course I
did are there things that I I wish that
I did earlier besides meeting my
wonderful girlfriend of soon-to-be 20
years he's not kidding you 20 year plan
man
uh so uh little sneak peek yeah so you
guys you guys get a little tidbit when
you show up to the last dreams but it's
never too late man it's are there going
to be challenges yeah there's challenges
when you're young miss challenges when
you're older there's challenges when
you're my age it just depends there's
benefits at every age at forty eight a
company may be more willing to take you
on in a junior role knowing that you're
going to be appreciative and that you're
mature you have your together and
you're trying to better your life and
because of that they maybe they might
take your leave how many jobs I lost out
on to people who are just generally age
wise older than me and they're told and
I'm told what I have more experience
more experience life maybe but I mean I
really do think that in some companies
or it depends on who you're talking to
age does have a benefit so I mean and I
say this being on the opposite end of
the spectrum is I I literally am one of
the youngest guys in the company and so
in my
face on the second-youngest and that's
on I'm and significantly most people are
married have children and are making
what I consider to be very important in
those directions but besides that I
didn't think that's no takeaway that not
but uh I my point is this is that um
people are younger have issues people
over have issues people are right in the
middle have issues um but it's not it's
never too late man you just got work cos
it it may be a little harder
everything's a little harder it's a
little harder for me to land a developer
job because I didn't finish my CS agree
but Here I am working yeah I agree with
worlds it cuts both ways there's a lot
of programmers that like to put down
younger devs to I mean from every
generation we're kind of standing from
our point of views with biasness
selfishness whatever is affecting us at
that time but in the end we're all human
and when we get our consciousness
straight we realize that we are all
human and you know I will forgive each
other eventually ah maybe I never
forgive what for good
it's okay neither do I um we had a cool
comment up here by jazz I tried code
economy but found free coke to be way
better now and I'm flying thanks to you
guys I hope you're trying out the beta
man there's a lot more good stuff on the
beta it's a little buggy and they're
still adding so a little buggy what a
day we haven't gotten through with that
we might have gone through one lesson
without one bug that's it I know how to
work it though yeah well that's great to
hear just keep up the awesome work I
hope you keep flying soaring soar high
OH
Chris house I'm Jayden after getting his
CS agree no fifty yeah Chris Hawkes
always sounds to rescue so I am I'm a
Chris man um I think I think what you're
you're you're taking away from Chris's
not depression so much as somebody who
doesn't actually like being on camera I
think he enjoys you too
I don't think he enjoys public speaking
and because he's not there in front of
people I think that's what you're
getting out of it
and I think I think I think it's
developers we have a tendency to be
monotone a bit I know I have in the past
but um I mean I like Chris where are
those days where I literally like you
guys will see me like if I go back and
watch the videos you'll see me I'm like
really like timid I look shy look like I
don't have anything say and that's just
simply because I'm just not feeling it
like I don't want to be in front of the
camera but we made a commitment to be in
front of the camera every day for a
hundred days regardless of how I feel
that's right I told her she didn't come
in I was kicking her out as it I said no
pressure baby say you're gonna be
sleeping on me you know saying that for
me I'm pretty hard when it comes to
saying on alright I committed a hundred
days let's do this you know 100%
Reena shines sickness and death I will
be here those hundred days whether I
want to be or not and I'll be here as me
as best as I can as anyone can do

Facebook group Kotak and caffeine the
link is in the description and support
me on patreon that's always dope calm
slash coding tutorial 360 we'll see you
guys tomorrow
we're only in day 14 day 14 we have 86
more I got an email today say hey man
how come you haven't been doing to me
coming tutorials and all these sort of
advice story driven developers I'll out
time asked when our day plus on these
ask a death I run these tuner reads so
yeah I really sucked the life out of him
shut up
anyways also guys I would like to add to
his feel my spiel which is go ahead and
share these videos try to help us grow
the channel and that way we can do more
content he can do more content stop
bitching all that stuff and also code
