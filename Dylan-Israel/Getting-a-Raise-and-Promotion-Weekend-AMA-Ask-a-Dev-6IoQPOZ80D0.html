depending on what part of the world you
are in it is about 7:30 a.m. on this ok
weather Saturday and we are doing our
weekend live stream for those 2 you're a
little bit new every weekend I do one
live stream for about a hour sometimes a
little bit more and we answer questions
and all those sorts does try and help
provide you any direction that I can
write the hardest part with taking on a
new task like this is just making sure
that you're doing the right things and
and providing feedback
I'm just essentially providing some sort
of mentor function right and it's really
hard for a lot of a lot of the time
going through this stuff on your own and
so my goal is hopefully it's to make it
so that you don't feel so alone so here
we are doing our thing doing the damn
thing as they say and oh is this not
going out I feel like for some reason
it's his no it's public okay cool
everyone is just sleeping still so while
people are tuning in let's go ahead and
talk about the topic before we get to
everyone's questions
today's topic is getting a raise and a
promotion this is something that I'm
gonna be kind of speaking out of my ass
on because in all honesty the way that
I've gotten races and promotions in the
past is not by staying at a company it's
it's more so by it's more so by hung up
with this by leaving that's truth matter
leaving for a race and working for
another company and going from there
so in that aspect you can be very
successful of okay I'm going to I'm
going to leave my current situation for
a better situation which will result in
a race or a promotion so sorry and that
is very very easy so in that in that way
you essentially just clean up your ice
make clean up your LinkedIn have you
know more skills up sell yourself to a
new company
wham-bam you know year later six months
later you're good to go it's not very
hard especially as a developer with a
little bit of experience you know I have
offers that are $20,000 higher than wire
right no one I'm making now from
companies I've turned them down
mainly because I'd love where I'm at I'm
kind of in a transition period of my
life trying to figure things out
so that's on this earth it's the first
time in my life where I'm like I might
actually be here longer than a year
that'd be nice right no one really
enjoys jumping jobs at least I don't
think they do you enjoy the result of it
you enjoy you making the more money
maybe no environment but the whole it's
a very long and strenuous process a
stressful process so anyhow what I'm
trying to say here as I look at my words
is that's one way of getting a raise in
a promotion the other way is within your
organization how do you go about doing
that well there's kind of two things to
consider oh is it even possible
that's the first question is the
organization growing is it profitable
because if it's not it's gonna be very
hard task for you can get arranged to
get a promotion all that sort of stuff
now so that's the first thing to
consider now another thing is do you
know how to get a raise or promotion
honestly from what I've read in John's
book it seems like the best way
basically ask not ask hey can I get
promoted either hey can't get more money
but
ask the question what is expected of me
to be able to get a race what is
expected of me to get this promotion
that I want be very specific about what
that raises what that promotion is and
do those things don't assume you're
doing those things do the actual things
if they're assuming and keep track of it
right so that's one of the things that
I'm actually doing this weekend so I am
compiling a list of all the things that
I do for work that I believe go above
and beyond as well as things that are
just part of my job so that when my
one-year evaluation comes around that I
can argue for the best promotion I can
argue for the best race and at least is
very least if you don't get it you have
the evidence that you it's not a
miscommunication it's a oh well I guess
they don't value me as much as I wanted
them to value me but then you can make
the choice to get a raise or promotion
elsewhere if needed it's very strange
but yeah so I mean that's really a topic
of the day is if you want to race you
want a promotion ask what it's needed to
get a raise or promotion then act on it
actively act on it and and follow up
with your superior relay I did this I
did this as anything else so anything
else or anything else you know do it and
it and really at the end of it you um
you should get what you're looking for
or in the range of what you're looking
for we never get what we want we should
get in the range what you're looking for
I think and am oh well let's you know
that's what I'm gonna do so I'm at the
point now where I think I'm losing money
by staying with my current company and
that's not even to say that I'm
underpaid I'm paid quite well
so yeah you got raised yesterday
congratulations black halo please share
your knowledge with us
do you use similar qualified colleagues
to find your worth your worth is is so
it'd be one thing if you worked with
like a bunch of really bad developers I
would say for for the most part all the
developers I work with are excellent and
it is nice to nice to work with
and everyone's hard-working does their
 so in that sense we're all pretty
much equal but I don't I don't like that
I don't like comparing developers
against one another I think that that
everyone is unique like I I know
compared to some of the other junior
devs I make more money but it's also
because I I put myself in a situation
make more more money just and I'm gonna
 time talking about like five or
ten thousand dollars or so and I
shouldn't help but not ton more but I
don't think I don't think that has
anything to do with it I think has to do
with you if you accepted an offer you
work for that offer if you want more
money can you say look man so and so is
getting more money I guess you could I
feel like you're sort of breaking the
trust a little bit I think the argument
that you make is you let them know like
hey you know my market rate is higher
than what I'm getting and I like working
here I would like to stay but you know I
have a family I have kids at that you
know we actually don't even go into that
because that doesn't matter
you say look my marker rate is higher
than one I'm getting paid or so on and
so forth and you go from there
and you say look these are all the
things I've gone above and beyond I did
30 courses this year I read five books
this year I worked overtime these days I
volunteered I made I I you know have a
hundred percent attendance record to
these extracurricular things so
that's where I would start that's where
I'm going to start when the time comes
for me I know no I didn't get a raise
that's just a topic of today I was
talking with this stuff at the at the
bar with some colleagues last night
Sophie I was so weird when I was 20 I
would say co-workers about 30 now I'm
mature
so I say colleagues alright that's how
it works
um oh yeah so a couple cool things for
the channel monday we got a dole on
video a two-part don't long video it's
gonna be exciting you get two videos for
the price of one on Monday and then some
of you may be free code camp fans as I
am if you are you probably saw my video
on their channel I was kind of exciting
right I might do another one there this
week's been kind of a blur it was a
game-day week so I have a nice video
about scope creep coming out on
Wednesday which is what happened this
week but so I probably put in 15 extra
hours this weekend about two and a half
hours every morning in 30 minutes to an
hour after work to meet a deadline
someone dropped the ball along the way
I'm not quite sure who I'm not quite
sure how but the ball got dropped and
the devs had to pick it up was
 oh yeah it was exhausting though
but they got me I I'll usually do that
about once every two or two or three
months got anyone for the channel banner
I'm not man no one stepped up I'm not
jealous spits out hot fire
I do not use bootstrap studio for a
front-end do I invest 401ks are a stocks
right now I have nothing except some
kryptos which let me tell you aren't
feeling like investments are you now uh
so I have I'm just sitting on my money
in the bank right now which isn't
normally my my way of doing things part
of that reason is I'm looking to buy
property so I need my money to sit I
don't really like 401 case I do have
some money in peer-to-peer lending but
via prosper but I've actually lost money
with that so I unfortunately that has
actually cost me money yeah I've lost a
quarter of a percent doing a
peer-to-peer so my game plan in terms of
investments is property so I am I have
money in the bank saving I'm looking to
buy a place property usually so the
places I'm looking at for the most part
are either apartments like two or three
unit apartments or houses with
backhouses which is more likely of the
the two so that's kind of what I'm
looking at one that I can live in one
that I can rent out pay the mortgage
rinse and repeat so my goal really is to
buy a new property every year if I can
well maybe every two would probably be a
bit more so
yeah do you like traveling and I love
traveling I just haven't been able to do
anything for a while
my girlfriend's been unemployed for a
very long time so it's it's sort of hurt
our savings not that I'm losing money
but it's harder to save more money
because I'm supporting both of us and so
traveling has has put a damper on those
things are you a good landlord I've
never been landlord but I imagined I
would be where would I buy the property
somewhere nearby in the Tampa area it's
just one of those things where Here I am
although values have gone up quite a bit
they're still pretty low in comparison
well I ever venture away from tech and
become a business entrepreneur usually
these questions are about you man we're
talking about me today all right I don't
know how many plans to you buy is there
something that I thought was a good
business idea or that I was passionate
about yeah
yes I would do you want to have two
houses for you to live in no I don't
need two houses for me to live in the
back house is to run out and help pay
the mortgage and then you go and you rip
prints repeating you basically buying
like two properties but once a little
bit smaller that's sort of where I'm
going with that oh man I'm so tired
property ain't coming tonight I've
thought about like buying a 7-eleven or
something something that would be like I
think I could run this with very little
training well place it's why I love to
travel everywhere everywhere everywhere
ever when is the right time to ask for a
raise when you're software engineer
several months before your next
evaluation or or if you have a hard job
offer and you need to bring it up bring
it up immediately ask for a race and say
they kind of give you the long dick
workaround
give you two weeks take that race I
don't know the company right where my
cats they're all over I got three men
there's there's someone here there's one
when i chew in this room right now
stinker Tito Tito he's in his window
seat you may not want to come hang out
see you because they're answering the
hard questions today it might also just
be that I'm tired of I probably
worked 55 or 60 hours this week what
about using YouTube done you see
yourself as an entertainer spokesman
okay as a youtuber um I could see how
you might see I mean definitely the
channel is a infotainment channel so I
could see how you could say do you see
yourself as an entertainer
just because you're entertaining doesn't
necessarily mean you're entered you're
an entertainer I would like to consider
myself more of an educator somebody who
is somebody who is
educating you but doing in such a way
that it is fun and it is it is enjoyable
for everybody involved and you know
that's kind of why I think it falls into
the infotainment channel right
do you consider this work oh yes I do
just cuz I enjoy it doesn't mean it's
not work I spend maybe 10 15 20 hours a
week doing YouTube stuff building
courses and everything else so I think
um I think how could you not consider at
work when you are working at it right
like you know I do get a check and I I
do talk with sponsors and and three
emails do clapper
so I write collaborations work on things
so it is definitely work it's not
working the sense that I go to it or
that I have a boss on my own boss but
it's definitely work what were you doing
before web development I was just in
school dicking off working odd jobs
delivering pizzas building wine
vineyards bagging groceries
depends what we're doing but mainly just
school student not giving us all and
hating it in my inner say I'm machine
learning I'm interested at all whether
I'll go into this field taboc highly
unlikely
a lot of YouTube channels that make
videos of of Google salary and the up
quitting Google yeah I seen you quite a
few of those diabetic Manatee $5 for the
work you do I appreciate that man thank
you so much is appreciated cash monies
are not easy to give up just for other
people and that is probably one of the
more selfless things that you can do so
thank you very much man I appreciate
that where would you want to live if you
work remotely uh I don't know there's a
lot of places I'd want to live but
they're expensive I think that I think
the real answer to that is if I had a
good-paying remote job I wouldn't want
to live anywhere I'd be doing what one
oh my my remote colleagues is doing and
moving around every month or two so that
would be how I handle that do I use the
green screen often not as much as I
should I really just have it there so I
can do tutorials but in the Dolan videos
on Monday the green screen is used very
well so look forward to that here so
here's the thing guys at the end of the
day when you have these Google engineers
who are quitting and going and doing
their own thing the the main issue is
that people want to work for themselves
it's sucks working for a corporation
because it's not your end goal it's
their end goal and so it's one of the
things where how do you how do you
handle that right how do you deal with
that and a lot of times most people just
go through life and doing it and no one
builds up a side income no one builds up
a side hustle
so you're always gonna see those
outliers of you know yeah you have these
ten people on YouTube for Google
engineers that left but what about the
other 99.9% of Google engineers that are
there right so uh hold a live class you
guys couldn't afford my live classes my
live classes would be very expensive I
charge ninety dollars an hour for
mentoring so if we did a four hour live
class if there's four of you it'd be $90
a person and I don't even know what it
would be like a JavaScript class or a
typescript class or something in it it's
like that's not something that I think a
lot of people would pay $100 for is a
four hour live class how hard it was it
to motivate while coding do you feel
like giving up as a beginner very early
I questioned myself I quit I never felt
like giving up but I questioned that I
had made the correct decision dropping
out of college that is something I did
question because I wasn't quite sure at
what point do you stop at what point do
you give up what point do you throw in
the towel and so you question those
things but uh but I never needed to
motivate because to me the motivation
was I dropped out of college I got to
make this work that was the motivation
so hey maybe Ellen hoboes will continue
my path to self self developer very nice
I feel like if you are feeling like
giving up you just haven't hit your rock
bottom yet so um oh yeah I feel like for
me I was at my rock bottom and that was
enough I was like look I don't like it
down here I gotta get this together
right
but everyone's gotta have their own
rock-bottom
alright everyone has to you know all of
a sudden they can't put gas in their car
all of a sudden they can't buy food all
of a sudden they're you know they're you
know they live in a lifestyle they never
thought they would live and to going to
work coming home going to work coming
home and they're miserable I do I work
with designers very rarely make sure
designers no code their designers if
they were if they could design and
develop they wouldn't be just designers
but but a lot of time so when people
talk about giving up there's a ton of
people who's trying to learn to code and
give up is that I hiya
I wish I had stats on that but that's
much harder thing to track but I have no
doubt its astronomical amount or someone
who's been learning it part-time and you
know there's been doing that for seven
years I'm gonna take a month break here
month break they're definitely video
games very rarely
now what I do to relax I don't know it's
something I've been trying to figure out
lately I don't know anymore
right now I just work oh I'm actually
thinking I'm finally getting burnt out
how's school going I dropped out so I
saw well it's going
I should probably do an update video
about why I dropped out yeah how's that
coffee going
not very well yeah I couldn't continue
with school it was awful
it's boring oh I I definitely did an
update video it won't be this week
because I already have my videos it'll
be the following week yeah I couldn't I
go on there's a waste of my time uh so
that's basically what it came down to
should I start with JavaScript or Python
I think JavaScript is probably a better
place to start can you become a good
program or even if you're not really
into it I have a lot of colleagues here
I'm not really into it W so here's the
thing Robert since you're considering
going to WGU I still would recommend WGU
I just want you understand what you're
getting out of it if your goal is to
just get a bachelor's degree quick and
efficiently and cheaply if you put in
the work
WG is an excellent alternative if your
goal is to become a good developer if
your goal is to get skills if your goal
is to practice those skills you're just
gonna be learning outdated content
that's not gonna be relevant not some of
its relevant some of its not but you're
really just there to pass tests it was
um I don't know yeah I I just think any
I didn't get enough value out of it to
continue for my time put into it it was
miserable for me but you have to
understand what you're getting out of it
and I thought I could overlook that
that was one things I hated about school
before and it shirts out I can't but no
no and also also for the schooling
although it was a mistake going back
oftentimes is better to go and is better
to go and get answers even if those are
expensive answers so I basically paid
$3,500 for this mug that they sent me in
the mail and for three classes and two
certs that I knocked out or something
like that to know to get the final
answer that I am never going to go back
to college that was that was what I got
out of my my little stint here going
back to school is that it is not for me
it is a waste of time so but I know now
I don't know and so that that's not
gonna be something like ah damn should
I've gone back and done this and that I
should not and I know that's nice it's
nice to have that
LeBron's even killed my cat work he
thought it was cool nice huh you'll bet
one bit clan I go back to school you
think I paid all this money spent
basically three months and then bounced
I was like oh yeah yeah I won't do that
again
or do you think I learned so how do you
go back to school
oh my go back to school what type of
apps work on I work on in up I mean I
really can't go into it but I I work on
client-facing and back office tools
that's really the gist of it
what are your thoughts on boot camps
before beginning the process of learning
web development I think you need already
now to develop to degree before you go
into a boot camp
yeah so I mean basically what I traded
college for other than my happiness was
and oh yeah I was basically paying
$1,000 for a worse udemy course it's
what I really pissed me off but uh you
should always be be learning and so this
year it was supposed to be college and
that didn't work out so I'm doing books
and I'm writing a book as well as I plan
to go to some conferences this year as
well as launch my very first web
application so that's kind of where my
learning path is for the year basic
coding knowledge would be things like
knowing how if statements work for loops
operators you know plus minus multiply
modulo knowing knowing how to you
knowing array methods doing string
methods and be able to work with those
that would I'm piece consider basic
coding knowledge I use the bathroom real
quick that's I'll be right back
oh hey cuz I don't wanna and super
hammered uh let's see here
I use four oh yeah I'm thinking
full-stack JavaScript
I've already started building the
front-end I need to build the the
back-office part of it what are you
talking about Kevin how do you apply to
use mine
I don't you talk about two dollars
setting virtual high five well hi - I
appreciate that coding connections thank
you so much for the support and thank
you for the active comments on the
videos but I know I don't comment on
everybody's everybody's comment I just
don't have the time anymore but I do
read all the comments and so I
appreciate your you're very vocal
support of the channel coding
connections when he has a video that he
likes is excellent knowledge you know I
appreciate you saying that
keep keep up the good work basically and
I appreciate that very much so I do see
that and do read that dev has afraid you
have to explain a little bit more to me
what that means essentially to use right
now music spearmint
I'll have the beard yet it do you guys
want to see a little preview for
Monday's maybe back maybe I can hook you
up a little something-something just a
screenshot if you will I don't see I can
show you a little screenshot of the dole
on video will muted though you don't get
to hear the audio no audio I'll give you
a little like ten seconds little
something-something let's see here
alright just cause we're boys alright so
do the intro
it's a collab no ILO Esav so you got
yatta our boy Ricky interviewing Dolan
it's gonna be exciting yeah that's all
you guys you just get a little tease
it's a little teaser it's gonna be lit
though I assure you so it's a it's a
two-part interview it's a two-part
interview we're part ones on my channel
part two is on his channel and and
they're they're being released at the
same time so 6:00 a.m. on Monday so
enjoy that it is I let me tell you man I
didn't know so Ricky did all the editing
right Ricky did all the editing and he
send it back to me I thought oh I'm just
gonna he's sending back the clips I'll
put it up but he sent it back perfectly
edited with the green screen and
everything and I kid you not I have
watched it probably five times
sissie sent it to me on Monday like once
a day just busting up I I was dying
laughing I haven't seen part two yet
either I'm dying for Monday to see part
two on his channel like I haven't even
seen it and I I'm so excited to see
what's doing uh main philosophy I think
it's about getting that cheddar and
getting that bread alright so the video
is titled so the video is titled the
highest-paid full-stack wyx developer
part one the cheddar and then on Ricky's
channels the highest-paid full-stack
wix2 Vella per part to the bread that's
that's that's the that's the name of the
the
the two-part series um but I'll be it'll
be good it was a lot of fun do you guys
see the the Dolan quote generator by the
way um let's give some love out to to
you guys for making these things man
oh I shared it on the community page but
I don't know how many people actually
see that stuff uh that was pretty solid
as well that was kind of funny so if you
go to you know I'll just bring it up
share the screen one more time this was
this all those things we talk about
unique projects all the time and like
even if you are at a point where all you
can do is all you can do is like a
random quote generator at least make it
unique right so this is the this is the
Dolan quote quote erratic so it's like
stacking those gains so you know nothing
that's that
my favorite thing is the detail right so
the background the the accounts useful
links no account no github no portfolio
just American code this sort of stuff
couch city couch phone oh yeah so you
know what the D indolence for deep money
so this is someone's little project
which is kind of funny but it's also a
lot of fun right where now you could
showcase your skill annual showcase
personality and communication skill and
all that sort of stuff as you're working
on these things but it's state it's a
very fun spin on a not very unique
project in terms of you know rant it's
essentially a random quote generator
with memes and we all love memes so you
know if you are finding or so
that you're not quite ready to start a
massive web application just keep in
mind that you come you can take a unique
spin on a pre-existing project like that
and be very successful with it al Qaeda
Oh w and I see and I see you too man
thank you
just don't do i or don't I have a
Twitter I have a Twitter I don't really
use it it just sort of spans my videos
out whenever anyone goes on me I check
it yeah ha fatlings it's what happens
when you work too much when then brace
is coming off soon dude my last I'm at
10 months and they told me ten months so
I think this coming month or the next
month hopefully sooner than later cuz
I'm ready I'm ready
I want them off not much longer please
some company is off of that here in
Germany and I know that you visit school
half the time than you work in-house oh
yeah I'm not too familiar with that um
dress we're about to hit 40k by the way
that's pretty exciting
I mean how close are we to 40k right now
I mean it's not a hundred K the dream
under Kade the dream right we got to
pick up momentum quite a bit to hit
okay the dream this year we had a really
good month last month and I gained
almost 3000 subscribers this month we're
back down to around 2000 which is where
where we're at I knew you guys start
sharing these videos alright know it to
a hundred thousand by the end of year
that's like my goal I'm not the way that
I'm going to try and get there is
through collaborations guesting on
people's channel being going from there
