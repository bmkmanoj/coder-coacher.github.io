to do a quick little video i'll let you
know if you didn't know that i actually
have a website its coding tutorials
360.com couple things on there um but
it's all built out in angular it started
off as my first attempt at angular kind
of my first real project if you will um
you have access to all my social media
so my youtube obviously instagram
facebook github linkedin i have to
really update my github so it's not much
on there then we do something the
YouTube API this basically shows most
recent video it's a little bugged right
now scheduled videos messes with this
little bit then you have some patreon
paypal if you want donate if you want
support channel wish list the things I
eventually want to get for the channel
some are really expensive so I expect
anything for their then we have the
again the YouTube API with our most
recent subscribers the lifetime used
total videos that are public 308 um yeah
a little quick about me section just a
you know current little quick
description background not the too fancy
the store for those of you don't know
this kind of a little something i did to
kind of try and raise money for the
store and eventually if we get big
enough i'll probably expand this but all
that's here right now is basically you
get two of these laptop stickers as you
can see there we go go on laptop if you
want to support its 245 strippin's
included basically a cool little thing
to kind of spread some love out there
and support me in trying to get the
content up to 4k that's really what the
this is a little bit about we're trying
to I want to get a new 4k monitor and
graphics card to handle that so that we
can do our future videos and 4k and
eventually we'll get there but that's
really where the store came just five
bucks and then this is something a page
I made today from mini I've got about
three or four emails and one or two
tweets about tutoring if I was
interested in tutoring
I do work full time as a developer so it
is something I'm pretty qualified for
and but even before I was a developer I
I was tutoring in code for some middle
school a middle school girl and
elementary school girl believe it or not
so uh if you're interested in that we
can do one-on-one tutoring we can work
through sections of a website a lot of
times people get stuck on Codecademy
your free code camp we can work through
that and if because not especially as a
student and someone who's trying to code
you may not have money so if you want to
do some group tutoring that's an option
also um it's basically fifty dollars an
hour and it all goes towards the channel
in going towards that 4k dream you can
either reserve a session just by paypal
lling it or emailing me directly if you
have questions or tweeting me on twitter
as well um but yeah I mean it's just
something I wanted to say I really just
put this up because I got a couple
emails and I thought if people are
interested let's use this as a way to
creating better content moving forward
but I hope you guys enjoy this I'll be
adding to my website periodically and
this is just something I want to share
with you and if you wanna if that's
something you're interested in
one-on-one tutoring or course
walkthroughs or group tutoring there's
that option for you as well but if not I
completely understand it thank you guys
all for watching the videos and
subscribing and sharing I appreciate all
the love and I'll continue putting out
content non-stop as I have but i'll see
you guys the next video and thanks for
watching thanks for watching the video
special thanks to our sponsor dev
mountain definitely check them out at
dev mountain calm if you're looking for

next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
