control flow I was trying to declare
variable that didn't exist so basically
we just need something that evaluates to
true so we're gonna say if 1 is equal to
actually we can say if true is equal to
true we want it to trance this is true
make sure to use the end call the end of
it
Oh make sure you use double equals
because we're not setting that we're
checking the value let's actually see if
because we're not fully power I'm not
fully sure if this will work without end
ok we got to use and at the end of this
evil here we go
next lesson now we're gonna use else I
also want to print this is false we
could actually say say else else I guess
not if else all right but so cool this
is true this is false
sorry next lesson we're gonna clean this
up on this one put period in so we're
going to use else--if else--if
this footfalls is equal to false and it
should work oh no either all right
simple enough we started you off in the
editor place two underscores that's
correct
unless statement goes on less I know you
unless it's unless like a while loop
let's see
all right so hungry is the boolean
variable I'm just gonna guess at that
same unless true
then we have to end it so this is saying
well false because hunger is equal to
false I'm writing Ruby programs now else
it would be true and that means it's
time to eat
alright so next we're gonna be making
comparisons got two variables answer is
true
and this false replaced the underscores
legal evils not equal to make is true
values true missiles to is not equal to
three and two it is greater than three
is false which
so this lesson three no two three on
three assaults and two is it's true
oh when she is not equal to my bet she's
not equal to three and I read
instructions not equal equal to so we go
true and false less than or greater than
just a few variables so looks like we're
just using a little bit of operators
here to get us to do our code we want
them all to evaluate to true so greater
than less them equal equal plus or equal
to and we'll say greater than or equal
to
so we just had to change that real quick
alright we'll show you these comparators
and you get each felt that very well
true or false finite value its tricks
expression to return so let's see I
would say this first test is false
because 77 is equal to 77 next test is
true because negative 4 is less than or
equal to negative 4 negative 44 is less
than negative 33 is true and 100 is
equal to 1000
ok cool so we'll share this because we
want everyone to code as much as
possible in life all right so the next
thing we have going here are some looks
like and boolean searing so double and
Sun check out the blending expression
set each fair a little true or false for
any one value affects the expression he
returned so 77 is less than 78 is true
and 77 is less than 77 is false so the
whole thing is false true and 100 is
greater than or equal to 100 so that's
true and we say 2 to the third is
exactly equal to 8 2 times 2 is 4 or 4
times 2 is 8
all right and 3 to the second power is
exactly equal to minus is true so it
should be false true true cool move on
to the next one senator will it true or
false for me what value you expect so
and here we're going to be using or
meaning only one side has to be correct
for this to be it go true and it looks
like the I forget the technical name of
Alliance the double lines is or so 2/3
is not sandwich 3
so true so I a is not equal but they're
both three on this case so next one
false or negative 10 is greater than
negative 9 it's false so those false
false or false also so be cheerful so
cool now we're using nopt basically it's
exclamation point that makes whatever it
is the opposite so in this case not true
is false not true and not true is false
but not sure is false not your and not
your sauce 700 divided by 10 is 0 7 not
true not true all right so not true at
all all right cool last one and this one
we're using we're going to be combining
boolean operators this is really good
just for a if statements basically um C
3 is less than 4 is true false one false
entry right so true or false and false
or true if this is going to be false if
it both the same so this is false is
this true or false and this is and false
or true actually I'm going to get true
because they're both true or false true
or false so not true so false and not
true this is true
sorry Hill one thing here and then true
or not true or false
so I put true this is false and false or
I guess I felt that leave your false
that would be false in London so let me
take a second for lecture you learn so
we used if else else if you use
computers and rational operators and
then we use boolean logic and or not
let's see this next section create an
if-else statement and that or make sure
to include at least one that fails if 1
is greater than 2 print whoops one is
greater than two else else uselessness I
so this should work
oh and then of course we have to end it
there we go
and finally but not last
let's see unless
please example hungry equals false
hungry hungry my jack you saw hungry
you're all you'll see here and then we
have to end it go dare to compare let's
see here okay
so this test should be false just get a
little complicated we'll do two to the
third which is 8 it's exactly equal to 7
now I'll do
so actually we don't need the brackets
here exciting make it all that
complicated so this is say 2 greater
than or equal to 3 and then here we'll 6
by this less than or equal to 5 so we
should get false false true cool last
section billions of balloons
alright so they want to use and so we'll
just do something simple true and true
use true say 1 is equal to 2 not true or
1 is equal to 1 which is true I should
return true
well then we'll say 1 is not equal to 1
nice we're gonna share it and that
completes the control flow Ruby also
says it's gonna help you with your
if-else statements and so make your 4
loops while loops which are unless here
next session we'll be getting into is by
death for this meaneth war pretty
intense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
