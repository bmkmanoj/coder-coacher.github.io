in coat fights in the dark wilderness
growing plant of the intersection so
what is are we tasked with here
essentially this scenario is we are
trying to track how tall a plant grows
every night from the sunlight that would
be our up speed and then we're also
tracking how much it decreases every
night that's the down speed as well as
the height we're trying to get to the
way I did this was I just kept a
variable called total height and then
they I created a wall loop that added a
day as well as added the total height
based off of the up speed and an if
statement to make sure that the once we
hit that desired height it broke the
loop Exedra etc so pretty
straightforward so let's go ahead and
get started so we'll start with let
total height equals zero again this is
going to be our basically our count
element that's going to keep track of
what we're trying to find here then
we're going to event day's element as
well this is red day's variable and in
here we're going to have our wall loop
and so while our total height is less
than our desired height or continue
running our loop you know each iteration
the first thing we want to do is we want
to add one to the day the next thing
that we want to do is we want to take
total height and we want to add our up
speed to it now one thing that threw me
for a loop was after that I did the the
down speed but what would happen is in
certain use cases where the down speed
made enough of a difference to kick you
out of your desired height issue it
would really ruin
so how I solved that was I created an if
statement that said hey if the total
height
is less than the desired height meaning
after we add our now total ad week after
we add to total height if it is greater
than our desired height we don't want it
to
- anything because I want it to exit the
loop but if it's not go ahead and -
whatever our down speed is and at the
end here all we have to do is return
days most of the hardest part is just
making sure that for the most part if
you've gotten this part this one should
be a pretty easy one the desired height
toll hike - now see this is probably the
SIS statement it's the only way and
there's that I was trying to think of a
different way to doing this because I
thought maybe there was a way to - after
in iteration I summers I couldn't think
of what I was trying to do there but I'm
pretty sure there is so you might be
able to get rid of this and just
subtracted a different fashion but as
always guys I don't know what my cats
are doing right now they're not hit
over but that's always going to thank
you so much for watching the video don't
forget to comment like subscribe and
share your solutions in the comments for
other people so they can see it and
learn and grow as I'm trying to do while
I do these things so I will see you guys
in the next video thank you so much for
watching
Oh Facebook page patreon and discord
channel links are all in the description
bye hey guys thanks for watching the
video especially thanks to our sponsors
dev Mountain if you look for a coding
boot camp where tuition and housing is
included definitely check them out
appreciate it and I'll see you guys in
the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
