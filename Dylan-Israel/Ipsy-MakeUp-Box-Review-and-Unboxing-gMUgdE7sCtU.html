well for her time pretending to be my
girlfriend in this video
okay guys we're gonna be talking about
the Ipsy makeup bag my girlfriend
ordered it and I thought you know let's
do a review of it just a quick thing
about it since you four to five samples
of products about a 50-dollar value they
say and 40 to 50 and it's ten dollars a
month that's with shipping and it goes
down even more to about nine dollars if
you order a year so let's check it out
hi guys um so this is me I got a haircut
uh and this is my girlfriend April you
talk to me and she's excited over there
FC baguette so you can see it's bright
pink it's not an Ipsy bag other element
should be called they call it an Ipsy
box so when I got it in the mail and it
wasn't in a box i will take it back but
what gave it away was there was a
totally bright pink package which I was
totally excited about alright so let's
open it up favorite okay I'm opening it
up because I haven't come today yet
alright alright so shown what we got
here we got two cards this one says win
a one-year subscription to the glam bag
oh this one is a invitation to like an
Ipsy event on May 30th 31st at LA live
it's some sort of make it look a $75 any
I'm gonna go 75 bucks ago this thing
special offer 75 the I hear that
okay wait wait this is the Ipsy bag this
is or April I already took like a glam
test for my personality and what I'm
looking for in makeup um the main thing
that I told them was that i'm looking to
experiment with makeup because i'm not
really a makeup artist or really into
makeup but i'd like to be a little bit
more proficient i would ideal already
know so okay can I just say I don't know
anything about makeup bags but this to
me looks almost like a purse except so
like I already like the value of the
just as a man because I could see myself
buying something like this for her if I
was on like a trip to go see my brother
or something is really are like a little
person like the little one I use today
oh I get it but I'm not a song where I'm
wrong like this I don't like it I don't
like this channel like what blast this
is getting recasted oh yeah so inside to
make a we have ok I want to go for a
song something called hi Cara tango
color by the ingredient what do you
think it is before you open it it says
blush oh so wait wait well let's do the
colors I mean colors in partnering i
reek this open no I hear you you know
how I am about packaging I this up so
why we're waiting let's see what else we
got here we have some L'Oreal Parker I
think this is lipstick know what is it
not lipstick huh whatever you think is
that's what it that's not where sir just
use your imagination okay oh I like this
that's pretty bright if the goal is to
be adventurous tango is the way to go I
don't know it's like a it's like a
bright warned you pink what do you do
like it um I don't give it a try uh this
is a little bit brighter than I normally
used to I normally stay towards the
peach beige kind of warmer colors like I
said I'm not big on makeup so I couldn't
really tell you what this is really good
for but I'm hoping that if she will turn
me into a master alright so for the
l'oreal park rest completely wrong it's
looks like it's some sort of fragrance I
mean it's like I look like much on
camera but like when you open show me
strongly nice just feels like every
other perfume movie it smells
dead it like a sweet spicy smell sweet
i'm i'm excited to try it out
okay uh first thing I notice is there's
soap for some reason it's a new dude on
it it is a mini nude eyeshadow I don't
know what that means um I think it's one
of those new retro makeup PR people and
this is an eyeshadow and this is more of
the color palette that I like to work
with which is the beige bronze metallic
colors I really like those colors
especially on my skin tone so this is a
good one this is a good one I like this
look I'm keeping us ok the next thing I
see is something called star looks and
it looks like it has some glitter like
glue in it and i'm going to guess this
is like you put it on your skin like you
know like girls put glitter on their
breasts is this just like this is yes
this is actually for your nipples no
it's not you put it on your nipples all
right oh and it what is it actually its
lip gloss lip gloss I was close who and
skinless lips her skin I'm not big on
lip gloss I love a chapstick girl myself
um plus he doesn't like to kiss me with
lip gloss cuz he just whines about it
whatever we're not gonna go there um
this is a nice color so is this a good
rule in air battle this is a bad one for
me I'm totally regifting this hmm you
shouldn't show some interest it
should've shown plain and boring and you
get five items you like well maybe I'll
try it hi last but not least we have
something called hey honey good morning
honey silk facial serum all day
nourishing I know for a fact that she's
gonna like this cuz this is something I
every girl is blistered skin and this is
somehow going to make their skin young
and rejuvenated and better looking so do
you like this I actually do you're like
this I really excited about this yeah um
this is a win for me I love serums I'm
all about serums I don't really know why
harris terms facial serum anything serum
I'm like yeah so I hope this really
works out I'll let you guys know how it
is next time alright so just go over
real quick we got I'd say we got three
yeses 2 i'm still not that adventurous
on ordered the adventurous pack so of
course we got the serum we just talked
about which is good we got a fragrance
from l'oreal alright cool nice little
ball roll that on some nude dude was
that Loria they say it's joelle park
Joelle Parker Laura I thought thing we
got and these are the two more
adventurous color so was this good blush
yeah the tango blush and the start
Brooks lip gloss on top of me you get a
nice little back I really like the bag
like if they could make this in a mince
wallet with a little less maybe purple
and orange i'd be down um so what would
you say did you for ten bucks you happy
with what you got uh for ten dollars I
think the perfume and the serum and
these three unfortunately three small
things for ten dollars I'm okay with
that yeah yeah and then you got a bag
unless on top of it I shot that so for
us so this is definitely a good deal
y'all know expensive support is as you
