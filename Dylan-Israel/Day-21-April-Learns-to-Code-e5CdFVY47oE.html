this is short at twenty seven-year-old
looks like you know the 30 look I'm not
 30 well let someone tell me
today I like 24
he also don't want it oh is it a woman
yeah he also is the gentleman I in the
past day yeah this anyhow
all right yeah he wanted it I'm down
here alright so here we are uh yesterday
we had a rough day we're back on track
today I posted prior as I posted that
video this is like people anything on
the monster so yeah we do every oh yeah
yeah I did do it for you I just wanted
people thing I want monster it just
worked out that you were right on like
recording hey guys so um up on the left
hand screen here we have a cheat sheet
to help April out with what we were this
is not basic that is this is basically
is where you get you know coding welcome
welcome I feel like you're always on
Twitch man like that yes alright so um
this is what I know what is this
remember bracket notation how to call a
function a function call a method call
which is a similar an array an object so
Walter White we've got a celebrity in
here today alright so uh this is your
cheat sheet it's the simplest one I
could find everything else would just be
names the things I want to help you it's
going to be I add the Kappa all right so
let me let me see what you went over
today I got pulled up on coke at me
so today April's been having an issue
retaining what she's been doing so we
decided to downgrade to code Academy I
say downgrade just because I I think you
got you got injured you got two
variables what you get two in here yes I
did the first two on that one and then I
did the first one on JavaScript
okay so you got introduction JavaScript
and variable Sun let's ah and also
JavaScript or think we're not counting
someone no because that one was the
hardest
yes I want to count it so let's see what
is in here
it went over a lot of weight yeah
all right so types let's start here I'm
willing to look at what's on here and I
already know it's in here without
looking at it so write all the types
that
okay so bricks tcv CI so we have the
string
not numbers number sing good and
whatever what are we leaving out imagine
a coin flip is how I explain it usually
this is a bull beam yep believe me Louie
lean lean I follow the substitute to see
a movie
all right so types good now how do we
print something out in the console you
got trained Lewis anyway so love
it
all right so how do we print something
out what's what's the function call
all right and what say if say I wanted
to print out Dylan how would I do that
do you have a variable or is it just
just Dylan you pass it in directly so
what do we what do we call this when we
are passing something into a function
what are we supposed to work for that
we're passing in an argument but that
for the parameter argument is Dylan the
parameter let's say it was like numb or
something like that
surpassing then that value you just said
argument
I said yeah the argument gets passed
into the parameter so Dylan is the
argument and the parameter would be
where that functions written log there
is a there is a parameter that could be
maybe we called string value or
something like that in the parameter to
the parameter
all right so future April necessary
parameter part cool all right so so
that's how we can select math operators
whatever our math operators forget in
you here
good those are the basic once perfect I
believe there's more so what is this
last one do gives you the remind ah good
so if I say ten module of seven what do
we have with our answer ten modulo 7 is
equal to one
what is it turn
modulo 7 I don't know how the computer
on it gives us the room is that you're
just so remainder so what what's our
value
where's don't give us for tray 710 three
[Laughter]
all right so good so you got the modulo
waiting all my answers whoo
alright now what is a random do
how does random work uh random math
thought random yeah so you can do math
dot random
but you can also do
oh my god my back
I remember that right so that looks like
all right so what does math dot random
do that generates a random number from
zero to one good so you know what math
dot random do is mapped off Florida
gives you a whole can't give you a whole
number yes I mean it can
well you it can go as many decimal
places as you
provide a parameter into it so maybe you
want you know yes it gives you whole
number sure
all right so good I'm so you're
remembering some of this how do you
clean the erasers
anyone know how to clean an eraser
alright so show me a single line comment
and a multi-line comment today she is
working on the we're doing review to
start off and then we're going to push
on the other thing so we've changed our
learning pattern usually I would do a
lesson and then she would go and
studying now she is studying beforehand
she's working on the learn JavaScript
section a code Academy the free code
camp section was a little bit too hard a
little bit too much so now we're we're
jumping back to coke atom e changing it
up good so you have multi-line comment
single line comment what why might we
use Commons provides some context this
is to denote your attention your in text
yeah this is to block out code if you're
trying to yes anger you can do that you
do both let's please so usually you
might want to put a comment single or
multi line to say what your intention is
or to save some code that you don't
erase
show your water in order clean life
where that sounds like Oh
troll alright um so good that was the
first section he didn't use it excellent
love so let me look at the variable to
see what the the headings are here now
did you have any questions while you
were going through this just the if-else
statement I'm still struggling with that
one but that wasn't all the two ones
that I did it was on the JavaScript oh
okay so so when dealing with if and else
statements what that does it's called
control flow it essentially controls the
flow of your code so you know how we
said your code goes from top to bottom
it does but what happens is is that when
it hits a line that has an if statement
or something like that it evaluates that
statement decides if it's going to jump
out of its normal flow and skip over it
okay so I don't understand the logic
inside of them okay so let me give you
an example so what's what's the point of
an if statement a start thing do you
know
the point of an if statement is to find
out if something is true or false and
then we run code based off of that so if
I say let's use uh let's use a to
evaluate a true or false statement its
evaluate a statement that will evaluate
to true or false
so but in this case let's take a coin
flip right so if we flip a coin
typically we don't have a point in this
whole house
Minna might be all right let me get a
coin
all right so I have a porter here
all right so what happens here is let's
start off my cranium variable how do we
create a very tall bar
all right that's the keyword now what
that's the keyword this is the keyword
okay
then the name name we'll call it a
quarter coin coins better shorter coin
and what do you want to set coin to tip
so that the set is to something in a
second this is bad notation we wouldn't
have this well do this well create we'll
leave it undefined so we're creating it
but it's undefined right now and what
we're going to say is I will say line
one we'll skip line two and it will say
line three and we'll say credit if
statement says if coin is equaled equals
equals to head run some logic and run
what's in between here and here and
we'll say this is like four and line
five so and we'll say well we'll print
it out right
Kampala will console.log it out on line
two we'll assign a value of point notice
how we don't have the keyword yeah
because it's already stored and let's
assume that we're getting this from the
user input now if we flip a coin
and it's taeil's we assign the value of
coin to tails so what happens when the
if statement here evaluates hey is coin
equal equals equals the heads no false
right off so does it run the console.log
no does it run anything in here not yet
no it was in the console log age
all right so the reason that if
statements exists is because it adds
logic to your code it adds a way of your
code flowing because all your computer
knows how to do is run top to bottom and
when it's running top to bottom and it
hits this line it needs to say hey we
get you're going to top to bottom but do
you want to run everything top to bottom
if we wanted to console.log H every time
we want need a if statement if we wanted
to add two numbers together every time
we would need a statement
so it's add logic to our code and then
same thing with the else if and the else
so what what how would say where you
wanted to use an else if ur an else with
our logic we have here in our heads it's
heads or its tails so what do we do four
would be the best way of doing tails
Ellis good now why why would be doing an
if statement or an else if B bad it
would still work but why why would this
this would be no ser why would it would
still work logically and the code would
run and it would work but why would it
be bad convention because you're not
evaluating a statement anymore
you already know as well yeah because if
it's not true here it has to be false
meaning it's tails so we can go ahead
and write an else statement print it out
now we could write LC if they say else
if equal equals details but that would
require it to evaluate it's bad
convention it probably run slower in the
background but this is why we have if
else if and else because we need to
apply our logic to that because the
computer only knows what to do top to
bottom so now we're kind of getting into
jump around and run things sometimes
instead of running everything always
okay so let's let's take it up one more
I'll give you another example here all
right I'll give you I'll give you an
example and you can see if you can
figure it out
oh go ahead don't do that all right
um so is the best time ever
alright so here we have three essential
oils see the trip guys
we have three essential oils so let's
assume that we're going to get an input
what do you want to call it call our
variable good and we'll assign a value
off the get-go
sign is clear is the value no you just
put oil one sounding this you know I
cool
so what would happen what do we have so
far we have oil one now using using them
we have three oils oil one oil 2 and oil
3 and the user I'm telling you hey I
want this oil now how what would be
using the if-else control flow
statements the best way of writing that
I just want you to tell me back what oil
I request it I want to tell me all the
oil it's just the one that I told you I
want which is in this case oil one
oh okay if you just want that then we
use do a console.log oil one yes I'm
trying to talk about here for else yes
alright I how would this um I want it to
say back to me are you sure you want
I'll one not oil two and three are you
sure you want to not oil one and three
okay so this is where I get tripped up
all right so
oil is the value that's our placeholder
right that's what's that's the parameter
that's coming in this indicates the
number one if you remember from
yesterday so what are we checking here
we're checking the value of oil what
value is it are we checking oil 100 L to
oil three it doesn't matter however you
want to set it up but we're checking to
see for each one of our oils using an if
else if and else and we're turning a
different value
kind of put console.log right here
yes business within the scope right even
though you have an ended the scope and
you can just you can just write
console.log you don't have to return
we'll just you have to actually write
the stuff in there for the six-bed
logging road so we'll just assume you
can put dollar in there for the time
triple equals in JavaScript means so
there is double equals which is the
value equivalent saying hey is this
value is the value of the variable
correct so let's use a number so we'll
say value five value number five so if
that's a string five is true if it's a
number five it's true now if you use
triple equals what that is checking is
type and value so in that case if we
were to say number five is equal to is
triple equals to string five it would
return false because even though the
value is the same the type is incorrect
that's what triple equals is therefore
it's just good convention to use it in
general I'll look at you you're trying
to show out
all right so there is one thing wrong
with your code up here I'm giving it
somewhere between line 1 and line for
care was undefined I think it's right
here
all right so read read over your code
start going line by line because is it
this is what happened earlier when I
sell pin you you mean you need to start
being able to supply your own bucks or
you're gonna have a real hard time
learning code so go line one what do we
know about setting up variables hard so
you need the variable which is the
keyword
the name oil and then you can give it a
value oil one okay that's and of them
good so no oil exists so if oil so what
if we're checking a statement right
that's going to evaluate to true or
false good yeah now let's say that we
wanted to we wanted two other cases so
we did case one oil one and then there's
a little two in oil three would be the
natural progression to continue on from
there
I'm gonna be NFL's there's no such thing
as therefore I'll tell Elsa why because
it would need to evaluate again okay
because I wouldn't be a true it would be
true or false when you have three
there's something going on in my brain
but I'm not like that so I said that the
object of my instructions is the
objective of my instructions is I want
to print one thing out for each value so
if it's oil one I only want one print if
it's oil to I want to separate all those
three on another so based off that how
might you write your logic using an if
else if or else why because I would need
to evaluate it again okay but why not
use an if good because what's going to
happen if so if this fails what happens
if this is true it prints this out if
this is an if it's still going to check
it right right so instead our code runs
faster by using elsif that we don't have
to check so we don't have to check this
again yeah so let's say this is oil one
and we were to write an if if oil is
equal to L 2 instead of Elsa it would
actually run that if statement again to
check it
oh that if this was true and still run
this if it's an entertainment yes so
based off our instructions and that's
okay if that's what you want to do but
based off our instructions and the
reason for it there's no reason to do
that okay okay so let's do our else--if
we're gonna have a fun one next baby
we're gonna do boolean comparison
operators all the goodness okay
so else if
what do you want to say nothing we'll
just assume that you're doing here and
so what would we will just put dot dot
dot and we'll assume that you put some
like similar see his you did good you
can catenate it yourself what's good
catenate me put together yes so you can
catenate streams just like that good so
so here's a question for you okay so
good so explain to me why use an if and
else if and then a house okay so the
first one because of your requests you
want a new I only want one print out a
new program no I just want the one print
out when the value comes in I don't want
to have to check all the code I think I
just said why you did that
okay ah all right you get why you did
yeah well you saying that you saying
that I want it to run through one code
for whatever I put in makes me say that
okay if that's the case then I can only
have one statement evaluated at a time
for whatever you put in thus for good
convention you use the if and if you put
in a statement that doesn't comply with
my first if statement I'm going to need
a new statement so then I would use the
alt s statement to be evaluated
and since there's only three oils that I
can use to evaluate I can add my last
one in for an elf if these two are not
true and so if what was what would else
be in this case it would be what would
all be in the else case good all right
let's see if I can find a chart
I love so what's today's lesson we are
reviewing things until they start
clicking and now I'm going to give her a
pseudo maths quiz with billions I
suppose
so what's the boolean again good and now
we're going to work with operators so
I'm going to write a couple things and
was so
per bullet show
all right here we have six things
testing if you understand comparison
operators the first one says bring
yourself Lotus if you would see yellow
orange socks on there is is true equal
equal to trip in this case
true double equals the truth stranger
stranger you see you can see Emily you
can see yeah so is that true or false
okay it's true not equals to stranger oh
good good as it is right well that's a
signing of value
No
not equals
signing values with the equals is the
assignment operator you assign values
equal what is that not equals not equals
job I thought that was part of the true
word
so is true not equals to string true
no it's true false
which one
was that in spots because is equal good
so is true triple equals the trip okay
good
now is true not equals equals to false
why is it true because the sign good and
it's false not equals equals to true
and finally is false not equals equals
to false
good yeah they we're in the process of
packing up and move it so things are a
little messy here guys I apologize
because a really is to clean the
self
hi good so let's look at what else you
covered today
um
so we did else if statements logical
operators draw me a switch statement did
switch statements
don't look at the switch statement no I
mean we decided that I could get cheat
you go back because I don't remember the
switch statements this is five fun I
know we've been going up weird guys
we're doing JavaScript we've been doing
JavaScript for 20 days we're all ready
to switch over to five on cool beans
what's up man alright so what is the
switch statement do let's start there
before you sir I'm in the same sections
that you said you did today which is the
first two sections of learn JavaScript
thank someone got caught in a lie no I
did the first two where's yours
the one that you brought up yeah I did
those okay well I should check out you
won't work won't worry later about the
Swiss shame yeah mm-hmm all right baby
so we'll say that's good for the review
um I live in Washington now man although
maybe one day it's my brother loose he's
gonna live in Portland Oregon or maybe
Sierra Leone where the hands up so
we're going in please uh okay
do you remember functions
write down how you think you did you to
find a function we're gonna the function
can be called ad we're gonna add two
variables just like we did before
okay so what is that you worry okay so
what what do we normally what normally
comes after the keyword we're into
finding things good I mean good so we'll
call it ad
what is what contains the parameters oh
no no we don't we're not assigning a
value to function we are creating a
function almost so there were functions
what if functions do again
function store our code so that we can
call it again later
so it's one of the ways we make sure
real hard code things yeah and that we
can rewrite exactly just like my charm
every day I'd be charming you see you
going
thank you one she appreciates you saying
happy birthday
alright guys um I grab the lid don't
worry
somebody I bought the markers and I
should say good yeah right you never
make sure but thank you one okay so this
is how you set up a function these are
optional and what do we call these in
good program manners and why do we have
our curly braces why do we have why do
we have one with their statements
is that it defines an area where it runs
defines the scope oh sorry
so
this defines the scope just like the if
statement defined scope just like the
for loop oh yes you just refer to a
disco there's scope there's local scope
and there's the lone wolf okay well in
your scopes
there's function scope and there's block
scope also really is this a function
scope yes whatever first variables how
variables are floated so there's a bar
if you want to get into it the bar let
cons the VARs what we're working with
cuz I cs5 that's called function scope
so those values will get hoisted get
hoisted to where it is in the function
so the reason but will you let is it for
first two blocks cut meaning it will
only take place in the block just well
say there's a block right here and we
use a let let will be here but if we use
bar inside here it'll actually be a
building down below it as well so that
is why a lot of yes in es6 let came
around and the constants from basically
creating constant variables even though
it's not a full almost constant a how
this SI garner their teacher about
callbacks and promises I'm over here
explaining functions I don't think we're
ready to start jumping in on this is
called ah that's also promising a
callback promise
Oh Oh all day so we have our function at
keyword name optional parameters in the
scope of our function how do we call a
function or we want to use the function
we want to call it what how do we do
that how are you say do we use a
console.log know that prints stuff how
do you call function do you know what it
means to call a function it means we use
the function so similar to how we use a
variable which is said to write its name
so if the function has these parentheses
after at which point you could pass in
some parameters yeah so we can call it
again that wouldn't be inside this scope
yeah
no no it wouldn't this is separate
imagine this is on line below that so if
I said hey I have this add function and
I all I wanted to do is add two numbers
what do we do to do that
pass on
no this is just a one in a to being past
it you have parameter one o plus
parameter I want you to return
uh so how do we return values Oh
good
all right so let's take it up a notch
I'm gonna no no we don't have to okay
let's see what you got
all right it should be review because
I'm doing the same exact problem we've
done a couple days in a row man uh-huh
so
instead of passing in two numbers I want
to pass in an array two numbers which is
three and four how do we change our
function so that it works with that and
we change the setup of the function as
well so how do we change it
I think
yes it's right where does my erase this
no way
so what do we have to change about the
setup of our array not just what's in it
we change the setup how many parameters
we have in here say oh how many
parameters do we have in here one it's
just a single array so how many
parameters should we have in our
function so how many parameters do we
have here
okay so what it what is this all right
how do we access values in a race 3-0
with indexes so what's next
what index is this yeah what index is
this mine so knowing that how do we fix
our add function
No ah that's not how this works I so
love it what are these whatever prank
what's the point of parameters they're
placeholders so they hold the value for
something that doesn't exist yet until
we pass it in so this is our argument
the 3/4 argument so we need a
placeholder so in in in yesterday's
example it was my array placeholder so
that we can access the three and the
four eight when we call it we put a
value into it when we are defining the
function it is a placeholder okay so so
this should be in here
what
wait so this could just be a that could
just be a it could be anything as long
as it's not another keyword okay okay so
now how do we add these two values from
the array knowing what we know now
you know I forget how do you access
array indexes I forget what is it what
are these this defines array now how do
we access our array from May next year
on the next one
remember this is our array this is
jumping into here a has the value of
array 3 &amp;amp; 4 so we have to use a this is
where we're getting the value yeah
goes sure it's so the way that you get
it is use the bracket notation we're
bracket notation
you know man I need a barrel coffee a
day I don't know if that's for me or her
doesn't the barrel of coffee okay so
what are we forgetting here in our
return statement we need to end our
returns with a semicolon
okay cool
so was this keyword what is this Nate
was this parameter what are we doing
here giving parameter value correct but
what is this whole thing doing we are
calling a function calling a function
and what what is this value called that
goes into the parameter starts with an a
it's not array
clothes still say it's not a ray wasn't
a trick statement its arguments these
are the arguments that go into the
parameter okay all right so what does
return to
um
prints out doesn't pronounce know
exactly what it sounds like it returns
this value and so in our example here if
we were to blow say var add eggs and a
DX is equal to add function and we put
one into this case what is the value of
a DX and function we're passing in so
we're calling the function and what is
the function do it calculates the value
of a0 and a1 yeah and it sets it to a DX
because we're returning that value
returning returning returning so we're
returning this value returned is
returning this
so a DX we're calling a function that
does what it adds two numbers together
from the array so what is the value of
our variable here say that again so
we're creating a variable we're sending
equal to the call of the function we
just defined sorry I was Milo distracted
okay so we're creating we have our
function what's our function here do
let's start there it takes in an array
and it does what with it it returns
whatever habits it to okay it returns
the the combination of a zero and a one
do you know what it means that return
sends a back it takes this value so in
this case here it's one and two and it
sends it back to wherever you called it
in this case we're saying the value of
the variable equal to it so when we call
this is a new variable yes and we're at
X this is the new variable that gets
this return
this so we're calling the function and
when we call it work on the function
we're not getting that anymore we're
getting this this is a new cult forget
about this one this one we don't care
about that one all we care about is a DX
what's a DX so it's equal to the return
of this
yes it's equal to search or and the so
in our example here where we have array
1 &amp;amp; 2
what is what is a DX when we call that
function at its this okay what is that
value
what is that value
it's an array of
so what is a DX
why because it's returning this value to
here so that's the new add value and
then you're adding this to it as well no
no there is there is no new add value
this is not a this is not a variable
this is a function
the what's getting returned baby is this
is not returning it to add it's
returning into the variable here so when
I say if I were to add so7 is getting
push down to here what is seven seven is
the original value that you gave this
that was it zero and one all right
hey you're miss understand you're making
crazy jumps right so all right so let me
let me show you I'm going to call this
function and assume that we're setting
the variable that our won't the x1 is
equal to add with an array of one and
two okay and then we're going to create
another variable called ex2 and we're
set this equal to add three and five so
what you're saying is or what you think
is that when I call this function add
one and two it's going to return three
right right the x1 is equal to three
but based off what you're saying is this
is going to be 3 plus 8 and so x2 is
going to be 11 no it's not I'm saying
it's going to you next to each other I'm
going to add it because why would you
have it there's no infection at it so
what is the value of y x2 it's a new
value and what is that
it's whatever this is to this no no is
it I don't know how you're getting there
because an is getting a new value would
you put this between and five no three
here and then why don't I tell you is
add doesn't have a value this is a
placeholder so when we call the function
again this a is equal to 3 and the array
3 and 5 and all we're returning is 3
okay
wait wait okay so you're saying forget
it
yes yes okay so add function is about to
call the out the array the placeholder
the parameter right parameter and so our
variable x1 goes into this placeholder
oh and it gets returned with this
statement yes it sends back the value
right there sends back the value okay
now we have a value F x1 is 3 not at x1
is 3
yes but that is giving at its value
no it doesn't have a value baby that's
all I'm telling you is you're treating a
function as if it's a variable it's not
do something do you see an assignment
okay okay all right so so ex1 gets its
value which is 3
yes and they've done yes the x1 has a
value of 3 that's all that function did
when we called it so now when we give
another ex2 it's 2 and it has 3 &amp;amp; 5 5 it
gets its returned by
okay and then if you add another 1 X 3 X
3 it's a with a with an array in it 2
values what is it
give me 2 values 3 2 &amp;amp; 2 so what is e^x
3 good so it stops this is it this is
also happens the value goes right back
to its variable in this case because of
the return statement
that's what yes that's it that stops
that's it all this there's no there's no
break or nothing that just no return
exits on the function with this value
back to its variable yeah so imagine we
call this function this is saying hey
right here I'll draw out an origin here
or say hey this value is 0 and 2 that
goes into a we say okay a right now when
we call this is 0 &amp;amp; 2 and then we're
saying hey we want to add wanted to let
me say hey we want to add a 1 and a 2
and they say ok thanks and then we send
it back and we set the value of e x1
 hate algebra Pacific
I'm the Vanina alright so normally we
take questions at this point I want to
go over for loops
yeah I'm waiting for it to click you
guys
okay you want to go over for lips yes
your are for lips or do you want to hold
off do you want why don't let me let me
explain for loops to you in five minutes
and then because tomorrow session you'll
be going over for loops or do you want
to do it on your own tomorrow
now let's go okay so a for loop what's
the point of a for loop the point of a
for loop is to run some code between our
for loop scope as many times as we as
our statement is true so in our case
we'll create a sting well you're usually
it'll create an iterator start off at
zero in this case we'll say something
like while zero is less than three while
this is a true statement this is our
statement while this is true excuse me
while I is less than three okay so for
our for loop what is the for loop do
again it runs the code that's within its
scope right here within the curly braces
as many times as this statement is true
yes okay so for the for loop can go as
many times as it needs to not just four
times all this monkey is telling you to
stay chapter eighteen by the way yes yes
I keep meaning to and I keep running out
of time because I am prioritizing very
badly these days I plan to
okay so var is my variable and why do
why we create this too and you she
a volume or we've created to help keep
track of how many times we want our for
loop to run and then here we create a
statement using this value and then here
it says how many times we increase said
value because that gives us how many
times it goes through each iteration so
let's say all we wanted to do was
console dot log which does what again
prints okay
and so now first loop
what is this printing out to your room
cool second loop what is this printing
out third loop what is this printing out
hmm
fourth loop what is it printing out good
and then what happens so it doesn't
print out 3 because 2 is less than 3 but
3 is equal to 3 and then we continue on
with our code so tomorrow after you
continue on with your 4 loops we are
going to take that problem we had and
we're going to make it a little bit
harder using you're going to have to use
a for loop ok
all right guys oh man this is tiring for
me for some reason today uh how doesn't
doozy I'm just tired and burnt out all
right it's gotta leave a highlight of my
life here except on payday now all right
uh diverse any questions okay guys so uh
you doing better today we've been
studying this for we've been going over
the same stuff I'm hoping tomorrow that
you get the four loops on your that's
what I'm hoping
and so tomorrow's let's talk about what
I want you to do your work you're able
to accomplish basically what I ask now
you'll be in control flow although it
looks like you might have to finish up
variables you did this section veremos
yeah go click on it let me see it
this is on my account so you have to log
of yours so tomorrow what you do control
flow and functions and scope the very
first section ok functions and control
flow so James John says I have my first
freelance client not sure what to charge
also do you have any tips for me how
were you able to get a freelance client
without knowing when to charge is
usually money is the biggest indicator
well if it's your first man I would say
if you really want the business and the
hardest thing to do when you're just
starting out guys is get clients and
build a portfolio and there's a benefit
to you having a portfolio so if you can
charge relatively low for your first
client build that project out and add it
to your portfolio and then when they
come back to you and they need
additional help just tell them like if
you're able or if you are afraid of
losing a client don't do this but one
thing that I've done in the past is I
will increase my rates once I have a
couple of other clients be like hey the
$10 an hour at charge which is what I
charge some clients always put it this
claim
when you first set up your prices that
don't why because then they may not go
with you so I just explained to the hey
I'm charging twenty twenty-five an hour
thirty forty fifty dollars an hour but
my advice is is if it's really your
first client depending on the project as
well but if it's just like hey I just
want you do some web content management
or hey I just want you to build a simple
web page for me a lot of times on those
first clients they're going to want you
to charge a flat rate if anything so it
just depends on what your time is worth
and Denver it's right it's all about not
short-chain yourself I was always more
interested in building a portfolio and
getting experience which is lives
because that to me is significantly more
valuable if I have zero relevant resume
experience what I would like to have is
one relevant portfolio item and even
though maybe I got paid half what I
should have that item gives me a a lot
more do I give out business cards I have
business cards my work azzam has had
them made I can't if they're so dope
looking - I wish I could show them to
you they're very professional very nice
quality and everything it makes me look
really little box that it comes in is
very my dad took one home that was one
of the things or he was I could tell he
was impressed that I had a business card
he's like proof my son works yeah I know
I know I look like a degenerate and like
this gaming shirt and everything but I
have a real job I swear oh but um yeah I
wish I could show them to you business
cards are always a good idea but uh yeah
I mean it makes you look nicer and you
can get them relatively cheap you can
get like I think you get like a hundred
of them for like twenty bucks so if it's
something that would make you feel more
confident but in honestly most people
only use business cards to pick up
chicks anyhow it's a casual way of
businesspeople so the guy handed me a
business card be like what are you
trying to do a deal no this is like what
you do is you write your number on si
so that's all the older people there man
do you even code bro sure that's a great
idea I'm going to actually write that
down um
so see that even code a double code bro
yeah we could tell the lack of math like
I'm a sleaze oh I have a picture from
when we first started dating you should
see it
some washboard abs we started nothing
all right all right guys um I appreciate
this I have to get back to my own grind
I have 60 algorithms to solve family
self two of them after work today I'm
also excited together no flex on this
way um yeah my scope is bigger than
yours do you even code bro that's a good
shirt I like that I'll uh I'll talk to
my graphic designer about it and maybe
I'll do a limited run where you guys can
buy it and I can make a few bucks in the
process
but yeah so thank you guys for watching
it's been fun I think you're doing much
better today than you were yesterday
I think cry today so that uh if you guys
flesh my frustrated levels are low you
need much better say yeah we'll put a
little tribute to June Scott like quotes
J Scott
I'm a DAB in the UK would you be
interested in talking some more we want
to talk about me so that's a pretty
that's pretty out there saying I tap
that color would it be like
I read console.log that cuz you bring
that print
yeah return
get in my scope struggling through
reacting suggestions on where to go
there's actually two react courses on
coke atom II that are fairly decent I
did the first one I was able to start
building projects in it other than that
there's a lot of great YouTube tutorials
man people don't really take advantage
of watching this whole you two YouTube
tutorials
yeah the terminology for me is important
too
otherwise I don't understand what needs
to be applied via circumstances it's
just like algebra so if you if you don't
have any like actual hard code to work
with and you just need the terminology
to make sure that the logic works and
you can keep continuing to use the logic
despite whatever values you put into it
you have to know what it is that you
need to create with the words and
structure and all the terminology that
builds that so dan dan Barrett you can
email me at Dylan's email 3 100 at
gmail.com if you're interested talking
about some stuff um you want to type
that in that it says it's like literally
the simplest email that could be it's my
name plural email 3 1 up if you can't
get that right Dylan's name 3 1 0 at
gmail.com Dylan's email 3 1 so you could
be slurring your words if he can't
figure it out I don't know his ideas cuz
that's a simple email that's that's the
truth that's so simple
who knows math do I know math God knows
why I have an English degree I mean I
don't know I could I could know math
alright guys I gotta wrap this up
because I have things I need to work on
thank you for watching and if you want
to support me you can at patreon.com
slash coat Orioles 360 we just got the
4k monitors I still need to get the 4k
webcam and I actually ordered some new
lights and
we're going to be painting in the new
office a green screen wall back so I'm
throwing some money towards the channel
if you want to help me out so that we
can release great stuff and continue
improving you can at patreon.com slash
going torres 360 but above all because i
know most of us are broke i don't expect
too many free of all patreon join the
Facebook group codec and caffeine when
we release cool things like the do you
even code bro shirt the first place is
going to drop will be the Facebook group
so hope you guys check that out I
appreciate you all and thank you for
being here on the 21 day journey we've
had a lot of the same people probably
struggling through the same things as as
April is and understand her plight
probably better than I do at this point
but here we are continuing on and going
through the grind anything you wanna say
before a guy code long and prosper later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
