everything you need to know about
javascript string methods first of the
length property the length property will
allow us to get the length of the string
for instance hello with return the
length of five h-e-l-l-o one two three
four five you can also find a string
with in a string using the index of
property now keep in mind this will
actually return the first spot that the
string is found at a first index spot
you also have the string method last
index of where you look for the word
except you want to know the last version
of it so in hello world hello world it
will return the second world first index
spot for that you also can slice a
string meaning you can cut out part of
that string by using the sliced method
you put in the first position parameter
in the second position parameter where
do I want to start the slice where'd I
want to end the slice now two parameters
are optional if you omit the first
parameter and just put one in it's going
to start it at the beginning of the
string so if we slice with just the ten
parameter it's going to slice the first
ten letters off of that and return the
remainder of the stream you also have
the option of putting a negative number
in as one parameter and it's slicing
from the end so maybe we want to slice
that last ten characters we then put
negative ten into there i'll have the
replacement that you can call on strains
takes in two parameters one the word
that you're looking for and to the word
that you're looking to replace it with
so let's take the example hello world
and we want to change it hello to
goodbye our first parameter would be
hello and we would then search to
replace it with goodbye dreams also have
the Conn catfights functionality that
will allow you to combine one or more
strings you can combine multiple strings
s-parameter now if you combine two
strings such as hello and world and
using only one parameter won't be a
space now if you put in a first
parameter of a space comma the second
string world you'll then have the hello
world that's spaced out evenly that
you're looking for now so you only need
to get
one character from a stream you can use
char at for that and just list the index
spots so and target the string and then
say char at will say 0 in our example
hello world and will return an age now
if you want to convert a string into an
array of strings based on some parameter
you can use that during split such as
uncommons you'll take a b c d e all with
commas it'll break it up or we can take
hello comma world comma goodbye comma
world and then it would break it up into
hello goodbye world and all the various
strings all right so last but not least
we have to uppercase now this is gonna
last uppercase our string so we have the
default string hello world in lower case
it's going to uppercase the whole string
just like how we were able to uppercase
whole string you also have the ability
to lowercase up the whole string using
two lowercase so if we have hello world
in all caps we were just call the two
lowercase function on it and then it
would lower case the rest of the string
