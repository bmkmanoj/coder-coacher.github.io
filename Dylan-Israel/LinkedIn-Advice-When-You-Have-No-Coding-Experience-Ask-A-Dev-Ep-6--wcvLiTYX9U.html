of ask a dev we're gonna be talking
about a couple things you can do to your
LinkedIn to showcase that you're
learning how to code this is really for
those junior developers people trying to
become junior developers rather it can
be a little intimidating having a
LinkedIn page and all you have on there
is like Domino's subway like jobs that
aren't related at all to what you're
doing and I want to show you some things
I put on my resume before I got my
current job as a web engineer I just
kind of give you some feedback based off
of what I've been told by recruiters
what I've been told by people who I've
been working with who ended up getting
me the job and you know saw my LinkedIn
clicked on a few things ask me questions
it was like cool so the first and
foremost if you don't have a LinkedIn
you are shooting yourself in the foot
make a LinkedIn doesn't matter if you
have nothing relevant to put on it we're
going to talk about some of the things
that you can go to get something
relevant on it now the first thing that
you should do is have a picture a
picture just kind of showcases that
you're a real person that you exist that
it will be their studies that show
having a picture really help you if
you're really uncomfortable with it get
comfortable that's my advice here you're
a professional and this is a
professional networking site and that's
kind of the point of LinkedIn now if you
don't take advantage of your
introduction you're really doing
yourself a disservice I have a very
detailed introduction here talking about
what I'm working on what I'm learning
really pushing forward that hey I'm
trying to advance as a developer these
are the technologies I'm learning and in
my resume section you'll see what
technologies I know and I've been
working in and one of the things that
really got me a lot of help was the fact
that I put a video my videos here in the
past days where jQuery tutorials going
over like the open weather API and
things of that nature I also have a
little code.org participation so that
showcases that hey I can code because I
have these tutorials which ended up
helping me get a job my coworker who
ended up moving me along the ladder
moved me along the ladder because he
watched
two or three of my videos from it he saw
hey I think I can work with this guy and
he sees me no to know what he's doing
and then like it moved up the ladder and
I ended up getting my job and it's a
little more complicated than that but at
the same time not really when they're
looking to hire a junior developer what
they're looking to hire is someone who
is eager someone who's learning and
someone who's trying to who is I think
they can work with it because I and
that's one of the things I think you
should really do is make a video
portfolio or video introduction if you
will and put it in your introduction
here so instead of maybe look you know
this Wikipedia API project what you
could do is have a video there just on
your YouTube channel you know it's all
free record it and talk about yourself
talk about what technologies and up you
know what technology what technologies
you're comfortable with I should say and
what what projects you have what
hackathons you've gone to what you've
been learning what tools you've been
using to learn and really introduce
yourself to show that you're you know
that you're part of the coding community
active and kind of give them an
introduction to you because they're
going to be hiring you based off yes
your skills but also how does this guy
communicate do I think I can work with
him or her and those sort of more
personal things they see eager is he
learning so really take advantage of
that in your introduction section so if
you have nothing at all at the very
least right here you can put a video
introducing yourself your experience
with code and if you you know a month
later update that video if you have more
relevant things to put in there I highly
encourage doing that it'll take you
maybe 30 minutes kind of just freefloat
off maybe you have some some things to
show if you want to get fancy with it
the next thing is if you have any
relevant experience obviously put this
on here but you can see right here I
took a job right here at a software
company where I was working at making
videos and things of that nature not
touching code at all closest I got was
wire framing but when you come to these
jobs if you can get a letter of
recommendation so right here I have a
letter of recommendation I have letters
of recommendation for every job I have
pretty much this was as a web design
intern
you know these are but say you don't
have any of this right no problem what
you want we'll see see more positions
you'll see I have letters of
recommendation as a delivery driver at
Domino's right here so I literally
encourage you to put and obviously fill
out all your information it's better to
have all your jobs on there because
that's what's LinkedIn this for it's
your entire job history
so obviously you're more relevant stuff
to go to or your more recent so it's
going to be more relevant but in these
past jobs have letters of recommendation
and put them right on there and if you
have any media that's related to it put
that on there as well I'll keep going
down education so let's talk about this
free code camp section right here this
is a free certificate grand you have to
put a lot of time and work into it but
with this free certificate there's gonna
be some skepticism and it's really your
job to sell them on this certificate at
least make it a good talking point when
you're talking to a recruiter what you
see here in my example not only do I
have the actual certificate up here I
also have a very detailed description of
what it covered it's estimated 500 hours
of coursework includes html5 CSS
JavaScript and jQuery 10 basic
intermediate and advanced projects you
have 10 projects 16 algorithms 21
intermediate and 5 advanced you know I
put a little sentence here about going
on my YouTube going in in-depth about
these this is really how you need to
sell your certificate section to
showcase what in consular man really is
because there's never heard of free code
camp and all this all the work that goes
into it it's up to you to sell it and
same thing if you went to a coding boot
camp this is this you know it's your
additional coding boot camp this is also
the place where you need to sell it as
well
now if you have volunteer experience
this is another section that you can
fill out and you're saying well Dylan I
don't you know I haven't completed the I
haven't completed free code camp I
having onto a boot camp so I don't have
anything relevant for there fine
volunteer experience you can always long
tear through co.org I have my we saw my
certificate before I also have it up on
the wall right there because I think
it's important to kind of showcase that
you're that you're supporting the
community here's another example of me
showcasing that I volunteered with
code.org you can sign up today at any
skill level and hassle and volunteer or
have people reach out to you to go and
and teach kids code talk about code get
them interested in technology just be an
active member in sight this looks great
and this is something that's completely
free it just takes a little bit of your
time and energy but it's great to put on
your Linkedin and if you have anything
else in this example I have a couple
other things where if you're in college
right now and you're like how can I
build up my resume or at least my
volunteer and associate Association join
ACM almost every computer science
program will have the association of
computer machinery a club go ahead and
join that or any additional
organizations such as Honor Society org
is a Honor Society that's for that it's
traditionally for honor students but
they both ended up for everybody you get
tons of resources and you become a
member kind of showcases that you're
trying to go that extra level that's
that's another example something you
could do on there as well now obviously
you want to put your featured skills and
endorsements and I'm actually going to
go through here and remove ones that
aren't related to code because most of
the times people just kind of thumbs up
your top ones and call it a day I'm
going to go through here remove all my
code my non-coding related once because
I want people sum up my JavaScript I
want people to sum up my angularjs now
it doesn't really have a big impact note
it's but these are all the little things
that you really need to do to have a
strong LinkedIn especially when you're
just getting starting your new and that
some of these smaller things may not may
not come to you so courses if you have
any coursework make sure you put it in
here I have all my college coursework
covering up programming physics calculus
things that are related to the field
right all my CS courses now
certifications this is another section
where you can really blow up your resume
a little bit to show that hey I'm hungry
hey I'm learning yeah you know it's just
a single solo learn course but you can
see that this is what I'm spending my
time doing you know December 26 2016 12
January 2017 a steady progression
February
17 of me doing PHP JavaScript HTML CSS
jQuery this is a small little thing to
really sell the point that hey I'm not
going to put this on my resume per se
but when a recruiter comes my LinkedIn
or an employer looks at my LinkedIn and
they're trying to see more about me to
go AR I thought his resume it's worth
checking out these LinkedIn they see
these additional things as showcase you
know what we're actually this guy
actually really seems to like code
because that's what they're looking to
hire looking to hire someone who's eager
and look and enjoys it and is continuing
to learn because that's what you look
for in a junior developer and if you
have any honors and awards go ahead and
put that in here but this project
section now I'm guilty of not putting a
great project in here as well but I can
tell you excuse me that when I was you
know when I was having my phone
interview I talked about my hackathon
that I went to include all your
hackathons in your project section and
definitely put that on your resume in
your project section as well it shows a
couple things one it shows that you're
interested in coding and challenging
yourself to it shows that you can work
with the team and three it shows that
you are really really interested in the
community and that is good because
people they want to hire to someone
who's eager who can work with people and
likes what they do there's plenty of
people out there that may want to just
take a paycheck and not really be
committed that tells us they're looking
for a junior developer he's looking for
somebody eager who enjoys it and they
can groom to work their way up to a
senior developer SWAT and stay with the
company and things like hackathons to
show hey you know I'm actually jumping
around I enjoyed this it's not like I
just took two months and called it a day
these are projects where you can do it
and all your free code camp projects or
any other projects call it fraud
projects boot camp projects this is
where you need to put it describe the
project go into detail about what
technologies you use you can see right
here I use HTML CSS bootstrap ESRI API
YouTube API
I put boots up twice there I just
realized I got to change that javascript
get jQuery that's what I use because
that's what I knew I didn't know angular
anything but it was more about me going
to the hack
showcases I understood Ajax calls than
anything else now definitely you put all
this on your resume these are kind of
little things that you can do when you
don't have any resume experience that's
kind of my two cents since I appreciate
you guys for watching I hope you take
advantage of these things if you knew
how to do it or did not have a LinkedIn
you're really shooting yourself in the
foot get it together and give yourself a
LinkedIn it's just the way of the world
