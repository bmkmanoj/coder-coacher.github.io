streams the AMA so for those you also
known as energy drinks Saturday because
I basically begged my girlfriend into
allowing me to have an energy drink
scratch that
I said listen here I'm drinking an
energy drink well you like it or not
that may not have been how that went
down but we're gonna pretend like that's
how that went down
so happy Saturday to everybody and for
those who are new to the channel what I
like to what I like to do is I start off
with a question every weekend I do about
an hour livestream to answer your guys's
questions and I start off with a
question it could be a question in the
comments so if you have a question you
you definitely want to answer to make
sure you just sort of comment on some of
the videos I put out videos every week
and or something that's going on with my
mind and so something that's going on in
my life is I'm actually picking up my
very second programming language like
really yes this may sound like kind of
strange because I've I've coated in
about well in about ten different
languages but I wouldn't say that I have
picked up a different language but
that's something that's gonna be
changing in the near future
you know I've coated in I would say the
I would say that the only language I
truly know would be JavaScript if I want
to use the I don't like the word no but
I'm the only language that I'm
comfortable with this JavaScript and
part of that is just it's the one I use
all the time
it's one I've been using for years now
and moving forward in the past I've done
Ruby I've done Java I've done C++ PHP
Python Visual Basic
I'm sure I'm leaving a few out but these
are all things I've played around with
and da Vinci
I haven't touched in many years but
moving forward at my work I'm finally
and I've talked about this they're
actually going to be grooming me for
front-end into a full stack developer
and I'll be doing c-sharp using the.net
framework so I will be officially
picking up what I owe I also did PHP in
my last work so I hate to say but PHP is
probably the language I know second best
and that that can't stand so that that
has to I can't have that on my
conscience so we're we're definitely
going to be picking up c-sharp with
the.net framework and starting in the
near future I will be that will be where
I spend the bulk of my time studying
outside of course my coursework and
things like that I have a couple udemy
courses I'm trying to finish up ones I'm
taking and ones I'm building but uh in
the near future I will be diving in
diving into the sea Sharps so I wanted
to talk a little bit about that about
when you're ready to dive into a second
language because there's this strange
mentality where you see you know
especially when you're just starting out
right when you're just starting out you
are um you are looking at you're looking
at these job apps so you see sometimes
they say three or four languages
oftentimes as suggestions oh well you
know we want some always good with this
this is this and you are you may say oh
man I'm I'm just I feel okay with
JavaScript or whatever I want to learn a
back-end language and you get kind of
overwhelmed I want to I want to just
take a moment to sort of say that it is
a not advisable when you're just getting
started to try and tackle multiple
languages it is hard enough to remember
all the methods that are available in a
single language especially especially
when you are just getting going that you
may confuse some concepts and different
languages now it is most most languages
that you will work with have a lot of
the same functionality right they have
the four loops have looping they have
logic statements like if statements
for loops while loops data types that
are very similar and so it may be an
easy transition but when you're actually
trying to go and be a production like a
in-house developer I would I would say
try and stick with that first language
once you get your toes wet I mean that
once you get your first job and it seems
like a the next natural language will
come very easily though you'll say okay
well you know I've been working in
JavaScript for a year six months
whatever it is and I think I'm I'm ready
to start building things for the backend
or I'm sorry building things for this or
that or you know we're gonna transition
our product our company what is what is
the new hotness right I think it's okay
to then start learning a second language
and some people may disagree but I think
you would I think you will paint
yourself into a very complicated corner
where you have invested too much time
into learning two languages that you
don't know that well and instead with
your time would be better spent learning
one language that you know decently well
so that you can can get going and then
once you I don't say master because I
don't feel like I have mastered anywhere
near master JavaScript or anything else
in in general but once you are confident
in a language that it may be time to
move on to a second one after you have
some experience in that language and I
think that that's a fair way to go so I
just want to sort of the question about
when to learn a second language is to
when you're ready and a lot of times
people try to jump in way too early so I
just want to take a moment to kind of
say hold up I know it's I know you
worried all want to go at 100 miles per
hour but you're actually probably gonna
do more harm than good when you're
studying multiple languages at the same
time as a beginner so that's my little
PSA public service announcement that's
right and let's go to answer some
questions is it you word Olam a
watch out don't on coming soon baby
gotta gonna start filming for don't long
videos today actually so Steve miss
tricks this PHP is good freelancer
doesn't work for us yeah well I mean
WordPress is a lot of small businesses
so the thing is here is I want to
comment on this freelancers a lot of you
want to be freelancers a lot of you want
to really just want to work remote and
there's two different things and you
don't really want to be a free a
WordPress freelancer it's hard getting
clients hearts it's hard keeping clients
you don't get you don't get paid all
that well and what you really want most
of the time is you sort of want to work
remote have maybe a little bit of a more
free schedule and that is completely
possible as a contractor you could you
could go and work for a consulting
company after you have a couple years
experience in your belt or if you're
just a very skilled developer and you
can have that lifestyle get paid very
well and and go from there so that
that's kind of my two cents on that but
he is right that PHP is good for
freelancers because of WordPress but I
would highly highly highly advise
against going down a wordpress route
because it is in the long term not very
good for your career that would be that
would be my thing it may be easier to
get started because there are less jobs
or there are more jobs but they're
they're kind of like it's kind of like
if you were to say there's more jobs in
fast food and thus you study fast food
do you understand what I'm saying here
and so instead of like instead of being
a bartender where you get tips and it
makes decent money like nah man there's
more fast food things so I'm gonna go B
I'm gonna go flip some burgers at
minimum wage you know I mean like I can
see that's that's that's how I see the
argument from from Steve but he isn't he
isn't incorrect that it's good for
freelancers yeah but most people aren't
going to be successful freelancers they
are going to be successful contractors
successful employees and I would say I
would I would lean you towards doing
consulting and contracting instead of
freelancing
but without Steve seeing his whole
argument like that is just my two cents
on it I'm a fan of mr. Steven was Chuck
although I think I am mispronounce his
name a million times but uh off - I know
I know I am I am a I would say it I'm
not the only one that thinks this way
but I have heard other arguments against
it
I'm taking the free code camp algorithms
and putting them on my get rip repo and
I'm creating the test using mocha nice
this is something I actually wanted to
add to my javascript 360 course when I
finish up my angular 360 part two
cryptocurrency chart in table I will be
adding some tests using jasmine and
karma or maybe I'll just make it a
separate test and we'll go from there
with new algorithms would you prefer
front and back in be in the same
language JavaScript and node.js would I
prefer it uh uh I don't know that would
prefer I mean I would because I could do
it but is there any preference one way
or the other not really the the thing
that you get out of having a front-end
and back-end language being the same
such as JavaScript and node is you get
quick and fast development you get
somebody who who you get somebody who
can transition from the front end to the
back end and start learning the backend
concepts without having a new learning
new language you're more so just
learning a way of doing things in your
way of thinking about the backend and
that's where the benefit of a full stack
mean or myrn project really comes from
what do people say javascript isn't good
for data structures I searched on Quora
many people saying it what do you say on
it I don't know enough about it what's
next for the coding god the coding god
is currently finishing up his degree
program is also reading several books
right now
well one book with four queued up I'm
also doing the school thing doing the
YouTube thing and I have just finished
the coding aspect of the angular 360
part 2 which will probably be released
in like two weeks I'm working on I have
to actually film it I have to build some
wireframes from user story some testing
and then added and do all the
descriptions the crap that takes
forever so that's kind of it that's
that's that's the near future of what
I'm up to
if I'm the coding got a phone I'm
referring to if that's who we're
referring to if we're referring to dough
long dole on its gonna be telling you
all about freelancing so click forward
to that I'm starting a bootcamp in
Orlando next month any tips I hope
you've been preparing I have a video
coming out on Monday comparing a college
verse boot camp verse self-taught and
one of the things I say in the video is
when you go into a boot camp which is
about three or four months you should
already know how to code beforehand you
should be spending about three to six
months reviewing prepping studying and
just fine-tuning those skills from there
I was wondering how do you approach a
project I know JavaScript CSS editor
I've known Jay house our basic project
such as a JavaScript calculator how
would you tackle this this is probably
just an inexperienced thing this is
where you haven't really opened a text
editor or you've watched so many
tutorials so you haven't had anything to
do for you yet so the first thing you
should really do is just break the
project out into simple parts right and
go from there so the like for instance
find parts that are repeating and that
will help cue well if it's repeating I
only have to build it once and change
certain aspects of it but just take
simple like tribute page for instance
and build that from scratch and say okay
how would I actually break this out and
take a piece of paper or whiteboard
whatever draw it out and um what I would
say is from there go and say okay
there's a picture I know how to do a
picture build the picture insert the
picture say okay there's a menu how do I
build a menu go build that menu and
start breaking it out and in s fine-tune
pieces components as you can and just
tackle them one by one a lot of what
happens to get overwhelmed right where
you're like I don't know how to start
this thing oh my god there's a
calculator here I got a blank text
editor how do I get blank text editor
have a calculator and you say okay well
let me just build a box for the
calculator all right now I built the box
I'm gonna have an input right so okay
let's let's add an input all right I
need some buttons let's build some
buttons my buttons have to have some
labels on them let's add some labels and
then you start there and then you
continue and progress but really it's
all about breaking it down into fine
tune pieces without getting overwhelmed
that's really the truth of the matter
are you still investing Kryptos I have I
still have money investing Kryptos right
now I am not really I'm saving money
more than investing because I am buying
a new car in the near future once
Apryl buys a once April gets a job
she'll be getting my car and I'll be
getting a new car and so I'm probably
gonna buy cash
I don't like debt so I'll be by the bulk
of it cash I'm probably financing like
$4,000 of it just to build credit things
like that should we learn a framework
after building a few projects in plain
JavaScript this may some people may
differ on this but I say yes you should
be picking up react or angular yeah
because that's what you'll be working
with in the workplace those are the
skills that employers are going to want
when you are applying for jobs
ah alright um did you see that John left
simple programmer Johnny unleash it I
love John to death and I emailed him
about his name change and things like
that and and but uh Mike with all
respect John Manley I like John
John I've just I'm really reading one of
his books it's very good but uh really
all that John did in my my two cents and
I I haven't watched this video about why
he left simple program I did see it pop
up and like you I haven't got around to
it yet but my two senses John's doing
some rebranding that that's essentially
what he's doing and he doesn't really
want to talk about development anymore
and he never really did right he did for
a while because that's where his
expertise was but I feel like John's
always wanted to be about um just living
better and making better choices and I
think it's it's a little bit more
personal branding and it's something I
actually emailed him about to where I
said hey man did you change it because
I've thought about just naming my
channel Dylan Israel and instead of
coding tutorials 360 and changing the
name of it just to do more sort of
personal branding of where I I mean I'm
I'm the brand if you will of my tiny
channel but uh for for would it would it
would it be a better decision to say
okay let's change the channel name from
coding tutorials 360 to Dylan Israel
would that be better for my career and I
emailed John when I saw the name change
to see and he said no I kind of quit
simple programmer and the guy the guys
putting out videos every day almost
still so I don't think he really quit
anything I think maybe he's just sick of
talking about software or maybe he is
doing a little bit of rebranding which
isn't the same as leaving so but I again
I haven't watched his video that's just
my two cents
my two
on intelligent sense uninformed rather
sense about it I'm competent html/css
very good javascript react am I ready
for a junior developer a job yeah I
think it's I think obviously you want to
probably throw in some testing with
either mocha and chai or jasmine and
karma that's what I'm familiar with and
then um hopefully you have some projects
built and then I also would suggest
getting some version control as well the
idea the interview process is pretty
daunting to pay me to brother okay don't
everything that shit's gonna get any
better
all right so just keep that keep that in
mind if you think it gets any any easier
it does not good morning good morning
diabetic Manatee when did I start coding
at which age my first college coding
course actually my first college coding
course was like when I was like 20 but I
didn't have I at that point I didn't
know I was gonna be a developer so my
foot real first college couldn't course
was at like 24 and so I didn't really
start learning web to web dev until
about three years ago when I was 27 but
yeah all I had then was just a college
course is the job of course like three
or four Java course is a Python course
C++ course so I personally don't think I
really started coding until I was 27 but
it's a it's all relative because that's
when I started building out my own stuff
and going from there
well I ever used data structures in web
dev it data structures in terms of
certain certain will sort I'm looking
for a certain in organizing your your
JavaScript in certain ways yes it
depends on it depends on the project
application not all the times like I
don't really I do a lot of crud tools
and things like that but if I was
working with with
thumb was something that was a little
bit more complicated than that then some
of the client-facing tool tools I would
probably have to be more confident in
Dave structures so it just depends on
what you're working on so someone asked
me what what book I'm reading by Jones
it's the complete software is developers
forgot actually included a link in the
chat and I'm gonna go ahead right now
and throw it up in the description and
that way if you want to help me out I
get a little bit affiliate money for
Amazon it would be appreciated I don't
have that I throw this in here in phone
settings but uh so you can help me out a
little bit with that right in there so
but yeah so that's what I'm working I'm
about eight chapters and I love it I
plan on getting of soft skills book as
well down the road do you still buy
e-books for your college classes not
from my class no my classes no how long
can you be comfortable how can you
become from Doug Express just everyone
goes at different rates so really just
go start building things and see what
other programming languages have you
learned if any and why I mean at PHP is
probably the PHP Java and Python are the
ones that I that I have most familiar
with so if I was to kind of say Java cuz
I was in college
Python because I was in college and I
really enjoyed it I'm built games in it
game singular and PHP cuz that's what I
used in my last work place I remember
back in the day when the channel is your
name Dillinger Israel are you Jewish I
have my dad's side of the family is
Jewish
I've Jewish heritage but not Jewish
faith I was never for me I never got a
bar mitzvah or anything said he so John
has a partner he's taking over so I
guess we'll see what simple programmers
interesting I know John has partner with
him on his stuff but uh under what that
entails
I should go watch that video eventually
are there any resources help you improve
your approach to projects like you said
breaking down projects there's any
resources help improve that skill uh I
mean in my course I do wireframes and
user stories and things like that and I
try to break it down on I'm going to
actually harp on this in my next annular
360 course but I don't really know if
anything other than just practice what
was the future of JavaScript so this is
an interesting conversation I personally
think it's going to evolve into
typescript which is you have types and
which it kind of already has right how
many I mean angular the default you use
and angular the default is typescript
and you have react application is now
using typescript and and so that's
that's kind of what I think is gonna
happen so you're gonna have you're gonna
have it so it's so hard to say because
you have all these things in web dev
that you don't necessarily have in other
languages you have compilers pre
compiler CSS compiler so you're working
with a view and stylings and not just
the pure language so it's one of those
things where you have to look at it
objectively and for me I think I think
that a lot of what's happening is you
simply are gonna see as web dev has sort
of evolved from this language those
built in ten days to a fully functional
object-oriented or object based language
you're gonna see it become more and more
like typescript in the near future
uh oh my goodness what's my what's my
daily schedule like I wake up every
morning around 6:00 or 6:30 I uh
yeah why are you lying over there baby
some days I wake up early I wake up at
5:00 yeah some days I may wake up a
little early
some days I'm more often than not I'm
waking up at 6:00 or 5:30 before my
alarm clock goes off so I so I wake up I
spent about an hour to an hour and a
half studying for school and then I
sometimes a little YouTube depends on
how much I get done of my I have my
sections broken out and I talked about
this a little bit more in an upcoming
video where I talk I give an update
about my classes and stuff like that I
go to work Monday through Friday so I'm
at work from 8:30 to 5:30 I get home I
have dinner I go back to study until
about 8:30 or 9:00 and then I do it all
over and on the weekends I work a little
bit more on YouTube I work a little bit
more on my courses to give you an idea I
found two videos today I'm going to be
working on my Dolan freelancing video
I'm also going to I'm doing my
livestream I'm also going to be studying
I have some reading I need to do for
school and some quizzes I also am going
to finish up my course and I'm going to
after that I finished the working on my
course I also before bed read for about
30 to 45 minutes of my my current book
that I'm reading so that's kind of kind
of how my daily days go if that helps at
all do you see the hashtag women in tech
for the fascist sexist anti-men movement
that is all hail Mert
merit accuracy right um
I'm not answering that question I can't
[Laughter]
yeah it's quite the loaded question I
will say I understand why such things
exist I understand that that why they
exist do I think they should exist no
that's my thing I and I'll give you my
example at Cal State LA that I've given
quite a bit and these are topics that
are a little bit loaded and a little bit
rough but I went to Cal State Los
Angeles when I was computer science
program and they had they didn't really
have a compute and engineering Club they
had a Latino and Hispanic engineering
club and anytime I feel like you include
genders or race and technically
everyone's included but it's always it's
all anytime you include a gender or a
race it becomes non inclusive even if
legally or in theory it does right and
so and you may say well Dylan you know
what well maybe because they were in the
minority they needed that you know they
they felt like they weren't included Cal
State LA is 60% Hispanic this and this
is not just some random statistic I'm
pulling on my butt it I've seen the
numbers from the Cal State LA newspaper
and it might even been higher than that
but but I wanted to join an engineering
Club and I felt like I was not included
due to the fact that it was prefaced
with such things so I would say that
I've reached out to some some you know
girls who code in the past and wanted to
sort of help promote the movement a
little bit and I've not gotten any
response and say hey I'd love to talk to
you about what you're trying to
accomplish in this and then and I I am
personally against that sort of stuff
but I understand why people think that
it should exist yeah uh it's web
development just about credence overall
know uh some some part of its crud right
you build a lot of back office admin
tools that you know need to be used and
things like
I also build cool client-facing stuff
that that is more fun more dynamic than
that oh I prefer angular react I really
like angular uh just because I'm more
familiar with it now uh so a lot of
people like to this question happens all
the time but a lot of people like say
angular react angular react
I love react to so light not really if
you if you've ever done any react
development which I've done a little bit
you end up installing about 40 different
libraries 40 different frameworks and
then you just have angular at the end of
the day you have your own customizable
angular I much prefer just to have
angular that's it I don't need to go get
angular from a bunch of open-source
software just give me give me Google's
angular and start there that that's my
two cents on it do you feel like the job
market for junior entry-level devs is
dying no man I I feel like that's a lot
of clickbait so my sense on the the
junior entry-level devs is dying is that
there's just a lot of unqualified junior
developers that's true the matter is
there's a lot of people who want to be
developers but just aren't ready they
don't want to do the bare minimum that's
required because the bare minimum is a
lot right the bare minimum is being will
pass those technical interviews the bare
minimum is being proficient in a
language the bare minimum is being able
to to build side projects have side
projects to show it's the show that
you're passionate whether it's through
volunteering or meetups whether it's
going and getting certificates sometimes
to Greece and its it's just a large
amount to become a junior def and a lot
of people just like to bitch about how
hard it is that's really what I think it
is now is it hard yes is it possible yes
so that's kind of my two cents on it
what is the future no Jess I don't know
man I don't follow the node stuff too
too much
definitely is it better and learn
typescript first in JavaScript I mean
typescript is nothing more than a
superset of JavaScript
I would advise against it if you are
just getting started because what may
happen is you may confuse functionality
in typescript for what is functionality
in JavaScript but as long as you know
what is type Scruton one is JavaScript
there probably isn't any harm but I
would say nine add 10 times you should
learn JavaScript well I think a
functional programming I don't know
enough about it I know that functional
programmers are in love with it but
that's that's pretty much out should I
learn oder angular first you should
learn probably JavaScript if you're
asking that question a little bit better
but I would say you should learn react
over angular if I was going to choose
right now just because sheer Mountain
Jobs what operating system to use I use
the windows do you know bash I used to
get bash that's about it though are you
doing a live coding tutorial this
weekend like today or tomorrow I don't
think off time I was just doing that
because I was working on my my
cryptocurrency charting course
who's gonna win the fights tonight I
actually don't know who's who's fighting
tonight
uh I went and saw a black panther what
are your thoughts on it I thought it was
it did a very good job the spoiler alert
I wasn't angry all right hey I got John
too bad so I think I think the they did
a very excellent job with incorporating
a little bit of history of the civil
rights movement and and doing it in a
very very interesting way I also just
loved it I thought it was it's a nice
change of pace man a lot of times you go
to a Marvel movie and it's just like
goddamn this is like every other Marvel
movie so we swapped out the Hulk for you
know Iron Man or some and it was
just different which was nice and it was
really well handled I really liked it
I'll leave it at that because I want to
I don't want to ruin it for you guys do
I handle UI and UX davon as well as at
work I I do but typically we're not
we're not too too big on UI UX so it's
not a big deal
and that just depends on what projects
I'm working on though by the way you're
pretty cool Thank You Man
is it the braces but yeah do I need
advanced math under my belt in a
developer I would say you just need
strong algebra skills most of the time
if you could recommend five different
projects to have on a portfolio site
tool and a junior devil would they be
five unique ones like five unique
projects I'd have something with some
api's I'd have something with some
algorithms I'd have something with data
structures I would have something that's
but they all have to be unique that's
the thing that is the absolute thing is
they have to be unique projects
so I think five is more than enough
honestly if you had one really good
long-term project that you could show
how it has evolved over time and you've
been maybe make a side income from it
even that would be just as impressive
what language you suggest for back in
the confused because there's so many
that's really up to you man
the there's a lot of jobs in PHP as
someone who hates PHP I will admit that
there are a ton of jobs in php.net and
c-sharp c-sharp for the backend is an
excellent language which I see all the
time so something consider as well node
is great because you can transition
usually for the front and the back and
so it really just depends on what you're
trying to trying to do Jeremy Stephens
hurts Josh Emmett Strauss Emmett the one
that had that nasty KO last time I mean
look up Josh I mean I think I think this
guy I think this guy looks like he
killed somebody his last KO I got my
money on Josh and Josh a man yeah just
like know it is that yeah Josh Emmett
straight up murdered this dude last time
now he he didn't get a fight of the
Night bonus cuz he weighed in too much
but he definitely wouldn't want it that
night but my money's on Josh Emmett
because who the is who the is
Jeremy Stephen Luke is that guy are you
saying react has more number of jobs in
Paris and angular right now I couldn't
tell you the numbers I could just tell
you I've seen some research looking at
some jobs for for a video and I saw a
 ton of react jobs so I would say
that especially if you're trying to
break in and you're try and do a friend
in role I would I would advise react or
angular
I have have a good one Yasha should I
learn WordPress No
do you miss LA no uh the reason I left
LA was traffic cost-of-living I will say
that the one thing I do miss from living
in Southern California is having all the
good Mexican food and having good food
places in general yeah the food in
Florida sucks dude
that's the cheese than that it is it's
really hard to find good food in Florida
I don't know what it is I don't know if
it's just because the average age of a
Floridian it's 50 and I just lost their
taste buds after that but it is it was
an unfortunate situation all right am i
high fray
my hair academia season 3 yeah when does
it start though I uh I've been so out of
it I've just been watching Dragon Ball
super lately once a week so I'm
definitely my hair academia is one of my
favorite shows site favorite new animes
yeah I find out one season three stories
well coder do you use slash suggest I
use Visual Studio code it's really great
I'm a big fan of it when you were hired
for your first web dev job in floor
excuse me in Florida did they fly you
out for an interview or do they hire you
in California I got hired in California
they didn't fly me out for an interview
what do you think about maximillian's
the angular course I love it I'm about
3/4 through it
I've been just sort of kicking kicking
away with it
nipping away I've just been doing 30
minutes at 35 days I'm trying to say
yeah I got murdered with the who the
 is that guy that's like it bro you
just need to get off the stage now you
done you're done here I'm taking your
manhood boy
which is better
Google flutter first rag native well
consider I've never heard of Google
flutter I can't tell you I think they're
extremely qualified web dentists in
California the requirements for friend
is very high the salaries are super high
also and um it's just I know it feels
that way guys and I promise you I
promise you I completely understand you
know I'm still just under two years
experience as a developer but there's
one of those things where I understand
it looks overwhelming especially you're
just getting started but it really as
you continue learning over the next few
years after getting your first junior
role those roles will become much much
much more obtainable but you have to
just continue to progress is it really
hard for a junior yes but that's always
the case always hard to go to go
ball-ball hairs one you know the food
here sucks zero to keep it real I get
you're from I get here from from Florida
but we we can we can admit that the food
sucks
oh let's keep it real with you I tell
you all the shitty things about
California also yeah supers I mean
Crusader gravity Oh doll do you think
Freddy's masters is worth it I I don't
think many things are worth it I think
you just do some YouTube videos do some
udemy courses and call it a day did I
say job
I prefer html/css when you first started
now I kind did them all at the same time
a very interesting content so few likes
yeah that's what I'm saying man well you
guys doing over here can't you could you
hook your boy up with some likes and
shares and some Dolores cash money baby
um but yeah I appreciate you guys all
tuning in how old am i how old do you
think I am
I'm old man now I'm 30 I'm the big three
oh if you're this good after three years
of Cody I feel more confident about my
learning curve a this good coding god
maybe no uh I I pretty much try and work
at it every day and I basically told
myself I was gonna code every day for
five years and work work towards my
career every day for five years I have
about two years left 2020 we'll see if I
slow down or if I just can't help myself
I try not to work someday so I can't
help myself
but yeah it's I'm trying to do my best
and the way that you do that is just
every day you try to be better than you
were the day before and I encourage you
to take on the same mentality how did
you value yourself for your first dev
job trying to find do research to find
my worth um we're talking about how to
negotiate your first salary I basically
when I was negotiating I was first off I
pretty much was happy to take first job
I got as long as it was a reasonable
salary I I asked for what the average
was I believe the average I believed the
average salary like web developer salary
in in in my area of Florida was like
65,000 and I got 62 that bumped up to 67
for my very first job so that was kind
of my arguing point is I just want to
get paid the average and I'd be happy
with that
I think I'm worth that
and they gave me exactly that and so I'm
sort of dick would I be if I said no I
was very happy to accept it it was at
that time I was making forty five
thousand as a technology trainer or
technical writer and I I took that and
that was so it came out to I want to say
like I was 45 it came out to going up to
67 was $22,000 raised until the first
three months was just like a 47%
increase in pay and it was nice that's
really all I could say is nice you get a
47 percent increase in pay life is good
um do you know all back in languages no
uh I don't know what food is bad to you
okay first off there's very few good
sushi places so let's start there there
is no good Mexican food I've tried like
30 Mex I've been living in Southern
California all my life there's a Mexican
taco stand on every corner burrito joint
whatever you want to call it
Mexican food here is just awful
absolutely awful same with the Italian
there's very few good Italian places
it's just bad man that's all okay I
ain't got no I like Florida just the
food sucks I'm sorry
I'm sorry man software web dev in
general Mac or PC
I prefer PC we prefer we want dole on
not down you got away Dolan's coming
soon man when when does that caterpillar
molt after the dole on video actually
you know what a long little slight
announcement you guys might get a bonus
stream you might get a bonus stream this
week cuz uh your boy engineered truth is
coming down here and he's staying with
me for a weeks just to get Florida
hanging out skooby in the guest room
and so maybe we'll do a livestream later
this week on the channel
maybe both our channels while I'm the
other who knows but uh should be should
be fun thanks for the advice I'm
actually going through free free code
cram project videos at the moment since
I had brick wall of projects nice Johnny
letting the whole JavaScript in order
learning angular something like that I
would advise you to be very comfortable
JavaScript before you move on to angular
angular is really going to handle the
Dom manipulation manipulation aspect for
you um and I would I would highly
suggest that you get comfortable with
that I've seen jobs advertised to
California Fernandez 421 an hour do you
think it's just something trying to take
advantage of someone your thoughts I
think it is someone trying to take
advantage yes there is a large amount of
people who take that job when they're
trying to get their first job their
first job and honestly if you are a
junior like a real junior dev take 21 an
hour in California it's nothing right my
when I was making a 45 K in Los Angeles
I was renting a room for $800 I barely
could afford my rent I barely could
afford my health insurance my car
payment III my mother was bringing me
groceries is awful I used the bathroom
real quick guys don't come back answer
more questions
you
alright alright let's see here um was my
ethnic background Irish like 70% Irish
must be nice to make money on the go
what do you mean on the go what does
that even mean
bad foods more of a tamp thing I'll take
your word for it
I sounds like big excuses sir
I'm learning Android dev was next Python
or Java so you probably picking up
Kotlin and Java yeah and also that $21
an hour job
yeah that's up to you to take that and
leave after six months for $30 an hour
and so on and so forth and keep grinding
up that that that salary do you like
alcohol I'm not a big drinker I will go
out with coworkers and drink socially I
did pick up some beer for this
engineering the truth is coming her
maddest comin rather and just so though
I believe he's a little bit of a drinker
he's more of a social drink I know it
goes out the guy basically doesn't have
a job what else again do other than
drink a party and date so I got I got
some beer for why he's down here so we
might have some stuff I have just
started using Visual Studio is a bit
overwhelming suggestions or tutorials on
how to use it it's overwhelming really I
thought it was a simplistic design
personally but I would suggest just
going on YouTube
Visual Studio code in Gino tutorial and
seeing what sort of walkthroughs you can
find I'm from a third world country
meeting salary for a web devs just inkay
do you think I should go for a dev job
or something else I honestly couldn't
tell you you'd probably know better than
I would assume am I still high for a web
demonstrating Phil it's not because
you'd Emily selling these courses for
cheap you Jimmy's always sold courses
for cheap they've always been 1015
dollars I don't think I see anything new
that's just how you Demi's always done
it so how do you gain confidence as a
developer that is my problem how to gain
confidence in skills from flying job so
one I could build a project from start
to finish and one so the project from
start to finish was really helpful and
gaining my confidence because that was
basically like hey that is what I that
is what I am that's what I would do
right as a developer so that's good I
was also working a software company and
I would see the people they would
interview fail things and answer things
poorly I'm like I know that answer I
know that and that was really something
but really it's uh I guess when I the
thing that kind of put the the nail in
the coffin of the hey am I good enough
to be a developer that the sort of
imposter syndrome was when I made my
most recent jump
I had three job offers on the table so
that was something where I'm like if I
can get three job offers with one year
experience I must be doing something
alright and that was enough for me to
get going
udemy getting burned by access right
Brian we got a brine in the chat let's
build that app if you guys
aren't subs I highly suggest you go and
show him some love
but yeah so for those of you aren't
familiar with the udemy situation
basically Chris someone forward of
course at hey man someone's stealing
your content and building a course out
of it along with other people's and
making money and Christa has been
posting some videos about it and it's
it's I see I didn't even know this is
the first I thought that that was I
heard that was a thing and someone who
sells courses on udemy that you have to
go through an approval process but I
guess I guess that when you submit your
videos they don't actually scan to see
if there's other videos out there I'm
not quite sure how YouTube does it but I
can tell you that if I upload a
duplicate video YouTube lets me know so
I hope you Demi does something cuz
because that it's a awful situation I
don't know if they can recoup some of
the money or how that works but I would
I would be furious as I think Chris is I
think he was just handling it like an
adult he's not gonna be like throwing
computers across the window cussing and
screaming so I'm not quite sure what
they're doing I saw that he released a
third video on it I haven't watched the
third video I go from there
can you download the udemy course videos
after buying it ah
I don't remember be honest I never have
but I never wanted to you might be able
to can I suggest some web hosting
services for free web host is relatively
cheap guys you can get it for like four
or five dollars a month sometimes
cheaper I would encourage you to just
dish out two extra few dollars I don't
I'm gonna tell you how to develop an LMS
I'm sure you could with JavaScript any
front-end and back-end you could develop
just fine if not developing an LMS is
never gonna be easy
all right now that Casey's here we can
end it and life your voice we call it a
day now the Casey's here who always
shows up late but yeah so I'm not quite
sure
so they refunded the people who bought
the course but they didn't give the
money to Chris or the other people who
already use the course that doesn't seem
right
right so not only did so someone buys a
course they like the course that's fine
nothing wrong with that they pay for the
course they got the content they wanted
but they're not going to give the people
anything did you read the article but
Joel Spolsky about side projects I am
not familiar with that now
and I don't know who Richard Stallman is
let's see you here Richard Stallman who
is this guy
so he's a hippie that's all about free
where is that this is is that the gist
of it the only downside is Chris at it
for free on public domain that's not
public domain to throw it up on YouTube
you he is agreeing that you can then
watch it to get he gets ad revenue I
suppose promotes his own stuff that
doesn't mean it's free doesn't mean that
you can download it and use it actually
none of that isn't is Intel he is still
the owner of that content or at the very
least YouTube technically probably is
the owner of the content is somewhere in
there in there out in that long ass
thing you assign when you say hey I'm
okay being a content creator who is John
who is this guy Joel Spolsky
I'll look it up another time it looks
kind of douchey though I'll just say
that from his picture it looks kind of
douchey who's the CEO of Stack Exchange
go
sounds like qualified I have a kind of
little addition yeah some tips for
hackathon have an idea
research the API soar whatever it is
that they're going to move forward with
that you're gonna be using and then go
for it do I know Elon Musk yeah I mean
Elon go backward voice malware's we were
throwing throwing the the shots back
last Tuesday what the hell you think no
I don't know Elon Musk easy guy if I did
you think I have a job at Tesla SpaceX
right now you wanna hit me up baby I
know you're sub o so ridiculous
questions I'm not familiar with the
Google amp how many hours do you think
one can work on udemy course seven hours
per day I just did a video about how
many hours a day I think you should
study and that's about three to four
hours so so that would be my suggestion
if your goal that day is to work through
your Deming I would say about four hours
what are the higher level JavaScript
features topics they should know
considered the intermediate to have
answered officer probably asynchronous
closure should definitely be familiar
with all the the clawback functions
methods go from go from there
es six and all the latest how long
should a man date a woman before he
proposed this when he's financially
prepared owns a house or two and can get
everything in a prenup that is the right
time requesting a github tutorial oh god
you guys wanna get up everyone keeps
asking
that's uh that's actually something that
I want to do is do like JavaScript in an
hour
get in 20 minutes HTML in an hour CSS in
an hour one of those one of those
courses one of those sort of things and
I I've been slacking with it I'll be
honest with you I've been doing the more
fun videos for the topic or Nia because
that's what I like to do I like I like
Tom I got a lot should say I guess but I
should and most of my courses I I just
built my JavaScript course it's seven
hours long and I added two videos to it
this week and I continue adding to it so
tell me something about nodejs nodejs is
a JavaScript back-end it also runs npm
the more you know that's basically
nodejs
but but yeah so is net HTML CSS
javascript someone's best bet to get job
if you're trying to do front-end web
development I would say it is
any good resource to know how to
integrate api's you really just have to
understand basic crud how to create data
read data update data delete data from
using an API and once you do they're all
sort of similar and then it's just a
matter of diving into the documentation
okay how do I get this data from this
API and just going through appreciate
the coupons he gave bad from traversal
yeah no problem and uh I got nothing but
love for Brad he has uh I've sent him
some email section for advice here there
he's a good guy I'm a big fan as well
let us know when you'll be coming to
London England
hey when Ilan hits me up and says hey
bro we flying out on the jet I'll be
there alright
do you also teach coding and girl
friendships programmer like you know she
is unemployed right now but actively
trying to be a project manager she's
just got three certifications to working
on the big one which is the PMP once
that happens hopefully she'll be able to
land her first junior project manager
role graph QL arrests I'm familiar with
this I haven't touched craft ql at all
my understanding is that the way that
graph QL works is the front-end defines
the data model which I'm all for I'm I'm
ready if that's true if that is a true
statement it sounded too good to be true
I'm graph QL all the way I don't need to
see I don't even need to know how it
works if the front-end defines the data
model put me in coach
risk and get the out graph QL
you're in we're putting you in you're
now the starter all right I don't know
that's true but that's what I saw like a
one paragraph header on an article and I
was just like you got me that's it
clickbait all right I'm ready
but now I haven't had a chance to to
dive into graph QL play yeah
Haitians CSS someone's best bet to get a
job might what I said was if you're
trying to do front-end web development
because that's exactly what you're
building what what you would use that
for what does it take to be a software
engineer to from a software engineer one
usually years of experience that's
really pretty much it and leaving a job
for another job is probably quicker than
waiting that would be my advice what
databases do I prefer I prefer a
document based databases because I think
a little bit more fun a little bit more
spicy a little bit more like JavaScript
and a lot less like relational databases
you should make a day in the life of a
software developer I would love to do it
at my current work I'm a previous work
and at my future work unfortunately lot
of companies don't like that so that's
my thing is uh I would like to but uh
you have to understand not everyone
wants to put like let's say I get the
business to okay it right I get my
company you say hey you know that's cool
yeah we've that's that's a really neat
thing you're doing dealing we love they
have a YouTube channel whatever we'd
love for you to go and post a video
that's fine there's 200 people plus at
my corporate offices now I'm going by
and I have to make sure okay who do I
who do i how do I like what am I doing
here like do I need to blur them out do
I need to get all their express
permission a lot of people don't want to
be on camera a lot of people aren't like
hey let's go and just blab about
software on that on the thing and put
videos out of ourselves you know with a
Dolan character I a lot of people want
their privacy and that you have to
respect that so it's also one of those
things where what can I include so now
if I want to show you my stand up are
the other four or five people do I need
to get their permission are they okay
with it and if they're not
I can't show you my stand-up if I want
to show you our hackathons if I want to
show you our weekly dev meetings if I
want to show you this or that code
reviews how much of the code can I show
so it's all those things it's a little
bit more complicated than just showing
up and filming I would love to do it and
I think it would do great I think a lot
of people would like it but uh usually
these these midsize to smaller companies
are a little bit more private than like
a Facebook or Google or ham as long so
you better believe though I'll be asking
if I ever get a job at Google or
Facebook or Amazon or something like
that like yeah that shit's too good for
the channel your boy might just get
fired to sneak it in that's that's
that's one of those six-digit view
videos I feel yeah Dylan we notice that
this video has half a million views we
don't remember exactly giving you
permission to film at Facebook oh
well my bad we're gonna need to take it
down now that that that definitely ain't
happening mr. face bets Facebook man
this shit's bringing in the subs it's
bringing in the views and it's bringing
in the cash money so imma I don't have
to say no but yeah so I I mean I'd love
to but it's a little bit more
complicated than just that
speaking of a day-in-the-life you should
at least do vlogs if you don't get out
of the house I can understand why you
don't just make vlogs yourself walking
through that so you you know like the
green background I could throw something
different up in it um I uh so I am
thought about I need a new phone and
then I'm gonna maybe I I kind of like
how Chris Hawkes goes about and like
films outside and stuff like that and
I've been thinking about doing something
a little bit like that once I buy a new
phone but I'm buying a new car first and
so once that kind of happens spending
500 600 dollars on a new phone isn't
always the best financial decision when
you're looking to buy a new car cash so
we'll see oh I would never say no to
Facebook or Google or Amazon for that
matter or Microsoft hit me up boys but
yeah so uh yeah our algorithms only use
interviews that I've real-world
applications for friend and development
it depends on the role but most
front-end roles you're probably not
gonna need too many algorithms and
things like that but you know it depends
on the role you and what you're doing a
lot of times and algorithms are really
nothing more than and data structures
then being able to sort and filter data
in a fast and timely and memory
efficient manner and it that depends on
what you're doing if you are worried
about that what car so I'm probably
gonna be a by a hundred Honda Civics
2017-2018 sport hatchback that's
probably the Carm going with
have I applied and got interviews any of
those big companies I have gotten
interviews at 8 but Facebook and Amazon
they've reached out to me saying that
they were interested I have not I have
not passed the technical interview which
is upsetting so yeah so I've blown two
chances but we learn we grow we get
better and we try again so yeah what I
think the YouTube censorship issue I
think I haven't really had too much of
an issue there was a period in time
where they were deep monetizing my
videos and that really sucked
cuz like I'm talking about sulfur I
don't really like what it how much more
how much more vanilla can it get than
web development um like really can it
get more vanilla than what I'm doing no
panties are dropping no expletives
typically are flying no blood is being
shown like it's nothing sexy about it
guys and yet the the the web d'Ovidio
are getting demonetised so that sucked
um but um uh I haven't really had too
much of an issue with it I don't see
that I will most likely um do they have
offices in the Florida would you have to
move most of the roles that I was thrown
at work for in the Seattle area for the
rules
oh yeah alright guys I think it's about
time have we how long we've been going
I'll just try to go about an hour let's
see here
right I can kind of feel my voice going
a little hoarse from talking
oh yeah we're over an hour all right
it's time to end this I can't really
talk about the detective interviews I
don't think they would appreciate that
okay well and on this note this is a
positive now what was your best moment
till now in your career and it's a
pretty straightforward one my best
moment in my career was the day that I
got my first development job it was a
day that I was put in to work and this
is one of the things that's hard about
learning to be a developer and
progressing as a developer and something
I struggle with right now right I'm
going to college to make more money to
become a more qualified developer on
paper right just knocking that out but
doesn't pay off till it does and the day
that it paid off all that hard work all
the you know the blood sweat and tears
people say the frustration the the days
where I was questioning if I made the
right decision the days where um you
know you didn't want to code or study
but you did the days all those days that
you didn't go out and have fun all the
days where you felt like a loser and all
those days you know it finally became
worth it when you got that first salary
full stack roll that would probably be
my best moment in my career because I
wanted it so bad so so bad and uh I got
it sound like was screwing around but
that was the best moment of my career
getting my first real job
so I'll leave you on that note I hope
that you guys wanted as bad as I did and
if you did you'll get there no problem
thank you so much for watching we do
these every every Saturday we'll do a
weekend last room check out my videos on
Monday and Wednesday Monday's video we
talked about we do the three main
trifecta of learning well that's going
to be the college route the boot camp
out the self-taught route and on
Wednesday I do update about school a lot
of you guys been asking me about how
that's going so I actually did a video
about that as well and I also have
another video coming out the following
Monday about if I could learn if I could
learn development all over again what
would be the route I would take and why
knowing what I know now so I hope you
guys find that all very helpful I've
based my videos based off what I think
would help you and what would also be
enjoyable you know so I look forward to
maybe a live stream with the engineer
truth we'll see if he's up for the cause
and I'm picking them up from the airport
tomorrow so I'll catch you guys later
gotta go get back to the grind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
