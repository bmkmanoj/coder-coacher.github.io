and free code camp doing drop it and
intermediate algorithm scripting so what
you're gonna need to know at least for
the way that I solve this particular
problem is how shift works it's gonna be
very crucial so if you're not familiar
with how shift work is I actually do a
basic video in my JavaScript array
method or a methods video that is a new
series I launched so go ahead and click
the annotation that's gonna be on the
screen somewhere I don't know where but
somewhere you'll see it and it's all
also be in the link in the description
so go ahead and check that out if you're
not sure how shift Forks and end up
coming back to this video it'll really
make things a little bit easier so
what's going on here is that we're
passing in an array and a function and
in this case so you see the one two
three and then this function right here
and this is probably the hardest thing
the grasp is using functions within
another function so it's a little bit of
a interesting sort of you just have to
get accustomed to it I suppose this is a
way to look at it so the way I did this
is shift here well if you just call
shift it will actually remove the zero
index item and then shift the one index
there then the two index just to one the
three shifts to for excusing the three
shifts of two etc etc and it just drops
off that ending thing so essentially
shifts everything to the left so in this
case what we want to do is if this
function we want to run this function
until we get a true result and if it
doesn't we just want to shift it to the
left so the way I did this is very very
simple at the end of the day so we're
what we're gonna do here say wall we're
just gonna do a while loop that says
well that wall our function is not true
so basically while false on this on the
first value of our index
we are going to continue to run the loop
and what what how are we gonna end the
loop is just by shifting each value so
again I'll go over this real quick cuz
there's only basically two lines of code
we're adding so while we have a false
value in our function while we're
getting returned a false value in this
case for our first value remember that
zero is going to keep shifting to the
left because each iteration we're gonna
shift until we get a true result and
that's that it's really a matter of
understanding shifting and understanding
that this function is working so what
we're gonna say here is will just say
wall our function returns false on the
zero index shift left until it is true
that's basically our code right here so
I hope you guys found this helpful
it's pretty it's pretty it's more of a
can you conceptually wrap your mind
around how to solve problems then
difficult so there's probably a couple
other ways you could solve this this was
just the first thing that came to mind
for me but you can go ahead and check
out that shift video if you're not quite
sure how it shifts and as always guys
don't forget to Like and subscribe and I
appreciate all the support check out my
patreon and I'll see you guys in the
next video say thank you to test oh
gaming for sponsoring this video if
social media started here you can also
click this video go to his channel he
does he has a gaming channel and just
first person shooters mainly it looks
like so go ahead and check that out and
as always thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
