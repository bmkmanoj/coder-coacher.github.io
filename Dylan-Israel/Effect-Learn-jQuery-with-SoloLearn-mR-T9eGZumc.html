in solo learn in the last section of the
course effect let's go ahead and jump
right in these are some powerful things
to really make you're one of the great
things about jQuery are the effects and
it can really provide you a lot of value
in making your site function looks you
know great basically is the gist of it
so you have the hide in show elements so
sometimes you want to hide things
meaning they disappear from the page and
sometimes you want to show things you
want to hide it when you click it maybe
you want to click the area again or you
click a button to show something that's
an example you also have toggle toggle
is used to go back and forth between it
right so you can also with toggle you
can set a time within it so that it
slowly does it slowly does it over one
second a thousand milliseconds right
let's go ahead and jump all right in so
it's in millisecond so toggle method is
in milliseconds so fade toggle so jQuery
has fade in and fade out fade toggle
it's the same thing where you can go
ahead and pass in a thousand seconds
like so so you can slowly fade out so if
we want to fade out over to that seconds
there's be 2,000 milliseconds if we
wanted to do it but 2.6 zero opacity
that's how we could do it like so
oh does it require % excuse me it
requires a zero in front of it so so so
testy these things so mm and then it's
0.6 I put point six zero and then slide
toggle so sometimes you're gonna slide
things up and down and then they're
slide toggle as well and it takes in a
speed parameter so let's say we want to
slide down the developments upon
clicking the paragraph so remember we
have the click function you select the
paragraph and we're saying look when you
click it we want to run this function
that does some stuff and we want the div
we want dip the div to slide down
in three seconds it's also animate
animate lets you move things now you can
do this all in regular CSS and html5 but
you know this the the the reason jQuery
is really invented was to make your life
easier and so you should really take
advantage of it so say we want this diff
and wanted to on it we want it when we
click it to animate the width to 250 I
think the best way to kind of show these
sort of really visual things just go
ahead and bring it up so let's go ahead
and check this out so let me run this
here's our div and we click it BAM it
goes to 250 it doesn't go back because
we don't have a toggle turned on but the
JavaScript here says look the animate
set the width to 250 and have it do it
over one second you notice I didn't jump
on that automatically it's gonna leave
and jump back which of the following can
be used with the hannam 8 method oh I
see that I'm padding left apparently we
can add padding left to it as well so
you can SEP so you can do more than just
one property right each it's not with
and last one we did the width Heights
you just separated it by commas and you
pass it in as an object remember that
you do plus or equals like this so if
you want to actually subtract from
wherever it is so take the width of the
div subtract from it or add to it now
you also will keep in mind that you may
need to use the stop method down the
road to stop it from repeating
indefinitely depending on how you set up
your program so this example fill in the
blanks to animate the opacity and height
of a div elements in five seconds so div
dot animate and you see it's setting the
opacity we separate it with a comma it's
an object that we're passing in and then
we're setting the height plus or equal
to 100 px but we wanted to do that
slowly over five seconds so we pass in
five
in milliseconds you can see you can do a
whole bunch of crazy things so each one
of these will run one after another so
by default jQuery creates a queue for
each animate call so that it runs an
order so creating a drop-down menu let's
go ahead and look at this slide toggle
real quick so you can kind of see some
of the benefits of may be working with
jQuery so you see right here there's
this nice little drop down so it's super
fancy but you have some CSS and all that
stuff but the JavaScript what it's
basically doing is slide toggling down
every time we click it now it's this is
how easy it is with the right amount of
CSS to create a drop down like so pretty
cool so that's a one great example of
how you might use a slide toggle in
jQuery now if we want to hide the
element remember we can hide things as
well over 1.5 seconds I'd be fifteen
hundred milliseconds like so and then
finally our last little quick quiz so if
we want to hide all the paragraphs we're
gonna select a div so we're saying look
when you click this div target the
paragraphs
select the paragraphs and then hide it
like so so this is asking how many
seconds will the following animation
group run so we have one second two
second three seconds so it's gonna be
run for five seconds because remember it
accused up one by one by one it's not
going to run them all simultaneously
fill in the blanks to create a valid
animation so we're gonna do animate
passing the rumor this object separate
it like so and then close the object
separate with commas I should say and
finally we have finished our jquery
section a lot of great stuff a really
great introduction to jquery a great
refresher for me and one one thing i
hope you really take away from it
is that it is a great introductory
library to learn and I really encourage
you to get comfortable with it because
it's gonna be expected for you to be
comfortable with jQuery you may not use
it all the time but it will be expected
