a email today from code CAD me saying
hey the rest of our course is ready to
go the only thing I have to say is why
is Java only four sections man
we already did one in the preview you
get preview 1/4 of it anyhow let's go
ahead and get started
conditionals and control flow
conditionals and control flow so this is
what it looks like we're gonna be making
here if you're not familiar with Java or
this is your first object-oriented
programming language let's just work our
way through line by line real quick
quick understanding so this is our class
called conditionals this is the main
method main method it's kind of where
you call your code so that it runs if
it's not in the main method and it's not
in a function getting called in the main
method it's not gonna work it's not
gonna do anything essentially so if this
is our if statement so it's you know
some statements prints else if else if
else statements switch so this is
essentially saying that we could do we
could do a lot of things with if and
else statements but if there's only one
answer and it's fairly straightforward
we can just set some cases and from
there if it's that do this and that's
basically like cases if it's this and if
this is it do this if this is it do this
and if it's none of those you have a
default right here so that's what we're
gonna be doing so cool plus you order a
cup of java you answer C that is correct
oops next cool so oh it looks like we
didn't do operators in the last one so
in this case we're going to be using the
and operator so we're just going to
evaluate to boolean so we'll put one
oops one true and one
and we're gonna print out is true and
false true no it's it's true in true
true yes it's false and false true yes
it's true and false true no it's false
so that's what we're gonna print out
cool
so prints out false just two of the
insights and percents so I think this is
technical name so we're going use the or
operator some languages actually use the
word or and it's so much better if you
ask me I've always thought these two
slashes where it kind of it so I this
time we'll do two and true oops actually
we'll do true or false and if it's true
or false it should return true so let's
go ahead and do that it's gonna print
out the value oh maybe not yeah that's
true cool
so that's how we do or oh and then you
can also do not equals two so on line
four we want to say not equals to false
so the exclamation points naught and
then equals and we're gonna say so is
this not equal to false it's true not
equal to false sorry I forgot the other
side of the argument so it's true not
equals a false that is true so when we
run it it's going to print out true and
then use in offering so is five five not
greater than one so that should print
false is five is greater than one and
sometimes people get loopy in their
heads when they're doing not equals and
true false return the true or false just
speak it out to yourself like it's true
true not equal to false that's too fast
it's true not equals to false because
false is equal to false and that would
return true and true
- true but true is not equal so false so
you did maybe I could made it more
confusing right there but um oops not
equals not greater than isn't isn't a
real thing
so not greater than use less than I
don't know why did that so oh they wants
to return false so let's go ahead switch
these so it's 1 not equal to 5 and don't
have that in there oh is 5 greater than
5 no sorry Oh
oh my God my break I got so distracted
but it's true or false sorry I broke the
problem so it's 5 not equal to 5 that's
false because 5 is equal to 5 so
services that delay they're just let's
see line 4 has a code statement it's
incomplete for use each boolean operator
no more than once to replace the empty
comments so if you don't forget what a
multi-line comment is it's these slash
star star slash so let's go ahead and
take out all these
and here so is so what do we want to
return my own fault
so is one so one eco that eight is false
there's one equal legal innate or we can
use greater than or equal to 8 and then
five is less than 2 or greater than 2
and then we'll do and and we're going to
change this to 12 and we don't need to
change the other statement because this
is an end and think we have to throw in
hand there as well so let's go to
written that it returns false did you
use each boolean operator more than once
oh whoops
all right so we'll do 1 not equal to 1
so that's false we have to use or so
it's one that's nine so we're gonna
bambam or 5 that should work though
they're boolean operator
so one is not equal to one is false or
is I guess we're gonna jump right back
into it i refresh the page and I got the
code and I think they just wanted it a
certain way so let's go ahead and
comment this this is what it is and so
we were still I think we were doing it
okay I think what we were doing or us
okay but I think they wanted to insert
an order so they want us to actually say
whatever this is we want we don't want
to change this we only want to what I
did was I changed the variables and I
think they didn't want us to do that I
think they wanted us to just add the
operators which makes more sense so I
apologize for that but you live in your
learned so in this case one is less than
eight so that would be true and is 5
greater than 2 that's true or is 3 less
than 5 that's also true so everything is
true in there and when we return it it
returns false because what's not true
it's false and what's not false is true
so sorry about the confusion there don't
mess with the numbers and just use the
operators all right so if 9 is greater
than 2 probably if statement ok so let's
go ahead and do we want to do a billion
statement that returns true
so if we'll do 5 is greater than 4 print
access granted nice so let's see here if
else wonderful the ifs boolean
expression so the code else gets
executed
so if seven mana well so we want to else
to get so we changed our operator here
so the else will get printed no oh I'm
sorry not equals there we go
so there we go print successes 7 is
equal to 7
naturally I try to put things true so
otherwise you're gonna kill yourself
trying to find that earlier on you know
set the value of the round variable so
that the code in the elsif block runs so
let's just go ahead and set round we're
gonna set around 2 and we want the elsif
around for that to run it needs to be
less than 12 and greater than zero so
we're gonna say around is equal to 7 and
there you go so prints this hour here
the match is underway very cool so
that's a can drive variable variable
equal to the term to Nick to nari
expression set can drive variable so
here's our can drive I'm gonna set it
equal to the ternary I don't even know
if I've ever used a ternary expression
let's see what's going on here
so is equal to our fuel level greater
than 0
oh I like this oh I know what this does
are without having a look at it so this
is an if statement in a variable so
here's our character and we're saying we
we get our character we're saying is our
fuel liver level greater than 3 if it is
returned this is equal to why else it's
it's
equal to n I like this I don't know if
I've ever used one of those if I have
it's been quite some time I did see that
in like Python or PHP I forget which one
it was no all right so set the code lock
in a default case to system not no all
right so our default here like we were
explaining earlier is Nessie is in
position what the
No so I get dirty but uh our defaults
what happens when our switch statements
our switch checks our character says hey
switch for this value whatever it is if
it hits one of these marks in this case
it's an X so nothing would happen except
we'd run our default this said you know
like wrong answer try again so let's go
ahead and run that Messi is in position
or Missy look at the code in the code
editor select char variable LRC all
right so let's say she got her shot
blocked so let's go with C and this is
case sensitive so oftentimes what you'll
do for your characters a little beach
you'll do like go do penalty kick kick
dot to lowercase or whatever I forget
what it is and what this would do is it
would change whatever your character is
to lowercase and then you would set
these or uppercase and you would set
those so that you don't have to program
two cases like a lowercase L in a big
case L because it is case sensitive so
we changed it to C and she gets her
blocked most embarrassing of all things
so use the the precedence rules help you
evaluate an expression single line
comment above the tricky variable so
so we set this and then we're gonna set
boolean tricky is equal to and then this
and it was a question mark
well actually do they want us is that
what's it I don't think they want us to
do that I'm not sure they so boolean use
the precedence oh nice so precedence
rules so how do we do this we have to
use and so we want boolean tricky
so apparently after I went on the forums
what we're actually supposed to do here
is say what we think the answer to this
statement above is so it's three greater
than or equal to three
yes it's equal to it so that's true and
is true or true so it's true or true yes
that's true and that's not true thus
true and false so this is true this is
true or true returns true and not of
true is false so you have true and false
so our answer in this case is false
that's literally all we had to do and I
was so confused by what was going on
there
what oh not double equals there we go
all right if that didn't work I was
really gonna be soaked like ah what's
going on
all right so use boolean expression that
will print out the code if the else
block if seen so if 20 change that 2014
when we run it 2015 is less than 2014
it's false it prints out the else I'm
not sure where the train goes set the
value of the in variable subway train
equal to the case so equal to the case
this is a brooklyn-bound train so just
remember how cases work so you can you
don't have to use characters in this
case we're using a integer and you can
do that for quite a few things so you
can do that for pretty much every
datatype and bam we finished our
conditionals and control-flow sorry for
a little bit stutter step there but it
looks like it's not it's gonna be a
pretty quick Java course so hopefully
we'll get some more of it in and I'll
see you guys in the next video and as
always questions comments concerns and
anything constructive is appreciated I
mean that I mean that to guys like I get
that I get a lot of like oh good job
thank you it's like I love that but uh
if you are stuck on something someone
the other day is like why did you use
the the cubed function and they didn't
use the word function to them they're
like they don't know functions still so
okay cool I may have skipped over that
and I'm more than happy to go back in
the comments and comment about it so I
will see you guys next video and as
always constructive criticism thanks for
watching the video don't forget to Like
and subscribe that helps me out a ton
and I appreciate all the comments that I
get and all the questions I get in the
comments and I'm happy to answer them so
keep them coming and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
