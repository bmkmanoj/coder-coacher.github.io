intermediate algebra scripting doing the
bonfire some all numbers in a range so
essentially what we're trying to do is
we've taken an array of two numbers in
this case let's say one in four and we
want to just add them all together
everything from 1 to 4 so 1 plus 2 is 3
3 plus 3 is 6 4 plus 6 is 10 so it would
return 10 we do 1/4 so they give us some
helpful math dot Max and math dot min
sort of things to say hey you should
take a look at this and this might make
your life a hell of a lot easier and
turns out it does so instead of having
to iterate through an array time and
time again trying to figure out what is
the max value there's actually something
that we can just declare right here so
in this case I'm gonna create a variable
called Max and then we'll set it
actually this to let's do it max might
be a will say max no this time we'll set
it to the Matt we're gonna use the math
library and the math and then and in in
this case we wanted to use apply and
then null and then put in our array so
what does this do so obviously but at
this point you know we're creating a
variable here we're calling the math
library with the dot Max and apply is a
special type of function or prototype
that is going to find the max number so
you insert a null value here and then
the array the array that you want it to
find the max value of and so oh man they
did this for max so I wonder if there's
a min num and when I did it I just typed
in what I thought would be what would
work going off the convention and turns
out that this is exactly how you could
find a minim without having to go
through this whole craziness of
iterating through your own arrays and
writing code and getting it just right
and checking and spending time more or
less so we got our max number and we
have our minimum number so we still need
to
be able to add them all together and
return a result so how do we do that so
the way I did it was I just did a
looking back there's some better way of
doing this but I just did a creative
variable I set it equal to the range and
I subtracted to the max minus the min
and the reason I did that is I wanted to
set it for the for loop we're gonna
write in it right now I also kept a
total total variable this is instead of
equal to 0 right here and then now we
create our for loop so that total
variable is going to be there to keep
track of every time we add a number so
start at 0 and then 1 then plus 2 so
that's 3 and so on and so forth so in
this case I actually set the variable I
equal to 1 because the way I incremented
total I was always off by the first
index if we did the other way around
normally we start these at 0 though so
you see while I is less than our range
we want to and again there's probably
multiple ways of doing this but this is
just kind of the way I did it so we want
to take our total we want to add our
whatever our current total is in this
case is 0 plus the min plus I so we're
gonna be adding the minimum value so the
way the better way of doing this would
probably be to just start at 0 and
adding whatever the min value is or
actually I guess you have to do it this
way because then you're not necessarily
gonna start at 0 so this is how I did it
anyhow so we increment we get we get the
total range of what's in there so we're
right now from 1 to 4 we're getting 2 &amp;amp;
3 tol would return 5 more or less and
then we are going to set total equal to
total plus our max number and our min
number and that's going to be it we just
have to return the toll and we're good
to go
so you're on it max is not defined nope
this is maximum this is min numb and
this is I mean them and of course
make sure you do the correct variables
you know what's around that cool so as
always let's go ahead and put some code
in here uses math library to find max
number and all right cool
so next thing you want to do just
control paste this and then do our array
used to get range for for loop and so
little items total numbers to be added
ended alright and here we do it here
adding min and Max to total then
returning so always put comments in your
code we're gonna probably be Reesie
you're using this on this specific site
and I hope you found this helpful
there's multiple ways you can probably
do this this is the way I used and
that's why I highly suggest you take a
look at these uh helpful the helpful
links because they really are helpful
you see right here we didn't use a radon
reduced so someone probably did and
maybe found a better way of doing this
but at the end of the day as long as you
understand how to do it this should have
I hope this helped you out so thanks for

helps out more than anything else but as
always constructive criticism is
appreciated I'll see you guys in the
next thanks for watching the video don't
