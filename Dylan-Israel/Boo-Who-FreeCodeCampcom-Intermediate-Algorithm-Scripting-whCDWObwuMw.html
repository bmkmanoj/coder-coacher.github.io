algorism scripting the bonfire boohoo so
what we're trying to do here is to
essentially return whether a input is of
a boolean type so how do we do that so
if it's a boolean return true if it's
not a boolean let's say like the my name
Dillon it's gonna return false so if you
checked out the boolean objects
documentation you eventually would come
across something called typeof and this
will tell us the type so all we're gonna
check is if its type boolean so let's
get started so we're just gonna say in
if the type of our input wool is exactly
equal to boolean return true so let's go
ahead and run that real quick and so all
our true values here are gonna return
true cool but what about everything else
we can just put return false and if
you're like me I know this is probably
bad convention
I just prefer doing else's anytime I
have a if statement and then we return
false so a little a little about this
first important thing make sure you look
over the documentation second thing this
is pretty quick on the videos about less
than two minutes right now but to put
that in context I've spent about 20
minutes going through documentation to
get this code to look exactly how I want
it but let's just go ahead and put some
comments in here checks I have type of
returns boolean and then here we're
gonna put tie if it's not a boolean and
returns false cool so I hope you found
that helpful don't forget to put the
comments in code I really do think it's
the best way to kind of recycle code for
later on and I'll see you guys in the
next video
forget to Like and subscribe for
watching the video don't forget to Like
and subscribe if you enjoyed the content
I want to see more and also check out my
new series let's talk code that's gonna
have programming news tips and tricks a
little bit of tech and just a little bit
of my own personal hobbies and
preferences so if you enjoyed that go
ahead this very casual check it out I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
