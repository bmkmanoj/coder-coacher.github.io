histogram now in the race and hashes
what we'll be building this is an
example is um as always guys just to
kind of work our way through and see if
we know what's going on here
so this is gonna print text please we're
gonna get our text then going to split
it based off spaces frequencies we're
gonna create a new hash at 0 with dot
new 0 starting at 0 maybe then we're
going to see alright let's just see what
it does
text please cool cool 1 is 1 Dylan 1 ok
so this counts how many times I just I
believe so let's reset the code try it
one more time
so you're going Dylan is is is cool okay
it just kind of threw Dylan twice cool
once okay so
let's work our way through this alright
so we're gonna put in some text space I
guess we can see like alright I'll say
text equals get chomp and save it
tonight
Dylan cool next we're going to declare a
variable called words I said it equals a
result dot split on text all right so
remember to clear the words is equal to
text dot split and then doesn't actually
say what to do it here but I'm just
let's see if this works without okay so
I guess it just splits everything hi
this is where we need to use hashes
start words using hash
all right create a hash called
frequencies in the header and give it
value one alright so say ash eagles
hashed new let me go to value of zero
and that should work just fine maybe
might want to come with a better
oh we needed to call it frequencies it's
probably better that way rather than
having to create something a hash lower
case when just upper case is a already
keyword all right so let's see here so
it wants us to iterate over the words
alright you saying dot each so we get
red stud each for each we find assumed
that the word itself is it's a can't
frequence alright so I'll hang some
we're gonna go back to example one cuz I
might wear it so each alright alright so
let's see here
so assume that the word itself is a key
in frequencies and increment its value
in one let's see here we gotta go back
six I'm a little confused myself
alright so plus or equal to 1 so this is
our key this is their value then we
incremented by one okay
all right so there's the key or the
values right like so forwards then we
take the frequencies words
all right ashes of all we spent a little
weird for me I don't really use them too
much I there's a lot of things out use
instead of them use dot sort underscore
by all right so sort by color and count
I so surprised built in this example we
have a hash called colors that map's
color strings to numbers and then it
sorts to the colors okay
all right so in this case we want to
sort the frequencies
okay so it'll say frequency is equal to
frequency sort by and then we wanted to
sort by two things it has its key and it
has its value so justice in here it's
color and count will use name comma
number let's see if that will work for
us and then believe me may have to end
it right yeah we have to end and then
we'll do three once you stop reverse I
should reverse it let's see here
Dylan cool yeah okay cool Dylan sit so
reverse its back into frequency and cool
it's a little bit tricky but sure as we
get to
I'm sure as we get more familiar with it
I'll see them a little more natural
alright so here we're going to be
iterating over the hash with a do loop
but look
do we skip one I feel like we skip on I
guess not
all right everyone over the hurried over
done each key/value on the frequencies
so frequencies got each organ I do
because it needs to go through it and
then we'll say I think we did a
name-calling number amount might be more
accurate name calling them out and then
ask this to so we will put a plus and
then give you a space and then we're
gonna put a mouth then we need to end it
that should work
all right 911
see what it does right Oh Charlie I'm
sorry to hear that's where I'm not quite
sure what happened there as I saw
throwing me off is this looks quite
similar to what we're trying to do there
all right so we did it this is our new
histogram you can see here Dillon si si
si cool cool
still a little bit confused by this
section I might go back and just review
it a little bit I've never been too good
with hashes but um it's you know is what
it is let's see what the next section
method blocks and sorting y method
basically what we've been writing this
whole time is one method for the most
part or a function depending on what
language you're writing in so eventually
we will like you can see here where this
is uh basically our code but if we
needed to call our code instead of
rewriting it it would take in this case
a parameter and for instance two and
then would run the code with that to
filling its need so this is basically
where programming becomes programming to
a degree once you get we kind of got
through all the backtracking and all the
like
what you need to know before you start
to actually be able to write your own
code so that's kind of cool so we're on
our way
in Ruby and next section is method
blocks and sorting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
