the weekend livestream today we're gonna
be talking about a topic that so for
those of you who are new to this channel
every weekend I like do a quick little
last year and say hello do a little bit
of mentor and answer any questions that
I can try to provide value just
basically talk about software for a good
hour or so and today one of the things
that I wanted to talk about was a
individual who on a recent video
commented and I'm gonna read the comment
just a second about how he keeps on
essentially getting fired from his
developer jobs and how he essentially
keeps on losing jobs because for
whatever reason so that's how we're
gonna start off and after that why
everyone's funneling in will go ahead
and take some questions as always so
individual says hi Dylan I'm really I'm
trying really hard for the past five
years to learn to code in C and C++ for
embedded software to fill me but I'm
still not able to get good at C or C++
is because I'm not able to get a
detailed and complete understanding of C
and C++ am i able to code in C and C++
quickly I couldn't meet the expectations
of my boss for two years so I left the
job which was becoming increasingly
suffocating because I was not able to
grasp C and C++ concise fast pointers in
classes was not able to meet set
deadlines but set by my boss and I am
now studying for my master's course to
support myself financially I was doing a
working student job on embedded software
development usually C and C++ for the
from the past few months but this time
my boss a new startup fired me saying
that I did meet his expectations and
guess what I'm still interested in
software development using C C++ and
also in unity and game development using
c-sharp do you think I should pursue
coding so what we have here is an
individual who essentially is getting
fired because he's not cutting it and I
I honestly can say that I'm not sure how
to deliver a proper response to give to
him
I feel like if you weren't meeting your
expectations of your boss for two years
that's on you so for those of you don't
know a lot of times you'll get
internships for roll seven essentially
are exactly what this individual is
dealing with where you're going to you
get a job I can't usually be contract
hire there isn't a new contract hire
it's because they don't technically want
to have to fire you
they just don't want to work with you
anymore and there's some tax reasons and
all that sort of stuff so the in this
case I just think this guy is somebody
who's not putting in the work in I can
only imagine it's coding for five years
and saying that you've been coding for
five years but how much have you
actually been putting in the time and
the effort and the energy are you coding
every day are you are you building new
things are you just watching videos are
you building your own projects and I
feel like if you're in a situation where
you're getting fired and you're you're
getting laid off from your programming
jobs you need to re-evaluate what your
level of effort is well your level of
energy is and try and find out what when
what I would do so let's say I got laid
off from a software job said I wasn't
meeting their expectations what I would
do is I would I would inquire as to why
now it's going to be uncomfortable
conversation because you're essentially
to say you got fired it's never a good
conversation now you need to find out
why why did you decide that you no
longer want to work with me why is it
that you're ending this relationship
essentially and you need to fix those
holes in your grants because not meeting
your expectations a lot of things is it
your communication skills are you too
aggressive are you too passive is it the
fact that you actually just don't know
what you're doing and need to and it
sounds like if he's been doing C and C++
for five years and you don't know those
languages it's very concerning and you
if you can't hold a junior level role I
don't know what you're spending our time
on as a developer to get better and to
and I actually right now that him
spending his time in a master's program
is not going to make him even remotely
better and see
C C++ artsy sharper anything else
unfortunately a lot of people that's
kind of what they do when in reality
what's probably going to end up
happening for this gentleman is that
he'll have to if he doesn't put in the
time the effort and the energy he'll
have to actually go into a slightly
different direction maybe into quality
assurance that is a little less
technical or maybe in the project
management or business analyst or or or
something along that roads it doesn't
sound like that's what he wants to do
yet I'd be very it's I just find it hard
to believe that you've been coding for
five years and you're getting fired from
roles so anyhow that's my two thoughts
on it I apologize if I haven't been
doing as many live streams as usual and
I haven't been posting as many videos
but my computer was broken so I ordered
a new one and I don't know if you can
see this is my old one on the ground
over here you guys see it over there I
had to take the graphics card out of it
but uh anyhow I got a I got a new
computer let's see if you guys can see
that look at that look at that
you see I see that right there that's
the GTX 10-8
oops a gtx 980ti we got three friends
we got a liquid cooling on the CPU which
is a 16 core AMD thread Ripper I got the
SSD in there 32 gigs of RAM and kind of
create it to 64 but I need it in the
short term but uh so for those who have
been wondering where the videos have
been at that's part of the reason so
cost me a pretty penny but uh it's
something I use every day between
YouTube and work and studying and all
that sort of stuff but um I don't use it
for gaming so wasting money I I mean I
do game on occasion not too often I used
a lot of video editing tools and it I
can use it for pretty much anything so
you got the glass on the side there
glass on the front it's got I got a
couple of remotes for the coloring on it
all that sort of stuff
um hey Mark Samar cast really
your windows gonna be latching these
right now man I'm here so let's see
let's get some questions guys uh that's
what this is all about but two to the
back to the point of this the start of
this conversation if you are getting
fired from your developer jobs you need
to evaluate if you're putting in the
time effort and energy if you are you
can be a very good very good developer
but you have to put the time effort and
energy into it and a lot of people just
don't want to write that's just the
truth of the matter so I don't know what
else to say about it than that all right
huh looking beautiful sir thank you Hey
is it the facial hair is it is it the
braces Kumar how's it going electronic
course please hey Manu both men I need
to learn electron I haven't touched yet
what do you do when you're not able to
code fast enough I think what you're not
you're not necessarily referring to
typing speed I think what you're really
referring to is being able to deliver
products and it's something that you
need to find a more relaxed work
environment to be honest less time lying
driven and honestly at least the places
so a good workplace is flexible with
timelines a bad workplace has
unrealistic timelines and so if you're
in a situation where people are setting
unrealistic timelines you might want to
just remove yourself from that situation
and it sounds a little harsh and like
I'm not necessarily telling you to quit
your job but if that's the result if
we're like there's a point when you're a
developer where things aren't
necessarily complex a lot of times so
much as just time-consuming in the fact
that you're building some crud tool or
whatever it may be and you can envision
exactly how you're gonna do every line
of code but you know that it's going to
take several days several weeks just
based off the scope of the project and
people want it done by then people who
typically aren't technical and you have
to push back on that you have to give
realistic deadlines you have to explain
to them why and in a very simplified
non-technical manner so that might be
one thing I would do now if your ability
is just that you are really struggling
with
trying to build and implement projects
you just need a code more you need a
coat you need to go home you build your
own projects you work on your own
projects you need to solve algorithms
you just need to go until you can do it
you know quote unquote fast enough what
language you love I'm really uh big in
JavaScript typescript for the most part
if you want type count type script just
linguist just JavaScript mainly still
wind dolan the weeks to velvet a it's
coming dude I've promised don't don't
worry Dolan is going to be dropping that
hot fire
all right data structure important
learned for a front-end developer job
yes I know you have to understand how
data you're like how to define good data
structures as a front-end developer
because you want to be able to give
feedback to the back-end developers who
typically are designing the the the JSON
that you'll beginning and consuming on
the front-end and part of it is you want
to be able to contribute right
oftentimes you'll be building the
front-end even though I don't like doing
it before the backend is done and you'll
have to you have to be able to
communicate well this is why I think the
Davis structure should be this way and
they'll say this is why I think it
should be this way you need to be able
to talk about that so I think it's very
important you said gpgpu for
cryptocurrency a uh-huh maybe maybe I
know what type of vanilla J's project is
used is best to build for a portfolio so
I would worry less I would worry less
about what type of like you know
framework or JavaScript vanilla J's and
just what type of project in general the
best projects that are going to get you
noticed by other people other companies
whatever it is are unique ones stuff
that there's not a tutorial for stuff
that it's a law
term project you can show that oh well
this is a project that has been you know
continuing to develop stuff that's
unique to you right and the example I
always give to me and this is less hard
coding if you will
more of a soft coding seal is my youtube
channel that is what has always been
uniques for me to showcase okay this is
what I'm passionate about and you could
do something very similar let's say that
you are very interested in
cryptocurrency so you could make a you
could use some you can go and consume
some api's that deliver cryptocurrency
information and then you can just have
build charts build custom tools and then
later on as you get better you can add
authentication so people can though
going to find their own charts so on and
so forth how many courses have I
finished one one course I've finished on
udemy unless you're talking about school
of which I have since graduated from one
course that's weird way of saying that
I've since finished one course I started
school on the first I finished my first
course last weekend and then this coming
weekend a week from now I plan on taking
my second final my current goal is to
finish a single course every two weeks
and so far I've set up the easier
courses for me and it's been very easy
to to continue with that some of the
courses I may have to expect expand for
three weeks for the material I'm less
familiar with but yes so that's that's
in terms of courses in terms of like
udemy courses I finished one in terms of
college courses since I went back on the
first I have finished one everything's
going very well in that in that aspect
but then again my first course was web
dev and my second course is web dev and
which is kind of funny so to elaborate
on that just for a bit the something
that is ironic is I'm going back to
school just beefed up my resume at the
end the day and I have a chip on my
shoulder but I was actually hoping that
I would learn something now I didn't
believe I would but what I've learned so
far is a little bit more of a history of
the internet because the material in web
dev web dev five years ago is not web
dev
today because uh almost a renaissance or
so in the last decade if you will of
build tools of super set languages of
frameworks libraries the whole deal
right so so there's all this craziness
going on and you have courses on web dev
talking about like HTML for HTML 3 about
VB script that Microsoft uses and you
have to answer questions about this so
it's kind of it's kind of funny at the
same time it's kind of sad but hey it is
it is what it is
thoughts on becoming AWS solutions
architect slash developer AWS there's
some AWS certs that like if you get the
certification on average you make like
one hundred and twenty thousand dollars
but in terms of like working with in a
DevOps role which is what you would
probably be doing as a AWS guy I don't
see anything wrong with it I think it's
great
how much did my new PC cost about twenty
eight hundred dollars
so quite a bit yeah
is there ever a point where you go in to
work in web dev and you have nothing to
do nothing to do is relevant is all
relative I guess what I'm trying to say
there was a point about three four weeks
ago where I had asked my product project
manager for more work because I didn't
believe that the work that I had was
going to be sufficient now in that case
the reason for that is I like to be
overwhelmed by work I want to have so
many tickets that I can't possibly get
them done and the reason for that is
because I found that there is always
when you're only doing front-end and
other people are doing back in and
you're only doing part of a project you
oftentimes get blocked as you dive
deeper into a project so that ticket
stalls for two three days this ticket
stalls for two three days and so that
allows me to always have something to
work on so I've had two in the past and
about a month or two
talk with my manager my project manager
and say look I need more work I don't
have enough work I'm sitting here
watching angular videos trying to get
better at that because I'm waiting
because things are in flux and what that
has led to is more tickets which is
great some people would find that very
overwhelming I do not I don't care if I
deliver one ticket a week one ticket a
month the thing I do is I am constantly
working and whatever gets done gets done
and things that actually have hard
deadlines I will focus on and deliver
that so yeah anyhow so one of the things
with me as I want to always be busy I
don't want to be there sitting twiddling
my thumbs ever if I am I'm very unhappy
and so I I've talked with previous
people in the past one things that
they're going to be doing for me anyhow
and my current role is I'm moving from
front end to full stack and so I'll be
developing in c-sharp and dotnet as well
as angular in the front end and probably
still focus on the front end but I am
now moving to full stack I am finishing
up some some pure JavaScript application
front-end projects and then probably
starting late next week I will start
diving into the sea Sharps i pwned
pancakes oh hey Dylan finally got my
first gig from an oilfield company here
your channel definitely helped me out
guards the developer just wanna say
thanks and keep up the good work Thank
You mana congratulations on the new role
how hard is it to get freelance jobs as
a full stack web developer from Africa I
honestly couldn't tell you I think
you're gonna have to whether to get
freelance roles from anywhere you're
going to probably have to be able to
communicate that you're a good developer
very clearly that could be with a very
clear introduction letter a very clear
portfolio a a great resume in terms of
like if you're working on up work or
something like that having a great some
great reviews there as well from Albania
shout out to our boys from Albanian and
our boy Francisco Caballero
project ideas to go from beginner to
intermediate JavaScript the thing is is
just take an existing project and add
additional features and when you feel
like you finish that try to add
something new like I thought the example
I always give is authentication
authentication is something that is
definitely an intermediate point or if
you want to jump into the backend and
build some basic endpoints it all really
just depends but the the goal should
always be to keep moving forward as long
as you have that mentality it's it's
you're good to go
excuse me sorry guys that I'm something
I don't know what I ate like three
breakfast sandwiches and it's killing my
my stomach and my throat right now how
does how this start as a as a fresher
how to start as a new developer to show
the interview that we know that we have
knowledge about the programming language
well a couple things you have a github
that has projects to show that you
actually code you have a LinkedIn that
has us filled out to show your coding
expertise whether that be you know your
blogs that you've commented on the
projects that you've built the people
that you've collaborated with at
hackathons maybe you volunteer at
code.org things like that that's all a
great way to show that you aren't
actively learning what back
framework do I use in personal projects
I usually use node and MongoDB and
Express I'm I'm an in-school bro I suck
at math specially when it comes to
prisons but I'm pretty good when it
comes to programming classes you think
is important to be able to do proofs no
absolutely not if you're interested in
data analytics it may be relevant
because it is so massively if you're
looking to do full stack development
front-end back-end and it it varies but
it honestly no it's nine times out of
ten you don't need to you don't need to
be pulling out the god what was that
awful course I took back in college the
algebra that dynamic algebra the yum
he'll come to me later but yeah I
wouldn't worry too much about it should
I invest in a virtual private server to
run my web apps for my portfolio page or
just link to my github why don't you
just use like Heroku Roku's free if you
need a back-end for your application
what is github sir github comm check it
out after learning some basic vanilla
J's is the next step learning JavaScript
framework I would say build some
projects in vanilla J's and then jump
into angular or jump into react but
definitely make sure you're comfortable
with the basics with the language itself
not necessarily Dom manipulation because
it's very rare nowadays that you're
gonna be building anything in vanilla
J's in terms of the Dom manipulation but
I would definitely say you need to be
familiar with the higher-order functions
the array functions the string functions
the boolean functions or methods
whatever you want to call them that's
what you definitely need to be
comfortable with Joe echo daily for
freelancing no I have freelance in the
past for old companies I've worked with
and things like that but I don't do any
currently
I've been thinking about taking computer
science courses Open University distance
learning to think it's a good idea I
don't know I'd have to investigate the
program now I'm doing it I'm doing
online college and it's it's something
that you're gonna need to have a lot of
self-control
there's something that you're gonna need
to work out every day and it is uh it is
something that not that it's not for
everybody I could definitely see a lot
of people not succeeding so keep that in
mind when you do do it that it is a
active active effort at all times
are you watching UFC 220 tonight I will
indeed and for the main event I have I'm
picking Frances Nagato now it is a main
event fight the way that I see him
losing this if he does lose is that
steep a just sort of wears him down into
the third fourth and fifth round and he
tires out and that is kind of how steep
a wins but if Frances Nagato kisses
Hanazono that seriously thing I think
stupid could win this fight
but I think it's not going to happen
because I think he's going to try and
stand because stupid seems like he has a
a a chip on the shoulder about the whole
thing is a guy you have a complete grasp
of es6 before using react or angular es6
is uh is all relative right so es6
introduced classes but if you're
developing angular you'll be doing
classes with typescript now what you
really just want to understand in terms
of es6 are a few things you want to
understand the spread operator you won't
understand arrow functions you want to
understand let and const you want to
understand the what's the other one oh
there's a couple things i have a course
that i'm building right now that has
everything in es6 I think it's important
I discrete mathematics yes that was of
course I was talking about it was awful
I'm come fro since
people saw Survivor I'm working at home
but I've become clueless at some point
when I'm working on a project
nearing deadlines with the team what is
wrong with me I don't know man
working with a team is one of the best
ways to become a better developer in my
opinion I I personally love it in terms
of working I personally love my solo my
personal projects to be solo projects I
don't want to work with anybody on that
for this different why is it so hard to
get an internship I don't really think
it is I think you just need to change
how you're looking and how applying you
need to apply a lot you need to be
prepared in terms of having everything
you need as such as impressive portfolio
a LinkedIn a github a nice resume cover
letter letters of recommendation you
just need all that I mean once you have
all that it becomes much easier now if
you're applying without any of that or
missing part of it you're you're
essentially going the bottom of the list
you would for me if I was interviewing
didn't you know if you want to do full
stack why are you skipping no Jess I'm
not skipping no Jess I use node and
Express why do full stack and personal
projects force tanks is a deal I
remember that video did you did about
the Google Udacity scholarships I know
he's talking about a live stream where I
started off talking about the Google is
giving away like fifty thousand
scholarships Udacity and yeah so I
filled out the app because of your video
and I got in don't know if I'll get the
second part but almost know what the
first part thanks man you're welcome man
have I learned anything interesting
Concha far I've just learned a little
bit of the history of the web some stuff
about that's at some outdated knowledge
that it's interesting but no not really
yeah UFC to 20s tonight his bootstraps
still necessary with CSS grits you're so
screwed and bootstrap are two separate
things
Heroku hgr oh hey you
Dennis welcome is jQuery gonna die soon
jQuery is an interesting thing because
it's not going to die but it's is still
using is still on much like PHP which is
a cancer to the web it is still alive in
in the sense that it take it it is on a
large percentage of websites but what
you'll notice with both of those things
is they're slowly dwindling we're slowly
fighting the good fight and the pH P's
of the world and jquery's of the world
are going to die and burn no ice oh yeah
we got it we got to cut out the cancer
from the internet guys so jQuery is
something that is no longer relevant
it's how I would put it if you're a
entry level developer what you need to
be learning to get you the money to get
you the good jobs the art is react is
angular that's what you need to be
working with now will it go away no it
will not go away because a ton of
websites already use jQuery and in all
honesty a lot of people use jQuery when
they want to do Dom manipulation and go
from there what is your average day at
work like and how long are the days why
I did a video recently talking about my
day to day operations on the front end
Devin I encourage you to check that out
yeah but basically every day I go in I
typically so I typically show up about
an hour to an hour and a half early and
the reason for that is I study for class
I study some angular videos somewhat hat
so I do a little bit of pre prep and
then I I start my day and you know start
by answering emails I do become a couple
pull request some code reviews I have
some stand-up meetings I and I code so
I'd say about 2/3 of my day I code on
average
for content creation and online presence
do you think being more casual kill some
job opportunities in what are you
talking about me particularly or what
are you talking about a Kelvin
hello I'm new to the program I started
course on code Academy but I don't see
any usefulness in any of it well I I
mean considering all major companies
that are exploding have a software
aspect to it
I mean I guess I guess when you're just
starting it may be hard to see it but
what you really should be worried about
it's not whether it's useful at this
point you should just be trying to learn
the syntax I would say any websites or
books learn C++ I don't know man I I
haven't I haven't ever gotten what do
you have against PHP what's the problem
I PHP you know what I'm gonna do a video
about why I hate PHP and give you an
educated response how about that because
this is something that people I got
really upset about me just taking a dump
on PHP but I'm gonna I will take a dump
on PHP and I will cite my sources and
we'll go from there
what I think about the main site I think
is a great entry level stack to help you
get started um okay Dylan where do you
see yourself after your graduate and I
have a university degree on your resume
um I don't know uh my life is very
interesting the fact cuz I love where I
work but I also am aggressive with my
salary so if I got in I can really
imagine if my boss is watching this but
I'm a I'm pretty open honest about what
I want out of my career so if I graduate
before my one-year review which I think
is possible I will be very aggressive
with my salary if I don't I'll be semi
aggressive with my salary and go from
there that's how I see it
now my sort of short-term goals is to
work on YouTube to develop courses to
write book all those sorts of things are
going to
kind of take away sight till I finished
my university degree hey how about
network security cyber hacking and all
those that's a very broad question our
cover letter is important at all it's a
very time-consuming process for instance
the time consent we're gonna side
projects practicing five word energy so
the way that you write cover letters so
you don't write a unique cover letter
for every employer what you have is
about five or six different cover
letters and in those cover letters
there's sort of a main theme to each one
of them and all you really do is swap
out different names different addresses
and then you're done so yes you have to
take you have to take an afternoon to
write three four five cover letters
whatever you think is different and what
might be what you might focus on one is
you know you talk you start talking
about specifically your your web dev
skills and go into more emphasis about
JavaScript and types here for those
types rules and other rules maybe talk a
little bit more about how you go to
meetups and whatever you think is
relevant so that's how I write cover
letter so I sort of have three or four
and then I just swap out names and dates
and things like that and addresses such
coding whilst you learn any jobs
I mean you I I'm a software developer I
know what do you like I mean you learn a
little bit of business aspects and
things like that marketing but every
jobs gonna be different
can I make a in-depth video about on
your resume github my portfolio fits
several I've kind of gone over it
briefly I don't know if I did
I was looking into starting YouTube
channel i prefer channels like yours
because your casual tone is more real
but I'm more self-taught so I thought it
might hurt I wonder if I should take
this casual tone as a offence like I
always wonder when people say that I'm
like casual like what like well like how
am I suppose to be more professional
well that's what I sit up straight would
I not have a Starcraft shirt on anybody
yeah so start a youtube channel when
you're just starting out I started my
youtube channel two years eight months
ago and I was still a computer science
student in school and I was just doing
like job like tutorials on coke Adam II
that's how I started my channel and I've
been working at ever since and you know
the reason I bring that up is I think
it's always a great time starting
YouTube channel because it's a it's a
marathon and you want to start the
marathon as soon as possible
and not a sprint because by the time
that you want to start a channel you're
gonna already want to have the views
you're gonna already want to have the
subscribers want to have the people
watching like the fact like I'm looking
right now we have 80 people watching
that is a fantastic number for me and I
remember when there was zero people
watching the livestream or you it would
go from zero and then go one two three
right and then three people would leave
he'd go back to zero alright and so it's
it's one of those things where it is a
great thing to start on and you start
earlier you learn you progress as a
developer you progress to somebody as a
content creator I don't think it hurt
you I think if anything my youtube
channel is done more for my career than
anything else and it has essentially
made me unique candidate which I think
all all developers should strive for
when you're getting started aren't event
are the developer industries introvert
friendly I think so I mean a lot of
developers are awkward guys in terms of
I mean I'm awkward in my own way don't
get me wrong but I'm probably more of
the I'm a bit of an introvert and it's
kind of crazy right because like Here I
am throwing out hundreds of videos of
myself on the internet but like if you
met me I might be I'll be friendly but I
probably be a little bit
depending on the situation but yeah I
would say by and large the developer
community is introvert friendly now I
will say from a business perspective
that if you are an introvert and you're
not very good with communication you're
not going to just statistically speaking
your career is not going to progress as
well so it may be something that you
want to overcome is it worth me trying
to get a computer science degree I have
a portfolio tell myself some computer
science versus what my academic
achievement alone
it's all relative man you don't have to
have a degree by any means I do very
well I've a working developer I'm going
back to school for a couple of reasons
but I would do just fine if I didn't
have one so it's all it's all relative
what is a cover letter cover letter is
sort of an introduction statement about
who you are as an individual and why you
want to work with said company that
you're applying to to sell finish
projects work in a portfolio site I'm
not sure what a self-initiated project
is James first off MA my man my man
James take take a second and go download
Visual Studio code it's the best text
editor out right now you need a ditch
atom man I say this ain't 2016 anymore
boys you need to ditch the atom text
editor and go get yourself Visual Studio
code all right what would be
semi-aggressive after one year a 15%
raise that would be that would be
aggressive
that would be aggressive a semi
aggressive would be a 10 percent and a a
okay we're we're meet at a 5% I would
say that would be something I would yeah
so that that would be how I would define
semi-aggressive an aggressive in 2018
for a web designer sketch or Photoshop
slushie illustrate honestly I could tell
you I don't do web design how the cats
are great we actually might so Milo has
had some teeth infecting his mom so he
has autoimmune disease we found out so
he had he has to get like a shot every
five months to essentially make it so
that he doesn't scratch on himself and
nip at him so we're taking them annexed
we kiss get two teeth pulled out though
unfortunately because of it casual is
good as it's your style of how you pitch
the info which is stuff how some of us
want to be taught your like a friend
news talk just sue info we're all boys
right even the girls you're our boys too
all right so we got to keep we got to
keep it 100 as Ray J would say can you
listen to music yeah so I have headphone
everyone for the most part head has
headphones and in there
imagine having 80 people in a room
that's really puts in perspective it's
kind of a trip right imagine if I'm just
up here
shooting the with 80 of you over
there in your underwear right it's not
what they tell everyone to just just
think of an idea which is a really
strange thing to say
and even stranger that it caught on what
are some tips I have a get an
entry-level junior web developer
position for someone seeking the first
job as a developer first off make sure
you have the skills that people are
looking to hire entry-level developers
secondly make sure you have practice
practice practice you need to be
prepared at all times and you need to
actively apply a lot of times people
think oh I'll just apply to two to three
jobs a day no you need to be applying to
fifty to a hundred jobs a day and you
may think I'm exaggerating I am NOT also
I think you should be willing to
relocate if you're gonna relocate you're
going to compete against less people and
you're going to be able to open yourself
up more opportunities so you're so you
know Dylan but I want to stay in my home
my family okay that's cool
go back after three years of experience
go back after five years of despair go
back after two years of experience one
year whatever it is but your main goal
should be to get a job how to learn
nodejs well install node decide what you
want to build using node and maybe
Express and go on from there lots of
love from India a India's second most
watched country on this channel we got
nothing but love for our Indian brothers
out there so higher math we actually
answered your question at the early
beginning of this video
couldn't meet the expectations of my
bosses two years to come is you think I
should continue to pursue coding my
thing is man that I don't think you're
putting the effort or energy I think
that if I think that if I think that if
you work you wouldn't have any issue but
I honestly can't base that off anything
else anything really have I proposed yet
am I've honey to the wedding I feel like
you're a secret a secret a it's like
you're April secret account you're
trying to plant seeds
do we get to use our preferred tools for
working it all depends on the
organization but for the most part yes
aye sir
I subscribe to your channel when you're
around 1k subscribers and one of you in
wonder your live streams you said you
were that you're gonna be marrying once
you have a hundred thousand subscribers
I have 100 salary job what is all this
marriage talk man can't a man just be
dating the woman of his dreams for seven
years and not have to seven or eight
it's hard to keep track eight years and
not have to put a ring on it
everything's going great everything good
I had no problems do African developers
need to be paid hourly with the United
States race I mean honestly it's all
relative you could pay what you can I
don't know how often should you ask for
a race my thing is usually eight a race
as a developer every year every single
year and if you don't you need to
there's a there's a there's a company
around the corner who will give you a
fat one if you go and leave so am i very
close to reach 100k subscribers 100k
salary I will probably reach 100k salary
in two years I think maybe three and I
will reach 100k subs let's see
currently I'm ground by like twenty one
twenty two hundred subs a month so
what's that a year twenty five about two
to three years off I'll reach 100k if I
don't join it so about the same time how
to get clients if you're in Africa
probably just online I'd be my guess how
long does it take to become a full-stack
developer as long as it takes you
yeah obvious code it's legit what type
of portfolio projects guys this needs to
be unique stuff you don't want to be put
in like weather apps and calculators and
to do applications that's the stuff you
build when you're learning to code and
there's nothing wrong with that but if
you're trying to impress an employer you
don't build those sorts of things you
need build custom things new stuff 5800
applications is a bit excessive I think
cover letters should be job specific at
minimum and resumes - really 5,200
applications is really spring freight
just my two cents well it is definitely
spray-and-pray 100% but that's really
what you have to do in in reality now
your resume should be job specific but
typically you're going to be applying
for junior level roles and if it's a if
you're okay going to a front-end role
you have a front-end resume yet you're
going to okay going to back in role you
have a back-end resume and if you're
going to a full sack role you have a
full sack resume and honestly as a
junior developer they're all going to
look alike now your cover letter should
be yes you swap in different things and
maybe you have two paragraphs that are
the same for every cover letter and then
you write that one paragraph there but
you will be putting in if the eight is
you will be more successful filling out
fifty to a hundred job apps and doing
custom cover letters and custom resumes
to a job how complex will code usually
be in real world that's it kind of
depends I mean it's all it's all
relative to what company you're working
with and what projects you're building
on are you gonna shave your mustache no
it's a little darker in the center and I
got the light going on I basically just
been using a beard trimmer on my face
for the last two weeks April wants me to
keep a little bit of facial hair
what's going on with Miss
don't like so the PC broke and I'm
working on it guys don't worry don't
long dolana's coming alright
tabs or spaces tabs I think we all know
the answer that follow-up question I
have the skills but the problem I'm
facing so far is I've been playing to a
lot of positions I qualified by only
ever hear back otherwise is your silence
so a lot of times people are intimidated
to apply for positions that let's say
you have zero years experience that says
three years minimum this apply to it
there's no harm takes 5-10 minutes
applied to more roles than you think you
can that you're qualified for and
eventually you'll you know you never
know they may but what they may want is
a junior developer but if you're if
you're competent you have skills and you
just get a phone interview another thing
is applied daily to the jobs that go out
that day sometimes people are wasting
their time applying to two roles that
just don't all right they're already
filled it's just a week old thing and
they've already have 10 candidates and
they're talking less so his web
development markable everywhere else in
Kenya it's not people who don't know the
value of what to film it I mean it's all
it all depends on what country ain't a
lot of software and tech jobs in the
United States so Chavez like today the
chat is lit oh I like that word late I
don't know how that why isn't that
caterpillar ironing your nose man what
would yo guys why you hating on the on
the stache it doesn't look that bad
more year left at CSULA that's where I
dropped out of college in case a no when
I was back in school before I went back
when I was in school and I dropped out
of his cat Cal State Los Angeles I'm
below average developer I just went to
school just to screw I feel other people
outright mean when it comes to what jobs
what would you do I would start side
project so I would start coding on the
weekend so I turned this last year as a
developer I'd focus entirely on getting
those skills up that's what I would do
uh have you ever been fired and know
someone from a developer job why they
were fired yes I
well not yes have I ever been fired but
I have known people who have been fired
oftentimes just because they can't do
the job oftentimes it's because it's
it's kind of funny so the people who are
the the people who are who get fired are
so worried about showing that they're
bad at development that they end up get
firing and what I mean by that is when
you need help as a developer it is okay
to ask other developers force that help
it is okay to reach out to the tech
leads to the senior developers to the
other junior developers to say look
ma'am I am lost I don't know the source
code I am overwhelmed just can you sit
down can you pair program with me
ninety-nine percent of the time they
will and what happens is a lot of times
people are so worried because maybe they
lied on my resume and which a lot of
people do I'm not saying you should and
I'm actually saying that you shouldn't
what I hit but there are people who do
that and those are typically the ones
who get fired and they're so worried
about exposing the fact that they lied
on their resume and that maybe when they
put angular or they put JavaScript on
there they looked at they they they did
that and they were like well I took a
JavaScript course on code CAD me so I
know JavaScript yeah that's not really
so if you get high because of that then
yeah you're gonna need some help and
you're gonna be exposed and so people
are so worried about exposing themselves
that they just let things to Windows
Windows don't know it's windows window
and never get it done and then they get
fired
that's usually what happens
what's the biggest reason to choose
Visual Studio code over Adam Adam would
crash with large file sets for me that
was my biggest thing if I business
management Bachelor should I put on my
junior resume even though it's not 100%
relevant you 100% should always put your
college degrees on your resume don't
care if it's literally in music theater
whatever it is put it on the resume it's
okay to start with Java instead of the
usual path
I mean Java is the usual path for some
colleges it just kind of depends Java is
gonna be a little bit of a harder
language to learn than something like
JavaScript as your first language partly
because there's a lot of very specific
rules that go along with Java that you
don't have and maybe a more dynamic
language like JavaScript thoughts on
static site generators they are taking
some of the web design jobs
I got stashed but not as qualified it's
a good job I like code janitor Hey yeah
yeah I mean you guys all of the stash
let's just be real all right
mustache and
race is not good kamma these things are
coming off I think in about six weeks
six weeks boy hi again 88 yeah we're
getting favourites let's see if we can
hit that 100 keep it 100 I if you guys
love trashy television I don't know I
don't watch too much television but I
used to go watch for love of Ray J
season 1 and season 2 is probably my
favorite show of all time a quick
question last semester an IT specialist
Asian web dev any advice to give job
pays around 40k of some benefits 40k is
pretty I mean it it's all it's all
relative to what degree not what degree
what region you live in but 40k with
benefits and a college degree is is
really really probably pretty low in the
United States but my advice to you as
someone looking to get a decent salary
is to go outside the box and have a more
impressive resume than everybody else by
having projects by having a portfolio a
portfolio site active github by
volunteering maybe doing blog posts
doing tutorials just essentially setting
yourself apart from everyone else I
definitely recommend you take an
internship and work at a corporation
before you start freelancing or doing
contract work do you need know how to
shop nowadays see a job now how did you
plan out
moving to Florida when you knew no one
had no money I had no place to say the
Biggers he took so um I've talked about
this briefly in the past but I'll
summarize essentially I knew that I was
willing to move out of state so I moved
back home and my mom said I could stay
with her for one month without paying
rent and so my goal was to get a job
within that one month and I did but I
moved back home so I don't have a lease
or anything and then I start applying
1,500 jobs a day and then when I got a
job in Florida I - I accepted instantly
I gave my two weeks and at that moment I
then booked a air B&amp;amp;B for 10 days
cheapest Airbnb I could finally was like
13 or 14 dollars a night and I had by
the time I left and I drove down there I
had about God maybe $700 to my name at
that time like I didn't have much money
at all
there's definitely under a thousand
dollars by the time I got to to Florida
and I stayed in the air being excuse me
no I take it back I had like $1500 and I
had I had I gave a deposit
I basically what I did was I stayed one
or two nights in the Airbnb and from
there I then rented a room that I found
on Craigslist and I just started
grinding it out like like you would how
do I know my programming knowledge is
enough to get a job go get a job
interview and see no one's gonna you
know go and tap you on the back say you
ready man
you're good a lot of you guys are
probably ready you just have to you know
work yourself up and you get in there
and continue learning once you get a
role that's probably the most accurate
way of determining of determining it how
did you approach salaries when you first
start applying for dev jobs you just
take what they gave you or did you give
them a specific range when I forgot my
very first web developer job as a junior
dev which was my last job incidentally
they they asked me when I've been
interviewed what was I expecting to be
paid for the position and what I said
was I would like to be paid the
the average rate of a developer with my
years of experience based off the
standard in Florida what that came to
was sixty-two thousand dollars and so I
got paid sixty two thousand and then I
it went up by five grand after three
months to sixty seven and that's how I
knew go she ate my first salary because
that was something that I thought was
fair how much free time do you have per
day uh not much right now I wake up
around 6:00 to 6:30 I am out the door by
6:30 or 7:00 I get to work around 7:30
for 7:00 between 7:00 and 8:30 I study
for school I study maybe a little bit on
udemy watch some videos and then I work
till about 5:30 I Drive home till 6:00 I
study I have dinner with April for about
30 minutes I usually do about 30 minutes
to an hour of YouTube stuff and I do
about an hour studying then I go back to
bed that's usually my Monday through
Friday
have I watched em ship channels not not
in a very long time yeah are you doing
Dylan good man
welcome welcome I was wondering when you
got hired are you loud to use them but
you're going to have to use what they
have to the company it's all relevant
it's all relative rather to what you're
trying to
how many projects should one have before
applying to in ships a lot of projects
is good but it could be as little as one
project it's an impressive project but
if I had to choose a number I think
three because that way you can showcase
multiple skills whether it's different
frameworks or different technologies
well Eric I mean be willing to relocate
right so when I booked the air B&amp;amp;B I
drove you know 2,800 miles it was awful
I drove for three and a half or four
days straight I stayed at like the janky
astrayed roof in Sandwich I'm like god I
hope I don't get assaulted and then I I
got stopped at Texas by like eight eight
eight Border Patrol and and they had
guns drawn and there is sketch but but
yeah I mean sometimes you got to take
chances guys general opinion Ville
the competitors program hey man if you
can do it I mean I've come in a lot last
place enough in my life to know that I
can't compete with people doing
competitive okay uh look man I could
take Elle's and things but like why go
and get an L that you know you're gonna
get one up but no I think I've probably
got you I've gotten to a couple
hackathons they're kind of fun but I
mean they're always interesting making
60 70 K per year I mean that's what I
was making my last job yeah well
fully relaxed relying employers spend
the extra minute takes login or a login
page scare them off so I would say that
what I would say chase Davis is I think
the login page is awesome because it
shows authentication it shows additional
things I don't think it was scared them
off but if something that you're worried
about what you could do is create a
temporary account or account
specifically for people looking to check
your portfolio in your cover letter you
supply the account and the password and
go from there all right uh so I am gonna
have to ban explore how to avoid
Explorer because I I can't stand when
people spam the chat man it's like look
man I don't know what you want I'm a
white guy in the United States I have no
idea how much what the market is in
sherry Lanka I have no idea I've never
been sherry Lanka I don't know the job
market intimately in sherry Lanka so
we're gonna put you on timeout you need
to go in the corner alright so I mean I
appreciate that you want an answer but I
can't give you and I'm not just gonna
give you an answer I don't know man I
don't know what to tell you so yeah I go
on timeout yeah I mean you can always
March April May you can you can always
start applying and just if something
happens happens but it's always hard to
get that first job
once you got hired for angular job do
you know everything single thing about
angular know my last role I got hired
for an angularjs role and what happened
there was I essentially built my my my
current site for the channel which is
coding tutorials through 60 comm and
that got me the job and then I'd learned
angular a little bit more in detail
what's learned after a channel CSS
JavaScript maybe some get and maybe
maybe some we call it get and a
JavaScript framework how much you make
and actually take in after taxes my
paychecks after I pay for my benefits
and after I pay taxes and in my actual
pocket I get about $2,100 every two
weeks after taxes after paychecks after
deductions all this or so what do you
think about going after building a
startup you think you have to reformat
that one but thanks for answering all
the questions a man that's what this is
about what's up with the green
background
it's why you stir the green screen it's
just a painted wall so let me see here
Canada I might be you know what no I'm
not gonna play with it but yeah so
that's that's this Jill I'm sad you
broke your promise about the Jes course
sorry my computer broke I wanted to put
it out but I'm gonna put it out don't
worry I'm expanding upon it I am NOT a
fan of soccer what is the possibility
get a web developer job freelance in the
US for people I said yes I couldn't tell
you I don't think it's impossible though
I could put a cool background on the
green screen wall sure it's not right
now this new computer doesn't have the
software installed on it yet how does
knowing
syntax of a language translate to
building an app well you have to know
how to build an app you have to know a
language to be able to build an
application like how are you going to
build it if you don't know what your
tools are and if you don't know what
your materials are if you say I'm going
to build a house and I ask you with what
and you say no I don't know I'm just
gonna build it I say well are you gonna
use wood don't know are you gonna use
brick don't know you know are you gonna
is it gonna have carpet are you gonna
use nails and hammers don't know what
any of that is but I'm gonna build a
house got you are you kind of seeing my
point here you have to know the syntax
you have to know the language to know
whether it's how it's possible to build
said house did I lose any money on
Bitcoin stuff no I'm up about 300% on on
that stuff give or take a little here
there can you make an you learn react
courses I have a basic introduction
angular pour portfolio project in the
description if you're interested in my
first angular course how I visit Africa
or can you have not I'd like to one day
fortunately I need to go for the
my friend answered a frico can apply
that's over 60 places I even could I
resume try stand down still no luck any
tips online my first job
60 is not enough you need to be doing
like 50 a day what's your perspective
and opinion programming channels for
2018 or in general I think it's a a
great space to be in I think a lot of
people I mean the in terms of job
channels programming is a niche within
that and I think it's something that's
going to continue to grow and I think
it's excellent for your resume I mean if
you talk about the time and money that
so if you talk about the amount of time
I put into YouTube right now I'm making
about $500 a month in ad revenue and I
make I make about that in sponsored
videos and in sponsorships and things
like that but in terms of time it's
really not worth what you get out of it
per money if you were to add you know
the months that I was making $3 a month
and but the where you get your where you
get your value is in becoming a better
developer as well as becoming a
interesting candidate and having a
portfolio project that very few people
can duplicate and that is where I've got
my value with my programming channel can
can I evaluate on where any front-end
development using templates yeah so a
lot of times when you're learning to
code you sometimes don't even know how
to do certain things like you don't know
what to Google you don't know it to how
to how to go about it so let's say you
have this awesome website that you have
a template for for instance and you have
all the source code and what you can do
is you can then start customizing said
template to fit your needs and what will
happen is you're gonna be introduced to
a lot of different things in the process
and you can also go about the route of
hey I want to code out this navigation
and I want to see if I can build
something that works exactly like it and
I'm looking at it and I'm building it
and you know and it but you have the
code so you can dive into it to kind of
get some hints and and go about it so
that's kind of how I used to do it and I
found it very helpful it's exactly what
I did with my website coding tutorials
360 calm as well
do you have any colleagues transfer from
County and slash finance background a
codeine at two workplaces ago I had a
couple economics majors that went into
data analytics what I learned Visual
Basic for Anarchy job uh no I think I
get to 200k on my own in about five six
seven years I don't know I mean I I if
it's two hundred case today but hey well
hire you give you an OK unofficial basic
probably but that's not really realistic
situation if money wasn't problem for
you anymore would you plan on doing the
rest of your life uh that's very
interesting thing I probably would
definitely do YouTube just maybe not
necessarily I mean I really do enjoy
YouTube I do enjoy the the teaching
aspect learning aspect but I also enjoy
the coding aspect so I probably would
just be doing my own projects that's
really what I would do I was probably
starting businesses and it's got a crazy
started business to make money a lot of
times but I'd be starting businesses not
only to make money even though I had
money but so to just be successful I
guess alright guys so we've been going
about an hour I appreciate all of you
tuning in I of course will have a new
video out on Monday every Monday I
release a video this this Monday is
about freelancing so if you're
interested on some tips for freelancing
I know and I I know quite a few of you
asked some questions about it that is
what that is what a Monday's video will
be about I encourage you to check it out
and I also encourage you to just keep on
grinding it out every Saturday I will do
these live streams so that we can answer
your questions I help you out in the
best way can I know that I know that
it's frustrating at times and it's you
know not ever it not everything is a
clear-cut path and a lot of times when
you're learning software there is so
much information it can be overwhelming
so I will always do my best to help you
out in
the grind in the journey to the best of
my ability I appreciate all of you
tuning in and if I could leave you with
one thing to think about I always try to
end on some sort of final thought in
honor of Jerry Springer is that when it
comes to hard work often times you're
putting in hard work in daily and you're
getting no payoff until you do what I
mean by that is you know we if we're all
grinding away at something in our life
and we're putting on the time we're
playing the the the effort the tears and
and it's stressful it sucks and we
haven't got the payoff but it eventually
comes and it all becomes worth it what
you have to make sure to do is just keep
on staying on the straight and narrow
keep on putting in the work keep on you
know making sure that tomorrow you're
one step closer and if you do you'll get
to your destination whether that is to
build your project whether it is to get
a junior level role whether it is to
transfer careers and become a better
developer so I want you to keep that in
mind to say as long as you're grinding
it out and you're moving forward you'll
eventually get there but if you give up
doesn't matter if maybe tomorrow was the
day that you got your lucky break or not
it will it will come because you stopped
working towards it so just keep working
hard guys and grind in and I'll see you
next time have a wonderful weekend bye
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
