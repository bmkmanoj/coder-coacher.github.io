string so console output date in time so
as you can see I already did this
section a while back when I was
preparing for a Python course so I'll be
resetting the code as we go so the
date/time library so this is how you
import from a library and Python so
we're from date/time import date/time
just from the main file import this
necessary set the code alright so if we
want to use date/time dot now so we
we're gonna basically just say create a
variable come now we're to say now is
equal to date/time dot now and then
we're going to print now and this should
print date/time now and we'll see what
time is so 2015 it's the first four
where they're at not where I'm at and
it's 4:40
it looks like it's 1 or it's a 12 a.m.
12:40 a.m. there you go so so now on a
new line it's asked to print now dot
year so this will get just the year now
print now yeah print now top month
welcome to getting just a month and then
print now dot day will get the day so
year a month day cool alright so to
print the current date in the form of
month month day day year year year
change string so that it used as a slash
instead of amber since so okay let's do
this
instead of a - character oops
so you can see that it's formatted
already so you want to change this so
that it's formatted the way we want it
rearranged framers right so we want
months all right so let's just control
exercise month/day/year put that's at
the end take out the ending comma and we
should be good to go so 921 2015 let's
reset this again so now we want to
change the similar last exercise we want
to change the string of that you're
printing so that it holds the colon
signs so instead because we're now going
to be doing hour minute second now dot
our now dot minute and now dots and then
now dot second and we have to change our
output to colons and bam so there's our
12 a.m. 46 minutes 12:46 am i to start
the format string to the left
change the format string the left so I'm
sure that it has six print the date time
alright so now we need to add some stuff
here so there's two different things we
can do here how does it want us to do it
does it just want a one big string okay
so that's fine so we're gonna put a
space Oh actually we're gonna do in
front because it looks like it's month
month day here so put his face there and
then we're gonna BAM s / BAM s slash and
then BAM X and now we just have to put
the crixus so we have now dot months
comma now a dot year or now today common
now
here all right let's see and there we go
we have the date and we have the time
and that was it cool little use from the
date and time library for Python up next
we'll be getting into a little bit more
programming sort of related stuff you
can see we're messing around with
functions and control flow and
conditional statements so I will see you
guys in the next five tone video and as
always anything constructive is always
welcome Thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
