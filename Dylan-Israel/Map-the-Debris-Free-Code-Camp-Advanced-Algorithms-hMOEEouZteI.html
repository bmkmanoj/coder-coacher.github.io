advanced algorithms I keep on butchering
my equation here and this is like my
fourth attempt but this time we're gonna
do is so let's go ahead and get started
what do we need to know for this we need
to know this orbital period equation two
pi square root of a cubed over gravity
times are combined masses so they've
already given us our GM and our earth
radius which we're going to use with the
average altitude to get our a cubed so
all we have to really do here is create
a simple equation store it in a variable
and return that variable let's go ahead
and do that right now so we're gonna
create a variable called results and
we'll do this one step at a time so
we're gonna set this equal to two times
math dot pi this is just using the
built-in math library when we return
results right now we should get like six
point two eight all right so our math
dot pi is working the next thing that we
want to do is get the square root of
something so how do we do that just
simply math dot square root and then
we're going to get the square root of
our a cubed over our GM which we already
have equated here so how do we get the
power and how does power work getting a
number two like the third power or the
fourth power it takes in two parameters
the value that you're gonna jump up in a
terms of power and then to what power so
in our case we're gonna go ahead and do
math dot POW and then our first
parameter is going to be the earth
radius that they give us plus our
average altitude right here now you'll
notice that this is an array with one
object in it so we want to target our
first index or excuse me our average
altitude value in our object so let's go
ahead and do that we're gonna go ahead
and take our array or our our target the
zero index dot
average out now we're not done yet
because we still have to say to what
power we want to put this and that's to
the third power this is the second
parameter here and then finally we want
to go ahead and divide this by the GM
that they give us when we run this
you'll see we have a very large number
now it's not you'll see it we're very
close but it's not exact so what we're
gonna have to do here is just use
another quick thing from the math
library math dot round and we'll just go
ahead and do like so and now we have
math dot round 86,400 so this is right
and instead what we want to do is we
want to go ahead and just change this
value now what could what can we do here
we can actually just create a simple
array let me set VAR R is equal to this
is a VAR r new array is equal to an
object here and I don't have objects so
what do we want to put in here we wanna
have named the same name be R 0 dot name
and then from here we want to go ahead
and just go ahead and add in one more
value and we're gonna call this orbital
period and for that we just want to pass
in results and then finally go ahead and
return new array and we're done so that
is what we're trying to do here
now that just returns the first one but
we have to continue on with one more it
looks like so let's go ahead and jump
right into that aspect alright so if
you're still stuck and you're like oh
well man we have the second equation we
just have to change our code that's only
working for one instance to work with
multiple arrays so what do we have to do
to make that work we're gonna create a
for loop here with VAR i is equal to
zero
and while i is less than our array that
we're passing in length i plus plus in
here we're gonna take our results
variable throw it in here and instead of
this zero all we're gonna do is pass in
the current index that we're iterating
over and we'll go ahead and set our new
array just equal to an empty array and
then within here what we want to do is
go ahead and take new array and push
this object into there finally just go
ahead and change this at zero to an eye
and we now have the code that did not
seem to want to work also no so let's
see what I did wrong
so far results are not length I plus
plus new array dot push oh oh right here
so make sure that you don't have a
double alright and we're good so real
quick go over it one more time we have
our IGM variables and earth radius
variables we're creating an empty array
we're then iterating through the array
parameter that is passed into our
orbital period function we have an
equation here that we use three or four
separate math library functions and then
we're we're pushing an object to the
array for each iteration and then once
the for loop is done running we're
returning the new array so as always
