oriented Java object-oriented Java what
is even the point of naming it twice I
do not know anyone you know why don't we
change it a little bit but when there's
only four sections with four different
categories you really don't have many
things you name it you know that's a
separate topic altogether check out the
code editor it incorporates classes
objects and methods after a slushee
label or a read and write programs use
object-oriented programming using the
object-oriented programming model so
let's uh let's go over there example
real quick before we see what we're
gonna be making here so it kind of makes
sense so in lat we're working with this
class called Mouse it's going to extend
from the rodentia Java class here so in
here our mouse class takes in a
parameter that's a string name so here's
our and this is our constructor this is
basically saying this is how things get
made when we're making a mouse this is
what helps us make it and then we have
custom functions for our mouse eat here
you know name plus eat some cheese or
this isn't actually for the for the
mouse itself but we'll be able to do
that or it is rather so oh my god these
cats driving me nuts right now all right
so then we have public void solve maze
and this is takes an integer with
minutes and then when we call it it's
going to print out the name and the
minutes and then here is our main method
so the only reason we're gonna be able
to see this code run is because this in
our main method we created a mouse
called rattly we set it equal to a new
mouse and his name parameter is rattly
and then he's gonna eat so rather than
eat some cheese and he's gonna solve the
maze in three minutes and rallied order
his order and let's see what that is
Oh so order is a method in here called
so that's why we're able to call the
Rodentia class method it's because Mouse
inherits from rodentia rodentia I guess
I say so in the code editor create a dog
class so we're gonna say class and then
we're just gonna go ahead and name a dog
let's run it good to go
add a class constructor called dog to
class so we need to set it public so we
can create it and dog and then their
side cool
so start constructor we're not really
doing too much but these we're just kind
of setting it up and eventually when you
use I totally that's crazy eventually
when you use like a IDE like eclipse is
probably the one you'll use most likely
in Java what you'll end up actually
doing is just clicking source and you'll
click generate getters and setters
generate constructor and you'll select
what you need and I'll be much quicker
and easier but it's important to know it
right now so create ant it's just called
age so we'll say int age well we're not
setting it to anything so we're just
gonna end it right there cool and a
parameter called dog's age so in our
constructor here we're gonna say int we
need to say the type so that's int and
we're it's a dog's age and if you don't
know it kind of works with camelcase for
parameter names stuff like that so in
this case we'll say do they want us to
actually declare it no and then next to
parts inside a constructor parts at the
instance federal AG quills dog gauge so
this age here is going to be equal to
our dogs
age that age that make sense so run that
oh cool
and there we go
you dog Smith they should have a main
method it does so public void main
string args this is where again this may
seem like a kind of an odd concept it
did to me when we first started just
think of it as your Start button when I
hit start this is where it this is where
it goes to say look this is where this
 pops off so like right now we're
not doing anything in it so nothing's
happening
all right so inside the main use the dog
constructor to create dog and assign it
to the variable spike do we want to give
him a name in the inside of main use the
dog constructor to create dog oh whoops
so we're not actually working with the
constructor anymore the class is already
here so instead we're gonna say dog dog
so the dot dog object dot that we're
calling dog that's really bad oh wait
they don't have a name so we named him
spike there we go so that's why I was
like oh that's really bad for us to do
that so new dog and we are going to give
it the age of let's say oh 1 he's pretty
much a puppy
there's no such thing as a Dodd and
we're not doing it and even though we're
creating this you can see right here no
code is getting outputted because we're
not doing anything with it we're just
creating it unless in it it would have
something that would create something
and do something from a method or
something that's such a set so a
domestic called bark to the dog class so
here we're in our dog class and we want
to add a a method that's called public
void meaning it's not going to return
anything most times and we want it to
print out woof so when we call this dot
out dot print Ln so when we call our
bark method all it's going to do is
print out woof and when we oh do we not
want this maybe I wants to call it so
we'll say spike dot bark
I think that's right yeah what's going
on here sue check our bracket it's it's
all good that's look good public like
bark and that it doesn't work
did you create the bark method place it
between the constructor and the main
menu what I did so let's take this out
here there we go oh my god they wanted
to is that really that so if you're
doing that don't skip steps cuz they
will hold you up on that you're new and
then we'll print out wolf exclamation
point semicolon very cool so we are into
the main method dog class call the bark
method so now we're gonna call it on so
this is our object spike and we're
calling bark and the reason we can do
that is because this is part of the
class dog and this is our method this is
a really bad example also because we
could actually just call bark so we
wouldn't even need to do spike dog bark
this will actually work without it well
that won't be what they want yeah let's
go ahead and go keep it going so inside
the in between bark and main methods add
a method called run to the dog class by
typing public void run so again we're
just creating a method here and don't
skip ahead like I did way to run run
your code give it a parameter called int
and name it feet run your code and then
print out a print statement for this and
you'll notice that we're actually
breaking our code up instead of just
doing it all in one method or in inside
the main method and the reason for that
is just so that you were literally the
we can recycle these when needed and we
don't have to every time for a know Matt
we don't know how many dogs we're gonna
end up creating dog objects we're gonna
end up
so inside the main method color run so
go ahead and call black dot run and now
it's going to Nate run out feet oh how
much far do you run three your dog ran
three feet congratulations your dog
sucks it honey
and we could do some if statements to
say wow your dog is really awful running
here in the hole three feet if it's less
than ten feet something like that you
know in between the run and main methods
we're now getting into getters and
setters um typically when you get a
value it's called a getter and so public
void get aged and when you set a value
as probably what we'll be doing next you
are then resetting that value for
instance in dog's age a setter would be
used to say to change the dog's age from
5 to 6 so set that to 6 a getter would
get the value so if they were 6 it would
tell you or II would retrieve it for
whatever and maybe you need it for an if
statement so you'd get the dogs so if
the dogs less than 6 get that value is
it less than 6 yes tell me he's still a
puppy no no so public void get age go
ahead and run the we want to return age
oops so with setters you use void when
you are actually using when your Eternia
value you have to give it the the type
of value or attorney in this case we're
returning an int so inside of the main
set an int variable spike age so we'll
say int spike age is equal to in my
little spike
so we're saying we're setting a variable
and we are going to set it equal to the
number of the age of the dog and now we
want to print that out so we set the dog
equal to 1 if you remember correctly so
system dot out dot print Ln and we're
going to find out how old is spike and
we could even spice it up a little bit
hopefully this will work
my dog spike is spaced 1 don't forget to
put plus we're in it my dog spike is 1
no creativity creativity is not awarded
fairy-like I'm just gonna run that there
goes so then just returns one prequel so
those are getters when it return
something it gets it when it needs us
reset the value to something it sets it
swimmer reset and set if you ever get a
confused
note that there are no two files in the
code editor within the dog class use
extends keyword to inherit from the
animals class so in our animals class
they have a mythical check status so we
want to inherit that I really wish they
use word extends so technically dog
extends from animal I personally prefer
the word inherit
I don't know why but it's just more
intuitive to me so call check status
methadone spiked so we're gonna remain
method here with to call it we're gonna
say spike dot check status and it's
gonna work now because we now inherit
everything that's from an animal
stake out of it on a more simple level
is maybe our main group is humans and
then you're a girl or a boy or anything
else for that matter and you you inherit
from the human class so every human
might have a heart and lungs and a brain
and so on and so forth it's not the main
method create a new coffee object called
my order so we have our coffee we're
gonna say what are we what is it that
we're working with with like variable
its coffee it's a class we are going to
call it my order and we're gonna set it
equal to a new coffee and in this case
it has no parameters cool so a next line
called the add sugar method on my order
and specify its juice so if we go to
coffee we're gonna say my order and for
our order dot add sugar I'm gonna add
the sugar and don't put that there
because this is an object and not a
method I don't know why the other thing
add sugar we need to put a parameter in
so yeah we put in two cups of sugar -
sugar cubes and now it says to modify
the coffee class of inherits from
beverage so it extends so even there we
use inherits that's why should be called
inherits extends beverage cool and
inside of main called the is full method
on my order so we're gonna say my order
Todd is full and it's gonna tell us
order is full cool
so that was lessons completed object
oriented program we got one left
they were supposed to this course is
supposed to take four hours we did this
section in 16 minutes 40 seconds but I'm
used to Java so this is very elementary
stuff for me if there's anything that I
kind of skipped over or you need a
little bit more
I know classes and may be a little bit
weird at first and they're definitely
diving into it much quicker than they
did in the Python or PHP course so I
actually hope they expand upon this
because job is a really cool language
it's also the first one I learned as
always questions comments constructive
criticism is always welcome and I
apologize for the disruptions of today's
video I'll see you guys next time thanks
