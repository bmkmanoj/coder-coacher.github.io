more on control flow at javascript and I
actually made bad versions of this on my
new laptop in the webcam didn't work out
as well as I wanted it to and everything
else so we're just going to go ahead and
redo these next few sections like we did
for Dragon Slayer so I'll be resetting
the code as we go along alright write an
if else statement inside that is even
function you should return true if the
number is used is evenly divisible i
will buy true i'll return false so we're
going to say if if is even modulo 2 is
equal equal to 0 return true else turn
false
looks like your function transf also the
number is equal to 20 cuz I should be
good so we needed the number i don't
know why i put this even so if our
number modulo 2 meaning it has no
remainder when divided by an even number
but even number two it's even else false
so there's only you don't need to really
write out to if statements because it's
already it's one or the other i add an
else if branch to your this scene if
else statement if the number put into
the function is odd number at all
instead of return to or return false and
i should return string my cells using
that their input alright so we have if
else you have and if exilis look at the
hand cuz I and if else if then else
alright so just like sure you do these
in the correct order so else if and it
looks like is nan is gonna tell us if it
is a number
alright so we're going to say else it is
man number so we're going to say is
number is NaN a number our site is not
equal to true we wanted to put something
console.log and this is not a number
mari so what did we do wrong here oh
maybe return
I awesome instead of adrene church
your function returns true for three see
if else if else
oh I think this is supposed to be equal
to true is that is not a number not that
it is a number looks like a reference
rare maybe delete is even know all right
here we go there we go so isn't on you
saying it's not a number so Barry is
true because it's not a number all right
create a four or a while loop in letters
so so for and will say I forget if we
have to put in I like in Java that was
very ok so for bear i equal to 0 I
Celeste then we'll just a 5 I plus plus
and we want to console dot log the word
JavaScript so that's your print no way
i plus plus there I oh there we go so
you go to 20 rather so it should print
out five times one two three four five
there we go this is the code take a look
is can you see how the switch statement
works okay um switch statements are kind
of like if statements except it's one of
the if statements just have like one
variable it's just easier is like is
this it is it this one know is that this
one knows that this one yes BAM break
break the loop you'll see in a second
sighs it would you want for lunch also
soup so it's gonna basically it's going
to the switch it lunches are input in
this case the switch is checking our
value of lunch in every one of these
cases and it's going to see if we if it
matches any of them if it does it's
going to do something so in this case
soup got it tomatoes my favorite so
let's go ahead and on our switch
statement needs it the case for Monsieur
friel I sufficient needs a case for
yellow add in it add it in and make it
log a string of your choice the console
should be different from the default
string all right so i miss a case yellow
was it yeah Yello and then we want to uh
you always want to break your switch
more than likely for like memory
purposes and so that it doesn't q
anything else and a few other things on
our but i don't know why i think you can
probably do it without it but I think
for memory purposes usual so break it
um console.log and we'll say something
long lines is yellow is don't forget to
end your case with the breaks down my
other son execute the code for default
to okay so that's why you do it cuz
otherwise you'll do the default so it's
going to save and continue so in this
case let's test yellow and yellow color
so cool so add a default block at the
bottom of the switch statement pretty
simple and I'll probably mess it up the
first drive so we want to print out a
statement the default is basically the
last statement if none of your switches
are met um oh yeah we want to the
default will be I love all candy and
kids shoes and I believe you can break
here but you don't need to i think it's
the standard so we'll just type it in
here and then we'll get our last choice
I love all candy can choose because we
don't get licorice gum or beets so are
given the empty skeleton with swishing
and complete the existing case then had
at least one additional case n daddy
phone add your question here let's see
let's think of a good question um let's
do legal age legends I just rage quit
again ah who is your favorite lol
champion then our answer will go to our
switch statement and we'll put here
let's see where my favorites garen I
like Karen I don't play them too much
because this kind of weak right now
um spin2win break and that way wants to
add one more okay who else is pretty
Opie I'm only platform so I'm not like
super great but I'm all right let's see
your dunk master Darius and then
console.log space jam theme song pues
back I thought all right and then our
default default and we'll say something
oh don't forget to break it will say
something along the lines of console dot
log there are almost 120 champions shoes
and I should be good and we'll just test
Darius bam bam so you said this I
include your own switch statement the
editor it can be anything like so don't
forget in this case we're doing prompt
it could be we could actually just put
VAR answer equals 0 villen we do
something like this so do you don't have
to just do prompt it just makes sense in
this case because why else would you do
switch to switch and then we'll take an
answer
so this one may be a little bit boring
but if i remember correctly it's a cold
right oh no it's a bracket okay so we'll
do case will say Dylan also that log
first thing and then we'll do okay it's
a poker guy don't forget to break it
either or else I'll run the default old
console dot log myut it's actually my
gamer tag the game where made us where
it leads from great and then our final
case and we'll say Christopher
console.log my middle name call me rice
for short little joke my friend some
people ok and then default console.log
and i believe i should work straight up
so my first name
all right in this case save and submit
to move on to the last section of this
lesson logical operators and or not so
if you're familiar with any of these
start making sense that both variables
ever come true all right so pretty what
our refresh this page you think I may
have messed it up berkeley all right
complete line three and four so mar I
love javascript is equal to true and
this is also equal is true so also put
these equal true so it wants us to sit
both variables and that is true and hit
save to see what it could happen so it
prints out awesome let's keep learning
in this case it works right there solo
we'll just keep it going here it'll be
more ill make more sense as we type out
our own I don't really like when they
give you full examples just because I
get there there so you can go back and
look at them we don't really learn creto
variables hungry and food here I so
we'll say bar hungry a holes set it to
nothing then bar food equals 0 and set
them both equal to true so we'll see
true and true inside the eat function
create an if statement that returns true
alright so if that returns true only if
both hungry and food are true if um so
we'll do it
so do this if hungry is equal equal to
true and two equal equal to true Oh food
here we want it to return true else
return false function each should take
knowing put a hungry food should be
Global's okay so i should be good to go
so we don't actually call it but just
for the sake of it let's go ahead it
should come it should return true if we
call eat three is not defined oh there
we go so there you go sure go reset that
alright so create two variables tired
and bored so tired and set 1 equal to
true solicit tired equal to true and
we'll set a barn board take little falls
and then inside the nap function so
we'll call our not function create an if
statement that returns true so we'll say
if if either tired or bored or both are
true or false alright so we'll say if
tired or absolute like this if tired is
equal to true
or or is equal to true so only one of
them has to be sure we know board is
equal to false so this should return
true because tired is true so if tired
is equal true or bored occurring trudel
else return false and let's call it so
we'll make sure we saw earlier that our
code we made our variable roll so there
goes their turns true so declare a
variable called programming and set it
to false all right Sal are dreaming is
equal to false and then right if else
statement inside happy so that happy
returns true so if so if pro Grammy is
equally good pulse
so all right wait create a variable
called programming then right at if else
statements I'd happy so the happy
returns true if program is false and
false otherwise program is equal to
false return true but I think they want
us to do it like this so I'll say not
equal to true else return the not equals
doesn't really matter how you do it BAM
that's pretty much it so we those are
basically just operators of switch
statements to be honest with you I don't
use switch statements too much I don't
know why they're very useful but you
know everyone will find their own Lake
programming there's million ways to do
it until your boss tells you otherwise
you can do it however you want so up
next code your own adventure too so it
looks like a lot of stuff going on here
but it's it's just a lot it's another
like text-based scroller it's kind of
cool i mean it gives a little input and
output at the same time but i'll see you
guys in next video and as always thanks
for watching and constructive feedback
is always appreciated
