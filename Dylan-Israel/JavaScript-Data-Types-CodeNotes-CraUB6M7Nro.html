we're going to be talking about
JavaScript data types and some things
you may have already known and just have
a deeper understanding about things you
don't know so let's get started did you
know JavaScript data types are dynamic
meaning i can set VAR x and that would
return unto fine now i can set our x is
equal to 5 it will return a number the
same x or we could set x is equal to the
quote hello world and it now returns a
string not every language does this
javascript is unique in the fact that
the data types are dynamic like this so
when you're dealing with strings you can
do a couple things when trying to use
quotation marks in it you can do double
quotes which will then let it be known
as a string now if you want to use
quotes within your quotes the key is to
use single quotes on the inside and
double quotes on the outside or double
quotes on the inside and single quotes
on the outside this will allow you to
use the quotation mark that you're
wanting to use for the actual output
just make sure that you're using the
opposite of what you're using on the
outside for it to show up on the inside
now sometimes you'll need to use the
type of operator to find out hey what
type of data is you can use this for
Strings you can use this for boolean you
can use this for objects you can use
this for numbers you use this for array
which is also an object now you may be
saying well why wouldn't I just set it
to null instead of undefined because no
supposed to be nothing well that's true
but no also when you get the type of it
returns an object and most of the time
people want to leave those things
completely blank but if not go ahead and
use null if you're okay with having the
type of it being an object this is also
a good time to do a comparison of what
strictly equals and loosely equals means
so loosely equals would be an example of
where you just have two equals and
strictly equals is when you have three
equal signs the loosely equals compares
the values for instance the string
number 5 to the whole number 5 loosely
equals would return that this is true 5
is equal to 5 now when you're doing
strictly equals with the triple equals
this will return false this is
actually checking the value and the type
of it so the type of string the
quotation string number five is string
with a value of five while the type of
the whole number five is number and is
not a number and the value is five so
dumb everything matches up and that's
why you would use strictly equals and
loosely equals hey guys thanks for
