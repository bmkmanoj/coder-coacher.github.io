all long strings of intro tune so what
we're doing for this is we have an array
of strings and what we want to do is
return the string that has the longest
length
excuse me all the strings have the
longest length so in this case in our
example here we have three string the
three is longest length so we return all
three strengths now how did how did I do
this well I initialize a I decided to
initialize the length of the very first
string just as a starting point and I
call this longest word although it
should probably be something like we'll
rename it we'll call it a longest
largest length there we go largest
length is equal to the very first value
of our input array dot length so we just
kind of start it off there we then
iterate we're then going to create a for
loop that iterates through the array and
checks the each length of the word and
if that value is larger than our longest
word go ahead and replace that for the
entire array let's start that off and
because we iterate it we because we
initialize rather it to the first value
we're going to go ahead and start start
by setting it to the index one or the
second spot that we normally would be
checking
we're going to check each one of these
so we have I plus plus now here all we
have to do is say hey if the longest
word are excuse me largest length
because I change this from my original
is less than the current word that we're
iterating on lengths go ahead and set
that value set the largest length equal
to that new largest length which is the
value we just checked okay so now you
say alright Dylan but when we return
largest length what do we have here what
we have is just a number should be can I
find length of undefined Oh hurry up
little syntax their eyes list an infant
line i plus list so we should have is
the length of three then we check this
one too so we have the number associated
with that what we do from here is we're
going to filter out of our original
array input array all values that aren't
of the same length and return that so
we're going to be returning input array
Oh what is this will return via input
all right we'll just go ahead and set
our original right equal to itself after
it's been filtered filter is an array
method that lets us pass in an element
or check runs iterates through the array
and checks a statement to say hey filter
out values where this statement is false
that's what we're doing here and we'll
just return and in this case we'll take
element dot length is equal to that the
largest link meaning filter out all
values where the length of the word is
not is less than it's not going to be
greater than right
going to be less than our largest length
and so only return the elements where
they're equal to and go ahead and return
that value
wham-bam we are done so that is all long
as strengths are should there's a bunch
of different ways we could do this but
for me this is like what came naturally
we initialize a length you could
probably not start that you could start
this off at zero if you wanted to and go
from there we then iterate through find
whatever the length of the largest
string is that we filter by that value
and return it but as always guys thank
