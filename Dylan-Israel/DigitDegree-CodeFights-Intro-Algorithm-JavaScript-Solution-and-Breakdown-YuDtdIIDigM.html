in code bites dark wilderness intro
arcade digit degree n ow what are we
doing here that was quite an annoying
inter I apologize for that
the task for this I kind of
misunderstood the first two times I read
it and finally once I understood it it
wasn't too bad the task here is we are
given a number and we want to find out
how many changes to that number and in
this case let's look at 91 where if we
can get it down to a single digit number
if we split it up into single digits add
them back together split it up into
single digits add it back together so in
100 this is 1 0 0 which returns 1 so it
requires one change and then here in 91
we get 9 plus 1 that's 1 change that
brings us to 10 that's still a
double-digit number then we get 1 plus 0
which is 1 which brings us to 2
so how many times do we have to change
it to be able to return how many times
you have to change it to get a single
digit number that's the goal here so
let's get started by creating a count
variable to keep track of those changes
we're gonna start off by just setting
equal to 0 now if I did an if-else
statement here with a wallet and in the
episodes look if the number that we're
getting to string dot length actually we
don't even need to do it like that we
could just say if n is less than or
equal to 9 we could go ahead and return
count that's a better way of doing the
turn count if it's less than or equal to
9 it's a single-digit number right cool
now let's do our else and I said I had a
while statement here I just use wall
true this was just the simplest way for
me to do it and in here we're going to
add 1 to count and whereas it we're
going to we're going to convert our
number into a string break it up into a
character reduce it by adding this
together
and then checking if the length is equal
to one and if it is we're going to break
the for loop and at the end return count
now if it's not we're going to just let
it go back and do it one more time
so let's let's do all that so we're set
n is our our string is equal to our
number we're in Toronto strange then
we're split it up into an array and then
we are going to reduce it with the array
call back function and we're in passing
a lmv and this is going to allow us to
return half we now mind you they're
integers now so we have to parse the in
our it students are there strings so we
have to parse the end and we're going to
say return parse in a plus B and that's
going to return a number so n is now a
number started out a number turned into
a string turn into an array add in an
array back into a number n is a number
and so we're going to say look if and
got two string is dot length is equal to
1 meaning it's a single digit actually
again we don't have to do that we can
just say n less than or equal to nine we
can go ahead and break our break our
while loop and then at the end here
we'll just return our town and let's run
that
and we're good so again probably a
million different ways to solve this
specific this specific algorithm this is
just how I solve it this is what made
the most sense and you saw me here I
actually cleaned it up a little bit
compared to what I'd actually did which
was n dot two string dot length is equal
to one this makes more sense this is
already in a number form we can just
write logic to play off that instead of
having to call additional string
functions we don't need but as always
