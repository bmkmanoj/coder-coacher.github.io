ladies and gentlemen we have a special
Saturday weekly going on I actually
can't sleep it's about 1:00 a.m. Eastern
Standard Time
I have either too much caffeine in me or
I think I the dominoes that I ate today
when I was playing board games with
coworkers
isn't sitting well for me I have some
sort of acid reflux thing going on which
has never happened to me a day in my
life so here we are I figured what a
better time to do a live stream and we
could we go ahead and hopefully get some
of the subscribers that we normally
don't get that might be in a different
part of the world although I am
surprised to see the the average show
David yang I punk pancakes we got some
of the the oh geez in here today so
you
here we go sorry guys I the microphone
went down for a second well I was just
saying welcome to 30 the your body
starts rejecting the food and drink you
yeah yeah and I I believe that man
you're messing with Star Wars a few had
nicer and that's the type of stuff that
I I tell you guys to look into and let
me turn this off a little bit so I'm not
gonna be talking that's a lot as I
normally do just because it's late but
this type of stuff I tell you guys to to
do is start a project something that
would be fun they you're interested in
if a Star Wars man there's plenty of
people who would respect a Star Wars
project and and everything else I'm also
getting over I don't so so one of the
things that I I've been realizing is
that I need to change something in my
life I talked about this last you
think's and one of the things I'll be
focusing on is my my health and that's
going to start by eliminating energy
drinks I kind of been slip in the last
month I've been drinking a ton of energy
drinks it's been fucking my sleep
schedule up and I'm also I'm also going
to start exercising you know I've been
taking my vitamins and fiber and stuff
like that
so I started the process but we haven't
completed completely dived in so for the
most part I am a pretty healthy
individual just not as much as I want to
be and exercising again so those are the
big ones and I think that will help me
in my career I'll be able to focus more
and continue on from there Diet Mountain
Dew is killing you so - the energy
drinks I've given up all carbonated
beverages so I don't I don't really
drink soda I haven't for many years I'll
occasionally have one here or there but
I don't keep it in the house and I saw
that NASA makes their API is available
but you got to get a key I don't want to
build some thing and post it on github
with my personal key any ideas how to
get around that yeah so what you would
do is create a secrets file and you
wouldn't commit that when you go and
post your project and then you would
reference that key you would like import
the key from that secrets file and so
although your code wouldn't run on the
köppen you could just put a comment go
get your API key and store in a secrets
file that's usually how you would do it
some dude just got his head caved in by
some energy drink that clickbait article
has nothing to do with energy drinks but
I know exactly what are you talking
about hey Dylan I'm I'm recently set up
a technical interview for hack reactor
I'm blazing through their prep course
around 160 challenges in two days do you
think I have a good shot any advice I
don't know too much about hack reactor
other than it's a hard school to get
into I think regardless if you get into
it or don't get into you'll be a better
developer just going through their prep
work and you can probably try again if
you have your heart set on hat on hack
reactor
fasting now I don't I'm not down not to
eat I'll be honest with you
so yeah I'm not I'm not down with that
at all
but I would say in terms of it if you
are if already of what you're doing is
preparing I mean you're already doing it
right here you're studying they give you
prep work for their Entry Program if
you're doing that and you finish it
study something else that you think
would be helpful how can I make myself
addicted to codeine um I don't know a
lot of it for me was giving up bad
habits
some things like
Gaming I gave up for quite some time I
really don't even play anymore I'm not
necessarily trying to lose weight for
the record I'm just trying to be
healthier
my health is definitely searched
although I am in the worst shape of my
life I have not really gained any weight
it's just my muscle has turned to fat so
let's see here what are the boot camps
would you recommend it really depends on
where you're at in your life what you
want to do but I can say I can say that
for me having met the people at dev
Mountain even though they're no longer a
sponsor and seeing their program and
seeing the questions they were asking
being on one of their campuses I can
really recommend their program and I
think they're doing an excellent job for
their web development program and I've
interviewed quite a few developers from
there and all of them seem to be doing
quite well have you tried any program
blockchain it's so funny that you asked
that mark I actually just went out of
curiosity to see what the salaries were
for blockchain and I have a so I bought
the Academy course on angular 4 and and
it's 26 hours of content which means
that if I put in let's just I put in 2
hours a day it would take me lose that
13 days but then again you're not going
at full speed so it'll probably take me
a full month to finish that course I
want to finish that course to be a
better angular developer at my work and
then I am diving fully into JavaScript I
want to become my kind of my current
goals right now is to become a better
JavaScript developer over the next 6
months that's really what it is I want
to sort of deep dive I don't want really
I've used the term master because I
don't really think you can ever master
these things so I'm I want to instead of
being a sort of a generalist I want to
dive more into being a front-end
specialist
and that's gonna take some I want to
give specifically better at JavaScript
and at CSS and master a few things you
know quote unquote master a few things
but then I am diving into blockchain
100% I am there's just too many jobs it
is just too high pain it is just such a
good skill to pick up even if I don't
want to go anywhere just having that
skill set for the future to future-proof
myself and my doula I'm a self-taught
developer I don't have it I don't have a
CS degree and I have a master's degree
and I think about going back to school
all the time but mainly because not that
I need I need help getting junior or
eventually senior level roles is to get
roles beyond that to get tech lead roles
to get architect roles in that instance
I really will probably need a bachelor's
at the very least not always the case
but it's definitely gonna help but if I
go and choose to study a study a how'd
it how black Jane works it can change me
it change a lot of things have you
looked at what text tech stack they're
using for block change just it really
depends it's all over the place
but I mean there's even JavaScript block
chains there's a lot I see a lot of
Python and I see a lot of Java but
really it's just a head of an
interesting I'm not looking for a job
I'm very happy where I'm at but I like
to stay on top of the market and see
what's going on so that would probably
be what I would dive into next if as
because people are always saying well
you know are you ever gonna stick a load
of oh not really to be honest with you
because there's so much to do I kind of
say this about about front-end
development specifically compared to
back-end development back-end
development to me and I say this is
someone who has done both back-end
development is really about two things
it's about your database so how you're
storing that data and how you route data
to that database to and from and in the
front-end I feel like there's so many
more moving parts that's a little bit
more exciting a little bit more dynamic
because of that and and it's it's a
little bit it's a it's just a little bit
something extra right and that's why I
really enjoy the front-end pretty
specifically for tech lead role do you
need a CS degree specifically no I mean
you don't need a CS degree specifically
for almost anything but these are roles
that some companies won't hire no matter
how great of a developer you are some
companies simply will not promote you to
more management positions or more yeah I
would consider it technically sort of a
management position because you are
overseeing other people although it's
not a traditional manager role if you
don't have a degree it doesn't matter if
you're the best developer they have
there are a lot of companies like that
and even the companies that are okay
having developers without degrees it is
gonna be something that that scaling
wise is a little bit hard did I take
reversing media's angular course yes I'm
95% done with that I stopped I have some
bug in my project I didn't feel like
fixing it so I stopped at 95% but yeah I
basically took the whole course can't
you learn the CS degree stuff from books
yes you can but we all know that
companies place value on that piece of
paper whether they should and whether it
matters is besides the point you're
probably not getting a job yet no sadly
so if you don't have cs3 then have you
considered another degree um yeah I mean
personally I say CS degree very loosely
because there are web development
degrees that I've been looking at just
because I think it'd be a little bit
more fun and honestly I don't think I'm
gonna learn too much most of stuff will
just be practicing for tests and
studying and memorizing the bullshit
that they want you to memorize that they
value and think it's important that
you're not going to use a regular basis
so so angel says I just started learning
assists and programming with Python and
super intimidated by the amount of
information I have to learn is that
normal or am I just on my fork no it's
it's it's pretty normal a lot of times
people are overwhelmed and it's kind of
a snowball effect I kind of consider it
similar to to math in a lot of ways
where things lead up to other things and
you have to learn terminology you have
to learn how the working parts work
together right when you started learning
math it may have seemed very strange
when you're adding numbers and then you
slowly understood numbers and let's say
that's what a variable is and then you
had oh well now I have to multiply
numbers I took that a and I'm solving
these problems be using these equations
and then now you're learning about
equations that solve other equations and
you're learning about algebra and
trigonometry and geometry and you're
learning calculus I mean it's a scaling
thing and the things that work hard are
now easy because they're concepts that
you've used regularly but a lot of times
when you're learning
you don't really realize this stuff does
scale and it's a very hot software is a
very interesting thing because it's hard
to scale it naturally pass the barebone
basics and a lot of times you have to
die that's why I tell people just build
stuff and you'll sort of figure out the
learning path by what you want to build
but yeah a lot of people are intimidated
and they don't know what direction to go
and they never go any direction which is
the problem
why would one learn web development for
pi Wow why would one learn Python for
web development versus JavaScript I
don't know
other than database stuff and
specifically for data analytics there is
a lot of Python in data analytics
applications so okay it kind of depends
although in my opinion JavaScript is
greater than everything I hate the
equations that are missing variables
maybe I should do some math videos man
I've been applying for jobs I haven't
heard back what what would be the best
way to follow up with the company see if
they have received reviewing my
application an email that's usually what
I do an email just proper email
explaining how to get your eager and if
there's anything you can do to help move
the process along or if they're looking
for another kind usually I have yet to
have something like that work but that
would be what I would do can do video
and wireframe
oh my god I feel so bad Jordan I know
you've asked me this a million times and
I plan to I just haven't quite got to it
yet you know what I should do I should
just do a wire framing video for my
course because I haven't done that yet
and I'll release it I'll add it to my
course like the bulk of it and I'll do
another video like actually wire framing
stuff Oh
it
the algorithms will freak okay yeah it's
I mean algorithms so for me I start to
like them right once they some of them
are really stupidly hard right
I loved the although I didn't finish
their acne on degree I loved it and I
would highly recommend it what course
I've been building this little side
project course where it's basically
you're building a personal portfolio in
angular 4 which is now angular 5 which
I'll update so blasted that's what I've
been working on a lot of my videos are
game do you monetize lately and I'm
trying to work on other ways of
monetizing the channel so yeah it
there's probably no worse feeling than
like every single live show my I've done
lately has been Duvall enticed one
second guys I have to use the
gentleman's room real quick
but yes so it's about time that I start
building some courses together I've kind
of Drive udemy course that will be what
it is
but um but yeah so um welcome to the D
monitors club right why are they getting
devant eyes believe it or not they don't
tell you they just say it's not suitable
for most advertisers I couldn't have any
idea what a livestream talking about
software whatever whatever constitute
being demonetized huh but it does but
yeah so it's probably about time I'll
hit thirty thousand subscribers probably
in about a week maybe ten days and I've
yet to met ever make I've yet to ever
make a single course and I think I think
it's time you know if you go and look at
channels have maybe five thousand or ten
thousand you can probably find that
they've built 25 courses at this point
so I okay I did I watch Chris Hawkes
latest video no I saw it
I believe you're talking about the one
word he says does he like being a
programmer I'm not why do I keep looking
at stealing that's where the chat is I
can move it down does it bother you
I have the four monitors and the the
senior the second one is fire visit all
right there it's on the same level so it
won't look too much they know I haven't
had a chance to watch Christmas video
yet Chris I look depressed I lost you
Chris chakras verse yeah I mean I only
saw the thumbnail but he looked tired
I've known that that look and I've had
that look myself before with me being
sick this last week I've felt that way
and I'm starting to wonder if what's
actually going on with me kind of fun
trying to find what I want to do is if
I've been burning out a little bit what
do I actually do at your first job in my
current job I do front-end web
development specifically an angular how
can you tell if a developer's about is
about to get fired uh well a lot of
times they'll talk to you and ask you to
pick up it really depends on the
workplace in a shitty workplace they'll
just let you go in a good workplace
they'll say hey you're not meeting our
standards and this is what you need to
do to pick it up so so it kind of it
kind of just depends
Chris Hawkes warns about spending all
your time devoted to program I
definitely can understand that but I am
I'm still developing my career I don't
plan to do everything that I do now for
very long I think I can probably keep
this up so I've said this before if I
told April about two and a half years
ago that I was going to work every day
for five years and have about two years
two and a half left so probably at 2020
I'll slow down we're about 2018 so
that's really when I'm going to chill
out relax for a second and maybe take a
little bit of a backseat to a few things
in my life but yeah I could definitely
understand that but I am also not where
I want to be with my career with my
finances so do I drink decaf I'm
drinking water right now it's decaf can
I go in a bit more details well I work
for a large corporation multinational
corporation that is in the health and
beauty industry I build front-end web
applications for them for in-house tools
primarily although I imagine that I will
be on and in the future working on more
client facing tools as well our
applications that's really what I've
been working on do I create or maintain
everything I've been building has been
custom start from the ground up although
I did work with another team that that
had me do some bug fix fixes on existing
stuff
the most part 95% of what I'd do is
build from the ground up
did I ever use the axe body spray middle
school I use the axe body spray spray
for many many years the past middle
school do I need JavaScript for data
analysts uh no probably not how do I
learn web dev smoothly code everyday and
find a way to make it fun build your own
projects and go from there
how did I say SQL just like that do I
use PHP not on my current role on
front-end in my current role my previous
role is that I my previous role I used
PHP I hated it I tried to like it is
that why April fell in love with you
April fell in love with me you have to
ask her
April April April asked why I love her
and I said because you love me and
apparently that's not a satisfactory
answer but I love that she loves me like
that I love her because she loves me
that's which is not the best answer but
it is true I can count on her and that
is a good thing she's also been I need a
reason for Kozma all Cosmo tells you er
69 sect sex techniques and how to catch
your man cheating
and like the 60s sex technique is always
putting the pinky and the bum oh I've
seen the cosmos around the house and my
sister's places and stuff and in the
Czech stance it's always that some GQ I
don't know anything about cheek you do
do I love myself yeah man I don't have
any issues with me
I love prokhor anymore
I do love programming but I eventually
will slow down in my off hours do you
ever create Android apps with JavaScript
no I
this is something I've thought about
diving into ionic or diving into react
native and I don't I don't know yet I
don't really fully know what to do
I've been debating it for quite some
time
if I want to start with angular do I
start directly with angular for yes
except now it's angular 5 angular got
updated to 5 last week don't worry about
that there's not too many breaking
changes in it one of the things is
animations
got moved to a different folder or
different package and then the HTTP
package got deprecated and another HTTP
package got added that's basically it at
the other day I mean there's other stuff
but that's how happy are you on a scale
of one to ten one being in wish I could
start all over in 10 being I'm awesome
another should want to be like me
I would say normally I'm like a nine
although I've been hovering around a
seven lately which is low for me part of
that is I've been sick part of that is I
think I'm getting burnt out part of that
is just I'm trying to find that next
stage of what I want to accomplish I
mean a rhythm it could also be and this
could be and I don't know that this is
true but I could potentially be missing
my family which I don't think I do
because I really don't do that
but it's just something to consider cuz
this is the longest I've ever been away
from my family I think I can go a couple
more years I'll say you know April
misses your family though they I would
say I'm like probably around seven right
now working to get back to at nine or
ten if I want to change my career now
which would be the best choice data
science and python or AWS DevOps if I
choose I would say AWS DevOps just
because the data science and python is
gonna be very hard without a degree if
you don't have a degree if you have a
degree it won't be as hard both our
great fields though you really can't
make a bad choice I just think DevOps
might be something for a new career you
could transition easier into
are you required to do design into your
job do you have photoshop files which
you develop from now a lot of my stuff
is a lot of a lot of my stuff is
sometimes not wireframe when you working
on in-house apps in terms of how it
looks a lot of times that takes a
backseat all we really care about is
functionality so it's not something that
I've been too worried with if you don't
usually get Photoshop files unless
you're actually developing client-facing
so for web web development stuff web
design aspects so I'm trying to say so
now I'll be like if I get a wireframe
sometimes I do but a lot of times you
have to sort of design your own stuff
and it varies by organization
sounds like me get some more sunlight if
you're a bit down feeling over the way I
I definitely probably do to be honest
with you and that's one of the things
that's one of the things that I am
working on yes exercise is something
that's coming into the picture would I
do any AWS training videos for any kind
of AWS certifications I wouldn't know I
don't have to what camera do I use from
Aria there videos just my webcam say one
I'm using right now the c920 I think
although I've been thinking about
upgrading to like a legit camera I don't
know do you guys think I need to you
does it bother you the quality of the
camera in the videos so I could up
upgrade to like a 4k camera the actual
camera and not a webcam
okay yeah that's what I thought quality
of what I present what I like there you
go
I like that I need a trihard camera so
the regular videos are slightly higher
def for a couple of reasons one they are
there the Google Hangouts records in
720p and actually so you're getting 720p
instead of 1080p that's one reason
how much jQuery do you use on a daily
basis first vanilla js0 jQuery I do
everything in angular and JavaScript is
there any way to reach out to you
directly if we get stuck in any kind of
program on any kind of programming
problems I offer tutoring and mentoring
for ninety dollars an hour so if that's
something you're interested in I'm happy
to make myself available but this it is
costly by most people's standards but uh
otherwise I'd be reviewing your guys
projects answering our questions and and
solving your bugs for a living for free
any video games I'm playing no although
see the thing right now that I'm having
an issue with is trying to hang up with
this
I have issues right now spending my time
on stuff that's not productive
and I think I need to just to sort of
relax for a bit and video games are not
productive for the most part but I do
have as a Super Nintendo classic that I
play a little bit here there I do want
to get the new Call of Duty but none of
my co-workers want to get it on ps4 so I
got no one to play with they're all PC
gamers cuz their developers they have
those systems but they actually just get
games on PC and get the the console only
games I like playing on consoles that's
my shit do you ever use funky stuff like
is there observables yes all the time
what surprise there's so many people on
right now it's it's 1:30 a.m. just go
watch Full Metal Alchemist
I've seen full metal alchemist so many
times all I'll tell you right now on
Netflix and watch an episode or two a
day with April of of the new fate series
that went on there
nine California ten thing that's a good
point
stop being so productive I will in two
and a half years can I tell you the best
project I worked on what technology is
it in I'll tell you my favorite project
I worked on where I I built a report a
reporting basically a dynamic reporting
project in angularjs and PHP and my last
work where we would take the data from
the database you'd select what report
you wanted and then based off they
reported you have multiple filters and
you could filter the report down and
then it would autogenic and generate a
report that would display the data in
tables pie charts bar charts and then
export to a PDF that was probably my
favorite thing that I built that was a
lot of fun
it's a fate serious any good it's
alright it's not like a the first one or
two it's alright I think I've seen for
now I just watched so much anime that's
probably the only thing I watch but um I
would say he's worth watching if you're
just trying to kill some time what tech
slash programming language you think
will grow a lot in the next 10 years so
I think anything blockchain related so
whatever skills the technology are in
blockchain I think that's kind of the
the current explosion going on what did
I use for the PDF export there is some
library that I used to export the PDF
yeah it wasn't the best library but I
was able to export the PDF and then I
had to write a custom function that
checked if what I was generating was a
table checked if it was info checked if
it was a graph and then apply a bunch of
custom options through another function
that took in both of them took in an
array of objects and they had parameters
and things and then would print it out
so that it looked right and worked right
what host insight do you recommend for
your first landing site slash portfolio
I've only ever used to GoDaddy
but I honestly don't think it matters
boku no here a para academia is very
good Dragon Ball super I'm ok with
Dragon Ball super I know a lot of people
don't like it it's not Dragon Ball Z
that's for sure but it is it is an
homage to it is an homage to just fans
basically at the end of the day they
give you what you want
they just don't deliver it very well
lots of times but we still keep washing
all right so
it's it really is fanservice I haven't
caught steins gate yet but I'll check it
out yeah I don't know I've only the only
thing I really watch other than animes
maybe it's some MMA
when the fights go but live on the East
Coast the fights the main event skirts
don't start by 10:00 and I'm out usually
by 11:00 at the latest
sometimes I wonder if Dragon Ball Z was
that good or I was just a kid go back
and watch Dragon Ball Kai and you'll see
were they what do you think it was that
good or not I promise you is better than
Dragon Ball super so what about one
piece I haven't I've tried like on three
separate occasions to watch one piece I
get about 10 or 15 episodes in and I
call it a day every single time I'd like
to just because there's 800 episodes and
it seems like if it's that great of an
anime last year I've sent the last UFC
event was pretty amazing
one punchy I've seen one punch man one
punch man so great I have I watched
stranger things another show that I
couldn't really get into I watched like
four episodes I actually watched that
with engineer truth we were back at the
Airbnb when him and I were in Utah and
we caught a couple episodes then and
then both I think it was the third up so
we're like uh let's just go walk around
town this sucks
I see you have a lot of code fight
videos and they are really good how many
hours do you need to code every day to
come to your level of code expertise
that's always a very interesting
question because I honestly don't know
how I rank amongst other developers
um I think I'm decently a decent
developer and I've had some other
developers tell me that they think I'm
at a senior level but I don't really
know there's a lot of times people may
just be being nice I can tell you that I
have about one I guess one point one and
a quarter years of relevant resume
experience and then I have about a year
of experience before that in the field
six to one piece I won't be disappointed
just tell me how many episodes do I have
to get in before I'll get hooked is it
like I have to be a hundred and fifty in
it's the best case I don't watch 150 bad
episodes but if it's 25 or 35 and it was
just about to start popping off maybe
have I watched better call Saul no
although I did catch like five episodes
because my dad watched TV when he came
down here and he's streamed like the
entire second season I caught some of
that it's brother than most television I
watched in one sitting be honest in last
year 2:35 in the fall I yeah I don't
know it's
there's a great short like five FS five
episode series on on Netflix called like
new yogi oh I highly recommend it it's
it's kind of kinda hard to explain but
it's basically a psychic in this New
York setting and he's like really into
fashion high fashion and it's a comedy
sort of robotic one you know it's it's
it's very interesting it's definitely
different than your traditional anime
but if you guys have Netflix and I
highly encourage you to watch it you'll
be hooked after the first episode that's
the worst thing I've ever seen oh my god
get out of here man that was so much fun
it was a fun anime I loved it I
absolutely loved it yeah the Tobler okay
are you kidding me I loved everything
about that anime it wasn't that cringey
oh man it was great I loved it
April and I watched it together oh yeah
neo yo Kyo is dope man our computer
programmers respected enough what do you
think I think for the most part yeah
I mean it's a respected career that's
for sure so who is disrespecting it are
you saying within organizations within
companies thoughts on civil engineering
if there's any engineering you should go
into it's software engineering purely
based off the amount of jobs the job
growth and the salary did I do boot camp
no you know when it's free code camps
new stuff going out am i planning on
doing reviews of landing pages do you
have a landing page you want me to
review exactly and where do you
recommend on viewing current trends a
lot of times how I view it Vieux Carre
trends as I just read articles and blogs
and you know Facebook groups see what's
trending and then if I really want to
see the market I just go and go and look
on LinkedIn I looked on zip recruiters
see what jobs are out there and what
they're paying and what they're looking
for and and go from there that's really
it
I hate computer science should I just
suck it up and go into software
engineering I mean I wouldn't want to
tell you to do anything you hate usually
that's a bad idea respect within an
organization an example quality
assurance gets paid more than a
developer that doesn't sound fair no
offense to anyone but that's just an
opinion that's a very that's a very
unlikely situation most quality
assurance developers don't get paid more
than an actual developer
how do how will you learn new
programming language code everyday and
build things that's really it do
tutorials build those projects and
tutorials go on often build your own I
really like web development and but I
think I'm going in criminal justice and
on my own time do web development okay
it's software engineering the only safe
job out there
no but it's one of the few there are
other safe jobs out there but it is one
of the few what's your opinion on the
chingu cohorts if you've heard of that
I've not I have no idea what that is or
what's going on with it
BattleBots metal BOTS was fun man I
didn't watch the new seat I know that I
really brought the show back but I used
to watch it on Comedy Central
probably when I some of your guys's age
some of the younger guys when I was like
12 13 14 in middle school have a good
one
Murali Murali Krishna errata Tali
Venkata have a good night
what's your opinion Laramie Java in 2018
just like anything else you're going to
work with a large multinational
corporation you're gonna get paid very
well but then on a side note you have to
work in Java
why is the stream so late I just can't
sleep so what other safe jobs are out
there other than software engineering I
just hate sitting in front of a computer
seven hours straight and then yelling
when it doesn't work I wish I got to sit
at a computer for seven hours straight
actually I do
ooh nursing medical any medical field is
a good industry get into as well there
are if you're staying if you're trying
to say you can also do project
management which is another good field
which is in tech and software so I don't
know if you're trying to stay with a way
for software tech but it's a much more
social aspects business analyst same
thing the best course I've ever taken on
JavaScript uh well let's make surprise
you but besides the angular four course
I took from traversing media I haven't
taken any JavaScript courses except the
stuff on free code camp everything else
has just been YouTube videos and me
building stuff
do you think is ethical to edit existing
code use in in a beginning portfolio
before cream from scratch yes idea I
don't think there's anything wrong with
it
can I please describe a day as a
software engineer um kind of pens man so
every again every job is different but a
lot of times it's you get a you go into
the office you answer your emails you
handle any sort of initial initial
feedback that you need to give back you
kind of look out at how your day is
going
you prompt in again every every job is
different but you do your standup which
is where you kind of meet with your team
and discuss what you're gonna be working
on and then from there you dive into
your projects if you're blocked by
anything go and try to get it unblocked
right you talk with your team marry a
man I need some back-end work hook a
brother up with the API you know I think
he said and they said you know someone
like Oh a man and he's a friend and work
hook a brother up with some bug fixes
right and yeah sure no problem right so
you might go and wheeling deal a little
bit and then um from there you uh you
might have some meetings where you're
meeting with your with the entire
department you might have some meetings
where you're meeting you really with you
achieved a deep dive into more
requirements it really just depends man
they all talk like coding face no I show
you none of them do
Eric just sent me another day another
email rather the other day Eric sent me
an email
apparently of him making fun of our
talking shit in a video about Eric using
the term crash course in a title of his
mu crash course I don't know what that
guy's deal with Eric is how I like to
pick on him it's unfortunate but yeah so
anyhow so you might be it depends where
you at in your project if you're a
full-stack front-end but you might be
you might be still gathering
requirements and you need to talk to
some people but most of time you're
probably just coding something out you
have the requirements and you're
building out whatever it is they want
and you're going back and forth a little
bit when you get a good mile so hey this
why God has this look I cool you know or
hey I was thinking that we could do this
what do you think or what about adding
this feature that feature and going from
there but again it's so hard to break it
down but the gist of it is you have
meetings you talk with people you work
with people you code and sometimes you
pair program sometimes you don't and
kind of you go from there do you make
mostly web sites I make make a lot of
crud tools that will be used by micro
services for the organization I make a
lot of admin tools I'm not building like
websites for Joe schmo's auto shop if
that's what you mean
using bootstrap 3 or 4 is back no I used
to bootstrap for I used it today I'm
trying to get better at CSS myself I'll
probably the main thing that you have
issues with the down the road pair as in
Pai are not PE AR as in the fruit
oh yeah I'll definitely explain what
pair for everything I don't know if
you're trying to be funny
or if you really meant ok I'm not making
fun of you if English isn't your first
language but uh what is the best way to
get laid off and qualify for
unemployment benefits I have no idea man
I've never been fired a day of my life
from anything have a coding competition
how to practice I don't know man I would
honestly just if you have a coding
competition tomorrow just chill out for
a minute and so you go and fresh people
say I reacted no Jess thought thing but
every 2 4 I see is learning angular and
PHP it just kind of depends man I I know
that PHP is big angular speed reacts big
note is not as big as PHP that's for
sure just based off the job I think note
and and note is a wonderful back-end and
I love it but it's definitely in terms
of amount of jobs not as big as PHP or
anything else so crud refers to create
read update delete these are kind of the
before main HTTP verbs and that crate
that would be your post call read would
be your get call update would be your
put calling delete would be your delete
call and so when you're talking about
crud tools you're essentially
talking about creating an admin set of
tools that has crud that has all for
those built out that's really what crud
means can you explain pair programs so
prayer program is where you essentially
are you have to developer sitting side
by side sort of working on the same
project one person maybe actually typing
the coding the other ones leading or
vice versa i code on a pc i I like my I
like PC I've always worked on a PC I'm
sick of the Mac hypetrain
that's really it
I have no plans of moving to Linux
unless I have to or I think I'd be good
for my career I just always had windows
man I've always liked it except Vista
and Windows 8 we can all agree that
those needed to dock so if I ever had to
store CSV file into Mongo I think I
sturdy image file but I don't believe I
started a CSV file no where's my daily
laptop I I have a shitty old laptop it's
something that I actually really want to
replace and maybe when April gets a job
I'll treat myself I use Visual Studio
code
any advice on trades
my advice when it comes to buying stocks
is to learn early on and just sort of
get started really a lot of times people
wait so light in life to start saving
and investing and you know honestly I
think the best time to invest is when
you're with the sooner you can and and
that may be when you don't have the
least amount of money or as far as you
have the least to lose and so you may
want to educate yourself even if you end
up taking a loss early on does anyone
use opera for their web browser god I
hope not
any advice on learning mobile web
development no I really don't I I would
advise web development over mobile
though I think there's probably more
jobs o trade as in trade skills I would
say this isn't John Smith this isn't
something that I know it a whole lot
about but if I were to do a trade school
that wasn't the stay away from the
software realm I'd probably go in the
electrician route just because I've
known a couple electricians who and a
lot of times it is something that gets
paid very well there's always going to
be a demand for it and I think that
would be and it's respected and I think
that would be of the sort of stuff that
you mentioned probably the best route to
go but again I'm not an expert in this
but that's just what I that would be
what I would look into if I was looking
into that
what is your fitness state death I am
currently in the worst shape of my life
and I'm planning on changing that yeah
it's it's something that I am working
towards I really do want to get like in
super great shape because I used when I
was in shape man I felt so good mentally
physically Zumba
maybe I'll go in the gym tomorrow I was
I was I was joking with April that I was
gonna bring this into my work I was
gonna bring the the diffuser into my
work and just have it start blasting in
the office should become power lifter
hey maybe wouldn't be a bad idea
alright guys it's getting late I should
probably try and fall asleep it's about
2:00 a.m. my time right now
unfortunately with the way that my last
year's have been going this will get
deep monetize but I will continue do
them all the same as I appreciate being
able to I appreciate the support you
guys give me by just watching my videos
in general and I'm going to continue to
try and write good content normally I
try to have a more excited exit this so
I will leave you with a quick final
thought as I like to end my videos with
final thoughts for this late night early
morning edition of our Saturday weekly
that I've talked a little bit about
giving my Fitness back on track getting
back in shape and sometimes it's hard to
forget that we are mind body and soul
right and we focus so much on the mind
right we focus so much on why is my
girlfriend up right now do you guys see
this nonsense April over here is
creeping from in bed baby go back to
sleep oh my goodness
we're definitely not going right now
April
anyhow so so what I'm trying to say is
it's very easy to get caught up in
software about just the mind right we
just need to learn we needed setting
your focus on the line and sometimes for
you get a little bit about the soul
sometimes forget about the body and we
forget that they all need to be in sync
right so what what needs to happen is
when you get them all in sync everything
else works better and so that's really
what's going to happen by me exercising
and working out and getting back in
shape
I will think clear I will think more
crisply and I will continue to become a
better developer it just means in the
short term I have to sort of change my
mannerisms to get back to that point so
just a reminder to kind of try and
maintain yourself as you devote your
mind entirely to something give some
time for your body so I appreciate you
guys all thank you so much for watching
I'll see you next time
and as always don't forget to comment
like subscribe share support me on
patreon all that good stuff I am going
to bed
indefinitely not to the gym at Joe ham
