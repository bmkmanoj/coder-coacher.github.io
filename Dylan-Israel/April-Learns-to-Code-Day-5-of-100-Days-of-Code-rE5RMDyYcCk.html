it alright so once we get up and running
here losses whoa
we for us to get up and running
oh say we're having a connection issues
it was I I can't I hope our internet we
have to say internet provider so the
wirings better in our new place well we
look at to see what was built it might
be better just a real severely they
don't update the wiring inside yeah I'm
real sick of this look banging so so um
let's just chat
that my name is Fisher the bullier has
been fishing you wanna grab just got me
a bottle
so
so you started let's catch everybody up
about where you're at before I jump into
some stuff so so uh welcome Dennis love
what ah so you have been working on your
turn this on a lot of content today yeah
I'm tired we gotta push through man
gotta push there all right so um alright
so um hi so um you've been working on
the portfolio project right yeah so and
I was trying to fix as you guys know I'm
doing a vertical menu and I was trying
to add some like look to it or style to
it and I broke my code and I spent so
long fixing it I was like there's gotta
be a better way and then I googled
better way of a vertical menu and turns
out there's the better yeah
looks like every doing my code and so
part part part of that is I didn't want
to and he didn't want to tell me there's
a better way yes because I think that
there is I think there's benefit to fail
failure when you're starting out so I
wanted you to struggle through it and
get there now I'm going to because you
my advice is maybe to make a simpler
page as well just getting started and
then when we actually make your dev
portfolio you'll do another one of the
one you want that's part of my advice um
now what I'm going to show you right now
is you've been using JPEGs for the menu
and pngs yeah turned out you
use something else to call those yeah
yeah and I'm gonna show you right now I
already saw it you understand how it all
works I mean as far as I can understand
how it all works yeah but I haven't
messed with the code so how does it work
internally or what effects what I'm not
quite sure all right cool so that's what
that's what we're going over right now
um so for those of you guys who don't
know that kind of the standard we have
something called icons most of the time
most the icons you see come from one guy
font awesome IO font awesome is kind of
the go-to icon guy um I'm big fan of his
I've used his it's the same ones that
I'm using on my website coding which by
the way it's a funny thing apparently
I never told April I had a website for
the channel okay yeah you mentioned it I
was like wait so I oh let me show you
the website um but you see all these
these aren't JPEGs these are actually
icons from font awesome yeah Google has
some - yeah we're gonna we're gonna be
using phone awesome because that's the
more common one okay just get you
familiar with it Stream is really I'm
sorry man there's nothing really I can
do about it it's it's just my shit ass
Internet man even though I'm plugged in
and we have it's not even Irish it as
Internet it's a wire yeah yeah so in a
month we move I'm hoping the wiring is
better so I'm sorry there's nothing I
can do about it lagging hopefully it
will clear up it's been it's been shit
all day though so I'm sorry about that
alright so all right let me go through
here so we have my icons background we
this actually uses an API which pulls
from YouTube so this is my most recent
video and patreon page PayPal YouTube
has all my analytics and stuff like that
and then my social media again and then
that goes my YouTube page I have about
me page that's the most impressive about
me ever
but I was trying to use different like
things for each so this is all building
angular by the way and then I have a
store page and the story of the stickers
are and things like that and then I have
tutoring services as well that's
basically all it's up here right now so
when I was building this I never
actually got to building my own deaf
portfolio and yeah I love this picture
you took by the way this is one of my
all-time favorite pictures although
something in it reminds me of my dad
which is weird it's the way you're
holding your shoulders so I'm holding my
shoulders yeah your dad you said the
same way and you you said the same
weighs you down and you walk the same
way as you're done hmm that's why I
always find it funny
all right so um anyhow so that's that's
my website waiver you've seen you've
seen it all there's no other pages that
I remember there may be one or two pages
that are built I never actually went up
so font awesome icons are let's just
jump straight into the icons and so um
he has he's in iteration four point
seven now but he adds tons icon there's
even a free code camp on was pretty cool
and in here and they have something for
Etsy that everything you can imagine
these are all high cons that you can use
it's all free all you have to do is link
it over with a link file a lot of times
when I go and I try and find an icon
I'll just search for oh that's an email
I'll search here for let's say a home
page right and then you have your home
icon so let's take that as an example
because that's one you had on your
portfolio so the way that you do it once
you import the file
you remember how a link tag works you
use there's a there will be a link free
to get this and then you copy this and
you have file that you assign a class to
this I tagged and you say fall fought
Ashe home and so that's the name of this
icon is fall dash home
everyone's telling us the streams
lagging I'm sorry guys there's no you
see I know it's lagging let me see if
there's anything you can do my fucking
upload speed is shit right now
what is it hate me baby um all right
anyhow so sorry but we got to move
forward here we're study so um it comes
in different sizes as well so it's the
cool thing about fun awesome itself
design kind of very stuff so there's the
basic size you saw like in this salinity
of camera retro so it's fall fall camera
retro and then you have fall large fog -
2 X 4 - 3 X 4 - 4 X 5 - 5 X 4 the size
of it let's go yeah so straightforward
easy to use but this is what you should
be using when you're using your icons um
so you'll see here an example of some
vertical menus as well so something -
looking - I believe this is using
bootstrap so if you're sharing to create
a vertical mini they'd be the good place
to look um and you also have animated
icons as well for certain things you're
not gonna be using in it any of this uh
I don't think less you want to stack
icons I don't know that was a thing yes
that's what I want in lying
what sued me forever I was fucking with
my icon sounds like I want them stacked
what do you mean shut like in a button
on top of each other but I want them I
don't know my whole oh I got a mess it's
alright it's a don't don't select that
it's it's a learning process alright
alright so that's how you would do do
the icons so when you go back and you're
gonna swap them out make sure you use
not something any damn starting from
scratch okay so you start from scratch
you're gonna want to use fun awesome
moving forward um okay so we're gonna
start back on the JavaScript okay so
good
all right so oh wait a second what are
we waiting nothing I need to check
something this is slightly different
than the version you're doing yeah okay
cuz like where I told you that this is
gonna have more stuff and be slightly
different okay
yeah because I was going through my
going through my thing and we got to a
point on there where I was talking about
crap and I remember but it stopped at
the like you can divide congruent
augmented functions those are as a
Division one okay so I didn't get a
chance to do all this other stuff we've
been doing the multiple multiple already
this stuff yeah
and that's fine because we're covering
more all that stuff should be in here
this is just more it may be a little
jumbled um so what we're going to be
talking about is an array so array trim
route we had like a length function on
strings there's also a length function
two arrays as well and there's other
functions and we're going to be talking
about one of those right now so say we
wanted to add a value to the end and
typically this is what you'll do is
you'll add a value like say we an
example that is say we put in two
numbers user puts in one to ten and we
want it to print out one through ten we
would push that we've pushed from one
all the way until it hits ten and you
just push it to the end so that going in
order one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten but push allows you just
to add the item to the end of the array
it's one of the most common things that
you'll ever do in coding
would it be an example one of those
contains just what I said if you wanted
to count fine obviously with a
calculator you something like that yeah
so remember how we had an array if we
wanted to and we want to store the order
of input in order we wanted to go if we
put one we want that to be one if we put
two we want the next one to be two so
the way that we make sure that they're
in order is we push to the array because
if we push through the array happy joy
it will add an array happy joy here to
the end right if we push the number two
you'll add the number if we were to push
the number two to this Ray it'd be like
this that would be the actual result so
you see here in this example they give
you our array if we have Simpson jcat
and then it pushes an array to it and
it's the last one now if we were to push
another item to the array that would be
the new last one so it adds to yes to
the end of the array right now there's
other ways to change the array but push
specifically adds it as the last item in
the array okay all right so in this case
if we wanted to add we want our array to
have a dog three we do my array dot push
and then we pass in the array dog I'm a
three and that would be come back john
xxiii cat two dog three
what exactly like we said we wanted to
keep things in order in the list and we
could you read erase just keep things in
order and you can add to the end of it
well they erase store things multiple
things okay so like in the calculator
example an array would store your inputs
each number that you input it an
operator would be pushed to the array so
go one and let's say we added 2 to the
first fossils like those variables right
the ones that just sit there as a
placeholder the parameters a time
written in the function yeah you could
push that value to an array yes so let's
say we had our add some odd function and
we wanted to push it to the array for
whatever reason that number we could
push it to our total array and then at
the end we'll just calculate the total
then you have the pop array so similar
it's the exact opposite this adds to
push adds to the end of it later right
pop removes the last item in the array
so like say say in our calculator
example we added a number but we
actually we actually didn't want to add
it it was a mistake with that finger did
so in in this case say we hit the back
key it actually pops it off of our last
entry that's what's happening here so
let's say this is an array and each one
of those is an index spot when we hit
back we just popped it pop-pop-pop
pop-pop-pop pop-pop-pop it removes the
last item of the array why would you
need okay so like the clear yeah it
clears that last spot only and push adds
to the end
so sometimes you
so the clear button would be the pop
function on a calculator if the clear
button only removes the last thing I
don't remember what what there's a
couple buttons there's one button that
does do this there's one that clears all
of it and there's one that just closed
last yeah
Jeffrey one clear is just the last is
the same thing as pop okay all right
Lucas that's all right do you want to
have a coffee no oh it's really late
already Saturday it's only 6:00 it's too
late all right so that's pop so we want
to remove the last item from here how do
we do it on our on the array so our our
array right here popped off the last
value and now we have one two now we we
can actually oh by the way we can
actually store these values as we pop
them off so let's say we wanted to pop
it and store it so in this case say
removed from my array we can actually
store that value now so in this case
removed from our rate is the last value
of three so this value is three live it
into the new variable and our array
value is now one and two so we're like
linking them together a bit so in my
array here when we call dot pop what is
removed from my array what value is that
which one are we removing for my array.c
no I know but I read my array is zero
and one and which one is the last one oh
one yeah so we're always you're topping
always is your nose always so removed
from my array is an array of cat into
and my array is now just a
two-dimensional array with John and 23
maybe that's why I was like a piece
because I didn't want to get rid of the
cat
yes yeah my area look kitty all right so
so similar to how we just remove the
last item with pop there's a way to
remove the first item as well um-hmm
just becoming loose from wear-and-tear
so that's where shift comes in so shift
actually is essentially just pop on the
front there pop in the middle uh yeah
but but you specify where essentially
because you know not everything's gonna
be one two three
your array could be tens of thousands oh
hey Susie so and I remove from my array
we want to let it equal my array and
we're going to remove the first one and
so what is our value of my array after
we shift it good and what value are we
storing to remove from from my array
good
all right so there's also unchipped as
well so shift removes the first one on
shift actually puts a new first item
push ads to the end unshifted s-- to the
beginning okay pop takes out the end
shift shift takes off the front mmm and
shift pushes to a new new front so what
was in the zero index would now be the
one index someone was in the one index
would now be in the two index
push ads to the end and pop removes from
the end so in this case we wanted to
unshifted this value out and now we want
to shift into the array you notice we're
not we don't have to store it in a
variable if we don't want to it usually
won't for the most part if you're
getting rid of it
you're getting rid of it you probably
don't need it you don't need it to go
another variable usually not it depends
on what you're doing with your code but
typically you don't need to store
something you're getting rid of right um
so we unshifted
remember parameters we passing a value
and so what do we what are we doing here
what are we fussing in it we're passing
into the crimp in this case we're
passing Paul 35 does Paul have to be
stored anywhere can you
just wait we we could store it in a
variable and pass the variable in or we
just pass the value in okay so that
value is just something we're making up
and putting in correct
seriously Chi to illustrate the concept
so we're adding this to the front so now
our thing would be Paul 35.3 yeah I saw
the new printouts I have for a free code
cool yep welcome Kevin
sorry for the lag apparently my
Internet's garbage today the way the
wiring is oh my fucks with the wire I
think it's a he
I really do oh yeah cuz that would be
the only difference it's really hot
today in Florida
alright so holy shit
you know Joe glue this I dropped 20,000
frames 48 percent of this has been
skipped
I mean for something skip like it means
is there's an unwatchable video oh that
sucks
that's a lot yeah
fuck me right now
sigh oh right house is wiring right
house it should fix the fuck already
it's not their apartment building
certain building should people should be
doing it
that's true but create a shopping list
in the variable my list the list should
be a multi-dimensional race several sub
arrays you should be at least five
silver racing list so we're gonna what's
a multi-dimensional Reagan it has
different types uh it does but that's
not correct
Oh balls a it's an array has an array
within it an array has an array within
it yes that would make it a
multi-dimensional array okay alright so
the first elements in each of your sub
arrays must be strings alright so in
this case we have a Milas variable and
we're going to have another array in it
and it says the first one should be
string so for it to be a string what do
we have to do symbols character
substances or words I don't know if the
symbols all right
oh I don't think so characters letters
or words correct now how do we we denote
that with quotation marks all right so
in this case we'll do well just do dog
food all right
and the second element of our us needs
to be number so let's say we're let's
say we're buying stuff from the store
and for our grocery minions and so dog
food we're buying cat food so remember
five items for the cats each one of
these arrays within our array so this is
your grocery list cat cat list grocery
cat list right and that we have an array
of things we're going to buy each one of
them has what it is and how much it
costs so if we wanted to add something
to this right here what is the can of
cat food cost
let's do whole numbers one dollar
so if we wanted to add another yeah but
another one would be another item that
we would add litter maybe yeah well uh
okay so the reason why I'm
Oh was it dimension a multi-dimensional
array multi-dimensional array would you
print out a list uh yeah so in this case
like say these are all items the way
that you know like a site would know
what it is is every site has a bunch of
info about each one of those items like
and so it has like descriptions it'll
have price it will have keywords and so
this is kind of a basic example the same
thing of like here you're going to the
grocery store and you put down what
you're going to how many you're going to
buy and what it is you're buying you
have a list but then you have a more
details in in that smallness
all right so uh shot three bucks it's
like alright 12 so in the interest of
time because they want to Center five of
these I'm just going to control C and
run it
they're not like that
I have five items in my lungs
the first elements in each of your sub
arrays must all be strings
is array is not defined this isn't
messing up because it is an array so
it's going to refresh this page real
quick
there you go the tests were just messing
up no big deal all right so remember
functions what are functions again let's
do a refresher
Joel welcome welcome hi so uh no not
really
now what was it what was the word that
you use the word recycled for functions
Oh
now why did you use that word cuz you
because that you're able to reuse same
code so functions store your code and
you can call it and reuse it fine so odd
that it just doesn't happen naturally
computers are actually really dumb yeah
and so I know so really as smart as you
yes at least they're consistent I'm told
me don't know I just I don't work what
well this the point being is that a
computer can only do it things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
