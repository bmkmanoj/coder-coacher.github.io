perfect under loops you can see I did a
little bit of it here I'm actually going
to go ahead and redo it I was having a
bunch of trouble with the kitten when I
was doing that so we're just doing it
was just acting crazy jumping all over
the place but I should go by pretty
quick on on these first few so the first
one is just kind of telling us what's
going on and that they're going to
contain minimal instructions meaning
they're actually going to want us to
figure it out what for loops what if
statements that we need to do so um this
is asking us let's actually copy that
incase we get stuck so def is underscore
even so we need to find a function it's
going to take a parameter X and if it's
even returned true so X modulo 2 equals
equal to zero we need an if statement so
if modulus X modulo 2 is equal to so if
it is even return true and if it's not
even else return false and make sure
false is capitalized cool that's all it
is
same thing here let's check this out so
define function is an int so this one
was a little act I remember having to
look this up when I was doing it because
it was a little bit tricky I was getting
a little confused with JavaScript at the
time but let's start off with what we
know for sure we need to do which is
define the function and then in here I
was trying to think is there a type or
anything like that so this right here is
at saying we can't do that so what
instead it wants us to do is we're going
to say if X is equal equal to X to int X
meaning that if our value is the same
thing as the integer version of that
value it's an int because we're testing
for that we want to return true else
oops
else return false
all right um so same thing here dad
define a function so deaf digits um and
it's going to take in a parameter N and
here's one that I think obviously will
do it relatively quickly but this might
be something that may frustrate people
so it says what it wants us to do is
convert it into a string and then parse
it so I think it says in the hint here
somewhere yeah so we're going to say n
is equal to STR and so what we're doing
is we're storing we're taking that
integer and we're putting it compare
turn it into a string some text so oh
next what we want to do we're new for I
in n so basically for each value in n
we're going to create a total and let's
do it up here we're going to initialize
a blanket total of 0 and then we're
going to set total is equal to total
plus the turn now we want to turn eye
back into an integer and then at the end
we want to turn or turn the total
Oh return tool oops
there we go right now I believe we are
back at it and this one was I didn't
think they wanted us to do it this way
but hey it works so all right so first
thing we need to do is to find the
factoids did that so the way though let
me just explain this code rather than
rewriting it so if you take a factorial
of zero like anything to the zero power
is still 1 so the best way to do that is
to set an else--if statement so that
when it's at zero return a 1 for that so
in this case we are actually looping
through our X a couple times because
we're recalling the same function and
then we're just decrementing it so say
this is 4 4 times 4 minus 1 I'd be 4
times the third and then just keep on
looping and looping and looping until we
get our answer so let's just save and
spit and now I think we're caught up so
we're going to define a function called
is prime so def is
underscore prime
it's going to take X isn't input and for
each number n from 2 to X minus 1 test
if X is evenly divisible by hand if it
is return false all right so it's a
number for each n from 2 to excellent
then test of X alright so I think we
need a hip and an L if and if this is
true return false LF this is true return
false and indent this properly so I'm
just setting this up real quick because
I'm probably going to look at the hint
in a second else return true all right
so define function for each number n
from to remember all numbers listening
to our not prime numbers so if for each
number N
so if two to next all number is less
than two are not prime numbers so if X
so first one if the first thing easy one
is if X is less than two return false
cool now all right I'm I'm I know we
need to write a for loop here so let's
just check this out real quick so we
need to rent a for loop with at the end
for for to parse no oh I think what
we're going to do here this is slide six
is to a for loop damn fifty answers 76
Oh see right here what's going on here
so the first thing good and then wall n
is less than X and we're going to set n
is equal to 1 in this case yeah for loop
let's see an example here so if a X is
less than to return false else n is
equal to 2 while n is less than X if X
modulo n is exactly equal to 0 return
false break and as we go n plus 1 test
if X is evenly divisible by then so LF X
divided by 2 modulo 2 X modulo 4 you're
in from 2 to X minus 1 so if X much line
I just understand where we set n we just
give it a default value so let's take a
look at this I'm not even sure if this
works so first thing first let's make
sure this works
no let's actually put this right here
so we did that return false else n is
equal to 2 okay so our else statement is
actually testing the lowest value for n
which is 2 because starting at 2:00 and
then art else if it's X minus 1
so in this case he's just increment a
ten by one let's see if there's they
there's another one I don't like that
here
so if this / this is equal equals zero
return false so what's this is saying if
this is perfectly even return a prime
number it's not a prime number so it
returns false then else break it and
increment n by one again
okay that kind of makes sense so this
let's break this down one by one as we
integrate it into our own code so they
do a while pair I don't exactly like
that
so LF so we're going to say here if X
modulo 2 is equal equal to 0 actually
let's start from the beginning so we if
else Wow hmm I don't like the while loop
let's get another example
apparently we're not dealing on a
struggle with this
there's a lot of code I don't think it
needs to be that good you know it's
crazy I've written this like four
different in four different languages
too
so let's let's look at this so deaf is
probably max count if X is less than to
return false cool so we're on track with
that l if X is equal equal to two return
true because oh because just two is the
prime number so we can do that so that
makes sense
remember your prime numbers and then
from there dang this guy went all out on
this alright so else if none of them are
return true okay so we have to check the
rest of it so we're we're really messing
up is in our final else statement this
is what we need to fix so we need to do
a for loop let's integrate this part
into our code and so you seem a little
bit cheating but I count is less than
three I don't remember
I'll count sour hen and do we integrate
count we set count to zero so at the top
of here we'll set count to zero here
okay so let's break this down real quick
because the bigger bulk of this code we
kind of copied from the Q&amp;amp;A forum so
what's going on here is we're testing to
see if there's a prime number first line
to find the function take a parameter we
create an empty variable count and we
set it equal to zero the very first
thing we're going to check is 2 because
2 is a prime number so if it's 2 if X is
less than 2 return false because
actually 2 is a prime number
why would we always because it's 1 it's
not less than or equal to so if X is
exactly equal to a return true so this
is just some semantics based off prime
number so now what do we do so right now
we're
seemed to see starting at one and
incrementing it based on our parameter
plus 1 if X divided by any number before
it could be a million all the way up to
million won and every number that comes
before it if that is exactly equal to
zero increase the count by one so if the
count is less than three I understand
what this count is here
I guess this is maybe just so you don't
check all the values plus equals one so
we're checking for the value as we
increment it count if counts less until
you return true
okay so I think what's going on here is
eventually if it's a prime number three
is more than enough we could probably
change that to two or one and I think
that's what the the gentleman was
thinking it did this so let's keep it
going here define a function called
reverse that takes a string text and
returns the string in Reverse for
example reverse ABCD should return d c
ba all right so def reverse takes in
some text that's a parameter you may not
use reverse or minus one to help you
with this you may get the string
containing special you may get a string
containing special characters for a kind
of a blah blah blah consider how you
would loop through text starting with
last character for the first alright
so we're getting some a string and then
we'll say for I in text so we're going
to parse through it first
Brian text
okay so the issue I'm having right now
is I don't remember how to decrement
properly because we want to start at the
end so all we have to do is go backwards
and then restore it so let's see what
someone says see what function yeah the
I minus 1/4 so
so we're going to create a blank it and
then we're going to turn it so plus the
text length and sex minus I minus one or
in range of length of text so get got it
so I was thinking there was a default
function but it's probably this reverse
that they're talking about so we are
going to create an empty string and then
in there we're going to just parse
through this like we would for I in text
and then we're going to say X is equal
to X plus the length of text
- hi - one the reason we - the one is
because the length is always one more
than the index variable so we're going
to as this is increasing we're just
going to be subtracting it and then
we're going to - an additional one and
then we're going to return X and I
should reverse it unsupported judge here
to go through unsorted before it s
yarnÃ­s -
Oh
I still have to figure out what the
difference is with these brackets this
what is our example have here out text
the length of text text plus the length
of text
okay so this is actually a number I see
what's going on here
so text length of text so this is our
index variable and this is our string
that we're taking it for I think I got
the brackets wrong in yeah
they did say that we're going to have to
be working a little harder on this one
so let's see here go through and support
operative type for stringing us X minus
n or something why are we getting it and
it's cuz of that so X is equal next
invalid syntax okay X is equal to X plus
our text with the index of the length of
the text - I - 101 extra bracket there I
going insane
so X you're the text for range and
length of text and all I should be fine
text the text - I - one bracket let's
just do this let's
all right so let's take a look here so
we've set it equal to an empty string
that's good we set our function up for I
in range length text for I in text see
if this works
so we're suing an operand tight we're
parsing through when we're trying to get
no invalid literal free and base-10 all
right
so apparently for I to parse this we
need because we're treating I hear oh
alright we can't do this like this
because I is actually a character from
the string it's not an integer so what
we could do if we wanted to change it as
set account equal to zero we'll just do
like this - count and then count equals
count plus one
so let me go over I just did real quick
so we could have changed for loop to the
way the who's ever code it was that we
used before but we created a blanket a
blank string we then created a count
variable and then for each character in
the string we're going to take our empty
string set it equal to itself because we
wanted to continue then we're going to
take our text get the length of that and
then we're going to subtract it as we
move back so I hope that makes sense
then we have to increase count to do it
properly
all right so define a function called
anti Vasudev and time underscore eval
takes one string text turns the text all
the valves involves for example hey you
should return this I don't count why is
eval like sure to look case
alright so let's say for I in text and
then we'll say if I is equal equals two
let's do this if I is not equal to a god
how do you I know there's got to be a
way to do tricks to the phone see check
to see if al you can do C and yes let's
do it like this
alright so if I is not equal to 4 I am
Tex
that's something how do we append it to
do all of these so because I don't want
to all right let's just do it like this
to see what happens so if I does not
contain this this isn't going to work I
don't know if I'm gonna do this
so same thing we're first off we need to
create a word so to equal blank and then
if I is not in there
we'll set word equal to word plus I so
and then we need to return word so let's
just run this it should work but it's
not going to work like we needed to so
instead of writing out all these if
statements in hands let's see if they
have someone has a better way of just
calling one if statement and that was a
215 the anti Val yeah
turn dot join fry fry in text if I
thought lower not in eye let's try not
in not in
there you go so perfect so that's
exactly what we're looking for so you
create the function with the parameter
we create a empty variable empty string
variable we parse through the string and
we say if any of the string is not
contained in here at it so let's go
ahead and just call it and we'll do
pizza fungi and see what's going on here
so we can see that it works don't forget
the parentheses
except it doesn't print and bam so there
you go
Pizza poker goo and I'll be right back
so it looks like we're doing someone's
Scrabble score so define a function
called Scrabble score all right chef
Scrabble score that takes down a
parameter word now returns the
equivalent Scrabble score for the word
so I guess the first thing we do is
create a score is equal to zero
assume your input is only one where it
contained no spaces or punctuation and
it's mentioned no need to worry about
score multipliers your function should
work even if the letters you get our
uppercase lowercase are mixed all right
and so they only go alright so what
we're going to do here is something
similar to what we did and so the first
thing we want to do is create a for loop
we're going to say for I in word so
we're going to get the letters I is
equal to I dot lower alright so down
lower well find out there there's
definitely a way to lowercase it and
then we'll say
so this is our I this is what we need
all right so we'll say for once a score
it's equal to score plus word I that'll
give us our int turns score now let's
actually since we don't normally you
would do this but cuz all these letters
are lowercase in this case let's not
mess with it your code through a string
indices most managers on this here
so for I in word
oh all right so we returns scores equal
to well gotcha
all right so we do this and then when
this needs to be an int I think that's
what's going on here
so wait what's there one more time so
does your Scrabble score function take
exactly one argument a string your code
through string indices must be integers
not STR air so this is parsing through
the string frying word there's some the
score it should be but it should work
right so this is the key unless you give
us our value so we're obviously doing
something fundamentally wrong so let's
just check this out real quick it's
probably something really really small
we're W N word
and I don't think he needs a while loop
yeah total
or letter in word total or in our case
score oh
okay so that's probably where our air is
right now see how they use total and
when you score I didn't even see that
this was called score so um that's my
fault for not paying attention so we
have to set total is equal to total
total and this is actually score because
this needs parser here not for through
here I dot lower
oh my god how do you call the dot lower
again letter dot lower
what so we have all right so let's
compare make sure we're doing everything
correctly here so we're good there we
are for loop looks good
where's that total equals equal to total
plus score lower oh here it is return
total back with our score mistake so
we're on the right path we just had some
simple areas up we're very confusing
because our naming convention what's bad
all right so write a function called
sensor this one's taken two parameters
so it's really going to be hard text
word it should return the text with the
word you choose for place with asterisks
all right
so we'll say for example assume your
input strings want to connect any
punctuation we actually should question
the Millers alright so asterisks equals
and we'll say four
I in range I'll do like this count is
equal to zero this is probably bad
convention but I like doing it this way
for I in word count equals count plus
one so we're finding the length of the
word and then we're going to say
asterisks sternness actually that's a
stupid word replace place it's better
place word is even better so replace
word is equal to replace word plus
master all right
get rid of that actually
now we need an if statement
say if so the text is the whole thing I
want our place or right so if text
contains is contain stock contains you
can use string nuts split to help you
just
I don't believe we've used string not
split
yeah I'm with this guy please explain
what this does when it's important
exercise 10 the split function takes the
input string and turns it into a list
creates a new item in the list for every
space in the string
so print chocolate wouldn't get
chocolate but if I put I like chocolate
dot split I would simply get
okay so we'll say how do we going to do
this so we'll say text equals text dot
split so that's going to break it up and
then we're going to say if for I and
text if I is equal equal to word I is
equal to replace word
texts I
now how do I go into this so so if that
is equal if eyes equal equals a word so
the text of I is equal to replace word
and then we return return text I feel
like I made a lot of errors but we'll
find out right now does your sense your
function take exactly two arguments the
string text and a word replaces aspects
or code through listing to cease must be
integers on STR air so let's go with a
frying word replace word
place word
do this let's try and see if this does
it join
place word I don't think that's what
they're saying
then we'll say for I in Texas if that
word so for the value in text because
this should split it up into a list of
words now see if this is equal to our
word
so if
next time
all right so I seem to be having an
error here
the phone call but here we are I found a
quick example of someone who is just
doing it so much better than I did and
we're just going to go ahead and use
this because it's perfect
so apparently to split the text we don't
actually have to set it to a variable
this will automatically store it in
there for this function yeah so text 2
is basically just a blanket variable
that we like what you're doing and then
they use replace I don't remember them
bringing up replace so it's kind of
maybe maybe we did an earlier section
I don't remember using replace but this
is exactly what we need
so we're saying our new word from our
split text we want to replace the word
with the length of the text so with
asterisk so and this the length is just
however long that word is so that's it I
mean it's pretty pretty simple if you
know the replace method or the split one
they've brought up in this one
apparently so we're struggling through a
little bit here but they did say was
going to be a little bit harder all
right so to find a function called count
so def count takes in a two parameter
sequence and item returned the number of
times the item occurs in the list so
all right so sit will set item inventory
inventory equal to zero for example one
appears three times but you should do it
the long way for practice oh my god this
guy sounds like one of my instructors
it's like you can use sets we want you
to make a set but don't use the built in
set thing that you'll use the rest of
your life we just want you to do it the
hard way
for practice all right um what are we
doing here so inventory is equal to zero
and then we'll say return number times
item occurs and list all right so
so if
four we have four we need a if I will
say for so sequence is a list so say for
I in sequence I beam the item
we say if I equal equal to item
inventory equals inventory plus one and
take out that if statement and then
return and venturi I think that sure
cool so just go over this real quick we
take in a list with a string and we're
saying or I guess and theory could be a
number we're saying for the item for the
item in the list for for the object for
the thing in the list if that thing is
the same as the item increase our
inventory by one at the end return it so
to find a function called purify takes
in a list of numbers or removes all
numbers from the list for example 1 2 3
ok so purify ticks ticks in listed
number so it was just your list don't do
that
only numbs use my allergies
alright um I'll do for I in numbs and
we'll say if I modulo 2 it's not e not
equal to Z so we'll do I modulo 3
because if it's modulo 3 not 1 on high
modulo 2 it's not equal to 0 actually
we'll do equal to 0 and we'll create a
new list updated update it and we'll set
that equal to empty we'll do we'll say
updated dot append I and then return
updated I believe that should work
so you create a function called purify
your code through a global name sheriff
is not defend f-fine wins the two is
equal equal to zero there you go
all right so we define our function
we've taken a list we create an empty
list we say for each number in our list
if that number is even we want to add it
to our new empty list and at the end we
return it so def product takes a list of
integers as input and returns the
product of all the elements the list so
I'll just do an inventory again actually
I think we didn't know them SawStop
gnomes and we'll say
don't worry about the Listerine up to if
I should return all right we'll say
let's do just a count equals zero
actually some a keyword so yeah just eye
soap count our total totals better word
total equals zero we'll say for I and
noms total equals set this to one
hope it's good zero so totally you call
this total times I return total that
should be it so we take in a list of
numbers we create a we can't set this as
a 0 because anything multiplied by 0
will be 0 and I'll just always be 0 so
we set it to 1 so it doesn't change
anything so we then just multiply by
each of the values and we get our total
product all right
we're making progress now and I think
this will be only an hour long video I
think so we define a function called
remove underscored duplicates and then
for example should return one in two so
this is going to take in a list let's
just do gnomes again
so we're going to create a new list so
we'll just call it inventory we'll set
that equal to a blanket one and
eventually what we want to do is return
inventory so so far that should work it
just would return the empty list at this
but we want to do is for I in nums so we
want to go through this one now we need
if we know that we actually need another
for loop we're gonna say for I in
inventory for I and inventory actually
this seems to be different will do for J
in the inventory and now we do an if
statement oh excuse me if um I is not
equal to J so for we'll say if
so we have iterate through one if it's
not in the J so if I is not equal to
inventory equal to J
I think this is going to mess it up
inventory dot append hi I don't believe
this will work goes this is only
checking one one thing I think it needs
to check the whole list so let's just go
ahead and see so remove two plus return
empty instead of four or five so if I
it's not equal to J all right now to
provide let's see here
so if I if I is not in inventory
inventory that append I all right so
they say a not n B so if I is not in
inventory there you go okay so the not
in again which I didn't bring up except
we used it hid in here and this this was
only sectors kind of bothering me I said
either they didn't I just don't remember
or it's not in here but basically we
create same thing we've been kind of do
is just creating empty ones and then
we're running through our list and we're
saying if this is not in our inventory
add it to it add it to the end and then
return it so cool so last but not least
we are going to create def a median this
is probably in some sort of math
function already take the list so we'll
just do nums again for example meaning
one two sugar turn one those can be of
any size alright so if you don't
remember where the median is because
it's been a while since you mess with
algebra median is the middle number in a
sorted sequence Oh God
alright so we're going to need to do
first thing we're going to need to get
the length of gnomes
so we'll say length is equal to Ln of
nums all right so that's going to give
us a total amount number so if we have
five we want it was one two three four
five we want the third one so now we're
going to say if length modulo 2 is equal
exactly equal to zero so if we have four
one two three four we need those two
middle ones so that's the harder one
let's go
L
we want to return what the middle
function so the length divided by two so
if length of I so we have five that be
the third one I also want to return
something else in here we want to return
so the length so if the length is equal
to zero we need to add the middle number
so let's create a new variable here and
we'll say mid one is equal to length
divided by two plus 1 and the two is
equal to length divided by two plus one
minus one and then we want to return mid
1 plus mid 2 and we want to divide that
by two
and this needs Vietnam I know mother
so before we move on because I believe I
may have made a mistake let's review
what we're doing here so we need to
return the average of the so if we have
four we need to return the average of
that that's cool mid mid 1 plus mint 2/2
that's good
now we have the length of it so it's
four there's four there so we need to
get the middle numbers to get the middle
number from the top you would divide by
two so in this case we need to get one
to the left and one to the right so if
we have five
so six is three minus one is two okay
this is just this should work because we
already do an if statement here so else
we need to get the middle number so else
length modulo two is odd so else it's
odd and we need the middle indices all
right let's try this so how do we get
the middle one else return gnomes length
plus one I know
so that's the length so we have five and
we need the third one so plus one let's
try this
this makes sense in my brain I don't
know if this makes sense mathematically
so we need we have five but if we divide
that by two we get two point five that
doesn't work but if we add one and we
divide it by 2 we'll still get the third
variable
yeah there's no way listen I sent out of
range median one
so let's take this else out and see if
this first one works median one return
done alright so I think our else
statement is what's going on here
so do we end up properly I guess we did
back that up
alright so we need to return the middle
number r3 so we have the length
so
the length is oh my god I think it's
minus 1/2 trying to return for median
return for instead of 4.5 so this is I
think this is good here this is not so
our length is one greater
all right let's let's see a hint
so
integer division wonderful all right so
our number we get our lines we divide it
by two we add one because you want to
see that middle number
actually this is wrong also if it's a 5
and a 5 she returned five not four
alright let's see what's going on here
that's too much code to look at yeah so
I'd like to work it out more but
considering that that's wrong
I've been a diamond I'm not going to
mess around with that all right now so
meeting here we go
oh I don't need to add one I just need
to - the one so that's what they're
saying is going on there turned five
instead of four it should return five if
I can should return five
Oh God get out of here you web tune-up
announce this all right so mid 1 + min 2
divided by 2 and then here is just
divided by 2
all right should we sorted list
Oh God we need to sort our list all
right oh I'm so sorted I didn't realize
that so
that's part of why we're getting on this
whole thing of up cuz we need to
do the sorted object has no attribute
sorted are my donor all sorted
underscore list noms a golem noms and
how do we call sorted us actually sorted
knows
the code could not run to the end
turn four instead of 4.5 so it should
return got our hull code got messed up
right here let's just go ahead and copy
and put this in and see what's going on
here
because I think my code beforehand
should have worked but so in this case
we get the Lions we sort it sort of list
equals sorted numbers okay so saying if
line is modulo 2 is equal to goes there
good sorted list so are gnomes just
still our sport so we already did that
now we're just length chart line numbers
/ - that's right
all right 2-1 that's also right returned
by - god damn it if that's it that's
going to drive me nuts
turn gnomes and lengthen no so - that
could be it I found this issues before
in Java where okay so let me explain
with what our air was right here the
reason we got four instead of 4.5
because it may not be apparent to
everybody so sometimes depending on the
language if you don't use the dot point
0 like if you don't put a decimal point
on it it will typically round down or
round up so I believe that's what was
going on here so let's check that out
and do this one more time and you can
see right here we got a 4 instead of a
4.5
so this 2 point now is what was throwing
us off right here so it's a I mean it's
one of the good reasons for watching
this video because you'd probably have
no idea what the issue was in
researching for it but that that's
what's going on right there but you know
hopefully the next video will go a
little bit smoothly this one ran a
little bit long but I actually kind of
liked it because we had to do a little
more work than just type some stuff out
so up next we're going to be doing exam
statistics so we'll probably be messing
with lists and grades and probably
rewriting some of our own average type
of things so I'll see you in the next
video and as always comments
constructive criticism and anything
wordpress related that you'd want
answered go ahead and just leave me a
comment
I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
