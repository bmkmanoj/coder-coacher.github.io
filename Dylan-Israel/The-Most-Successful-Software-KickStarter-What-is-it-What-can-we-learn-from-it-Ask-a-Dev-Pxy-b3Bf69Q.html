cats tearing up the scratching post I
won't talk to you about the most
successful Kickstarter software
Kickstarter on in the world basically
and why I think it was and what why it's
important at times are valuable way to
market yourself is with open source and
giving something away for free like a
lot it's kind of like YouTube to a
degree we're here we give away content
for free and you know we do make ad
revenue but you don't make as much money
as you probably think and you're putting
something out for free and in the hopes
that it does something for you later
and I think the the kicks are we're
about to talk about is a great example
of how you can turn that into basically
a business so if you've three sided my
website up here is I wanted to show you
in action
I made this website about a year ago
when I was learning angularjs and MIT
it's just basically my my my my website
for the YouTube channel coding tutorials
360 calm I haven't really done too much
with it just kind of something I built
for for angular again but you see these
icons right here the LinkedIn icon the
geek of the Facebook the Instagram the
Twitter the YouTube all of that our
icons that I did build those icons
where'd they come from well if you're
not familiar with phone awesome I
encourage you to get familiar 90% of the
sites you'll see will probably be using
font awesomes free icon sets all you
have to do it's just like a stylesheet
you attach a style sheet and the follow
the classes that they work with you can
see right here we have a Windows Restore
icon and anchor and you can search real
quick right like let's say we want
facebook you'll see that there's a
couple different Facebook's and so
there's I believe they're 670 s 675 free
icon so you can find one for almost
everything and these are all free 675
free and a thousand on top of that if
you decide to get the paid one paid ones
but so the gentleman who makes font
awesome
currently in version 4.7 started a
Facebook in which he was trying to raise
$30,000 right there which is you know
he's a he's a professional UI UX guy I
would imagine he's trying to make he's
like hey I've been doing this for so
long I'm giving away free free content
essentially free hours of labor and time
generating each of these right making
all these 675 maybe I can start a
Kickstarter so that I can get paid while
develop these next thousand or so for
here and what how much did he raise you
say to become the most successful
Kickstarter in history well a smooth one
point almost 1 million dollars killing
it knock it out the park right 35,000
550 people backed him and you could
still pre-order by the way so one of the
cool things this is a combination of
people appreciating somebody who's been
providing value I think to the software
community and had a Kickstarter designed
to provide value back right so he's
taking it 1 point 1 million dollars
granting he's got a deliverer on that
right just in this one ellonija is
30,000 backers for font awesome Pro in
which you'll get his phone awesome
license early with the pro version at
$20 a piece and you can get down all the
way down here and of course you get like
mugs and t-shirts if you're not familiar
with Kickstarter real quick us some
solarization that is basically someone
says hey can you help me raise money and
if you do you'll get these benefits
right and sometimes a lot they're really
dumb if you want to find what some funny
ones you should check out idubbbz and he
does like a Kickstarter crack-up so two
things that are just scams people do
Kickstarter on but here we have somebody
who is on his fifth iteration of
designing icons that he's releasing
hundreds of them for free to a community
that uses them all the time I know
balsamiq a wireframing
toolkit that I use the icons you use in
there they're actually built into
balsamiq for you to design your
wireframes and things like that and he
was able to knock out not 30,000 but
just blow it out the park with almost
1.1 million
and probably this is just the
Kickstarter right you could still
preorder some of these things on his on
his website so if you're interested
about that I'm very happy for him I
think here you have somebody who's been
devoting time and energy and if you want
to look over the Kickstarter because I
find all this sort of software so very
very interesting
I'll definitely include a link in the
description of the video below but what
I want you to kind of see here is that I
would think you have you have different
um different sort of stretch goals like
let's say that you are able to get to
250,000 you know you have another one
and then 300,000 well of law and you got
all the way up there to a million
dollars good for him god man that's just
that just warms my heart that not only
is he providing value but people are
supporting somebody who's been making
icons for all of us to use right it's
not just me I'm not the only one using
phone awesome any developer will be
pretty so much familiar with this stuff
they're built into a lot of templates
right where you'll even maybe developers
will be augmenting a template and no
longer you have them built into their
example template you can see I have a
PayPal one here and uh Amazon one here
and I use them again down here hope he
builds a patreon in this next one man
I've helped me out this is just an image
right here but what I want you to take
away is that if you are starting a
project because somebody somebody today
send me a message and he said hey you
know I'm a fan I just want to let you
know I kind of look at you like mentor
it's you and whoever invented C++ so no
pressure is what he said to me and I
said okay uh he's like I am a college
student how can i how can i what should
I do I finish the front insert how
should how can I pursue what should I
proceed and I told him I said look my
advice to you is to start a long term
project one it's going to show you it's
going to stand you out right it's going
to make you it's going to make you his
you know employers when they see
projects they don't want to see a
weather app or anything like that like
that's all you got great but what they
want to see is something that's unique
and something that's different and so
maybe this started for him when he came
out with 1.0 as a way to market himself
as a way to maybe was just building it
for a client and was like hell man maybe
I could sell this maybe I can put it out
there for free people use it I'll gain
traction so there's a lot of different
ways that you can market yourself and
eventually turn a profit you know a
couple years later right so when I
started my youtube channel I just wanted
to to have a video portfolio get better
and it's done a lot for my career and I
didn't really realize that at the time I
thought it helped but not in the in the
effect it has but when you're out there
and you're thinking like a is it worth
my time it may not be worth your time of
first year it may not be worth your time
the first two years but you may find out
that as you build a following as you
gain you know is thirty thousand
followers on Twitter now fifty-one
thousand people have started in 9,000
people have forked it you may find out
that down the road you build up this
audience of people who are supporters
who who love what you do and love your
content you prove to them that you are
going to put out quality stuff that when
the time comes for you to actually sell
something they're there they're there
they're there like that fries fries in
um in a Futurama then they're holding up
their money like shut up and take my
money right so I encourage you all new
start projects that maybe you don't see
a way of monetizing them right away but
there's always a way to monetize even
free stuff down the road even if it's
just affiliate links and stuff like that
right
so I hope that you are take inspiration
from Dave here who I have no doubt his
life has like he has a lot of work right
but even if it takes him to three years
to deliver everything that's in there
and I'm sure he's releasing these piece
by piece by piece right and he's
probably hired two people he just got
one point 1 million dollars to basically
do what he already loves to do right and
it's because of the the steady grind of
fun awesome and because of the
reputation he's built in the web
development community that when font
awesome
Kickstarter the people who are fans of
it told other people and you know a
couple a couple articles
I'm sure went out on medium a couple
shoutouts here or there and before you
knew it people were on this thing and
every time he hit one goal it got talked
about and next gone next goal I have no
doubt that he never said he thought
maybe if a good run he might might maybe
double or triple jihad
what is it thirty five times what is it
what what he was looking for so it's in
the thirty thousand dollar goal done
he's roasting and you know if I raise
thirty two thousand maybe that's that's
a good amount for like that'll help me
for like five six months right and now
he probably has it enough money that at
the end of this he could ride off into
the sunset really if he wanted to but I
don't imagine you will but he has enough
that he could probably start a ui/ux
company at this point and get get some
people in there to help them but I I
loved seeing success stories like this
because it motivates me then maybe one
day I could do something that like that
in and I could go over there and be like
Dave I beat you by one dollar whatever
I'm like oh that's not really my goal
but it's not it's motive it's nice to
see other people succeed I'm very happy
for Dave Gandhi and if you want to
follow him I encourage you to do so at
Twitter and things like that
and if you haven't used the fun awesome
icons let me go ahead and just click on
I guess the superpower once as long as
you just import the file you literally
just throw this I tagged in there the
fall keyword and then the name of it
right here fall superpowers and
depending on how depending on the size
of the icon you want you just use these
additional classes right so this is a
large fought 2x 3x really intuitive
really easy and a great thing to have it
despised up your website as well if
you're not already doing that I highly
encourage you to take advantage of that
so congratulations to Dave candy
