6:00 a.m. so early for don't doing it
live yeah so uh welcome to everybody who
is new to the channel I am doing weekly
live streams we're switching up the
format just a little bit today where
we're actually gonna start off with the
topic and then we'll open it up to a
more AMA thing or any questions that you
have will be answered
maybe not correctly but they will be
answered most of the time so today we're
going to start off with with a a Tito
we're gonna start off with a topic that
I couldn't find myself to make a video
about but I thought was pretty important
and that is I'm go ahead and switch the
camera real quick that is the 50,000
scholarships that Google is putting out
for Udacity I thought this was really
cool and was worth a mention and let's
go ahead and dive into how you can
qualify for that and what you're going
to get out of it or how what you can get
out of it so as you can see here we have
a earn a developer scholarship from
Google there's 50,000 of them but it
like everything the the Devils in the
details first off this is open to US
students only so if you're unfortunately
if you're not from the United States
this won't apply to you it's not for all
the nanodegree programs it's for two
specific ones the web developer and the
Android learning path and by the way
there's a link for this in the
description it's the very first thing in
the in the video so if you're interested
in applying you can just go ahead and
click the link and go there so you have
the web developer path and we'll cover
that one first where you're basically
going to go into two groups where you're
going into a beginner track for 15,000
people who get approved and then the
intermediate track for 10,000 people
and what's gonna happen from there is
basically based off your skill lovely
get filtered into one of those groups
now from there that 10% of the top
students will be awarded with a full
scholarship for the front-end web
developer or the front-end mobile web
specialist nanodegree program that you
can continue on so that's the web
developer portion the applications are
due by the end of November so you have
about a month to get it done you only
takes about 10 to 15 minutes so if you
if you're interested in this and you
don't want to spend the money or you're
low on cash whatever it is I highly
encourage you to try your best and get
in there what you'll find is a lot of
people will apply you're like oh man
only 10% but a lot of people will apply
this stuff like this and they'll never
actually get around to to getting to
doing it I guess what I'm trying to say
they will just apply and wait and they
won't finish so if you actually finish I
think you have a pretty good chance of
being one of the groups of people that
that will have they'll have a chance of
getting the actual nanodegree all right
so that's the web development portion
and the Android development portion by
the way can someone say something in
chat it seems that I might my chat may
not be working just say hello Dylan
whatever it'd be appreciated so oh one
other thing is that not only do you need
to be in the u.s. you have to be 18
years old or so unfortunately if you're
a boy genius or girl genius thank you
for Saul Holly but if you're if you're
if you're the young stud unfortunately
this isn't going to apply to you we got
to be old stud of the eighteenth old but
in comparison so there's also the
Android which there's 25,000
scholarships going on right now and it's
going to give you three-month access
with and you get mentors with this as
well choosing beginner track or the
intermediate track of Android and
similarly it's going to go down and
break the
degrees out to a 1,500 and a tooth 1,000
for a total of 2,500 for beginner and
intermediate which is pretty cool in my
opinion and again it's the same exact
two days which is November 30th and
you'll you'll be notified by December
7th so it's gonna be a pretty quick
turnaround I would encourage you if it's
something that you're interested in to
apply I'm half way thinking of applying
but I don't know I'd like I thought I
think this would be fun but we'll see I
don't know what maybe well maybe I'll
apply myself I just don't want to take
somebody else's ticket you know I'm
already working as a developer and even
though I enjoy learning and stuff like
that I see it seems like kind of a dick
move in my opinion but I want to share
that with you again the link is in the
description below so if that's something
you're interested in all you're gonna do
is to click that link and apply today it
takes about 10 to 15 minutes from what
the article says which pretty cool right
so Google the reason that's able to
happen is Google wants more developers
because there's a developer shortage
right so here you are someone's willing
to help pay for your education
and give you practical real-world skills
and I I encourage some of you who are
interested in taking advantage stink
come up you coming up come on come on my
cats over here debating if he wants to
jump up or not come on get up dude
okay daddy pick up thank good--give ill
effect cat oh there you go oh
I so if you're new to these Saturday
weekly sir they're very similar to my
thousand subscriber livestream where
what I try and do is answer your
questions because one of the things that
I always found that I I got a little bit
of mentorship from a co-worker of mine
oh but not not too much channel I found
the little bit of mentorship I did get
was very helpful
it helped open my eyes to a lot of
things and and that's why I'd like to do
these live streams for about an hour or
so on Saturdays so if there's any
questions you guys have
if not I'll I will start discussing what
I'm working on and what's exciting in my
life or exciting for me so we'll start
there right so for those of you who
don't know I'm looking to buy my first
investment property so that's something
that I'm doing April I are going to look
at some open houses in the area just to
kind of see what's going on and it's
it's just I say that not like - oh look
at look at what I'm doing look how great
I am but it is a it is a very
interesting to go from April I are
sleeping on a couch together you know
three plus years ago - now we are buying
a house for an investment like what the
hell so that's something that I'm
learning a lot about I'm also learning a
lot about stock investment so I'm also
learning a lot about crypto currencies
lately I've been playing around in that
loving that having a lot of fun and I'm
also building my first course actually
I'm building two courses right now I've
been working on the how to create a
coding Channel course and I've been
working on the the mini portfolio
project course which is an angular
portfolio that that's designed to look
like a basic changelog and then from
there that that's kind of what I've been
working on so that I actually finished
the first rough
draft of the course I just in terms of
content I have to go and film it now and
then I'll put on the channel for five or
seven bucks that's what I've been up to
I've been recording some podcast stuff
but I haven't actually released the
podcast yet so right now I'm kind of
back piling interviews I mean other than
the YouTube stuff and everything else
mr. Boston and Jonathan Pia casa because
Lara welcome yeah so I have I have some
good videos coming out next week for you
guys as well which is kind of exciting
which is I the top five best things
about being a developer and the top five
worst things about me being a web
developer so that's gonna look good I
also have a collaboration coming out
with Ricky Garcia if you're a fan of his
he's a smaller Conan channel I think is
around 2,000 subscribers where we talk
about how you can get involved in the in
the coding community because I think
it's really important especially as
you're going to start Antigua you guys
are so quiet today normally everyone
asks questions I guess it's too early
but yes so that's coming out those are
my three videos for next week I'm trying
to if you guys don't know my schedule I
throw out a video 6 a.m. Eastern Monday
Wednesday and Friday and then I do a
random live stream on on Saturday an
occasional additional last year every
thousand subscribers although I don't
know I might be cutting that one out and
just doing since I'm doing the Saturday
weeklies see so this is one of those
opportunities where I try and write
tee-doe tee-doe come on come on
this is one of those opportunities that
I personally if you want to make
suggestions on hey you know Dylan I'd
like to see a video about this or you
just want an answer to it choose
something in your life that maybe I I
can help with no guarantee this is a
good opportunity for that as well I use
these these live streams as a way to not
only provide value but also to try and
see you know hey you know that's a
really great question let's make a video
about it
and it's how like the WordPress video
comes about if someone asked me about
WordPress for the millionth time and
finally I thought hey I should probably
do a video about this or unpaid
internships so all that sort of stuff
you guys got nothing today huh just hi
hello
something about a dick move okay well I
will continue to talk let's see what am
i working on well I just told you about
the courses I'm back piling podcasts I
need to get a couple people a couple
more people on the channel to interview
my main focus lately has been on
monetizing of the channel and providing
value in a different way and although I
haven't you haven't really seen too much
of it quite yet that's what something
that I've been trying to do for a very
riot e of reasons right but really just
for money so it's it's an interesting
balance of hey how can i monetize my
channel while still being true to myself
and not not coming like you don't want
to just sell anything what would it be
um if you did do the Udacity program
which route would you would I go let's
let's see I would probably go the mobile
web specialist just because I feel like
the front-end developer with the
beginner on it I definitely do it would
do one of the intermedia paths if I was
if I was going to do this yeah I think I
would do the four web developer go the
mobile web specialist just because I
think I'd have to go at least one the
intermediate pass good morning Michael
what is MATLAB about you know I never
have to touch MATLAB I can tell you but
my understanding is that it's like a
math programming tool a programming
language sort of thing that's used in
engineering that's my basic
understanding of it if you ever go to an
engineer truth live stream he would have
I know he's much more familiar with it
than I am
yeah so but uh in terms of monetizing
it's it's been an interesting process so
far and I think it's been pretty
successful in my opinion of being able
to monetize while still not bothering
your audience when the ways that I've
been monetizing the channel is I have
been after it after the my introduction
hey you know today we're gonna be
talking about this and that and then you
know we we jump to the the channel intro
where it's you know that's my attempt at
music to do let's do some stuff and then
it's me kind of giving a brief hey you
know shut up to blah blah blah that's
been one way that I've been able to it
and believe it or not no I haven't had a
single person complain which is really
nice because most of stuff that I've
been promoting I should say most of
stuff all the stuff I use is stuff I use
and I tend to believe that like if I use
it you guys might be interested in it so
here's a question I'm currently learning
the from learning learning the front-end
development
how many projects should I create for my
github well
not only all your projects that you do
make should be on your github but also
what I would like to say is that you
should have them live on your portfolio
site because that's really gonna be more
impressive for potential people down the
road yeah so that's been one way that
I've been able to do that I've done that
with like Humble Bundle links some of
the investment opportunities stuff that
I that I'm using so it's been pretty
cool and it's probably something I'll
continue to do but in return if you guys
haven't noticed this week so I was like
okay well I'm throwing this in here how
can I make my videos better but I can't
really devote too much time to it right
because I mean it's it's one of those
things where I don't have so much time
to work on the channel as well as in
terms of editing like the videos
probably take me an hour to edit and and
whatnot yeah it's only it's only open to
US residents sorry Michael if you're
nursing the Udacity stuff guys that's
the very first thing that we covered in
this video so check that check that out
like literally the very first thing so
you won't have to go find it we talked
about what about what the requirements
are and and the process and everything
but um yeah so I personally think either
one is fine so I my advice for learning
angular or react is spent go and do a
course in both and then learn whichever
one you like best and you'll be much
better suited that's my advice
personally also see what you know jobs
are in your area
let's see yeah well yeah so one of the
things that I've been doing because I I
was like okay well I'm throwing some
affiliate links in the videos how can i
how can I provide value in for me a time
effective manner and so to make my
videos one better and to you know just
just maybe offer a little something more
since we're throwing in some affiliate
links on so shot outs and the way that
that has happened what has evolved from
that is you may not have noticed it but
I in two of the videos this week and
it's gonna be in every video I do now is
at the very end of the video there's a
joke going on where based off the topic
like if you didn't watch the unpaid
internship video let's I'll show you
I'll show you the joke real quick case
for some reason you watch the unpaid
internship video but you should that's
decent video although I think I was a
little sleep you want started so I have
I'm basically talking about unpaid
internships and in this case I normally
don't there a time I thought it would be
a funny and appropriate alright so um at
this is this specific and they're little
like 10 second or twenty second skits
they're not like super this is wrong one
that's that's the out Jake so they're
little like 10 to 15 second skits that
are related to the topic and that's one
thing that I'm trying to do to make like
just evolve the channel slightly you
know nothing super time consuming or
costly but that I think people who watch
the video would enjoy and this is an
example one if you want to do this is
specifically from the unpaid internship
video
just a little things like that do you
think online degrees from udemy and
treehouse actually help you get
recognized by companies you know hope -
join the stream like we're gonna be
going for another 30 minutes or so maybe
an hour so this is Matt this is what
might my understanding is with these
sorts of programs I think it's I think
I'm pretty much dead on let me open up
in the window a little bit but and this
has been my experience as well with it
so when it comes to these online degrees
ninety percent of employers don't have
any idea what's going on with it I could
say that confidently because I recently
interviewed and no one knew what a the
the Udacity now degree program was they
so where it does help you
is it one you put on your resume it it's
a conversation starter where you say
that you know what is this you have
something on here about a nano degree
what what is that is that a bootcamp
what is and then you go into well it's a
sort of mini online boot camp where in
it I'm building out projects and I have
mentors and things like that and from
there I build out three projects one
using react when using reacts Redux one
using react native and on top of that
not only did I take what was there I
then built these five other projects
that are associated with it to really
reinforce it and so what you do there is
you take this thing that they don't know
and then you turn it into something that
they respect essentially and say oh well
that's you know that's really cool and
then you so so you know react yes I do
know reactant so it's essentially same
thing with the free code
certificate 99% of people will never
know a free code camp is but when you
put it on your resume it does give you
an opportunity to sell yourself and say
how it is valuable and that's really
what you have to do with it dad calm
down with the caffeine so I'm down to
one energy drink a day I am I am slowly
replacing them out of my diet though I
had some days I skip today is not one of
those days I apologize we all have our
shortcomings I show you mine happens to
be stimulants specifically caffeine
stimulants makes it sound like I'm like
a crackhead caffeine I was just trying
to sound sophisticated but caffeine is
what my issue is so what I use for
screen-capture right now we're using the
Google Hangouts that's built into
YouTube and usually I'm using OBS though
when I'm like filming my videos and
things like that but yeah so when it
comes to these online degrees it's
really about the skills you gain through
them and and how you apply them and and
how you sell them that that's the main
thing is that's where you get that's
what that's what you get out of these
programs is in college you get a degree
that is respected because people know
what a CS degree is maybe he's not as
expected as this nice college or this
you know Ivy League school but it's
still respected to a degree because that
is what the universal standard is in
society nowadays a lot of developers
aren't going to going through CS
programs that there's a decent amount of
are but there's a decent amount of art
as well and so they go alternative
routes and self taught routes and you
know you're invest in your education and
and that's some of these things that
it's about taking what you learn
applying it showcasing it and explaining
it
and that's really how you should try and
tackle these these degrees are these
certificate programs I've not got my
hands on angular five I didn't know that
that was on its way out until someone
mentioned it I'm expecting all my work
projects when I update to latest to
break exactly and one thing I would say
about these these degree programs is
thing that hurts a lot of people even
though they take these things and they
not see and they uh they they they go
and they pass because you can pass
almost any of these as long as you throw
a little bit effort into it it's that
they don't continue their learning and
they don't continue to grind right so
when I finished the first react section
of the mmm I Drive it I have no plans to
finish the nanodegree this was something
I was doing when I was looking for work
I was doing the nanodegree program I did
the first third and I started the second
one I got to the second project and then
I got it I got a job and one thing that
I did when I finished the third section
was I went and I built like four react
projects to reinforce the one react
project that I basically had my hand
held really it was a great project is
very interesting project but from there
I was able to go and build out some
smaller projects to really reinforces
things and I don't think enough people
really do that because that is really
how you learn so a good example of why
I'm going to structure my course this
way is so as I mentioned I'm doing a
small portfolio course where it's just a
project basically and we're going to
introduce a few things that aren't
necessarily introduced all that much and
one of it is refactoring because we're
going to be looking at ways to do
certain things so one way and we're
going to be looking at ways to do
certain things in a different and
sometimes better way and then testing as
well but also what I'm going to leave
you with at the
and and I'll come back and uh you know
at some point in time circle back and
had these futures but our hey here are
some additional features that came to
mind that you could take this project
that I that I walked you through and
built and explained the concepts and now
here are five features that you could go
on your own and build onto this thing
that is already existing and teach
yourself these things and and kind of
use a project as a outline of which is
only seventy percent complete which is
passing right so but how can you make it
your own after that and that's how I'm
going to try and leave my projects so
that you can continue to to have a few
ideas on how to how to go from there
because I do think a lot of times people
will watch projects and will just copy
the code more or less oh yeah I'm on I
got it
I'll only bang you leave today and not
always the case that your five still in
beta I'm already at LM in a dilemma for
so I I know for a fact that uh in my
workplace we always will be going with
the latest which is nice so when we
starting new projects and stuff like
that that would definitely be what's
gonna happen
so we'll see we'll see what happens but
I'm just hoping that they actually just
do good QA and bug testing and since
there are no there's no nuts no such
thing as enough QA probably will crash
somewhere honestly did you learn the
majority of what you know what I know
now after getting hired um that's an
interesting question in terms of actual
JavaScript I don't know I I think it's a
snowball effect right so I would say yes
but that doesn't mean that I didn't know
enough to get a job or just do my job I
would up the reason I say yes is because
if you go back and you look at the video
that I did where I said what I've
learned in my first year as a developer
I talked about what I learned at work
and then I talked about what I learned
how site of work and that outside of
work portion was larger than the at work
portion and the reason for that is
honestly after you get your first job
you need to make sure that you're
getting better for a couple of reasons
one you want to stay in the industry -
you want to make more money in the
industry and so if you were to compare
how good of a developer I am now and I'm
this is not me saying that I'm I'm like
God Tyr or anything i think im a skrub
but if you were to compare today's scrub
- a year ago scrub I am probably twice
the developer that I was in the last
when I started a year ago and I base
that off a few things sheer amount of
knowledge being exposed to a lot more
writing a lot more code and a lot of the
non software languages skills that you
pick up working in in in a in an
environment right so doing more
wireframes architecting projects people
skills in terms of how you need to
communicate your projects ticketing
systems testing quality assurance
gathering requirements these are all
things that you don't you really can't
get exposed to unless you're working on
a production level application so that
would be my thing is is yes I have
learned quite a bit since getting hired
but I think I was I I think I it doesn't
mean that you don't know enough before
you get high you know me I don't think I
went in unprepared I just think that
that that in reality I just work a lot
and so it's probably going to increase
because there's a lot room for growth so
but also I mean I say this I've had a
couple so in terms of developers at my
work I'm a little bit on the junior
level in terms of experience but I've
had other developers say to me and I
don't know if they're just trying to be
nice but that they say you know kind of
surprised to see that you're a junior
developer because I I assume that you
had many many more years of experience
and part of what I contributed that to
is somebody who's very passionate and
studies outside of work right so even
though maybe I only have a year and a
half of actual software experience of
technical experience that's directly
involved in being a developer when you
compare it with the fact that in that
year and a half I've built projects
every weekend I've I've went and I've
you know have the channel have podcasts
right I write blogs on occasion I do all
these sorts of things that are helping
me become a better developer in that
year and a half I have like five years
experience of the average developer I
feel like so that that's could be
something where you're like what goes
back to your question is do I feel like
I've grown significantly yes I I do and
I'm going to contrite and continue that
as best my ability so pratik gorgeous is
you won't believe what I'm going to tell
you next I'm a fresh graduate graduate
and everything's been computer science
as major I interviewed yesterday the guy
asked me about some basic questions
about JavaScript and node and boom I got
hired do you really think I should I
should really give it a shot because the
guy didn't even test my coding skills as
it was all verbal I think you should see
if they actually extend an offer that's
for sure a lot of times I got my first
coding job it was all verbal I may have
a coding challenge because they liked me
so much and I had I answered the
questions well enough so every every
hiring practice is different but if they
offer you a good salary I think you
should definitely take it
Walter Nexus what things can you wait to
learn until you are on the job meaning
you should worry less about things like
Ajax ass blue strap excedrin before
applying for jobs so you should
definitely worry about Ajax you should
definitely worried about bootstrap I'll
give you a personal example from from my
a work place of mine in the past not my
current workplace but a workplace in
Lyon in the past where they would
interview developers and one thing that
they would ask is what are the four HTTP
verbs what are they and what do they do
so for anybody who's done any web
development this is basically an ajax
question at the end of the day and this
is something that if you ever built a
project you would know what these are I
think this isn't like a trick question
or anything like that so if you're a web
developer or trying to be a web
developer this is a very very basic
entry-level question and unfortunately a
lot of candidates can't ask answer this
question and they it's just just in case
you're you're one of those people the
the answer really is get put post and
delete and so get gets data post creates
data put updates data delete deletes
data so some of the like those are that
really the the four the four main ones
and so a lot of times people can't even
get there but anyhow so yeah you
definitely need to know Ajax sass I
wouldn't worry too much about that's
just a CSS compiler a lot of people
don't care about CSS for developers and
you want to focus on on you want to
focus on your JavaScript more than
anything else I can tell you that this
is something I've struggled with I'm
actually looking to take a CSS course
myself to fix this about my skill set
bootstrap would be important now the
reason I said that's important is you're
gonna be you're gonna need to be
familiar even though you're not going to
hopefully be applying for web design
jobs for wear CSS is super important
you're gonna want to be at least
familiar with with resizing based off a
column grid system or a flexbox system
so that's why I would say you should
probably pick up bootstraps
at least for your responsiveness so
pratik just as they are not offering me
much but enough for me to start my
career they're hiring me as a mean stack
developer I'm quite confused can you
please explain a little about about your
opinion um so it sounds like they're
offering you a shitty salary
pratik i don't know what that is in
comparison so I'll give you I'll give
you an example from a recent video so
recently a company recently I did an
unpaid internship video and their paid
interns were making on average 55,000 a
year well unpaid interns for making
around 33 thousand a year and if you
look any comparison so if you're in if
if you're if the market rate really is
fifty five thousand which what that
means in my opinion so whatever the
market rate is you should be getting
within ten thousand dollars in either
direction as you're starting in to come
for the most part so I would encourage
you to go ahead and go ahead and either
decline counteroffer or just hold out
for another role at least how I
understand it from our brief
conversation on here so you don't use
CSS at all you're joking of course that
you CSS I know I know CSS I'm just not
very good at CSS
what I mean by that is that I I don't
have a design eye and I kind of need I'd
like to get better at design it's not
that I can't do CSS I can do you know I
can do it just fine I'm just not the
best at it nor am I
where I want to be now I've never wanted
to get into design but that's sometimes
goes hand in hand with web development
right there's front-end developers and
there's front end designers and I
definitely fall into the developer
category so what I'm what I'm trying to
say I guess
I don't know what it is about CSSI
Church me up I just think maybe it might
be one of those like either got to
dependent on things or it's just my
brain doesn't work in terms of design
that way like I've never been artistic I
tried to be a couple times where I was
like yeah yeah yeah let me let me see if
I can think this out and try and draw
when I when I was a kid right and I I
always tried to get into drawing because
I was into anime and I just dog
it was so bad for so long so yeah I
don't I don't know I just don't know but
we all we all have shortcomings in our
career and it's it's up to us to get
better at at that and and I mean it just
is what it is right now we're hey you
know I I mean I've been very honest if
it's a web design job it's not for me I
do web development hey shout out to our
homies from Albuquerque so I'll be here
for about another five to ten minutes
guys so if there's any of any
last-minute questions please let please
enter them in the chat and as we're
wrapping this up let me go ahead and do
a little shout-out to myself if you want
to support me you can at patreon.com
slash coding tutorials 360 where you can
give a small monthly donation I think
it's some perks with that like these
wonderful stickers
also you can of course donate with the
with the super chat icon in chat if
you're here live and of course you can
join the Facebook group that we have a
link for code tech and caffeine as well
as just to make sure that you watch the
videos so that's always good to watch
every video every one they're all
quality all right maybe not all but they
that most of are pretty good I'm
terrible at art and writing I've always
been better at math so so I'm actually I
enjoy writing I don't know that I'm
great at it but I'm better than most
what happened to your udemy course I'm
working on it so if your are in Kumar if
you're talking about the portfolio the
angular portfolio
I finished the rough draft version of
that now I'm going to refactor it I'm
going to so I'm gonna film so I have to
film the intro what we're gonna cover
and then I have to film the hey this is
the original and then which will be part
of it and then we're gonna refactor it
which is just as important so that
course everything I would say I think
this will be out by next weekend I'm
also working on the how to build a
coding Channel course which is kind of
exciting as well so yeah I've been I've
been working pretty hard at it
UX designer stands for a user experience
essentially their their job is to make
sure that it's kind of interesting
because it's the UX and UI kind of for
me anyhow should fall into the same
category but essentially what it is is
how how well does the site or the
application function for a user so it's
their job to design something that works
very nicely am I still doing the bit
patina messaging I am I'll show you my
link if you're interested I just threw
another four hundred dollars into it
actually but uh but yeah so the angular
portfolio because I finished it last
night the first iteration and I
there's the link there if you're
interested but but yeah so I finished it
last night and then I will continue to
continue to work on a few aspects of it
I mentioned this earlier but essentially
I'm going to have a refactoring part and
I'm also going to have a section where
you can then you can then also I'll put
in some hey you know some features that
you could do and build this out yourself
but yeah so that course so it'll be my
first course there's gonna be five
dollars that's because it's just one
project it's just a single project
course but you'll by the end of it my
goal is to have you be able to
understand some of the core concepts and
that are revolved around evolved around
angular and so that maybe you can go and
build your own sort of little project
who the hell thump sound this video
there's somebody who really doesn't like
me who goes and thumbs down almost every
one of my videos so I had one guy I
forget who it was said that he he came
into my live stream and he said to me I
just want you to know that every time I
you know I'm a fan he said something
like oh I'm a fan but whenever I see you
not have a dislike on your video I
dislike it to keep you humble or
something like that that's what he said
I was like like come on man but yeah so
I mean you guys can counteract that
right by by liking the video and and
Thummim it up and that doesn't mean that
you have to I just a lot of times people
don't think about it but it does help so
you might might like to dislike ratio is
like 99 to 1 so most of the time I my
videos like like for instance five
things I tell my younger self has 102
likes and one dislike the WordPress
video has 107 likes to 4 dislikes 4 of
them were
press developers so I expected that you
know getting started with Bitcoin
blockchain cryptocurrency says 46 like
zero dislike so that guy must be on
vacation yeah so it's it's all relative
right but 29 side project ideas 128
likes one dislike so for the most part
my my video is a very good like to
dislike ratios but I don't know there's
always you can't please everybody I
don't really worry about it but what you
can do is when you watch you say
your dislike here's my like baby let's
cancel that out and you can help me
out that way make sure that if you guys
haven't already you are subscribed and
you have the little bell icon where you
can get notifications when my videos go
out and do all that stuff so uh as we
are as we are here as we are here and we
are wrapping up the livestream for those
of you don't know I'd like to leave you
on a little bit of a final thought what
I recommend so now all of a sudden now
you guys are asking questions alright
would who would you recommend investing
in Bitcoin err stocks I invest in both
my Bitcoin investments have done me very
well
I have turned about 4500 into about 9000
although about a thousand of that is in
affiliate cuts so I'm doing very well
with that with Bitcoin though in general
I also have stocks and my stocks are
doing very poorly cuz I don't know the
 I'm doing
and although I'm doing about getting
about a 5% return so just to spread out
my investments in total I have a
basically a savings what I consider a
savings account in acorns and betterment
in which I put 60 250 each a week into
that and that goes into a Auto portfolio
that's managed by them and those earning
me around 3% I also have a peer-to-peer
landing platform called prosper where
I'm lending on there and I'm getting
about six percent right now but I've
restructured that to bring it up to
about 8% to 9% right now and that's just
getting auto invested I put about five
hundred dollars a month into that and
then I have my Robin Hood account where
I am putting about let's see probably
about right now it's around $1,000 a
month into Robin Hood and I'm rebuilding
that because I cash I had forty five
hundred dollars in that I cashed that
out and I put it into Bitcoin so I'm
rebuilding that and I'm rebuilding my
stocks and actually I was doing quite
well and then AMD took a and
crashed my portfolio so but yeah so I
have I have stocks in Robin Hood and
then I have my my Bitcoin investments as
well and I have not only am i buying the
coins but I'm also using these these
investment plot these high risk high
high yielding investment platforms where
my hundred dollars in Bitcoin assuming
the site is still paying and up will
return me one hundred forty seven
percent over six weeks and so I make a
forty seven percent profit I've been
doing that for a bit and that's been and
that was what the bit petite thing was
that was being suggested a second ago so
I'll throw a link in the chat if you're
interested that again it's very high
risk some of these such close in the
past so don't don't go balls deep but if
you want to play around with it I can
tell you that I'm using a couple
different ones and they've all been very
successful for me so far okay so that
was my investments real Solon asked me I
don't watch stranger things on Netflix I
caught like two episodes when I was
traveling with with engineer truth in
Utah and we kind of were like yeah I
don't know about this one
I joined us in other coins like
aetherium or like coin yes I have
litecoin and I have aetherium and I have
Bitcoin I'm also looking into
potentially picking up some Manero and
I'm potentially looking into buying my
first not potentially I'm going to be
buying my first ICO
in the near future so we'll see how that
turns out
okay yes um what should our final
thought be I think this I really liked a
y13 forest question about honestly did I
learn what what to know after getting
hired so let's focus on that as our
final thought so
one thing that can separate a good
developer from a very poor developer or
someone who's going to be successful in
life from someone who's not is really
how we're going to look at it is the
person who's successful is going to
continue to grow we don't live in this
world anymore where to get your degree
or you get your education and then you
stop growing you strap you stop becoming
a good developer we live in a world
where technology is changing so fast not
only in software but in general that
people have access to education and it's
expected that you are taking advantage
of that and that you're growing you're
not just going to get raises in life and
get ahead in life because the years
experience is going to help but there's
a reason that there's a median income as
some people are above and there's a
median income that some people are below
and that some people are just right at
and if you want to be above which I hope
should be your goal you're going to need
to put in some work in various aspects
of your life and that doesn't
necessarily mean coding doesn't
necessarily mean you know as a career it
does mean that you need to as a person
say that a year from now I am better off
than I was before and have a game plan
on how to accomplish that we just
briefly touched on a few things about
investments those investments I've
worked very I don't have a ton of money
but I'm teaching myself about investing
through investing and let me tell you
sometimes the the the easiest way for
you to learn how to make money is first
to loose money and then you'll start
realizing
you're doing wrong and changed some
things so part of that is I want to be
financially secure in my life and I'm
learning about that I don't want a year
from now to be like am i less
financially secure do I know less for
these goals and things that I want to
accomplish and that goes the same free
for your software career right maybe you
start out as front-end only can you say
I want to be full stack a year from now
how much closer are you to being full
stack a year's a long time right
that gives you what 355 days 3 or 56
days to get your together really
and or 365 excuse me and go and say hey
every day I'm going to work towards
something and if you watch my most
recent video on Wednesday where I talked
about the top 5 things I would tell my
my younger self
everything on that list was about how
you can improve yourself and it wasn't
like a 1 people oftentimes they're
looking for these quick okay I'll just
do this one thing and my life will
change it doesn't work like that in the
world what you need to do is you need to
take these changes objectively think
about what it is that these changes are
going to accomplish and then you need to
implement these changes for long periods
of time if not for your entire life
right if you want to be better off in
your love life if you want to be better
off in your in your career
these aren't changes that you can make
over a weekend they're changes you can
start today and you're going to have to
continue to work on tomorrow and the
following day and the next day right so
it's one of those things where you need
to you need to continue to grow and for
you to continue to grow it's a daily
grind and just just be aware of that so
when somebody asked me like hey you know
did you learn everything after your
first job I didn't learn everything but
I learned a lot quicker and I learned a
lot more because I kept on learning and
I just got thrown into an environment
where I got paid to learn
at the end of the day well every
position I ever have I want to feel like
I'm getting paid to learn so that's
that's my two cents I hope that you guys
have a wonderful weekend this is our
Saturday weekly if you're interested in
the Udacity nanodegree program go ahead
and check that out if you're interested
in the bit petite stuff I'll throw it in
the description of the video as well
since I got brought up a few times and I
appreciate you all it is it is a
wonderful day and we have come so far
together I feel like we're going on
around two and a half years and I'm
going to look at investment properties
it's kind of crazy I was delivering
pizzas three years ago and sleep on on a
couch and and here we are hard work that
I even have braces you guys don't I
don't know if you guys knew this I don't
really talked about this but my teeth
have been crooked for about five six
years and it was something that I was so
self-conscious about for so long whether
I should be or not or whether that makes
me weak person is besides the point but
I was and I couldn't afford braces and
so I just didn't smile and I because I
was so self-conscious about just didn't
smile and so so I was able to get braces
and you know it's it's those it's the
little things and like some of you guys
do I said that's silly Dylan you know
but it for me it was a it was a there's
a big deal to finally get the braces on
so yeah anyhow guys I appreciate you
listen I I want I want to see us all
succeed
these acity scholarship just watch this
first part of the video you'll see that
there I bye guys
it's been it's it's it's been something
positive how about that we'll leave it
on that bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
