going to be talking about novo resume
comm it's one of my favorite resume
websites it's actually my favorite uh
only who resume site because it's so
great it's in the beta but there's still
a ton of great stuff on here um I think
the easiest thing to do to tell you
about it is just kinda to show you but
essentially it's a resume template site
where you have an account your templates
are stored online or on your account so
all your information is stored and
there's about 10 to 15 different resumes
right now they're focusing on the junior
level which is for the student or the
recent graduate right here so you're
seeing very very cool the kind of
standard modern classic creative
professional and intermediate which puts
more focus on your work experience and
less on maybe your skills and your
education as junior would and eventually
they'll come out with senior looks like
it's coming in 2016 but let's go ahead
and jump right in you can see all the
functionality of it it really is an
amazing thing I'm a huge fan of it but
uh so let's see here so not only you can
change the font an easy one-click thing
that it looks like they have was this
this makes it a little bit larger so you
want everything a little bit larger very
nice we want to change from boot - to
railway or back and forth rather let's
go to XO see what that's about
I'm like that we're going back to
railway ah cuz I use this site so I
don't want to mess up my settings but
you can change the font the theme you
want change the color scheme you want
something a little more black and gray a
little boring I personally like a little
bit color in mine the layout simple
click here we can go ahead and change
the way everything's laid out maybe you
want these three sections right here as
I think that's how I know I have my
education and then I my work experience
but we could instead go ahead and swap
all this around you also have the option
of kind of extending these out
a bit or not at all so you'll see right
here as I'm going everything's kind of
this is all scrunched off to the side
now because of that you'll see that it
might not fit in the PDF so you may not
want to do that because mine mine was
pretty packed to begin with so look I
think I think it was like right now I
liked it right there to see it it's all
responsive you can go ahead and just
with a simple click I got much better
jquery is go ahead and put that up there
you can change the all the info from
here as well you can also just select
what it is that you're looking to edit i
want to change this i want to change my
name you're going to select that you can
include you include various links as
well to your skype github linkedin
website whatever it may be you can also
go ahead and enter stuff here skills
optional and it's completely free tons
of great stuff and i really just wanted
to share this with you guys
so i hope you enjoy the site a cool
thing to look forward to is i'll be
interviewing the co-founder of this site
and he's a software engineer coded it
himself and that'll be out in about
three or four days after this video so
keep an eye out for that and i look
forward to it and as always guys dot
