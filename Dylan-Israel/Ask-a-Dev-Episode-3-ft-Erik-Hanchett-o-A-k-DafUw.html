to ask a dev episode 3 our guest dev
well as always be answering the last
question to give you an idea what it is
it comes from a live stream from Jason
Rivera who asked what are some things
you learned on the job that a person
teaching themselves might not have
learned as much or learned at all and so
Eric hatchet from Eric the programmer
dot-com and his youtube channel which
you can get in the links below will be
answering that let's go ahead and jump
into the first question that I'll be
answering so the first question is the
first question is from sergio is the
next a common practice in professional
environment a dev knows exactly what he
wants to do but doesn't know how to do
it asks in Stack Overflow or Google's it
gets a codes in a bit and do a copy
paste is this done in professional
environments yes or no right so there's
nothing wrong with you going and looking
for a solution that you may be
struggling with you probably necessarily
are only going to be copyist like most
of time you'll have like eighty percent
of the code done and you'll need that
last twenty percent or if there's a
entire library where someone's devoted
months of their time to doing that you
may actually just take the whole thing
but it really just depends now it's
common practice to need help that's for
sure and it's common practice to use
multiple libraries I'll give you an
example of my work we wanted to have a
collapsible div an accordion-style
basically where you would take a div and
you click it and would expand and the
reefs up in it and you click it and
would collapse down to one row now I
could have taken the time to actually go
and write that but there's bootstrap UI
which has that feature so we just attach
that as a dependency and now we can use
that and we could change it to how we
would want to use and I mean that's
really what's so great about open
sources you can make your stuff so great
now it's a little with the minimal
amount of effort while still learning so
much in the process because coding is
developing every day so yes and no
starting out as
a someone who's learning code you're
definitely going to want to try and
struggle through it for a much longer
period than maybe a professional
developer tashu christie says sometimes
I just sit in front of the computers
they get think got everything else about
programming can you give me some sources
where I could learn JavaScript better
that's basically the summation of it not
I mean tutorials not etc not raw
information so if you're really
struggling about understanding
JavaScript there is only one book that I
can actually recommend and it is you
don't know Jas and there's actually six
books with the series of it because this
only one I haven't read now I think
codecademy does an excellent job
teaching you JavaScript but some people
need books i don't i don't personally I
read it only because we were reading
with my co-workers at work is a first
coding book I really read but you may
want to try books now if you if that's
not your thing video tutorials men video
tutorials are my thing if I want to
learn something I go watch a video
tutorial and then I immediately after
that go and use that library that
language that framework whatever it is
and you're going to go do that now
there's tons of JavaScript tutorials on
YouTube you don't have to go to udemy
you don't spend any money but that might
be the path to go down and I don't mean
like you know a free code camp solution
I mean someone sitting down Derek bonus
probably has a great tutorial where he
sits down for an hour two hours three
hours watch every video hour long
tutorial he does and try to follow along
as you're doing it and that should help
you fill in the gaps with JavaScript
Leon Morse's man has been two weeks
since i've been working with javascript
my first programming language and i
understand the language in parts but
once i have to put everything together
that's when i get lost so this is
something that happens to a lot of the
summit to summarize basically you have
your text editor out and you want to
build something and nothing comes out
right this is something that happens to
a lot of junior devs who are just
starting out now the way the what helped
me personally was sitting down and just
coding in multiple languages so i
reprogram my
brain basically to think more like a
programmer and that was going on
Codecademy and doing python that was
going cook and do javascript PHP Ruby
what else have we done on there i'm sure
i'm leavin one or two out but even
though just so i could kind of pick up
how languages generally would flow and
then choosing the language i want to
stick with which is javascript and then
just doing free code camp every single
day every single day and kind of
reprogram i right now you're still going
to struggle but my advice is to actually
get your whiteboard if you look up in
the corner over there you'll see i have
a whiteboard when i'm struggling when i
was struggling trying to get started
with the projects i would draw it out
piece by piece right so if it's a
calculator i would draw out what i
wanted it to look like and then i would
start to try and have my have my HTML
emulate that and the CSS and once i
actually got the core foundation down I
would worry about the the logic neck so
my advice is built out the HTML and the
CSS for that for these projects and then
from there try and do logics piece by
piece every single step you need to
instead of start thinking about the
whole project think about about 30 steps
per project and try to figure out what
that very first step has to be and you
may have a little bit better success
when getting lost people get overwhelmed
I feel like where they're like oh my god
I don't know where to start how how am I
ever going to complete this and well you
have to complete it step by step and
it's not like you're just going to do
that and it's going to be done you have
to do line one line to line three and
start breaking things up and it'll get
easier as you go forward but try to
visualize it draw it out when you when
you see when you see it drawn out and
with multiple monitors as well always
have one monitor with it up your HTML
and another with you changing the logic
will be much easier for you to visualize
it in your head that will help you kind
of get over that intimidation factor or
that kind of overwhelming sense that I
don't know where to get started and I
just get overwhelmed and nothing comes
up so I've
question what are some things you
learned on the job as a developer that a
person teaching themselves at home might
not learn so I when I was in college I
got an internship and I made a few
mistakes so try not to do these three
things first when it when i first
started my internship and then were
actually have much to do and so my
number first numbered one tip is to keep
busy during the slow times even if your
boss doesn't give you a lot to do try to
find things that you can do like
volunteering to help other people in
your group or coming up with new
projects that you can do actually it's
sometimes okay if you have an internship
or even just a normal job to just study
if you're a Java development shop do
some studying work really hard try to do
some practice programs just keep working
maybe if there's an open source project
that's out there try to contribute to it
if your boss is okay with that but try
to keep busy the worst thing you want to
do is just surf the web and do nothing
the second thing I did wrong in my first
internship when I was in college was
that I got a finally I got a really big
project and I was only working like 20
hours a week 16 hours a week and instead
of putting all my time into that project
I kind of took it slow in other words
just put work above and beyond on what
you're trying to do so if you're um if
you are working a 40-hour week job work
50 hours work 60 hours come in on the
weekends really show your boss that you
are willing to learn and that you're
willing to put your hours and especially
something like software development if
this is one of your first jobs you're
gonna find out there's so many things
you don't know and you really need to
work really hard to figure out
everything that you need to do I'm third
thing that I did wrong is I didn't find
a mentor or find good friends that I
could get help with while I was on the
job so when I started my new job when I
started my internship I just kind of
took all the problems that I needed to
do and I just internalize them all and
try to figure them all at myself so I
would get a bug and something like
senior developer could figure out you
know ten minutes took me two hours so it
was good learning
but what I should have done is is not
keep bugging the senior developers all
the time but be able to get help when I
needed it and continue on in learning at
the same time and one thing as you
continue on maybe also work with your
workplace and try to find a mentor now
you don't want to go up to someone and
ask them will you be my mentor but maybe
someones more senior on your team or in
another department or if you're looking
to be a manager may be a director talk
to them see if they're willing to go to
lunch with you every now and then try to
bounce out bounce ideas off them see if
they can kind of put you under their
wing so that's three quick tips on what
you can do on that you may not have
learned by teaching yourself thanks hey
