ahead and finish up the Pomodoro clock
what were you doing last time was we're
gonna set up the reset functionality so
the first thing we want to do is win our
break time when our break is over we
want to go ahead and show the reset
button so let's go ahead and target that
I'm just gonna say touch show now let's
go ahead and just run this and make sure
that everything's working nothing broken
between my 5-minute commercial break
here so session times gonna count down
times absence a time set up
break times you can switch over
all right so first thing that we're
gonna want to do is we're gonna want to
get rid of this we're gonna hide this
and hide this so our break is over now
what we can do is we can oh we also want
to play a sound when the break is over
so we'll just go ahead and play the same
sound you may want to get a different
one and then we may want to go ahead and
hide the break number as well break so
we want to go ahead and hide time time
actually any target I think this reset
needs to be outside of something but in
the mean time let's go ahead and hide
the break note so we'll just go ahead
and hide now that it's done counting
just go ahead hide it play so we play
the sound we're gonna hide this number
here now let's go ahead and get on with
the brakeman launcher with the reset
logic so when you click reset that's a
good place to start so when you click
reset
so use this target we're gonna run a
function that does some stuff now what
is that stuff that we want to do that
will be what we're getting to what it's
gonna want to do is we're gonna want to
reset our count to 25 and in our case
you know we'll set it to 5 go back and
change this to 25 Oh
we'll do 25 count to 25 and we want to
set the break time equals 25 s what now
what we can do here is simply set the
num we're gonna go ahead and target it's
now that I'm looking at this I think we
could probably leave out those first two
lines of code we said that our session
num here HTML to our count value and
we're also gonna go ahead and set the
brake num to the same value
excuse me - break time value
which is crucial because don't forget
that we actually we actually use that to
show how things are working like I
should to use our to get our values so
next we have to show everything remember
we hid everything we're basically gonna
do the opposite here we have to bring it
all back so the first thing that we can
show is I'll just start with start next
thing that we can target is the minus
five o'clock the next thing that we can
target is the add five o'clock the next
thing is the minus five break and the
next thing is add five break
don't forget your hash tag it won't work
after that we can we want to be able to
show the break now and we want to show
time I imagine it's shown um okay um
let's go ahead and run this logic real
quick and make sure all our shows are
working and then there may be some stuff
that we have to hide let's go how to run
this
so hit start you know this is gonna take
about 10 seconds this should be a great
time to go ahead like and subscribe on
videos if you haven't already just some
head out there
time's up cool so we're definitely gonna
want to hide this let's make sure every
set is working so reset is not now let's
go ahead and look at our you said let's
see if I reset it is ID is equal to
reset reset click function
now why isn't that working maybe it's
the semicolon here that we forgot let's
try this one more time if you're not I'm
gonna have to pause the video and do a
little troubleshooting get another great
opportunity to share the video time's up
alright let's see let's see if this work
time's up cool here's our reset all
right I'm gonna pause the video do a
little troubleshooting I'll let you know
what I come across guys aha
so a key thing to keep in mind is you
have to actually call the function on
air dot show sammich ur our at coding in
tutorials 360 I know guys mistakes
happen
so let's make sure that was the mistake
I didn't even touched it till I saw it
right now so let's go ahead and see
things out here they were session time
or break time time's up reset there we
go
everything's looking a little boosted so
we have to hide the reset here we want
to remove break time and we want to
bring back our titles so first thing we
can do is go ahead and add the titles so
add hashtag title 1 and then with a
hashtag title 2 we're gonna run that we
also want to hide time type so let's go
ahead and hide the time type as well and
we want to hide the reset button so
again we can do that in one one thing a
code here so want to go ahead and just
go a hashtag
I say reset and hashtag I'm tight yeah
we want to go ahead and hide that and it
should return us back to a very
beautiful page like we had before so
let's go ahead and run this and then
we'll test out the code here so this is
what we want it to look like after we
reset times up
time's up okay so this great time here
is not being removed still let's go
ahead and see what we owe our time tight
like so and actually let's go back up to
here we have this year we want to hide
the break now so we also want to go
ahead and hide the time type as well
again this is this almost feels like CSS
we're basically just doing a little bit
of formatting we want everything to look
nice
well everything to work and we need to
reset to appear like it was before so
we're gonna do our session time time's
up
never break time time's up cool we're
done reset we're back to where we
started and our values are at 25 we
should be able to loop through here one
more time make sure code doesn't break
times up so you'll see right now that
times I have our values showing up here
so we're gonna have to fix that next so
when we do the reset so we're probably
gonna have to do a show that is adding
those values back now what we can do is
just go ahead and add this right here so
we hide these initially and then our
time typed on HTML we're gonna need to
just go ahead and have a show so when we
triggers that timer a second time if
it's not there we just want it to go
ahead and show it so we go a hashtag
time type
and then we just go dog show I'm go
ahead and copy this and do the same
thing in break time all right let's just
gonna throw this in here real quick
let's see if our logic is working that's
why it's really important to run through
your code a second time as well and
actually see that everything works cause
you'll catch a lot of little things like
that that you may have soon may have
already logically have been working
time's up time's up very nice we're
gonna reset bring this down to five
seconds sorry so there's our session
time cool that's working now our times
up times up
all right cool guys so in the next video
what we'll do is we'll set up some some
formatting for the minutes and seconds
so right now we're basically dealing
with five seconds ahead of time we're
gonna set it up to be a much much larger
than that and we'll have to fast forward
do that for the next video but as always
