ahead and jump right back into code
combat backwoods forest
we're on thumb biter right now so let's
jump in and see what's going on lure
that ogre to its doom all right Columbus
100% open-source I like that all right
yeah Ari so we're using the double
equals property this is like what it
means to be loosely equals so the
difference between a double equals and a
triple equals is the loosely equals
means that the string to the string
number two rather would be okay would
pass if it was equal to the integer to
the number two so let's get started here
so what we want to do is we want to move
this guy to right here so if 2 plus 2 is
equal to four so if this statement is
true say hey if two plus two is equal to
five let's just run and see what it does
so like this isn't true it's going to
change that changes gonna shake it
that's it so we just want to be change
this to six and make this true we can go
ahead and change that as well I have one
more taunt to logo so here we're gonna
say Hiro say come at me bro
and don't forget
oh what's up son I said I do that we
just are using equals operators now all
right we need getting items just the
general experience gems are death so
we'll be using basic syntax arguments
this statements arithmetic and variables
so our goal here is to grab all the gems
make the if statement true for commands
you want to execute so we want to get
all the gems and we want to use our
famous interesting if statement code
only real incentives true fix all their
statements so that's their true so this
is true pixelation statements to be no
move to the first line so we don't want
that to be true make this true move to
the first jump it means it's not equals
to so not equals meaning does this not
equal for that is a true statement so
it's gonna return false so if we want to
not change the not equals we can change
that to 5 because 2 plus 2 is not equal
to Phi which is a true statement so
means lesson so it's 2 less than 3 yeah
2 plus 2 less than 3 that's false but if
we change this to 5 that's true make
this false choose less than 1 is false
and then if true we can just simply
change that if false and if make this
true we can simply changed up sure now
assuming I did everything correct we
should be alright it's really just more
of understanding ohm some understanding
what did the statements here so you have
the not equals you have the less than
you god bless em and there's not equals
greater than less than all the normal
things that you would expect when
comparing something and interesting
alright so far so good now we're doing
village guard defend a village from a
marauding munchkin mayhem whole lot of
Em's go
stop all the ogre saved all the peasants
patrol the the entry points using an if
statement to check for enemies alright
move to the right entrance find the
right enemy use if two tactics ready
okay so we have our wall true here so
zero not move XY left enemy if left in
me so what we can do here
my they have this oh we're written there
my mistake I was like oh we're not in
the while loop so all we're doing here
is creating uh will say right enemy
actually let's move first so we want to
hear we're gonna target our hero and say
look take our object we want to move it
to 61 34 the coordinates 61 34 there we
want to create an enemy will call them
right enemy that's all the convention
that they have set here and we want to
find the nearest enemy and then if this
guy exists if right enemy
so this is only gonna run if you do this
cuz no over will no one right undefined
return false so that's why it doesn't
run so if right enemy how we want to
attack and then we'll put right enemy
it's gonna run this so move to the move
to the left
attack something move to the right oh
you should have I we should have
actually put two attacks on here because
if you remember most of these guys died
with two texts let's go ahead and run
that one more time it's going back and
forth
yeah if you want to try and beat the
level all right that's kind of lovely
randomize
all right cool um not too bad just
really kind of understanding what it is
you're trying to do with your if
statement so in next video we'll get
started on the back-to-back hey guys
