back in manage packages with NPM so
let's see what sexually are on I forgot
already I think we just we are
unpublished alright cool so let's go
ahead and jump on down to the publish
section now what is good as a package
manager without packages not very good
so it's a very good point so luckily
that is on problem for NPM it is very
easy to publish their module share with
the world so the great thing about in PM
is people make all these great resources
and they make them easily available for
you you just have to basically install
them and share share yours using publish
so so make sure we're in the right
project directory which we are in situ
360 to do that we can go ahead and do
NPM publish and it will publish our
package so there we go you saw the plus
sign meaning it's out and about so we
published everything and now we can go
ahead and do something like how to Dutch
verify oops sir how to dashing and PM
verify make sure we did everything
correctly and we did so pretty
straightforward I think we'll probably
just move on to this next one real quick
senses no no I wanna keep to the
standard of doing videos each mainly
what you want to get out of this video
is that you can share your projects or
your modules with other people your
packages and it's easy to publish it out
there and now the world's can see it
which is kind of cool so as always guys
don't forget like subscribe share this
formula Pedro I appreciate it i'll see
you guys in the next video special
thanks to our sponsor dev mountain if
you're interested in coding boot camp
why don't you check them out where they
include housing alongside their tuition
so you can get up go and immerse
yourself in the environment if you want
