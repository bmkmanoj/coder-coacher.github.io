fights diving deeper of the intro
section in extract hkm now the objective
here that are what we're being asked to
do is remove a certain amount of
elements in their spot so in our case
here we have an array as our first
parameter and then a number that needs
element an index number that needs here
removes essentially so the third element
of fuel for a second third so three is
gone next three that would be six then
nine so we can use the modulo operator
and use the array filter to to
accomplish this basically a one line of
code with the return statement so let's
go ahead and and do that so we're going
to return our original array just in a
filtered format so I'm going to take
input array we're going to use the
method filter that now in here it takes
in the element so element the first
element would be one and then the index
number is an optional parameter but
that's what we need because we have to
keep track of what index it is and then
in our return statement
what this is going to do is it's
essentially we're setting a statement
here where hey only return the the
statements the elements that pass that
statement so in this case we need to
index plus one other is its index plus
one is because the index is off by one
so even though three is the third
element is actually the second index
that's where that plus one comes and
then we need to just modulo it by our K
parameter and we're saying not equal to
zero now that not equal to zero
essentially is the third element yes so
we're just getting rid of all the evenly
divisible items which in this case pass
all of it and we can solve this extract
each K it in a about one line worth of
code
there we go easy peasy lemon squeezy
