online resources is is that a lot of
them are free nowadays so I want to try
and take that concept of taking all this
all these free courses and then going
and try and apply it to the real world
so one of the things I'm going to be
doing is I have a meet up on Saturdays
where I meet with it's called code
coffee lb org or I meet with a bunch of
programmers and and you know these are
people who own their own software
company sometimes they they work in web
design mobile apps databases and I'm
gonna be doing quick interviews with
them so I would just like to know what I
guess the point of this video is what
kind of general questions or non general
questions would our kind of the better
better better end because I'm going to
be asking them questions like that I
would think are important and I want to
know questions that you would think are
important and leave those in the
comments below or even message me if you
have a really good idea and need to go
and detailing you don't want to post in
the comments that's cool too and also on
a thumb and a more fun note I have
access to a green screen my buddy has
one I'm very excited about this and I
need to come up with ideas of how to use
it in a video just to be fun so it could
be anything as simple as like k everyday
in the background your little webcam
throw on a crazy background that has to
be like I have to zoom into the video to
see what the hell is going on I but any
ideas are appreciated so that's all I
wanted to say guys just let me know
about the video ideas and what interview
questions that maybe aren't so
traditional like for instance I would
ask you know standard things after we
like can you state your name what you do
how did you get started how much money
did you make it your first job how much
money do you make two years later all
that sort of stuff what you would
recommend for someone so any but
anything that you really want answered
just go ahead and leave in the comments
that I wouldn't normally think of so
thanks for thanks for taking time to
watch this and as always questions
comments concerns and anything else
constructive is appreciated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
