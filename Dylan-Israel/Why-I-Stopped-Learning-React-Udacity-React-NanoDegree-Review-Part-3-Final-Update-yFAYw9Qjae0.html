update about the react nanodegree
program on Udacity and I haven't been
staying up to date we'll talk a little
bit about why what my final thoughts are
on the program and if I would recommend
it to people who are trying to learn
react before we get started I want to go
ahead and think this video sponsor dev
Mountain it's really cool as they
support the the channel in the coding
community so if you're interested in
going to a coding boot camp where
tuition and housing is provided I
couldn't recommend dev Mountain enough
I've actually been on one of their
campuses and met some of the the people
who are working behind the scenes as
well as interviewed various developers
and they're all doing very well and I
you know it's one of the the programs I
can definitely say that you're gonna get
your money's worth and really dive
completely into the the stack of
technologies just by the fact that
you're gonna live a block away from
campus as well as their great
instructors so if you're interested that
sort of stuff go ahead and check them
out at dev Mountain comm so as I kind of
mentioned I stopped working on the
Udacity nano degree program but I was
very impressed with it and what I didn't
stop working on it because I was like oh
it was too simple or oh it was too hard
or oh I just didn't think it was a good
program part of the reason that I
started the react nano degree was a very
practical reason I was I was under I
knew that I wanted to move jobs and I
thought to myself that I'm working in
angularjs which isn't the latest version
of angular you know angular 2 plus right
but it was something I said hey I have
some experience in angular some of it
will transfer over not too much but that
may be enough to make me more hireable
and if I decide to split out say let's
actually go and learn react there's a
lot of jobs is exploding and I might be
able to swing my way into an angular 2
role if I have the angularjs experience
there's kind of a a gamble of I think
I'd be more hireable if I go and have a
little bit of experience in both of
these technologies and my my intuition
of hey I have angularjs experience
eventually led me to a angular 2 role
and that was the reason that that at its
core was the reason why I stopped doing
the Udacity nano degree
program I got to the second project
there's three and I've got about halfway
through that when I got my job my
current job and it was something that I
as a developer I had to decide okay well
I actually don't do angular 2 yet like I
haven't built anything in it other than
a couple test projects so it's time to
focus my attention to fully dive into
angular and and learn all the skills at
a new workplace so for those of you are
you know just starting your careers most
of the time you're not going to be 99%
there in your role usually who's gonna
be some technologies that you're not
super familiar with or you've only
played with or you know that could be
anything from the build tools that could
be anything from the dev off aspects to
the testing to in this case the
framework that you're using on the front
end and so for me my main priority was
hey I need to get up there running first
up to running for work because that's my
main priority right that's what that's
what keeps lights up on here that's what
pays for these videos to keep being made
right so that was my decision to be me
do I regret taking the the react course
no I I think for the $300 I paid for it
that is one of the most well produced
courses that I've ever taken in terms of
the feedback aspect that was something
that I really loved and I think that you
could that in itself pay for it being
able to say hey how does you know
essentially getting a code review which
is a very practical process of your your
courses or of your um your work right
having your peers review it people who
are will even blow you at the same level
or above you who may know how to do
something a slightly different way
slightly better way we're all
opinionated but I think that this is
that something that is truly beneficial
in a great aspect of the Udacity nano
degree program and on top of it just
getting a little bit of experience with
the react from to be able to say okay
cool you here's the thing there's a lot
of people I had a conversation with
subscriber last night during a live
stream where he says he was looking for
a react only role
that's what he wanted he has learned
reacted he wants to go for actaully
girls which is okay but even if you
idiots instance I thought it was a
little bit strange nothing he wants to
only work and react but that he was
going to turn down angular roles if they
were offered if you can learn one
framework such as react and people say
it's a library all that's our self
different video but if you can learn
react you should be able to learn
angular if you can learn angular you
should be able to react and what will
happen is you'll actually become better
a better developer in general you start
seeing connections you know components
and react components and angular so you
start seeing these things that really
overlap and you'll learn you'll learn
each framework or library much quicker
in the process but back to the
nanodegree program the reactor one's a
little bit interesting because some of
their programs have multiple months
right that you go at your own pace it's
like you're you're essentially having
tasks the and that you're paying every
single month you know to $300 the nav
degree program is you have a set start
time and a set in time and I could tell
you that I personally think they give
you more than enough time so that even
if you have some hiccups you can go and
knock it out I just decided to focus
more on angular when I got a role in
angular it just it kind of killed any
interest I had in learning react because
I'd rather just deep dive in angular at
this point in time get better at my job
but in terms of the Udacity program
itself I would recommend it for people
who are looking to to get feedback on
their code but if you're looking for
just a super well-designed course and
you don't care about maybe having
someone to guide your hand along the way
I would say overall you probably would
be better because I believe the course
on average is five hundred dollars you
would probably be better spending a
hundred dollars on udemy courses and
knocking those out just because you're
gonna be exposed to so much as long as
you make sure that you get them from the
top creators on udemy who are
you know updating their courses give me
feedback because they're gonna give you
feedback too right here you have
questions I answer it as I do on my own
courses but is it is interesting because
that is the only difference in value in
my opinion other than the the super
cringy sort of udemy characters that are
reading off they're good and very
educated and I've interviewed some of
them but it is at times just a little
too crunchy for me but the content of
the video is great I have no issues
following along it wasn't like anything
was outdated why did it like oh well
this is broken now because in version
one point blah blah blah it got updated
to this and that was really what I was
looking for with the udemy program is
when I was trying to learn react on my
own I kept on running into outdated tech
outdated this outdated that and that's
the old way of doing the react this is a
new way of doing right and it was really
frustrating because when you're learning
this stuff you want to be learning the
latest and the greatest the the bleeding
edge right of all this and that was what
I suffered with when I was trying to
learn on my own without using udemy or
Udacity nano degree program and I
decided hey let's you know let's just go
ahead and take this other path and see
what I can do maybe add a little bit to
the education part of the resume and the
process and build and learn some cool
skills and in that aspect they had the
latest in the greatest and it fulfilled
me in that way and I think it was what I
was looking for but I would say for the
average person who you know can't waste
$300 on a course not that it's a waste
or $500 you know the people who are
trying to get their career started $500
is a lot to ask for it really really is
but I personally think that you can kind
of get more value and for $100 maybe you
buy ten react courses and Redux horses
and react native course so at the very
least $500 are getting react react Redux
and react native through the nanodegree
program and we get feedback from
developers about how to
code react more professionally super
important you also they also have chat
where used it several times saying I can
say that they were very helpful they
were there and they they answered my
questions and they provided support
better than I thought it was going to be
on all honesty a lot of times my
experience with that has been very poor
and I they did a very good job with that
and and I could recommend them based off
those two things if that's something
that you're looking for I would also say
that if you can find those udemy
creators who are charging $10 or $20 for
their course you go and spend one
hundred two hundred dollars and you'd
probably get more value if not just as
much from the nanodegree program not
have to break the bank for five hundred
dollars like that's quite a bit there
are other programs although I haven't
taken them they have a when you complete
the program a job guarantee if you can
guarantee a job not that they're going
to get you a job but the skills that
you're going to learn from it guarantee
a job to me
you have you have earned that two
hundred dollars a month
aspect of it along with the feedback and
whatnot but that's for a separate video
I think that's pretty cool that they
actually are so confident in their
program that if you complete it you will
they will guarantee you a job but with
that being said guys I appreciate you
watching the video thank you for
supporting the channel don't forget to
comment like subscribe or share this
will be of course my last react
nanodegree program video I don't foresee
myself going into another nano degree
program just because I have so much
stuff that I'm doing that I can't
imagine committing myself to three to
six months to something that isn't you
know what I won't even say that because
I could tell I kind of could see myself
doing it as I say I don't see myself
doing it because I really did enjoy it
was a lot of fun to be back in this sort
of structured environment where I get to
have somebody else lead the way and it's
the first course I ever paid for past
the udemy I've recently purchased some
udemy courses but this was the first
course ever paid for everything else
that I've used I've been teaching myself
and learning for myself so with that
being said that is my final review on
the you DAC you
the nanodegree program I hope that you
guys if you are more interested in you
say hey you know I'd like to dive deeper
into this I'd like to recommend Ricki
Garcia's channel he has been doing he's
done several of these programs and he's
been doing a weekly update about his
nanodegree progress and so I think he
has like 12 or 15 videos at this point
on the program and so if you want a
little bit more detail you want to see
some of the projects up close his
channel would be a great resource for
you to do that so thank you again guys
don't forget to comment like share
subscribe support me on patreon if
you're interested in my courses there's
a link in the description below and
thank you to our sponsor dev Mountain
com
see you next time bye guys hey baby what
do you think if I or some other
youtube's youtubers charge $500 for a
course that's what I think too
hey guys if you're looking for a fun
little project to do I have my very
first course out called learn angular by
projects part one where we build a
personal portfolio it's about three
hours of content it's one project and I
can teach you everything in angular by
any means but it's a great way to get
your feet wet and go ahead and check the
