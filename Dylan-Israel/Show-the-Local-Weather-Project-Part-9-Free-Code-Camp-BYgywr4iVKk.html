to convert this wind speed because it's
actually in m/s which to me American I
don't really I'm gonna too good with
meters today honest I'm bad at physics
and so we're in this case we're just
gonna make a quick conversion because
this is what would make more sense for
me so to convert from meters per second
to miles per hour is two point two three
seven times our wind speed this will
convert it into miles per hour so let's
go ahead and display that and you'll see
okay cool this is it's working but again
it's kind of ugly right here so we're
just gonna go ahead and go dot two fixed
we're gonna throw out a one one space on
it save and we need to actually target
the whole thing otherwise it's just
bringing that wind speed to one decimal
so there's 6.9 nice last thing we want
to do is we just want to add like a
little bit of context so 6.9 what miles
per hour so all in all this can this
controls like 90% of the code of what
you need to do we're gonna do the last
10% in which we'll be doing some if
statements going from zero to a hundred
degrees with every 10 degrees or maybe
every 20 and that'll be look that'll be
it the rest will just be styling and
personal preference after that so thanks
for watching guys
I'll see you in the next video alright
guys so the last thing that we're gonna
do is basically show how to change some
CSS and you're just using some if
statements for the weather here so by
default we load a background we're not
gonna actually do that we're just gonna
take out our CSS entirely so there's
that so what we're gonna do here is
within our within our JavaScript within
the to function to get JSON function
we're just gonna at the bottom here
really matter where you do it I'm just
gonna do it at the bottom we're just
gonna write some logic here so we're
gonna say if F temp so if our Fahrenheit
temp is greater than 80 we want it to
display a Sun so how do we do that and
then we'll do old it will also do if
your elsif
so I'm gonna be less than else if f if f
temp is greater than 80 yeah we're a
greater was right away excuse me so
we're gonna do is greater then that way
we can iterate downwards so we're say if
F temp it's greater than 7e so that
would basically be all the temperatures
between 70 and 80 right here that's the
way where I knew this logic so in our
case it's 78 point three so whatever
displace here should be what our
background is so how are we gonna do
that basically we're just gonna target
the body and we'll target it here first
to show that our code is kind of working
so we're going to target the body like
so and we're say dot CSS and then this
takes up we're gonna be using jQuery
this takes in two parameters the first
one is the CSS we're gonna be messing
with which is background - image and the
second one is the URL so if you kind of
remember how the background image breaks
up it'll kind of make more sense so
we're we're doing the background image
and then within it we're gonna go ahead
and put our you are oops our URL which
in my case right here we're gonna get
image copy image address we're gonna
throw it in there
and now when we save it you'll notice
that it's not working which is good
because it's not supposed to work so
you'll notice that oh well cuz the temps
not greater than 80 so what can we do we
can control paste this in here save it
and now you'll see that because the temp
is less than that our background will
display so the last thing that we really
have to do for this is with this
background it's more or less just go
down maybe in ten degree increments
until it maybe you get to like 30 or
below freezing and then it's he'll like
something but more or less you can just
set the temperature showcase a different
type of
whether so if it's great it's somewhere
between 70 and 80 it's probably pretty
good so as always guys thanks for
watching and don't forget to Like and
subscribe if you're interested in the
next video it's something new I'm trying
where I will be basically just grouping
all these videos together into one long
video and then if you want to support me
by buying that for like $2.99 dope if
not you have all these other videos so
as always guys thanks for watching I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
