got the accounts that didn't exist using
get JSON from free code camp and we got
the accounts that were online now the
offline ones free we're gonna go back up
to our get JSON done and you see the
data $3 right below that what we're
gonna do is we're gonna create if sting
this is if data data 3 dot stream is
equal equal to null meaning if they're
offline do some stuff now we want to
make sure that this works so we'll just
go ahead and log a 1 out here just see
that this data uh string no exists and
it does and it looks like the majority 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 of them
are offline so we have our 1 online to
offline so that's equal no longer so
what we're gonna do in here is just a
simple get JSON call that's gonna have a
for loop or excuse me a get JSON call
that it's going to let's go to the data
underscore links channel so let's go
ahead and do that so get JSON data 3 dot
underscore links dot channel this is
gonna take us to the channel info we're
gonna pass in a function here and we'll
go ahead and call this data 5
and I believe we're missing something
this is why you do this all I want sorry
function there we go and I believe we
said we're calling this data fine so
cool let's go ahead and console dot log
out data v dot logo we should actually
instead of logo let's do a display name
we're gonna need logo well we want to
make sure that we're getting the correct
information I won't be able to tell that
off of the logo so you'll see right here
we don't have our star craft guy or our
comm star 4 or 4 or whatever the other
ones guys we're only getting the guys
who are offline right now pretty cool so
we can do the same thing we've been
doing this whole time we can create a
logo your great status equal to the word
offline we can say logo is equal to no
quotes a logo is equal to data v dot
logo that's gonna be our URL and then we
can set name is equal to data 3 dot
display underscore name now for what
we're doing here we should do this for
the online as well but we'll go ahead
and do it here this will have a simple
if statement because one of these guys
has a logo that isn't there or they
haven't set it so we'll just say if logo
is equal to null we're gonna go ahead
and reset the logo to a default like
there is no logo or an X or something
like that and let's go ahead and add
that to our online code as well and
we'll just put it right below the VAR
logo so after it loads the data loads
logo we're gonna check if it's if it
exists if it if it's actually anything
if it's not we don't want to just a
break we wanted actually to input a no
load
JPG besides that all we have to do is
copy over the same follower dot prepend
that we've been doing here throw it in
here oops
copy throw it into there and let's go
ahead and look at our code and you're
seeing all our beautiful stuff you're
seeing our no logo pop up as well it's
looking really ugly but we're gonna
clean that up in the next video
so this is all the code that you're
actually gonna have to do I don't have
any other code written here everything
else is gonna be styling CSS we're gonna
go ahead and do some comments in this
later on and that's pretty much it so in
the next video what we'll do is we'll
style it up a little bit in CSS and what
after that we'll just go through do kind
of a summary of what we did using
comments like we started here so that it
really kicks in so I hope you guys

guys thanks for watching the video my
good friend Matt an engineered truth has
a three-part interview with Quincy
Larson the founder of free code camp go
ahead and check that out and so you'll
get a lot of really cool stuff thanks
for watching and I'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
