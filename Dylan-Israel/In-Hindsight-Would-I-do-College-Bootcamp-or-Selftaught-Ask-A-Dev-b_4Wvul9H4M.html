camps first colleges verse self-taught
as a way of learning the sort of
trifecta and I promise at that in that
video I was gonna tell you about what
path I would take and why would take it
knowing what I know now right hindsight
is always 20/20 and unfortunately well
not unfortunately the video went on for
about twenty-five minutes about those
three tops about ten minutes of Pisa
less than that or eight minutes piece
and I think it was good but I felt like
that video was going on a little bit too
long at and this should be its own
separate video so here might give you a
little bit about what path I would take
and why knowing what I know now well
self sponsorship if you guys are
interested in just learning a little bit
more about the soft skills a little bit
more about what takes to become a
software developer I've been I've read
the first eight chapters of this in one
sitting of John's book the complete
software developer's guide and I
couldn't recommend it any higher it is a
fantastic read I haven't got to the mid
or senior level developer entries it's
really cover all spectrums but is
something I'm really enjoying on site if
you want to help me out there's a link
in the description Guilhem is on
affiliate money also you'll probably
help John out as well but a little thing
you want to know I asked my girlfriend
to make me a bookmark or get me a
bookmark and that's what she gives me I
can't even ask for a bookmark that
getting some smartass reply so with that
being said it's going to start this
video guys for those of you who may be
new the channel a little bit about my
background is that I'm a self-taught
developer and I've I've was involved in
ACS program I dropped out and I started
going the self-taught route wasted a lot
of time in college but what would I do
now
and this is something that I think is
not going to be the right answer for
everybody and I want to preface that
because a lot of times people are
looking for absolute truths the world is
black and white man and I just want to
know what the right answer is and the
truth of the matter is that
although this is what I would do knowing
what I know now it may not work for you
and it may not be what's best for you
and you have to decide that on your own
you have to really answer yourself
honestly about what type of person you
are how much of a structured environment
or how much sort of hand-holding do you
need to get up and running as a software
developer but um knowing what I know now
I would I would have started as a
self-taught dev and I'm gonna preface
this saying that this is from high
school you graduate as a senior in high
school and the next thing you typically
do is jump you maybe take a year off or
you jump straight into college or
Community College and go from there so
um this is what I would do is uh
assuming that I was graduating high
school as a senior I would immediately
self-study that would be my goal and I
say immediately because most if you're
thinking about becoming a software
developer chances are and you're 18
chances are if your parents are anything
like my parents are is that they are
forcing you to do something and they
most of the time it's College right
you know usually there's three things
that parents depending on your parent
they're gonna they're going to try to
instill in you colleges usually number
one so hey go to college you're going to
college you're going to college III as a
child since the age of five remember my
father telling me about college so that
it's very deeply ingrained in me as well
as probably in our society and the next
one is if you're not going to college
you might be joining the military now
this is something that my father
ingrained to me by there is a large
portion of people who say look can go
school you join the army or you can I
get job and so those are kind of the
three the trifecta of what you do right
after you right after you graduate high
school a lot of times excuse me um now
the reason that I say immediately after
you graduate I would or I graduate from
high school I would self studies I think
I can hold them off for about a year I
said well hold up dad hold up mom just
give me a year I'm not not going to
do anything I'm gonna study software
development and go from there now this
may be a hard thing to convince some
overbearing parents and it is but this
is what I would do in a perfect world I
would see if I could you know I I've
been working since I was like 12 but
everyone's different right but assuming
that you didn't have a job
self-study for a year software
development and try to get a job then
part of the part of that reason is I
think you can I really do you're gonna
have to do a lot of great stuff a lot of
hard stuff building maybe a web presence
build a ton of side projects learn
relevant skills go to meetups volunteer
just be the person that companies want
to hire really someone who's passionate
about software always learning enjoys it
become that person if you aren't already
right it's not only about becoming that
person it's also about showcasing that
you are that person right it's one thing
saying hey man I'm passionate I love
this right I love it right you just
screaming at the top of your lungs but
then they look at your resume and they
don't see any passion right they don't
see any volunteer experience they don't
see any certificates that you've been
working on they don't see any side
projects don't see anything on your
github they see a a blank resume was
just someone who wants to get a job and
software that's not gonna be enough as a
self-taught developer now I'm not
completely done with this the the other
categories one thing that's kind of cool
is I would do kind of what I did and do
an online open source free boot camp you
do some of my free code camp where it
covers you know fifteen hundred hours of
stuff and knock that out to put on your
resume so I would sort of incorporate
the the boot camp thing now it's not a
traditional boot camp by any means but I
would incorporate something like that
into my my learning process as I become
a self-taught developer and finally to
wrap it all up I would do exactly what
I'm doing now we just go back and get a
degree why would I do that
because uh typically speaking you're
gonna make a little bit more money it's
also going to open doors that normally
would be harder to open or unable to
open and you won't have to
on the debt right so for those you don't
know I am in a online degree program
which I'm paying for out of pocket I
don't I make too much money to qualify
for financial aid or anything like that
and so I'm just paying for it straight
of cash I don't have to take student
loans out I have no debt I'm still able
to save a large portion of my income and
I'm working as a developer so not only
am I getting that experience at the same
time I'm going and getting the degree
I'm not accumulating a large portion of
debt that is standard in today's society
and this is something really to consider
I think it's also worth noting that it's
not I'm the first person just suggest
going getting a going becoming a
self-taught developer and and going back
to school later on as path I recently
have been reading the software the
complete software development guide by
Johnson masoor simple programmer some of
you may know him on his YouTube channel
and in his section he talks about what
he would do if he was go back and this
kind of would also sort of prompted this
idea because I don't think I've talked
about what I would do but he would do
exactly the same thing which I think
it's worth mentioning because I I have
high respect for his work ethic and I
think it's worth mentioning that you I I
tend to I like that my view aligns with
this because uh when you when you sort
of I don't call them mentor but when you
when you appreciate someone's a grind is
someone's work ethic yeah you you sort
of have to to put yourself in their
mentality of hey why would they see the
world this way and it just
coincidentally aligns with how I see the
world and in this this subject matter
and it's it's pretty much what I've been
doing essentially what I'm saying is I
wish I didn't waste my time in college
uh uh
in the beginning I happen to be one of
the lucky ones although I was struggling
to get food and pay for rent and all
this sort of stuff especially when I
dropped out of college when I was in
college I was getting some help from my
father he was paying for for it out of
pocket so I I'm one of those lucky ones
that didn't take on a bunch of debt and
that just just by the luck of life but
I would I know many developers who have
gone to college make the same or even
less than what I make and have tens of
thousands of dollars in debt and it's
it's rough man it's stressful they're
paying interest on that debt but I would
say that that would be my path from the
get-go is I would start out going
self-taught I would work myself into an
internship I would then go and get maybe
two three years of experience for those
you know I started my program when I had
about one and a half year of developer
experience about two and a half years of
industry experience in total and then
maybe three years if you count my
internship so pretty much exactly what I
did except I waste a bunch of time in
college beforehand which I hope I
wouldn't do but I would go the
self-taught route see if I can
incorporate an online boot camp for
either free or low-cost there's a lot of
open source stuff out there that is free
but there's also some very low cost
online boot camps as well and I would do
that I would then get an internship and
going a degree and the real question you
have to ask yourself is what is it that
you want out of this where do you want
to end up right so I'll give you an
example and then sort of work your way
back my end goal I haven't really talked
about this because it is sort of a
long-term angle my end goal is to go and
or might my dream job my dream software
game is to go and work for about three
or four companies into three or four big
companies Facebook Amazon Google
Microsoft that is my that is my dream
destination that's where I want to end
up so how do I end up at let's just say
Facebook how do I end up there well uh I
it may seem like a daunting task in the
beginning to get a job at Facebook
especially you're just starting to learn
to code your first job is probably not
gonna be on Facebook so you have to say
okay how do I get there let's start
where I want to be what is the same well
masters or bachelors preferred
passionate bunch of scales all right
let's take one step back now what is the
job before that well I get job as an
engineer in that role building up those
skills get some experience before that I
might get an internship
and as I'm doing all these sort of steps
you work your way back to where you are
you see what steps you have to go to get
there and that's kind of how I looking
back on this what I would do and that's
kind of part of the reason I'm going
back to school I'm always working on the
YouTube channel doing courses of books
trying to become that person that says
hey it's just a matter of time until I
get that job at Facebook until I get
that job at Google because I I am
becoming what they want to be not
because I have to be but because I want
to so looking back on what I would
change how I would go about it I
definitely start out self thought I
would evaluate what it is I want to
become before I take that path and then
I would set up steps to make sure that I
can accomplish that in a timely manner
and personally I think if you can go the
self-taught route and you always have
the option of you spend a year learning
it's yeah it's gonna be great for you
regardless you're gonna learn some stuff
but maybe maybe it's maybe it's not for
you you have that option of saying okay
well I spend a learn a year learning
about myself I spent a year learning
what I could and I you know I found out
that I needed a more structured
environment you can go back and say
alright well you know let's start the
Community College trying to save some
money and then transfer to the the big
name college or whatever the whatever
university you want at that point in
time and then I'm gonna spend the four
years getting my degree and then I can
try to do the internship and the job
thing because it is if not everyone can
do the self talk but for me looking back
self taught internship job maybe another
job college and then the macdaddy job
that your your whatever your end goal is
right - partially to build up passive
income streams build a web presence and
continue this sort of thing because I
really do enjoy this but what what is
your goal I think is how you have to do
it but that's what I would do so I hope
you guys found this video helpful about
if knowing what I know now about myself
knowing what I know now about how far
you can get as a self-taught dev because
it never really even occurred to me that
this could be a thing it was college or
your crackhead on the streets doing
things for money
so that was uh that was really what was
ingrained into me for a very long time
and and it's not the only way and it's
not always the best way depending on
what type of individual you are so
that's that would be what I would do
going back so hope you guys enjoyed the
video thank you so much for watching
don't forget to comment like share
subscribe support me on patreon all that
good stuff I'll see you next time bye
hey baby what do you think I would do
knowing what I know now if I was going
back to if I wanted to learn software
development hey guys if you're
interested in nice JavaScript course I
just released my second course and in
here we're actually going to be breaking
down JavaScript as a language as well as
give you some opportunities to solve
some algorithms and build some build up
your github as well as introduce you a
little bit to markdown there's a link in
the description to get the course for
just $15 if you're interested as always
thanks for watching I'll see you next
