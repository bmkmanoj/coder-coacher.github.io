excuse me back in JavaScript doing
object-oriented program objects one so
you can see that I already started it
we're gonna start from the beginning
because it's a video call it was bad but
let's go ahead and get started here so
that's good and I'll reset as we go
along here so this first one with this
big line of complicated or statements
and we basically just want to set a
variable called answer equal to true
pretty straightforward up next it is
asking us let's go and reset this code
to say which one of these is not modulo
by eight so if you look at the last one
fifty-eight isn't so that would be the
zero one two three four fifth index and
we're going to set that to true by
saying that the fifth index is not end
with a even division so it's gonna reset
this code here so it says print out the
numbers 1 to 20 using if and else if
statements here let me copy this in case
I mess up let's see here alright so we
need a for loop so we're gonna say for
VAR i equal to 1 so we want to start at
1 we'll say Y is less than 21 I plus
plus so increase it by 1 and we're gonna
say it needs to be one if it's modulo by
3 print out fizz
second if else is going to be divisible
by 5 and the third is divisible by 3 and
5 print out fizzbuzz otherwise just
print out the number so the best way to
do this in my opinion because we don't
want repeat values it start with the 3
and 5 it's the most complicated if
statement so we'll say if I modulo 3 is
equal equal to 0 and I modulo 5 equal
equal to 0 we want it to print out
console.log
we wanted to pronounce buzz with a
capital B else else if rather else if
and you could do this in in any order
let's just go ahead and type this out
we're gonna have to else ifs and then
else console dot log so let's start the
last statement is we want to print out
the number if it doesn't meet any of our
if requirements so so this is we're
gonna break up that first if statement
if it's not met
so we'll do five is equal equal to zero
but we want it to console dot console
dot log out I
and then the mod three so I come on
three is equal equal to zero
and we wanted to console dot log out
fizz and let me fix this one this one's
supposed to be buzzed so it's got in
save and submit and bam there we go one
two fizz for buzz fizzbuzz fizzbuzz 415
cool so control exit out of there so a
Toy Story 2 great story mean prospector
here your movies and reviews write a
function called get review so you can
see right here if you need to look at
this real quick I'll put it up for you
but we're gonna do it right now so
ramber VAR function hey-oh
VAR rather get review kit review equals
new function and in here
is function capitalized
yeah we need a parameter so write a
function named get real it takes a move
in a movie name all right so that's our
parameter we'll just call it movie and
returns it review based on so at the end
we're going to return the movie
all right let's look case all right so
that wants to see you switch statements
okay
so switch movie so we're gonna take in
our movie and we're gonna say we're
gonna get our case let's take out this
return movie because we're gonna be
doing it again and again basically so in
here we're gonna have three cases so
case Toy Story 2 and if it's that one we
want to console dot log out great story
you're gonna mean prospector if it's
next case so case two is Finding Nemo
and in this case we want to console dot
log cool animation comma and funny
Turtles and in our third case we want to
fun that is the lanky and we want to
console log out great songs
and because we're using a switch
statement we need a default default and
we'll just console.log can't find that
movie and it's usually you want to put a
break statement in here for each one of
these so it doesn't hit more than one we
know it probably shouldn't but just for
standard convention we're going to put
that in there and so let's call gate
review and in it we want to put in will
do Toy Story 2 can't find that movie Toy
Story 2
get review is not a function
hmm did I declare my function wrong so
far get review oh I put a new function
whoops there we go
Oh make sure your syntax is correct so a
great story mean prospector there you go
I'm not sure why he prints it twice
let's try it something else let's let's
just put zero zero zero and see what
happens I can't find the movie great
story mean prospector
thanks sis it wants this use or turn and
then we'll call it I'll just put some
empty space in here
check the review of Toy Story 2 okay so
let's go ahead with Toy Story 2
so we're getting some sort of air here
luckily we have our previous code and we
can see what we may have did differently
here it's probably a syntax thing
I don't believe the single quotes
shouldn't matter but let's go ahead and
just change that real quick we return
the same thing
great story Maine prosper oh my god
alright so it's probably that right
there just go ahead and cut this out and
now if you see right now it should work
check through on Finding Nemo
alright so let's get review and we'll
put Finding Nemo
finding email and make sure everything
is they look at their correct case :
rationed see it's working it looks like
it's more of a syntax thing so let's
compare our previous one so we have cool
animation comma and funny Turtles period
alright so now we're probably good
they're cool
just a little bit of a syntax there I'll
be probably referring back a little bit
to my previous code here since I've been
working mainly with HTML and CSS lately
I haven't had a chance to work with
JavaScript too much but we'll get back
into it's alright so this is just asking
us to print out I'm ready for objects
BAM there we go so in this case create
an object called Bob Bob that has no
informations inside the brackets so we
have our Bob little probably give us a
hint here all right so we need a equals
for our Bob equals and semicolon damn
good to go
so see the console object that I have
created about myself so that's probably
Spencer alright can you create object
called me so far me describes our age in
which country you live in
okay so far me equals and now we're
gonna set some object parameters here so
we're gonna set age to 27 put a comma
because we're adding another one and the
country and we'll put USA don't forget
the quotes so I'll take it as a string
and the semicolon at the end it's good
to go so so finish this code by filling
in the code in line thirteen and
fourteen access name and age for Susan
and give those to the global vows so we
want to say this is equal to Susan dot
name and Susan dot H so you call the
object and then you call the parameter
it follows with so we're gonna do the
same thing for the dog's weight so we're
gonna say dog dot o bracket notation
okay so far three Shizuko so let's see
let's check them so three said our code
we can't do it all right so bracket
notation so we need object name and
property name so in this case we want to
the dog's weight so I'm gonna say dog
and then we want to say weight I believe
let's see if this works properly
and then we want to say dog age let's
see if this works
so weight is equal to dog weight
I think we might need to like this with
brackets and then age because we're
looking for the key so this is like the
the key now this is like the door and
this is just a key I don't know you'll
figure out your own way to remember it
all right so make a Susan to object
using the constructor instead so let's
see barbed wire so far Susan 2 equals
new object and then we'll say Susan - ok
wants the same property dot name equals
Susan Jordan this is more how I'm
familiar with creating objects just
because it's more standard Java
convention
ah here's Susan to
nope there we go
cool so we have the correct name and age
and we're using a constructor so in this
case we're going to use two different
notations we're gonna use constructor
and then literal so in this first one
we're gonna have our brackets and then a
semicolon after and in here we need
snoopy should have two properties
species and we're going to set that
equal to beagle and then don't forget
the comma and then an age and we're
gonna set that equal to ten no comment
because it's our last parameter and here
we're save our buddy equals new object
and we're gonna say buddy dot species
equals
then make a buddy a five-year old golden
retriever right so uh golden retriever
then buddy dot age equals five that
should be good
cool so a little bit of literal notation
this first one and then object notation
so create a object named bicycle has
three properties so far bicycle
equals new object and doesn't say how to
do it so do do this however you feel
most comfortable and then we'll just say
bicycle speed equals zero
bicycle gear equals one bicycle dot
frame I'm just underscore material
equals carbon-fiber BAM all right so you
could have done it the other way as well
in literal notation and it should have
worked the same so define the function
multiply and I'll leave this up okay so
we need to refer back to it so far
multiply equals function and multiply is
going to take in two parameters they say
x and y
sorry about the break there the
girlfriend got home had to tell her I
loved her all that good alright so
in this function we're passing two
arguments and we wanted to do something
we want it to return x times y then we
want to call multiply and in this case
we'll put 2 comma 3 and I believe that
should work in return 6 so there's our 6
cool
all right so Bob's feeling old so let's
use our method set Bob's age so if
you've used getters and setters before
this is probably simple you just call
the set age function or method on the
object and we're gonna reset it to 20
and there we go
alright this is just asking us to see
what's the give birth year of Bob's ages
so BAM he was born in 1997 you see right
here this is written in 2014
looks of it and it's just whatever Bob's
ages - from the current year and there's
probably even a JavaScript function
built in that has the current year that
they could call so that they don't have
to go back and change change it so so in
this one we want to use the set age
function to change his age - alright so
we won't change his age
to show this way of making set age works
just like I said use Bob set age method
changes age to fifty so let's do Bob's
or Bob dot set age and we're gonna set
it to 50 and the when he's 50 that mean
he's going to born in 1964 all right so
make Susan on lines 11 to the 13 so
we're going to say Susan equals new
object and then we are going to say
Susan age is equal to 25 Susan have an
age of 25 and as Susan does set age
method also equal to set age
okay so Susan I age here update Susan H
so Susan set age is equal to 35
I believe that's what they're asking
Susan does set age it's not a function
all right Susan dot set age equals set
age so what they're asking cool
apparently we need to set this and let's
make sure everything's working properly
but apparently we need to set the
function in R when we declare our set
age so so let's uh let's call Susan dot
age here and see what's going on here
oops let's go back because uh this is
important console.log Susan done age and
see now it goes out 35 so we know
everything's working properly
so finish the method set width I should
take a parameter new width
all right so set rectangle I'll set
width equals and let's go ahead
should take parameter a new parameter
new with alright so that's always army
out so it's gonna copy this case we're
gonna look back at what we actually did
so we actually need to create a function
so our the method so it tells us right
here rectangle just set width this is
going to be a function that takes in a
single parameter called new width it's
gonna look similar to set heights above
so in here we're gonna say this dot
width is equal to new with this is
basically just saying that we when we
call new width this is what it's going
to be it's gonna be equal to whatever we
pass in to set width that's why it's
called setter set this to this then use
two commands set height and set width
the chain rectangle sight alright so set
height so we're gonna say a rectangle
dot set height and we're gonna set that
to six and then we're gonna say
rectangle set width and we're gonna set
that to eight save and submit everything
should work smoothly
all right so help us to find an area
method here so if you remember how to
get the area of a square or a rectangle
is just length times width so that's
basically what we need to write so we
want to add another methods of our calc
area and calc area is going to be equal
to function and we want it to which
returns the area of a square in terms of
side lengths so in the case of a square
we only need one parameter because all
sides are equal so we're gonna have
something called side length and in here
we're gonna use parameter as a guide so
could they you know return this dot side
length and area is equal to x this side
length so we just need to multiply it by
itself and everything should go we'll
square
oh because this is class specific or
object specific we need to call square
on it
all right so we have some sort of
function air so this side length so we
take in side length use calc area
unexpected token not very helpful but we
did save our code from second ghost so
let's go ahead and see what's going on
here maybe they don't want us to have
any gaps oh I took in a parameter Oh in
this case the side length is if you see
up here this is why I messed up so in
this in this case you can see right here
we actually give it a side length so
we're not taking anything in and we
don't need this okay so because they
created this and it's class specific I
was trying to create a function from
that wasn't class specific it looked
like all right so add Bob's age here and
set it equal to all right so this is
going to be free so set Bob's age Bob
dot H equals 20 go
all right so we're gonna create a new
person called George so far George
equals a new person and we're gonna name
him George Washington and we're set his
age to 275
all right so we're going to make a dog
constructor here
so in our dart dog constructor
constructor we want to give it prop
properties like age and name and then we
want to say this dot age it goes age
basically saying when you create this
age is equal to age and then we want to
say this dot name equals name cool so
create a new object called sally using
the person constructor so VAR sally
equals new person her name is Sally
all right so and in insert the necessary
information so necessary parameters
sally bolus her age is 39 and then we're
gonna create another object called
Holden and this is a new person his name
is Holden Caulfield and he is 16
unexpected token so let's look at our
code real quick I don't think I saved
this one either reference back new
person this is from the previous example
but it should all work all the same so
far above all silent equals new person
involved yeah okay edit the sentence
printed out such that includes the age
of Sally and Holden respectfully so
Sally says Sally got name plus Sally dot
age and then we're gonna do the same
thing for a Holden name and old end age
ma'am there we go so you can see up here
well you could probably change this so
this is a little less awkward but it
gets the two parameters and puts it in a
print statement
I'm just gonna copy this and go so any
of your reference back to it so define a
new method on line eight called calc
parameter so we're gonna define the
function function calc
oops
actually are we chained we're not doing
far anymore just calc area to find a
method which calculates returns the
parameter okay so we need to actually do
it inside here because it's
class-specific so this dot calc oops
parameter equals a function
and in here we want it to return so it
has it already has parameters height and
width so return
so we need height actually we don't need
to put in here because it already has it
so return this dot height all returns of
perimeter so return this dot height plus
this because it's only using this width
and this is a height we can just give
this dot height times 2 plus this dot
with times 2 because the sides should be
the same 7 and 3 there you go all right
now we can easily make all of our
rabbits so we want to create a new
rabbit cultivar grab it 1 equals new
rabbit with thatched if fluffy so rabbit
one is fluffy and then we want to do the
same thing here devour grab it 2 equals
new rabbit and this one is happy cool of
our rabbit 3 this is equal new rabbit
and this one is sleepy
and then use the method described myself
to print on in the console system
all right and to print out a console
sentiment all right so we are going to
say describe all right Omar say rabbit
one doc described my self I don't think
we need that rabbit to describe myself
rabbit 3.2 scoops don't describe myself
let's see go
you didn't actually print anything out
that's a little weird all right yeah so
you definitely need this on the end or
else it's not gonna work I don't know
what I was thinking this isn't a
parameter this is a function and even if
it has no parameters you should include
it so yeah let's reset code add the last
family member Timmy who is six years old
so if you look correctly here we
actually have a family of person we have
an array that holds new people I guess
new person's so in this case the family
we're adding a new member called Timmy
and he's going to be six years old and
we're just gonna add it to the array so
we're not doing anything with it we just
added it right and now we're caught up
to where I was when I stopped last so
right a person constructor called person
so let's look at the hints here I always
forget how to do all this stuff alright
so for me I'm going to look back real
quick just so function person okay
so function person takes two properties
name and age we're gonna say this dot
name equals name this dot a equals the
age we're just setting things here then
we create a large family now we want to
create an empty array so we're gonna
save our family
equals and I create the this incorrect
here but we'll see so there's our array
there will be four objects in the array
using your person constructor so we'll
say family will start it our first index
so family 0 equals new person and
they're gonna have the parameter Alice
it was 40 then we're gonna have family
member index 1 almost mean person and
that's the EOB but cob little cat was a
show but now bob with that silent K all
right then we have a family member
index value nor to new person and they
are going to be named Michelle and then
Tim after that double ellen michelle so
we don't get an error
she'll is 8 and to go on from there we
will have two minutes and they'll be
indexed like three and then we are gonna
say new person and we're gonna set that
with his name and age give me his name
and his age is six so now we want to
loop through the family array okay
couple ways we can do this the better
way is to use dot size and it should
work just fine so we're gonna create a
for loop
was a four bar I is equal to zero and
while I is less than family dot size and
I make my syntax maybe a little wrong
here we'll see in a second I plus plus
and then we want to print out
console.log I dot name so let's go ahead
and save and see what Eric because we're
family dot size is not a function
all right just because I don't want to
look up there's definitely some array
function that will tell us let's see if
they say anything
thing here also Oh actually what's this
right family size and I should have done
this so this needs to be family array
value dot name family array value dot
name all right we'll just set this to 4
to make our lives a little bit easier
BAM
there we go so we get Alice Bob Michelle
Timmy we could probably clean this up a
little bit but for the sake of this
exercise I think we're okay here so
we've created a two example people
Allison Billy complete line 17 by
calling age difference in saving result
in a global diff very evil so creates a
difference in age between Alice and
Billy so we're gonna say our age
difference
equals
oh excuse me age difference is a
function so we're gonna call age
difference and we're setting it equal to
Alice Billy and I believe this should
work because it's gonna take the
parameters from each one of these cool
and just to make sure it works let's
console dot log out diff and it should
be v emeritus
all right so we want to define a
function called older age we wanted to
function return the age of the person
who is older so up here we are gonna
create a function of our older age and
when I set this equal to function and we
want to call person 1 comma person -
doesn't really matter what we named them
as long as we use it and we're gonna
create an if state we're gonna create
another var so far how do we want to do
this actually we don't need to do this
we'll do it if statement so we'll say if
person one dot age is greater than
person - age returned person one dot H
else returned we don't be else else
because there's in this case there's
only two options
and we've already compared one so person
2 by default is greater we want to
return person to age ma'am
so the older person is 30 in this case
nice so make objects fence or two of our
Spencer just a little bit of review so
far Spencer - and we're gonna set this
equal to
oh we're using constructor notation Will
Survive Spencer cuticles new object and
then we're gonna say Spencer - Spencer -
age is equal to 22 and Spencer - dot
country is equal to United States
make sure you space properly BAM the
United States good to go set the global
variable species to Snoopy species in
the variable age to Snoopy sage
Oh using bracket notation I believe it's
like that and then we just put it in
quotes right yeah all right so we call
the object and then when you put in what
parameter which is in this case of
species and then we do the same thing
here all right so one we use bracket
we'll do it there so this one we're
gonna use dot so it's a Snoopy dot age
and everything should work cool
notice that without the constructor it
takes us three lines of code to make
Harry Potter an object that represents
Harry Potter object one then in line
seven we introduce a constructor we pass
in pages and alternate properties as
parameters use this constructor to make
the hobbit a book with 320 pages by jr.
tilt Tolkien alright so we're gonna say
are the underscore hobbit equals new
book equals son new object no equals new
book rather this new book and in here
we're going to take in first its pages
so that's 320 second is the author which
is j dot r dot r dot Tolkien and now
we're gonna set actually that's all I
think we need to do we did it in one
line so there we go there's our pages
and our author we just basically created
it a new book class called The Hobbit
that's it
and our last we are gonna define a
perimeter method so in here we were
gonna say that calculates the perimeter
of a circle so we're gonna say yes
they wants to as we did with area so
this dot perimeter
equals a function and in here we need to
return a value so we're going to return
and how do you calculate the perimeter
of a circle recall the formula Tracy I'm
not the only one like damn
remember this so return two times Matt
we're borrowing for when we do this math
dot pi we're basically saying call this
PI method from the math library so it's
2 times Matt tuff pi times rate this dot
radius and that should work cool so we
just finished our introduction two
objects one in JavaScript up next it was
a little bit of a long course 33
sections some harder than others up next
we're gonna be building an address book
so maybe a little more quick and
painless that's one of the longer
section is on the code Kadim e site but
uh it's a lot of good stuff constructors
or you can see how many different ways
you can do a couple things and you'll
find which one you prefer but as always
guys like the video share it leave
comments constructive criticism is
always appreciated and I'll see you guys
in the next video for building an
address book
