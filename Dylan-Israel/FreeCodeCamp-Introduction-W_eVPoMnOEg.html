tweets and a lot of comments like hey I
finished my HTML course alright finish
my JavaScript course or what do I do
after I get done at code Academy cuz you
know I'm big fan of code Academy and
since I've been making the videos I've
kind of worked through almost all the
videos I've run it running out of things
to do so one of the cool sites that I
found which I think it's great for
anyone going from a code CAD imme
environment to a minh and also if you
want to work on a certain set of skills
free code camp is the way to go and it's
the most like code Academy so if you
really like that format check it out
they claim to have 800 hours of practice
what's also really cool is if you're
able to get through all this you can get
a you can get a certificate from them so
that's quite a bit of practice to get a
certificate from free code camp but hey
I mean you never know every little bit
helps you know on a resume and it's just
kind of cool look I've worked through
800 hours of alleged course work let's
say it's really closer to 4:00 if you're
if you're going pretty quick and I
appreciate the certificate I wish code
calving me gave me a certificate for
completing so many courses but with that
being said let me just show you kind of
what they have here so let's show the
html5 and CSS course it's pretty simple
it's as like to code Kadim e as I've
seen and so this one is exit so
basically on the Left you have your
instructions and down below here it'll
actually tell you what of the
instructions you're not doing so it's
usually pretty helpful and you run the
test here you type the code here and you
display it here it's really cool and it
looks like some of the HTML is gonna use
be a little more advanced than code
Academy once we ramp up in it a bit and
that's kind of cool too because we're
gonna be messing around with the
responsive design which is really nice
as well so check out free code camp if
you're looking for HTML CSS and
JavaScript they also have angularjs and
agile and a couple others that are for
more advanced sort of things so but if
you're if you're looking for something
to transition
smoothly in HTML CSS JavaScript from
from codecademy and you want to learn
some more advanced skills as well they
have they have 800 hours worth of
practice stuff so check this out and I
will see you guys in the next video
about starting this with HTML CSS and
working our way through the first 28
problems and also if there's any
questions comments concerns or a site
that you like they say hey Dylan check
this out
because I I search for these things all
the time and I just try him out like
code combat is another good site that's
a little more fun I think if you're
working with maybe younger younger
people but yeah so thanks guys and I'll
see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
