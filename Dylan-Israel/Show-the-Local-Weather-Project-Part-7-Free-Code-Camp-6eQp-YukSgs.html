thing we're gonna do is basically just
do a little bit CSS a little bit of
bootstrap and pretty pretty soft thing
view at this point it's just create a
div to group our like our options here
so we're just gonna group that and then
we're just gonna use some CSS from
bootstrap so we're just gonna call upon
a couple classes so we want this in the
center of the page so that we're gonna
use the class text - centered so all our
stuff is there but we saw these ugly
dots so in that case there is a UL class
called list
- unstyled let me zoom in a little bit
alright so that list - unstyled and
you'll notice that these are gone now
but we still want to be look a little
more like buttons and we actually want
them to look like right now that we
don't really there when we click on this
it doesn't feel like a button because it
doesn't look like button and so well
there's a couple things that we can do
that we're gonna apply the class to the
each one of these allies or just give it
a class called BTN and then we'll give
it another class called BTN - default
then we probably give them some color
later on so now you'll notice that when
you hover over it changes color it's it
kind of feels a little more like a
button we're just gonna go ahead and ply
this class to all of these
you notice they're lining up as well cuz
that's the way that it's actually worked
out so now when we click on this it
feels a little more takes a little bit a
second or so on but you'll see that it's
really it feels much more responsive
when you hover over it so it's pretty
cool so we basically have our four
buttons here now hmm
we're still cleaning up the page but
we're trying to kind of get a a picture
of what is this gonna look like so why
don't we add a background image because
eventually that is what we're gonna
actually need to do so we're just going
to go body here I'm gonna say background
- image and in my case we're using a URL
and let me go ahead and pull out my
image I'm gonna put that in there
save it and you'll see we have this nice
little background from from unsplash so
a couple of other things we can do at
this point is if we really want to start
getting a feel for it before we start
typing up the remainder of the code we
can probably start in this in this case
we get still put in here I'll just
create an h1 class and we'll say
something like local show the local
weather the weather
right and actually show the local
weather and then we'll put like an h2
under it actually looks like h3 well
just have front and developer project
for an inn
cool and so we have our city you just
look like I'm but nothing's gonna happen
in this case when you click I'll change
between Celsius and then we'll have to
figure out what units is in but the core
functionality for the most part is here
so in the next video we're gonna clean
this up we're gonna probably be a little
bit CSS and then after that we'll go
into actually swapping the background
images but it's gonna look a little
something similar like this I imagine
alright see you guys the next video
