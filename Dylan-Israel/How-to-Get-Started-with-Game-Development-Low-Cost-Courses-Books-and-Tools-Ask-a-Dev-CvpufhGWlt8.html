building games right so one of the
things I did that I really enjoyed in
college one of the only things I enjoyed
in college was when I was learning
Python we actually built a game using a
library called pi game I built a tower
defense game that was based off league
of legends I did this really corny intro
and honestly I built more of an intro I
built an intro game to the game so by
the time I got to the tower defense part
I only built one part but uh maybe I'll
see if I can find that and show that in
another video but today what I want to
talk to you about is how you can get
better at uh if your if your goal is to
build game so a lot of people have that
right a lot of people are like oh I like
web development but what I really want
to do is I want to build games there's
some resources that are available for a
limited time this isn't like a buy now
get two free if you're not familiar with
Humble Bundle basically what they do are
they're way for you to they have limited
time packs usually about two weeks right
now they have the game maker bundle
which is going on for another six days
and you basically tell you what you want
and what that means is for one dollar
you get all this right here so say say
you can't spend more than a dollar but
and by the way normally they do games
but they start diving into software that
started diving into books that start
diving into courses and today they have
some really good ones that's why I've
decided to I had a video scheduled but I
wanted to do this so you guys could take
advantage of it and if you want to help
me out by the way that link that you see
that I'll get like a 15% affiliate cut
or something like that it doesn't matter
what you buy or but that's one way that
you can help me out as well
but so if you if you spend a dollar you
get all this in in this is the game
maker Reeb undle if you spend more than
the average which is typically how they
do it you get all this on top of it so
you'll get a pseudo professional game
maker and then here you'll get four 1078
you'll get or more ten seven eight or
more you'll get the html5 module which
teach how to make games in html5 and to
help you out with that and thank you
fifteen dollars or more you get the
Android the iOS and I'm guessing uwp is
Windows not to mention all these other
games along the way so uh and you can
see normally it's a $300 I don't know
how much people are paying for these
things but at the end of the day it you
could probably learn a lot as well as
build something I think one of the best
ways to probably get into into game
development is actually to have games
that you've built just like pbilic
portfolio and web development fort folio
games if you really want to be a game
developer the best thing you do is build
a game launch it and have people be able
to play it when you're applying for jobs
but that's not it actually so so they
also so they have the game bundles but
they also have the book bundles as well
which go off the same set and anchor and
coincidentally they have a gaming book
bundle right here and they say so $785 a
digital books for a dollar or more you
get unity five Unreal Engine Unreal
Engine game development cookbook
building RPG with Unreal 4 whatever our
map subscription is and then it you can
see it goes on and on so for a dollar
you're going to get four books and a
subscription to something and then for
eight dollars or more you're going to
get another was a seven more book so now
you're up to twelve items in total and
then if you decide you the 15 you're
going to get another six items like so
for basically less than a dollar a book
dollar item here you can get a whole
bunch of stuff but again you can only do
a dollar if you want and the cool thing
about this is that you support charity
also right so depending on how you want
to the amount you want to do you can
actually choose where your money goes
and I think if you're using my affiliate
link you can get all give it all to me
baby you say the people who made
that game and forget charities
I want my charity to be fair Dillon
alright but and also so if I didn't want
let's say for some reason your boy was
buying a game and EA had made it and we
all wanted to tell a a to go shove it we
might just go ahead and give those boys
a zero right so uh you do have that
option as well and you just give the
charity or the humble humble bundle
itself
all the money I believe there's a
certain breakdown percent wise that's
the default but you do have that option
to change it as well one other cool
thing this isn't necessarily software
but there's actually a hack to hack me
games which I guess the point of the
game is to do sequel injects as if
you're really hacking in real life for
these games so something right so if
you're if you are a super nerd you're
going to love this right so not to
mention all these other games also for
so I'm sorry a little bit of a more
gaming gaming nerd like myself I'm
subscribed to humble monthly bundle what
that is is for $12 a month they send you
games if you sign up right now you'll
get yourself killing floor and this goes
down if you sign up for multiple months
but every month you can see in July I
got Dark Souls 2 and I got all these
other games and you gotta check it out
and super hot last month or the month
chill in June all that stuff and not to
mention the store they have a store and
you can get discounts there and they you
know once it all goes to charity not all
of it but a portion of it goes to
charity so if you're interested in
making games guys if you're interested
in in going down that route not
necessarily something I can help you
with I mean we can talk about Python and
if you if you'd like to do some Python
and mess around with Pi game library I
will warn you that I don't believe at
least at the time about a year and a
half two years ago it was not being
maintained so some of the stuff works
some of the stuff kind of works that
some of the stuff just doesn't work
right so keep that in mind but also I
don't know I really like Humble Bundle
I've been using Humble Bundle for a
while usually I get some like I get my
courses from other content creators I
get my courses for you know people like
traversing media angular University - IO
and this last weeks I'm actually giving
away game courses for each for the
winners of the videos so in this video
I'll probably give away let's see I
think I did Android iOS I'll probably
give away html5 this video so make sure
you use the the keyword Humble Bundle
like the video and be subscribed for
that but
it's definitely interesting path that
one I don't I feel like a lot of us as
developers I know I did I know when I
was playing I was sitting down as a
child young adult and just adult right I
I always dreamt of making games one day
even before I started thinking like
seriously about it like I remember you
know playing the Super Nintendo playing
Final Fantasy three or six whatever you
want to call it and and thinking like
this would be really cool and I I had
things like a view on the PlayStation
they I forget I think it's PlayStation 1
they started with the RPG maker which
you're able to build your own RPGs and
and you know it came out awful but it
was fun right it kind of fulfilled that
nerdiness like I'm going to make an RPG
and you basically at least I did made a
Final Fantasy clone right so so this
kind of is on the same level where you
can you can get some help with some
tools and build it out and again I
really am a believer that especially of
your self-taught you don't really have a
choice of yourself talk of building a
strong portfolio maybe if you're not
self-taught just going that extra mile
right so help help you out in that
fashion and again this this game maker
bundle it's only this will be going out
tomorrow so probably five days at that
point and 19 hours and then the book
bundle is up for four days and 19 hours
or so so I encourage you to check it out
so let's check them out in the future
and the monthly bundle and if you guys
have built some games I would love to
showcase them on the channel like if you
have a web browser game that you built
that you think is really rad and you
want you want people to go to it you
want people to check it out I'm happy to
showcase them you can uh I guess leave a
broken link I don't think can you leave
links in comments I don't think so or
else people just be spamming
whitehouse.gov or something like that
right White House comm the old-school
job for some of you guys who didn't know
that AOL Internet was a thing way back
in the day and that was a joke people
used to make some of you will get it
some of you won't that's okay
I'm about to turn 30 boy some of us so
much stuff is we got to be a little bit
old so let's check out check out the
humble bundles make sure you use my link
as well help me out I've been using
Humble Bundle for years and I picked up
quite a few cool games uh and either
better less team so I know a lot of us
look forward to the Steam sale so I
check the whole bundle about once every
two weeks and I'm subscribed to Humble

five if I get five of you guys just kind
of playing through one day and checking
it out because again I mean I know this
is my channel but I kind of trying to
build a community of people who are
supportive and if there's some way that

feasible I'd like to do it so thank you
for watching guys and I'll see you in
the next video bye hey guys thanks for
watching the video especially thanks to
our sponsors dev Mountain if you're
