go ahead and share this link on the
Facebook page real quick and we will get
into it oh man so hope you guys are
doing better than I'm doing it's because
I have a cold for like a week and a half
and I'm pretty sure I just have Ebola
it's oh man
so um for those of you are new to the
channel what I like to do even one
second get the chat up here but what I
like to do is I like to say hello say
goodbye say no um so I can start making
some sense all right there we go so if
you're new to the channel this may be
something that you're not accustomed to
and that's good so every thousand
subscribers I like to do a a subscriber
special a where I so just it's a bonus
livestream right this was before I was
doing live streams every Saturday and I
kind of want to continue them on it's
kind of tradition right so every
thousand subscribers we get to do a live
stream I can answer your questions try
and help you out any way I can and have
some fun with it so this is your
opportunity so I do get questions all
the time I got an email and a tweet the
other day from a guy struggling with
algorithms and I just haven't had a
chance to answer back and I usually
don't be honest with you otherwise I'd
be doing this full-time
unpaid homeless crackhead I don't know
but probably not a crackhead but
homeless because I want to have a job
because I'd answer your questions all
the time so this is opportunity for you
to do that and it's opportunity for me
to say thank you to the twenty-eight
thousand of you who subscribed
beforehand and to say thank you to the
new 1000 of you and who are part of the
fam and say welcome so it's been it's
been fun
David Ricky Ross Simba Dennis
yeah we've been growing pretty fast man
so we've been grown by about seventeen
hundred subscribers a month so you get
one of these every two and a half weeks
or so
which guy nice it's a break it up a
little bit what's up what I've been up
to I've been sick as I mentioned for the
past ten days
my hair has also started growing back
you see this that's hair I haven't had
that in a while
so the hair is growing back I've also
started studying more in depth angular
and I've kind of I've been at this weird
point in life if you guys watched this
Saturday's livestream I think I may have
come off as depressed but I I really was
trying not to come off as depressed so
much of someone that was mentally stuck
on a place so let's see here
and I I kind of figured out what that
was and we'll dress that in a second so
Dylan you got it Dylan you said you got
a job about 3/4 to the front freak up
camp front and certificate the
curriculum has changed gave the idea of
how that is for the current FCC do they
actually update the curriculum finally I
know they have the beta do they actually
add some new stuff because I'd find that
I'd find it pretty hard to believe that
I ain't gonna email like something from
them but I'm going on the site real
quick so looking at the map the
curriculum has not changed on the Mait
on free code kept org so I think maybe
you're talking about the beta
so let's see let's see what you guys you
guys are actually asking questions -
that's good man your boy does have his
glasses on so I can't read as fast as he
normally should but yeah so the
curriculum is the same as when I took it
when I was working through it so what uh
what do you think the top five skills
you need OHS front-end developer are
well one thing I can say is that is I
obviously JavaScript I also think you
need a job so alright so let's just get
over the let's get the I'm gonna bundle
these three into one skill HTML CSS and
JavaScript just one skill because those
are the those are like the core
requirements and we're saying the basic
working knowledge of that skill number
two is a current popular front-end
framework that is react or angular there
are no others skill number three is
working knowledge of jQuery a lot of
times that's just something you're gonna
need depending on the job it's just
gonna do you do you justice although
that is a that is that is the may be
skill of this five skill list skill
number four is get please get
comfortable with version control skill
number five is communication it's not a
hard skill but it's the most important
skill for you to for you to be able to
have you need to be able to
communication slash passion are the two
soft skills that you really need as a
developer especially when you're getting
started if you have those five skills as
a front-end developer that's what you
need so javascript obviously the biggest
part of that but and JavaScript
frameworks follow it but communication
and passion are the first one what's
going on to a first one for in my eyes
and in a lot of developers eyes you
think it's a lot different than the one
I went through so uh if it's if you're
talking about the beta on free code camp
it is slightly different they have
updated it I'll definitely do a review
of it
and I'll definitely go through the
projects I started building out some a
while back buzz Lee I'll just wait till
it's out Shane you just got back from
the Philippines
hey Matt's in the Philippines right now
I haven't watched you videos in a while
I'm subscribed from you I know that's
all right thank you for the congrats if
I finish Iraq now and agree no I've been
I've not I've discontinued my energy
during my energy at that since landing
my role because I am actually focused on
learning angular mourning death because
that is what I do in my role do I think
that it's easier to get a job in a
start-up or with a big company well I
would say Jim that you shouldn't really
be looking for one or the other you
should be applying for roles at both to
start your career that's that's really
my my advice and secondary advice is
whatever you think your weaknesses are
work on them if you're not sure ask a
friend that will be honest with you and
ask a developer but I don't think
anybody for their first developer job
should be picky I would say every
workplace is different a it depends
there's some startups that are doing
very well and looking to build out a
team of junior devs and mentor them over
the next several years and there's some
startups that are only going to hire the
best of the best senior developers so it
really kind of depends and that goes the
same for corporate companies and larger
larger established big companies it
really just kind of depends so forth
things said last time you mentioned the
you did the Google and an agree you said
you take the mobile path I think you're
talking about the the live stream to to
live streams ago where I talked about
how Google is giving away 50 thousand
nanodegrees and essentially 25 thousand
our web and 25 thousand our mobile is
that because you are already a dev yes
that is correct well the reason I would
actually take that is because it would
be some
different the the concepts that we'd be
working with in terms of web are things
that I am I am familiar with and things
that I wouldn't necessarily learn as
much so if I were to choose one at this
point in time where I'm at in my life
and career I would do mobile just
because I don't think the return would
be all that great or as interesting
however if I was clean slate wasn't a
developer I definitely would do web over
mobile it was more of an interesting in
mobile than anything else is it ever a
good idea to work for a disreputable
company for money I got an interview
lined up for doing SQL customer service
so I'm very skeptical it's just as the
company has sued several of its clients
I mean I wouldn't be worried about it
that's a honestly when I look at
companies I look at what's on Glassdoor
I don't care what's going on in the news
I want to see what the employees are
saying for all you know the company is
suing its clients deserve to be sued and
you know treat their employees great but
I would definitely do the research about
the company if that's something you're
worried about have I noticed they raised
an income at all from the channel firm
arrays and subs you don't get any more
money because you have more subscribers
but my views and watch time have been
going up and so my income has steadily
been going up as well so I believe six
months ago if I were showing my income
is around 350 or $300 in ad revenue not
counting sponsorships or affiliate links
or anything else like that and now it's
hovering now 500 so yeah but I am a
little worried about the ad revenue so
if if you guys have been noticing you
know I've always had a patreon where I
get about forty five fifty dollars a
month and it's really nice because it
pays for basically everything it costs
for me to maintain a YouTube channel
monthly and it's just nice to have
support that way but I if you've noticed
I've been throwing affiliate links in my
video as part of that was triggered by
other channels getting demonetised and
now i'm my video so that like the if you
watch my one of my more recent videos
where i say how to join the coding
community got demonetised should you
take unpaid internship got d monetize
these are topics that aren't
controversial i you know we're talking
about software stuff right I don't I
don't know why they got demonetized they
don't tell you but if you're if you see
the affiliate links and stuff like that
that is uh that is what what happened so
how many jobs per day did you apply to
again might be a good video idea how do
you go about it
I applied primarily through LinkedIn and
zip recruiter although depending on on
the zip recruiter I think sometimes
it'll pull me to other sites but it
would depend on the day but I would say
somewhere between like fifty to a
hundred a day I was really would spend
all day applying when I was first
looking for a role everywhere every
every where on LinkedIn a zip recruiter
in the United States and I would search
for jobs only that got posted in the
last 24 hours because I was playing
every day and I wanted to be the first
applicant in there because they're
really just trying to find the first one
that looks good and and I wanted to make
sure they saw my resume so that that was
where I was I I've been trying to find
companies that are willing to train new
developers willing to invest with people
with a lot of experience how do you find
these companies I don't know man
yeah for me it was just a numbers game I
just applied as many times as I could I
figured I only needed one one one job at
the end of the day when I got started
when I was getting started so why were
they demonetized I don't they don't tell
you because the content is inappropriate
is the the general response can you
appeal it you can appeal it which is
fine but most people's channels mine
included in their first day of release
in a video get the bulk of the views for
most people's videos and so and it
varies but this is the general rule of
thumb so
say it gets you monetized immediately so
you lose out on 90% of the revenue of a
video or 75% of the revenue of a video
immediately and then it's kind of like
well man I spent the time doing
this video and and you can see why
people get frustrated about it not just
me I have a good one Jim
I heard that Google is gee monetizing
because advertisers really here realized
that people rarely click on ads if ever
that's I mean so I couldn't tell you I
think that's probably just sketch
skeptics but that's just some theory
crafting but uh it's just like anything
else television ads you know any any
other ad I'm sure I'm sure has the same
conversion right if not better because
you're already on a device that you can
go and actually access that product if
you want it or your your interests event
oh yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't worry
about it too much
I'm not I'm personally not too worried
about it but I mean it does suck right
it does suck when you when you're
talking about you know I I started I put
out three videos a week and I do a live
stream every week so it just um it just
sucks that uh it's just it's it's
demotivating like I completely
understand what other people people get
fed up and leave especially if they it's
affecting them on a much larger scale
than it does on my channel right do
if a place was lurking for a web dev it
doesn't ask any technical questions to
vet the skill of a potential web dev
would you decline whatever they offer
commit to working for them for a bit I
wouldn't be too worried about it
especially if you're on the junior side
and what what do you mean they don't ask
any technical questions like they don't
ask you basic stuff or they don't ask
how you to explain your experience
because this again goes to sometimes
companies are looking for the right fit
regardless of the skill set so but as as
any as a as someone being interviewed
you also have the ability to to ask
questions to get to whatever is worrying
you about them not asking technical
questions so I would say David if that's
something you're concerned about what
just bring it up with them and go from
there ask them it's usually not a
problem you're gonna have most of the
time do I use are the front end frame
works no not in my workplace
could I do my projects in Java yeah let
me just go ahead and do everything in
Java so I can shoot myself in the head
for you no I I don't want to do them in
Java I could it'd take me a little bit
to brush up Java was what my coursework
in college was in but I don't want to do
that job is awful
is it possible to have a web dev job
that allows you to work remotely of
course it is although not although it
just kind of depends on what your it's
gonna be hard if not impossible when
you're just starting a lot of the remote
jobs guys are for senior developers
that's just kind of the the gist of it
what coding courses did you learn in
college I had three Java courses I also
had a Python course I had a Scala course
I had a C++ course and that was it
I think I have yeah I had a creating
like a architecture course a database
course does coffee give you the runs
sometimes I'll be real with you
it depends did I eat any breakfast
before the coffee if not I've started
playing web developer jobs recently how
long does it take to hear back from the
jobs you apply to it it depends on your
job search strategy and what you're
going to do if you're applying for jobs
there three weeks old good luck you're
applying jobs that day maybe pretty
pretty quickly which is one of the
reasons that I apply to jobs that come
out that day am I going to finish my
degree let me tell you the Crusader
rabbits this is something I think about
every day I don't know I want to then I
don't want to we'll see we'll see us the
answer I would like to an employer to
pay for it so I don't have to that's the
truth of the matter what
on the popularity of jQuery do you think
it's going to be Hine damn in near
future jQuery is is I mean jQuery is
used on a lot of websites the thing is
if you want to make good money and work
on web applications that's going to be
in react that's going to be in angular
and that should be what your focus
should be in most of the time do I brush
my cats every day no which is better and
superior service treehouse or free code
camp third night you can't compare them
treehouse is a video platform that helps
teaches you free code camp is a free
online interactive tutorial service you
should do both but they're not
compatible you can compare free code
camp to code CAD me because they're
essentially the same thing can you brief
can I can you can you briefly give a
general description of UI UX design and
can you give any tips to go after
learning the basic fundamentals of CSS
JavaScript PHP and jQuery well UI UX
really just refers to having good design
having things that when a user looks at
your web application they know what it
does right using correct color schemes
correct design patterns and then user
experience is essentially just working
well as they're they're very similar
it's just about making sure that things
are intuitive and should be working as
they looking and a user is able to
figure out how your application looks
without you sitting down and showing
them in terms of what you should learn
after the fundamentals of HTML CSS
JavaScript PHP and jQuery you should
definitely pick up some version control
with git as well as a front-end
framework and a database if you're if
that's what you're looking for so if
since you're learning PHP you're
probably going to want to pick
my sequel do you have any resume advice
for someone new to web development
I do actually I have several videos Mac
dude in the little code playlists or ask
a deaf playlist and so in there I have
something for I have I have five things
that you should do to land a web
development job and I also have some
resume tips in there as well I forget
the name of that video agree or disagree
government jobs government jobs like
formal education on resume I agree there
are a lot of government agencies that
won't hire you at all if you don't have
a formal education should I learn Python
first or six months before starting web
development you should look into why you
would learn Python once there the roles
at it that is and if that's something
that you're interested in you should
dive deep into Python if you're looking
more for front-end web development
should dive deep into JavaScript it kind
of pens what you're your entry where
your interest lies I guess I should say
do I follow pro sports the only sport
that I follow is mixed martial arts um
yes VLSI did finish I did figure out
what I was missing the other day
so for those of you missed a live stream
the other day I briefly how I was trying
to something was I was feeling a bit off
and I I I ended up realizing that for
the first time in about three years I
didn't have necessarily the direction I
was trying to go with with myself as a
developer and that was it I had it
wasn't I had like free time it was that
mentally I wasn't
working towards a goal as a developer I
was working towards YouTube and building
projects for YouTube but as as an
individual focused on myself learning
outside of work I had I didn't have the
goal I was going to this last year was
get better with the backend learn as
many new skills as possible but now my
goal is to be more focused on as a
front-end developer and as no goals in
terms of me specifically for me I've
goals for YouTube I have goals of
salaries and houses but in terms of
working for a developer goal how I'm
going to get better as a developer and
what specific thing I'm going to do I
had been missing for me for about 6
weeks since I got this new job because
that was my goal and so am I kind of
have thought about Anna's like oh that
that's it and I that was what was thrown
me off so what I'm going to be what I'm
going to be doing moving forward is I'm
going to actually be learning angular
inside and out and I'm also specifically
diving deep in the JavaScript well I
mean by that is oftentimes you use 10%
of the language 90% of the time and I
want to learn JavaScript much more in
depth than I have then then I then I
have and like do you know console
there's other things other than
console.log that console does because
like I knew that but I couldn't actually
tell you what it does like what it they
are so these are things that I want to I
want to learn the I want to learn
JavaScript in a much more in-depth
professional level and sort of instead
of being a generalist I'm going to start
being a specialist in JavaScript and
angular specifically so that's going to
be my goal for the next six months to a
year at my my role for this next year
um let's see here
GSP yes GSP did very well thoughts on
you know CTO 17 I was very surprised
that it was an excellent card it was an
amazing card I was very surprised at all
three belts lost
I actually thought GSP was gonna lose I
kind of thought I just it's four years
without a fight and then you had the I'm
forgetting her name but the have a good
one David the the the young lady who
lost her belt who's gonna tie over Ronda
Rousey's record uh kind of sorry to see
ya Joana that was probably the most
surprising
um but yeah it was it was a great card
are you still going to build a web app
as a personal project uh I think you're
talking about the angular the angular
personal portfolio project is that what
you're talking about so it's a learning
Congrats only if you don't mind me your
contractor your current job do you
retain all copyright for any projects
you make on the side they wouldn't like
me talking about what my contract says
or doesn't say but I'm not worried about
them taking any of my projects yes so I
am still building that I actually
uploaded it I wanted to be out last week
but this cold has been holding me back a
little bit but yeah so I finished the
project I recorded and now I need to
refactor it I'll probably finish it this
weekend and release it for $5 nothing
crazy just five bucks a fun little
project if you want something to work on
the funniest
shirt I have seen probably I love PHP I
say some some salty dude went off on the
note verse PHP video the other day or
today in a common hope you're watching
no talk to companies you'd like to work
for one day
well I would say I would say that I want
to work for Google I I would say it's
kind of the same the same old same old
from a professional standpoint Google
Amazon Facebook from a personal
standpoint I would want to work for of a
coding platform of some sort that could
be a treehouse that could be a sort of
education base platform that could be a
let's see a treehouse a LinkedIn
learning a song I would you work a free
code camp if they offered a position
yeah but uh I don't think they they they
can because it's all open source and
I'll make any money but I would yeah
working for a coding boot camp has
always been a dream dream of mine
I'd love to to go and work at dev
Mountain or something like that so
salary or excitement of role uh it kind
of depends were you out in here in your
career but I would take salary and you
can always take salary and the salary
will let you get a higher salary for a
role that excites you six months later
that's how I kind of look at it much
cheaper than some YouTube courses yeah
it's just one project though Orange
that's why it's only five bucks so all
my courses are gonna be five dollars
unless I actually put like 20 hours of
content this is probably like four or
five hours
that's an crazy weight knowing Python a
bit helping newbie understand javascript
knowing any language a bit would help
you understand any other language have I
done any animation projects
I built a animation into the project
that just a little fade animation into
the project that I'll be releasing a lot
of times animation is are you talking
about just like web animations are
actual like After Effects animations why
do I put restrictions on videos please
that times make it available to all
countries I don't put restrictions on
any of the videos no and that's that's
some Google going on penny on deaf
slopes I'm not familiar with deaf slopes
did I ever film Postum strings pop
imposter syndrome when you were hired at
your current at your first job and how
did you overcome that this is something
that's pretty common but I know that I
did not for very long I you know what I
take that back cuz I could tell you that
I I really was worried that me not
having a CS degree was going to affect
my career and it still might down the
road right as I as I get passed up for
tech lead roles or architect roles or
anything like that as I've even though
years experience because that this just
naturally happens so but I could tell
you that after this last job jump it
went away for me for the most part
because I I had several offers on the
table like not just like oh well I'm
interviewing I had many interviews and I
had several hard offers contracts are
here just sign it and you got a job and
that was something that that
after kind of seen seeing that and
understanding how much work I've put in
understanding my value as an employee it
helped to eliminate that you know I
still think about going back to school
just because I always want to be
prepared but I could say for in terms of
imposter syndrome I don't I think that
was probably the nail in the coffin for
that for me was just sort of actually
seeing the real-world implications of
what my salary and what my my or what my
what my experience is actually worth and
it's worth something and that kind of
did it for me
would you have you ever worked on any
programming having to a blockchain
technology if one if you're being an RSS
ace what type of skills would one need
it depends there are there are
blockchain technology for a lot of
things but it is something that I will
be diving into in about six months after
I kind of feel this this JavaScript and
this angular knowledge that I want to I
plan on learning blockchain um and I
couldn't really tell you what to learn
but I do know that you can do a bunch of
different actually look at meetups man
I'm going to a theory 'im contract
meetup next week
so maybe check out meetups near you to
see if there's anything that you can
like do a fire occurs annoying yes but I
do appreciate them but I would say seven
out of ten are annoying but hey will you
be learning big oh no I have no plans to
learn any of these algorithms
I've talked about Big O done all that
Big O in college and no need to review
it
do I still live in Florida yes have I
tried
Gator burger sex / steak yet no but I am
a fan of alligator sausage which is
delicious if you guys ever try I was
like Gator burger / think that sounds
like something I should go check out
Achilles bloody do the algorithms help
you learn angular faster the algorithms
helped me get better at JavaScript they
also help me practice and prepare for
the white board interviews that I had
and they they made me just do better all
around remember when you got a haircut
that was really sure yeah that's my last
haircut man it's coming back baby
I still wear glasses yes I actually got
a new pair it's on its way do it anyone
else laugh when I said Gator sausage
something funny about Gator sausage man
yeah it's oh yeah so so I am trying to
overcome my cold so I apologize if I
don't seem super exciting ecstatic I'm
actually very happy I love doing these
live streams and in general and I
appreciate everyone watching and asking
so uh so you retired from code fights
come yes and no I have I have a
love-hate relationship with code fights
I have actually gone and done more
algorithms on there I've probably done
about ten in the last six weeks so not
very many but but the problem is that I
don't I can't upload videos on them so
you're not gonna see them anymore
because they they just don't no one
watches them that's the truth no matter
if I were to upload them I'd probably
upload them on a secondary Channel
all command line or some github desktop
I used to use a github desktop but now I
use command line so kind of I just bit
the bullet I wanted to get better and
and there was one hiccup where I
accidentally pushed straight to master
luckily it wasn't that big of a deal but
uh besides that it's been going pretty
well I'm gonna check out Mac's on cattle
mine to get deeper in gesso I'm gonna
check out a lot of things I imagine he
will be yeah do you think that code
fights could be a huge waste of time no
I think it's a great a great way to
practice I think it's a great way to
challenge yourself and get better and I
could tell you for a fact that it wasn't
a waste of my time just because I the
videos didn't do well I was using that
as practice for me to interview and I
consider the reason I was able to pass
these technical interviews and half
three offers on the table at one time
was because I studied and I practice and
I learned and I enjoyed doing it it's
just a different way of doing it for me
though right now it doesn't the reason
I'm not going to do it is one it's like
it's not going to work for me in terms
of putting on the channel and two it
doesn't really accomplish what I want to
do right now which is at that time it
was to prepare me for technical
interviews and to prepare me to solve
whiteboard problems and all that sort of
stuff
and now my goal is to learn JavaScript
more in depth and learn angular more in
depth and to me that means I'm going to
be doing courses going through
documentation and I'm also going to be
building projects so that's kind of
where I'm trying to to go and the doing
code fights to solve some mathematical
equation and stuff doesn't matter have I
seen the reddit thread where a junior
dev destroyed the production database
yeah we were talking about that today
actually at work it's pretty funny right
yeah yeah that's I mean it's funny for
us it probably wasn't fun very funny for
the company we're really good who's your
favorite death little Ben
I don't have one guys I don't actually
really listen to music all the music I
listen to is like trap music of from
anime and gaming that has been remakes
so for the next six months will be
focused on JavaScript and angular in
that and then probably blockchain yes
are you not too keen on learning es6 no
no I I i right
when I say JavaScript that includes es6
that includes yes 2017 and it will
include yes 2018 when that comes out
don't listen my Chemical Romance oh my
god we're going we're bringing it back
man just talking about bands from from
middle school My Chemical Romance what
else was there there was a simple plan
that's not the same really as My
Chemical Romance so that you nailed one
in a one in a million right there
when are you getting married what's
marriage green day green day green day
would be a good one blink-182 let's see
I I think I was listening to a lot of
Radiohead about that time Radiohead was
popping off you had sublime sublime was
oh my goodness you still hear sublime on
the radio sublime trying to think
any interesting web app you'd like to do
you have the to it besides the TV app I
have a dashboard app that I would like
to make where essentially it allows
users to build their own customizable
dashboard with all social medias in and
multiple other things where essentially
you have I just you add it's a
drag-and-drop dashboard for everything
Facebook Bitcoin prices weather time
stones and it's just a customizable
dashboard I've wanted to build this for
myself for a while I think it'd be a
pretty cool project it might be
something I build down the road yeah the
darkness anyone ever watched the
darkness yeah
we're bringing back the classics man you
guys are really gonna get me to show my
age today honestly Alex Adams I feel
like I feel like if you did code 72 do
app 70 different to do apps somebody
would give you a job a straight respect
I would if you had 70 to do apps in 70
different JavaScript frameworks you got
job
let's see trance the bands man why
Willie Tito I can't say miss Tito
all right enough about bad music from
the 90s actually not bad music most of
it was pretty good
I accept Creed oh my goodness I came
from a time when Creed existed what do
you do when you feel as if you've lost
your coding superpower you get some
sleep or you get more caffeine or you
take a break that's really it at the end
of the day oftentimes you can then if
you don't want to do any of those
unhealthy things to sleep things not not
too bad but if you want to go and start
work on something else often times when
I get stuck on a project I do algorithms
when I get stuck on an algorithm I go do
a project when I started started working
on on one thing and I just was pounding
my head it's not fun I'd actually just
pause the project and go work on a
different one
I do try you know when you say lost your
coding superpower where you're basically
talking about it's being frustrated and
losing now on the fun not enjoying it
anymore and when you find a way to not
when you start to not enjoy this stuff
that's really when you stop learning and
you need to make sure that you don't do
that right a lot of school is miserable
because because it they make it as
miserable as possible they really don't
care about delivering entertaining and
educational content infotainment if you
will and and and it was one those things
where for me is miserable but I would
say for as someone whose self teaching
they're so going the self-taught route
when you hit that sort of roadblock go
and learn something else in a different
format go read or blog go to a meet-up
you know watch some videos on YouTube
about subjects and just educate yourself
slightly differently and take a break do
I make any spicy music I am a spicy meme
alright I know this the spiciest memes I
get are the little conference if you if
you notice in the video if you guys have
been watching to the
into the videos I always have a little
10 to 15 second banter with April at the
end of the videos to be funny so that's
something new that I've been doing in my
in like last five or six videos I really
enjoy that it's kind of fun actually I
think of some video topics I have I
haven't done for next week I'm out of
videos I don't really have three or four
films this is cool
thank you Andrew how did I do in the
udacity oh I I did alright but I didn't
finish the course I stopped I took the
react course to learn react why I was
looking for jobs I got a job that used
angular for now angular 5 and I stopped
doing in a focus on angular I don't
really plan to go back no no real point
for me at this point in time but I would
recommend it I thought it was a very
good program I would feel confident
recommending it I'm trying to teach
myself I started out strong but I'm
having some motivation problems how do
you practice coding six hours a day
without losing motivation really just
depends on what you at least in my case
it depended on what my situation was I
had dropped down to school and was
working a job that I didn't want to work
much longer or or that was always going
to be a temporary job till I became a
developer and there was no turning back
for me I didn't like being broke and I
didn't like being hungry and even
working full-time I was and so that was
it for me would you train your cats use
the toilet I would this is something
April and I have talked about before I
know they're there I know there are
training like kids for you to help train
your cats and we've thought about it
which never got around to it is buying a
bidet worth the money I've never used a
bidet
I would like
to see I have my doubts that it works
yeah agree or disagree getting your
first step job is the hardest agree it's
not impossible but of all the dev jobs
you're going to get most likely going to
be the hardest used to watch you in the
summer coding almost 24/7 a trying oh
yeah so when I say master JavaScript and
angular I don't point I don't mean that
I'm going to learn everything and then
I'm gonna be the og I'm really more so
referring to I'm going to spend time to
devote energy to dive into it did not
being mentioned in Eric's top-five best
YouTube channels to learn code online
piss you off know Eric's entitled to his
opinion and I put him on my list I don't
think he was just he sent me he sent me
a funny email the other day anyhow and
he didn't give me a shout-out in the
beginning of it I know have you bombed
any face-to-face coding job interviews
not face to face but I have bombed phone
to webcam interviews and those are just
as awkward I assure you where you're
like should I actually just unplug
my computer and not pit and not call
them back I've literally sat there and
be like I'm tanking this and I know
without nervous I am and how
everything's going I'm just don't
understand this problem maybe I should
just unplug the computer like save us
both an hour but yeah I haven't tanked
any in-person technical interviews a lot
of times the in-person ones are pretty
realistic because they don't want that
to happen as much
would you like to create your own
programming language maybe as a hobby
like just a fun one nothing serious I'm
not qualified to create a language I
wouldn't even know how to without
looking it up it's a lot of work other
sounds of it but maybe if I just wanted
to make a fun one we could uh we could
make a new language called code God just
something to have a little fun I think
it becomes caffeinated hot chocolate
where do companies come up with these
numbers four years of experience just
saw one says seven plus years HTML CSS 3
plus SQL five plus a Java Script that is
just HR that's all that's really all it
is
HR out in my opinion I I can't say it
some people disagree you know there are
certain roles that require a more
experience than the other in certain
parts of that but in my opinion most of
the time HR is just coming up with
have I heard I've launched the launch
code organization that helps developers
develop themselves so that's a very nice
way of have I heard of the launch code
organization that gets people unpaid
internships helps developers develop
themselves so launch code as far as I
understand helps developers or aspiring
developers get unpaid internships and
they have a decently higher rate of
getting hired by said unpaid internships
now I I'm I would say an organization
that specializes in that it's much
better than taking an unpaid internship
on your own so that's that's one thing I
I know that the organizations they work
with pay not pay but they're a lot of
the organizations they work with our
legit companies here you know you're
talking about like Microsoft you're
talking about LinkedIn just very large
guy so it is something that I'm very
interested in and I see them on LinkedIn
I saw I became aware of them when I was
looking for work I look for a new job oh
yeah yeah so for sharing for staying
there Aang one of the things that I say
is a lot of these job descriptions are
looking for people who already have jobs
that's why recruiters still employees
away all the time because the person
that they want to hire the guy who has
seven years html/css experience three
years the sequal experience five years
of JavaScript experience that's a senior
dev that already has a job so often
times that's why you do get paid more
because you're leaving one job for
another that's just gonna pay you more
uh you describe yourself as a nerd
before have you ever had any major
social anxiety I'm not quite sure what
you would define this major but yeah so
I oftentimes have trouble introducing
myself in talking to people who are
strangers and when I shouldn't yes I you
know it it's not as bad as they used to
be but yes hey shout out to our homie
Gabriel from Brazil how'd you get the
job in the U in the US someday hey I
hope to get a job in in Brazil one day
so what would you say the role of a
senior developer is anyways like what's
the separation so the question is what's
the difference between a junior
developer
a senior developer and there's a couple
things right so so when it comes to what
my aunt and this will vary by job
category but I think this is this is a
general summation a junior developer
someone still so there's two things
first years of experience now I've
recently had a conversation with a
co-worker Ange said three plus years
your senior developer I was always I
always believed is five plus years
that's just my personal opinion
so so uh but there's a year aspect that
goes along with it
so the junior I always believe two years
and under is the junior developer and
then up is mid at two to four is made
five plus is senior senior the developer
artist I was talking with said one year
junior two year mid three plus senior so
there's a year sort of association with
it now there's also a a what your job
entails skillset so as a junior
developer you're you're sort of expected
to continue your education your your
your your work in progress right like
like you have potential that you are
working towards if you were dating this
is a fixer-upper that's the that's the
junior developer the junior developer is
doing a lot of the same things as the
senior developer doing just not as well
they're also maybe not they're they're
writing their own applications and but
in terms of architecting things that
they are limited as for the senior
developer comes in senior developer now
you may have things like tech leads and
you may have things like architects who
are really in charge of sort of passing
their vision down to the junior
developer who has less of a say in in
those things and a senior developers
role is also to nurture and help the
junior developers when they they need to
and that I mean that's really it in my
eyes is the the senior developer is just
a more established individual who has
more input and architecture how things
are done and the role is partly to help
the junior developers again that varies
by organization as well as your years of
experience gyrate go Casa no would it be
unethical for a straight dude to get to
get married to work in the u.s. the
question is to get to have a gay
marriage but I think the quote the real
question is it's not any more unethical
for someone to get married a fake
marriage is a fake marriage regardless
of gender and so yes regardless of
sexual orientation would you do any
certification so your company paid for
it I would do it yeah I'd go back to
schools they pay for it kind of like a
chair and an assistant professor that
that's somewhat more so yes we
recommend any books no I'm not a
believer in books
I'm believer in video tutorials specific
programs or parcels y'all be enjoy most
I don't normally like talking about my
workplace because most workplaces don't
enjoy but I will say that every Friday
for two hours we get to we have a
hackathon of which we can build anything
we want so that was something that I
really that I really like about my
current role is the hackathon time as
well as the demo time to demo our code
to our other teammates who we don't see
as much right so I really work with to
two or three developers and in total
there's about 25 or 30 developers and
growing and so it gives us a chance to
demo our stuff I've not seen the new
VeggieTales I've not seen the old
VeggieTales but those are the some of
the the program so I really enjoy I have
my current work to I talk to my cats
like I talked to a human do you use a
special cat voice it kind of pens sorry
guys um let's let's wrap up tonight's
live stream for those of you who are new
I like to end and my live stream so the
with a final thought something to put a
nail in the coffin and sort of steal a
little bit of oh I'm not gonna over
steal a little bit of Jerry Springer's
glory so um thank you to the 28,000 of
you who are here before thank you to the
1000 new subscribers we do these every
thousand subscribers and
today we'll talk about sort of finding
your way as a developer because that's
now something I talked about in a live
stream recently about something missing
in my life and really I didn't have a
direction to go I didn't have a
direction to go as a developer recently
and it was only three weeks before I
realized how strange it was and what was
missing so regardless of where you're at
in your in your career I really
encourage you guys to have something
that you're trying to accomplish right
and for me right now it's I want to get
better at JavaScript as as my language
of choice right I want to actually learn
something in-depth for once I never
really feel like I've I've learned
anything any sort of anything in
software in-depth it's always been had a
working professional level for at a
junior at a junior level I can do my job
I can do it just fine but I want to
learn things in detail and I said I
really need to know that it works but I
want to learn everything that I can
about JavaScript and annually that's my
current goal before that it was to study
and practice and learn you know back in
databases build projects so whatever
you're doing in in your life whatever
wherever you're at in your career when
you accomplish one goal try and think
about what your next one is that for me
I was feeling a little strange because I
didn't have one I realized like I had
other goals that were related to my life
but I have a goal that was related to me
as a developer in my career right where
I wanted to go how I was gonna get
better I was going to continue to strive
and and I'm excited to see how good I
can become or how less bad is probably a
better way about it
I can refactor my knowledge of
JavaScript right so I hope that you guys
are setting goals for your learning path
hope that you're setting goals for your
career path
path and I hope that you continue to
come back to these every thousand and
look forward to the video so thank you
so much for watching us I appreciate you
all it's it's been a pleasure as it
always is and I hope that you guys are
coding and I hope that you are doing
everything because it's hard and I have
something I have I've probably around
700 videos on my channel and almost
anybody can become a developer it's hard
and not in one video way every time see
me say it's easy but it is something
that you can do and it does take
dedication it does take commitment does
take hard work but it's all worth it in
the end
if this is something you enjoy doing you
just gotta stick with it so thank you so
much and I'll do my best to try and keep
you guys entertained informed and
educated as much as I can see you next
