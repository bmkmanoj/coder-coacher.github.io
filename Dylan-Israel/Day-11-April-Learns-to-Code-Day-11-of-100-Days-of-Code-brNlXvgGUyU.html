poof
you
tomorrow don't know all right
cool oh so let's get to getting going
here manage some videos here how's
everybody doing today
Arif
notification Squad is here Jordan yeah
so we're gonna be hanging out for a
little bit April is uh inna welcome
welcome April is out and about so I am
she'll be here in like 30 minutes 20
minutes something like that so I'm just
gonna work on so stuff where we get
going here we'll still do our full hour
don't worry I just figured uh I figured
we could uh hang out for a second just
that the two of us just the two of us we
could make it if we trap just the two of
us you and I just the two of us all
right so what Dan what's this eighteen
minute video I recorded here so I'm
going to make thumbnails and stuff just
work on this stuff white you guys answer
questions you're asked questions put
this in so you guys look at the feedback
also my finger is still injured but it's
getting better and so now I have I'm
ready to get back into the daily uploads
so what video was this let's see what we
it was hey guys hey we have a little bit
of story time if you will and I guess if
I had to say without sounding too
dramatic what the kind of overall
message for this story is is fighting
for what your work
how was this no your worth as a
developer any plans to interview anyone
in in is what's is
please this is going to be episode 43
right oh information security uh I would
love to but there's not - I haven't been
able to find anybody yeah if you find me
somebody or you know somebody I would
love to because that's something I don't
know - no they Allah Islamic state yeah
to interview somebody in Isis coming up
so you this is for you three
I wish I knew someone to man all right
so this will come out tomorrow any
videos on controlling access on a REST
API are you talking about on like having
authentication in a restful api
what's my email again it is right here
sir and chat therefore you
controlling accesses to the data um yeah
I mean that that's all that's more
authentication than anything else I
think is what you're getting at um so
you're saying you don't want anyone just
to be able to use the URL and they have
to have credentials that would be
something like you'd probably need to
look into like how I do it right now is
you need a passport js4 it to work
otherwise you don't get a message back
you just get air saying your credentials
are invalid at least in my project so
once I have that fully up that'd
probably be pretty helpful for you um
all right where was I developer log
programmer brushings I'm a little split
here let's see here suggest maybe
this is a good video it's 18 minutes
long I encourage you guys to throw it up
into the background and and just enjoy
it
it's a it's a true story about a
negative experience that I even though
times were hard I stuck through and did
my best to survive but it's about it's
about a negative experience and about
knowing your worth as a developer and as
a person at the end of the day
everything I talk about will be really
back to being a developer but some of it
goes hand in hand with being a good
person so I think you guys will like it
along this is tomorrow's video we got a
lot of good stuff coming out I've been
stockpiling videos and I'm getting
around to actually getting around to to
actually uploading them I was I took
about five six days off because my hand
and I feel good enough now that I think
I could play games so I wanted to or go
back into what I'm trying to do so
developer coding I own to development of
the Sun that's probably good
I'm cool so let's go and publish this
tomorrow that's tomorrow's video and we
gotta do some we also have to do a am i
hitting the gym when my finger so so
like I don't know if you can tell but I
actually still have an open wound on my
fingers more of a scab though that
hasn't fully healed yeah I don't know if
you can see that but it's still pretty
nasty right my wrist where they took the
skin yeah you can kind of see the scar
on there but that's pretty much healed
the finger not so much so because a lot
of the a lot of the exercises upper body
shoulders they're very hand intensive
I'm not around I'm not lifting
anything until my hand is completely
healed and then your boy is going to
become Kona toriel's 720 because he's
going to get yoked alright but
yeah I find I hit in the gym pretty soon
I got a home gym as well and I have a
gym membership but when the cool thing
about my work is to pay for my gym
membership so I definitely I'm doing my
best to take advantage of that squatting
lunges yeah I know I got to do the
squats and lunges I'll probably actually
go on a full diet and a full full
workout plan like it's better for me
anyhow it's been my experience if I have
a list of things that I know I need to
accomplish at the gym I just go it's
kinda leg them off until I'm done and
then I'm good to go you got a big dev
interview on Monday nervous as hell
hey good man it's okay to be nervous I'm
nervous every day at work
it took me even after getting hired it
took me probably about four months um it
took me about four months to uh to not
feel like I was gonna get fired any
moment even sometimes now man it's still
stressful
it's been a stressful week guys I'm not
gonna lie to you man it's been it's been
a stressful week so but uh it's getting
better
I'm excited too today I'm talking with
my graphic designer for some of you guys
who have been here but hear me talk
about my coding box that I'm creating
and my and my um what's your focus at
work everything man QA front-end
back-end database UI UX more small team
so we got do everything mainly the front
end and right now I'm doing a lot of
architecture so you do a little bit of
everything right now
so this is 43 all right let's see I know
April sent me some pictures
there yeah is your boy up in the
hospital bed is now my is now my active
doesn't that seem like a lot to
go get your finger cut like I was like
yo man I know I was gonna get all hooked
up to an IV and drugged up there what
not good for April little man she was
there with me that was nice of her
um okay cool so we got that let's go
ahead and edit our thumbnail real quick
and we'll go ahead and delete this one
that was today's video I hope you guys
watch today's video by the way
when I do my hand I injured it and then
I injured it opening a jar um the job
would mainly be wordpress I've worked
with WordPress but I've been focus on
j/s and reacting on PHP oh that's going
to be a hard job tool and then but the
good thing for you Big Bang Theory is
that I think you should take the job
while still looking for other work
elsewhere in JavaScript and react
because I think you'll see a giant
increase in your pay because of it
but WordPress isn't bad when you're just
getting started the problem is is it's
not that great after the fact all right
so this is episode 43
I don't like green what's a good color
guys will do ray
here we go I'll go ahead and change the
size of this down to about two 225
yeah
nice logo thank you good luck on your on
your interview though down with
WordPress my advice is don't get stuck
in the WordPress realm that's one thing
I would say I'm designing multi tend
didn't happen I want to be able to
restrict access for a key to only that
clients a key to only that clients data
it still sounds like authorization and
where maybe you need to check some sort
of pass or some ID make sure that it's
the correct one some UUID sort of thing
was I doing here all pictures the
pictures the pictures here's a question
for you guys that was once you ask a
dead videos do any of you find it like I
I think it's kind of funny that none of
my pictures have anything to do with
what's going on here like like this
right if the video is about knowing your
work as a developer I don't know is this
I does this bother people or like that I
I'm trying to have fun with this
I guess this what I'm trying to say
does that I think it's important for us
to have fun while we're doing this man
oh my monitors been bugging out a little
bit lately
no one has have an opinion on this
it was like not man doing you're doing a
great job don't sweat it
I look so torn up there it's funny
though
so fab gets it it's about being a little
different but at the end of the day man
I may not be the best developer in the
world I don't think I'm bad but I I
think what you're coming to the channel
for is a honest perspective and a unique
perspective and that's what I hope you
get from my channel and like what's so
great about videos like these is I could
talk about this simple programmer could
talk about it Chris Hawkes or talk about
it and I truly feel that if you
i dama is this episode 43 or so 42 I
truly feel like you get a unique
perspective from these things from
everybody who from everyone's oh and and
some could be the same but insight based
off different generational differences
right how is that relevant to the video
not at all
uh I'm in the video oh my monitors are
gonna this the thick I mean not
at all man um not at all
other than it's me telling you a good
job just right so noodles so your happy
camper all right so look at the playlist
ask a dev hands
you find it
41 so okay so this would be episode 42
that's also like I try to relate stuff
that's happened in my life back to you
guys that is software really and this
story which is 19 minutes there's pretty
long video for me to ramble on it's
really it's there's two parts to it and
it travels over a two-year span it's the
same guy and okay up you enjoyment I
always try to just give you the truth as
it is cuz I wish sometimes somebody
would get done that for me
I cool so tomorrow's videos up I wonder
hey I'm hoping April will be here soon I
don't think it'd be longer than 30
minutes from when I started no work
emails I don't want to look at him I
don't even want to look at him boys
they're good they upset me I don't know
what the hell I'm doing but that's okay
Coney channels I want to say I don't
know what I'm doing I just tell you
about my life I may not have it all
figured out
that's for sure I think I think what
happens it is a lot of these coding
channels even the junior developers I
consider myself a junior developer they
try to put on this persona as that they
have it all figured out and that they
know what the they're talking about
and that that I don't know I feel like
you should just be honest like I have no
problem thing that I don't know uh but I
can give you you know maybe I can relate
related to something or I could tell you
what I would do in that situation I
don't see what this video is about I
think this is the video where I talk
about what I do every day
hey Daniel Harris is I'm new to your
channel like what I've been saying a
thank you Matt um I hope you're just not
saying that because we have a real live
grill on here for the next 90 89 days uh
by the way guys we we may have a very
cringy thing coming out on this channel
it's either going to come out really
good or super cringy so I apologize
we're going to test a little bit of
persona comedy we're gonna have some fun
it's either going to fail horribly or
it's going to be epic um if you're a fan
of boogie 92 or nine eight nine eight or
I forget what boogie way for fan of
boogie and his Francis skits uh you're
uh you're gonna like it
I think cuz that's what that's what it's
inspired by Miley life gone sexual in
the hood almost died yeah just the super
clickbait um but yeah so the Francis
videos are going to come I don't wanna
say they're going to directly correlate
but that's what's going to have inspired
it
so think Francis but with coding and
life that's that's that's as much as I'm
gonna get into that but I'm working out
the skit ah Lane like I said it's either
gonna come out super cringy or or really
funny and I'll probably give it three
sketches before I give it give it a give
it a rest if it doesn't do very well um
Daniel a thank you again some fun
functions has video and perseverance
summed it up you have to be able to keep
at if you have no clue what to do a
shout out to bizarre blast from New
Zealand half my audience is out of the
state so that's always nice what do you
think we should title this video
a crown Z yeah I hope the best for
boogie it sounds like he's still way off
from his surgery um I watch uh I just
recently starting like I've watched
boogies videos for a while but I just
recently subscribed and now I've been
watching pretty much every video that
comes out um except his latest so I know
I know weight loss has been on his mind
pretty adamantly as it should be
what would you title a video that I talk
about my daily tasks as a developer a
day as a developer developers daily what
what a developer does every day at work
that sounds good ask a deaf episode 43
this is a why this this video a the
developers daily decisions should I be a
developer should I go into project
management is this a daily decision this
project manager guys look like they got
it easy
um yeah no I so we'll schedule this one
for Sunday
uh yeah man I'll give you like that's
right a few daily life as a developer
huh I know what developer does everyday
daily life of a developer that sounds
more like a serious name like behind the
code or something like that
I use phpstorm at work and I use atom or
no excuse me now you use Visual Basic at
home Visual Studio code rather
have I ever thought of doing a day in
the life of a dev vlog I have um I am
going to ask my current work if I can
record the office to do an office tour
Kranti send me I use phpstorm
uhm webstorm is probably just as good uh
but yeah yeah yes email me your project
or a link to your project I'll take a
look at it and I give you my two cents
but I have thought about doing a daily
vlog um the part that the hard part
about that though is I have to get the
okay from my work that hey it's okay for
me to come in and film and showcase the
office what I do where I work what my
daily tasks is their site where you can
search for a specific API hmm not that
I'm aware of that's not a bad idea I
think there's just too many I'd like a
good Google devs do does and done daily
does do don'ts it's got the don'ts a lot
more doubts and dues don't break the
code don't shut down our site don't
accidentally do I'll do things Oh
so ask dev episode 43 what what does
does daily what is the average day as a
developer
typical day I think we can do better
than this title average day as a
developer that smells better average day
as a developer I like that better
um this is a good video also developer
see you
so this is coming out on Sunday
and now we have to go get another photo
publish on
Oh Isis's
average is a developer that's a good one
that's a good title alright so let's go
ahead and pull up face blue just trying
to add me
all right date of his sure by the way
guys if you haven't already and you want
to be cool you should join the Facebook
er codec and cafe the link is in the
description below
we have believe it now we have 1600
members and we're growing by like 300 a
week which is pretty solid
so we're growing pretty fast so I hope
you guys join that anyhow back to my
photos
[Laughter]
the degenerate Dylan I like a
alright
degenerate Dylan strikes again
this is the sixish a creeper there
as a developer would you say it's better
look at API is always versus creating
what you need it depends on the
situation at hand so I recently have
devised an application that would have
to make 12 API calls oh so a plug I've
devised a plug-in at my work that would
have to make 12 API calls and the
problem with that is I think I
 the number up again no no right
now the problem with that is depending
on the API you may have to pay for that
so if you have to pay another company to
deal with data you have to weigh the
cost benefit of it versus how much time
is it going to take for you to set it up
so you say ok well it would take one
developer six months to build out an API
of that magnitude okay what's that cost
us well depending on the developer it
would take and let's say everything's
equal to actually build the exact same
application let's just say it costs them
50,000 developer makes 100 grand a year
it's a senior developer and if you just
use another API you might cost you a
thousand dollars in API calls so it
depends on the situation but typically
on smaller things there's no reason to
use an external API it just it just
depends on what it is you're trying to
get done and how often it's going to be
used and how much money it's going to
cost am I gonna post my code for the
rest laughs yeah yeah man I'm not there
yet though I haven't been coding for the
last three or four weeks coz of my
finger
is there an Emmett like thing for this
Oh No hey baby I'm watching I'm ready
for you when you are I said I started
live-streaming early we're able to get
your phone yeah yeah you saying my show
it off to everybody you know humble
person just got the most expensive phone
on the market yeah all right well when
you're ready we'll get started okay
thank you baby
why do you keep doing that by the way I
think every time you use my car you use
all the gas uh she got a Samsung what
what you end up getting baby
okay yeah she got the Galaxy s8 not the
s88 plus though because she decided that
she didn't want to spend all my money so
early well what do you think should
happen when you run out of money baby
all right what do we call this average
day for what's a typical typical day for
a bell okay
all right so let's go ahead and change
this text to white like that better
and then we'll change the stroke to this
that's good
you don't like the blue and the white I
think the blue and the white puffs out a
little bit I like it
all right before you see all right see
that all right let's go ahead and add
that thumbnail here you guys don't see
all this hard work on a daily basis from
the grind of being a coding youtuber
dand right ya know
just retracted my statement yeah as long
as you as long as you have stated an
official public apology we'll let it
slide yeah you got to add the border
almost any color will get stuck
blue and green does that mean more
people will subscribe if I start using
blue and green right
oh man this is a good video here I
I'll let this play out for a minute you
got I'm gonna give you guys a teaser of
what's to come three days from now some
of you may be too young today we're
gonna have a little bit of a fun video
where the first part of the video we're
going to be talking about getting
started in life and what I mean by that
is I didn't really get serious about
life until I was probably about 25 I'm
29 now my career is on the right path I
I'm making all right money and things
are looking positive for the future and
I reflect back and I think to myself man
I wish that what I was doing when I was
18 that I was on the right path right
and that's part of why I like doing
these videos as well is to talk about
what I've learned along you know the
journey of life right it's always easy
easy to say I wish I knew this and I
wish I did that you know I wish I
started investing when I was 18 I have
so much save I wish I saved money and
didn't spend it at the strip club or
whatever you guys do with your money
right and it's easy to say that and you
really just have to take
the person you are today is only because
you were that person before then so it's
like yeah I may feel that up until 25 I
wasn't necessarily making the best
choices or I wasn't you know I was more
interested in maybe dating then I was in
you know having a career or taking
school seriously or being productive
investing money whatever it may be those
things that are important to me now
we're always important to me I wasn't
always a developer and I wasn't always
coding every weekend and working on my
technical skills and things like that
and you know I wish all man I was tough
YouTube so that's the very the intro to
a very fun segment that I called and
some of you I guess I have to even
preferences this how old I am
at 29 years old I'm given to that age
where if you're like one of the younger
viewers and you're like 13 14 15 you may
not even know what myspace is and that's
okay but before for the for the young
ones in here welcome and secondly what
myspace is is it is essentially a
bootleg huh did I know
I've been um so yeah that's the
introduction guys to a very fun video
that's coming in the near future
there's no I hear that we do this one
alright
all right so it is 42 minutes in so we
gotta go for an hour and 42 or so all
right let me change the title real quick
um so what have you worked on today
notes what do you mean by that elaborate
for everybody just been going through
our ijs tutorials that we've been doing
art I'm not tutorials but cheering okay
I can change so I have you were you able
to figure out your paragraph there okay
let's start there
I want start there yeah no yeah come on
so hop in your thing and send me the
link and we're gonna look at that real
quick
it's Sunbury singing it's part of the
process everybody understands when
ain't working properly
yeah of is Ollie like this stupid I
don't have any Android development
videos although I'd like to if your boy
was ever working full-time and Android
development I her full-time for himself
Android development would be something
I'd be studying
Irish
so April's been having an issue where
the paragraph text isn't showing up and
I've given her about two days to solve
it on her own and now we are going to
dive into it together and so she's going
to send that and we're going to go from
there so you can set on Facebook
slide that time for that ask your drugs
here how can we still have two pages
we're Dylan Israel so after you frakkin
right yeah well I got one for you I'm
going for the side shape yeah alright uh
alright cool so yes
cool okay so I can tell you what's wrong
with it just by looking at it
so the problem that's going on here is
you have a paragraph tag that's being
nested in incorrectly to start ceases P
tag let's go before the text I did that
to you that's all right so that's first
thing the second thing is you have this
body tag that doesn't need to be here
yeah I did after I was trying to figure
something out
next I want to see if it's been
the suits being hidden so that's what's
happening here
so because you didn't throw this
paragraph into a displaying but it's
hidden behind the header so because you
didn't throw the paragraph into a div or
anything you said not to overdo it with
the divs there is a difference between
overdoing things with distant just not
using them um so in this case let's go
ahead and we'll have everything back up
and running right we don't need two div
we don't want it what we need to do
whoopsies
oh what was calling it out cyclones
out so we need to do here let's run it
it'll be back to where it was that right
- the divs that we put in here I'm
fixing it one second all right that
better that's what it was right so what
you have to do because this is because
this is absolutely that's fixed and
everything you can instead just go ahead
and add some margin - bottom
oh let's try 20 pixels to start I will
right
good pad in my game this mistakenly
might be cutting spot on we'll do 200
pixels save and run I was good padding
margin cuz I think yes so I had it right
you know what she does at a very
professional portfolio pic doesn't she I
was saying the same thing I tried to
find my most professional one actually
had a professional photographer take
that for me as it was a friend so it was
free some huh so what I'm trying to do
is I'm trying to push everything away
from it there would you not want to do
it in that we could do it in the para we
could oh I see we have margin:0
that's might be interacting so
margin-top and we'll say - 50px
I'd in and out come from was it in and
out yeah David's talking about it he's
probably having lunch right now it's
lunchtime over there it's about 2:30
yeah so what you can do is this is
you're seeing my weakness with CSS right
now is you can target this new passive
style so style is equal to margin or
padding will do padding - top of 40px
it's got to run that and now it
shouldn't be oh my god more yeah she's
going to be moving up this is the last
project fab that she's doing on code pen
but she's going to be moving over so you
can see I there now we have 100 px and
then on here a margin put that back to
zero save and run
and then instead 100px will throw back
250px cool so what was hiding it was
your menu now say for some reason you
wanted to go over there's this thing
called z-index which basically you can
start putting layers on top of things
what I was trying to sow it's called
z-index if you want this to go on top of
here yeah but I want things to do that
below yeah all right cool
so uh you understand where your shoes
were mm-hmm
hi nice let's jump back into JavaScript
Milo I was taking full advantage of the
hundred days of code baby okay so what
we're going to be talking about now are
known as while loops what that basically
means is run this while the statement is
still true run until it's false which
can lead you into infinite loops if
you're not careful and what happens is
the infinite loop is it never breaks and
then your browser crashes and sounds
like something from Futurama yeah except
it happens all the time
I big bike I know I know you like to rub
your dirty head on daddy's itchy finger
all right so we're gonna create an array
here and you'll slip little bit at the
example here before I say too much more
so we the law loop in this case is
saying while I is less than five go
ahead and add go ahead and add I to my
array and then iterate I so when I is
five it's no longer going to run right
because it's no longer a true statement
now where people might do an infinite
loop is they forget to add the AH to the
I and thus it I is always less than five
thus it always runs all right so here
we're going to create a while loop and
what we want to do is instead of
actually putting in 0 to 4 because let's
say it's not just before it's to 10,000
we'll have a while loop don't say well
we'll create a variable of far I is
equal to 0 I typically what this is
saying why it's I and not like any other
number is it's the iterator that's where
the I comes from hmm so this item you're
iterating on the number you're iterating
that's where I comes from a lot of these
so we're saying while I is less than 5
and this could be any same it doesn't
have to be a number like this we want to
take my array and we want to push the
value onto it now
do you remember what push does when
talking about arrays
yes adds to the end of the array
greetings from the Philippines a you
know engineer cheering to meet up in the
Philippines so basically making a
counter this is what we're doing right
now yeah we're adding is accounting now
if we were to run this and we didn't put
our I plus plus it would do it
indefinitely but we don't want to do
that and crash the free code camp
browser instead we're running so now our
array is from Suzhou no let's not crash
it
you'll crash it plenty on your own when
you're doing this we don't need to do it
around here so um that was a wall loop
while that statement is true running now
there's things called for loop or say we
won't say we know how many times we
wanted to run or we wanted to run in a
non-traditional manner
yeah you easy he's liking the team
all right so the four loops are it
breaks for loop start with three things
maybe this is called the initial initial
ization you're basically setting your
variable here that you're going to
iterate with the next is the condition
which is this is what's going to break
the for loop and the next is for each
iteration how much does that value go up
by one here right
all right so that same statement here is
doing the exact same as Oahu
now you'll use for loops significantly
more than a lot typically so are useful
for loop to push a trace I'll use one
through five onto my right so how would
we change this if we wanted to only have
the values myarray using a for loop so
we have our for loop there's a couple
different ways we can do this but if
it's starting with one you would think
we'd start our variable at one right or
do we do we start at zero you can do
anything with code but in this case I'd
started with one because because there's
no reason to make it more complex so pay
attention you know came in the
desk I'll throw my ladder you're not
gonna pay attention everybody you can
lane daddy slap out of Mama's attention
span she doesn't go near there hmm all
right so um so we're saying while I
while the number that we're iterating on
while the current iteration is less than
five continue this but we want five to
be included so there's two things we do
do less than six we do less than or
equal to five doesn't really matter in
this case whichever one you want and
then go ahead and increase it by one so
the array that we're going to have when
we push to it is going to be one three
four five less or equal to five be more
accurate and less than six less than or
equal to five would it be more accurate
yeah no it's the same thing
not really yeah because if it's eat if
it's less than five it's only going to
go up to four Celeste if it's equal or
less than five I'm saying less than five
goes up to four less than or equal to
goes up to five right less than six goes
up to five as well oh yeah exactly so
doesn't run if your question is is there
a preferred way of doing it uh yeah
that's your answer I don't think I don't
think it is nice so here we're going to
push to my array right we're going to
add these values which is going to be
one two three four and five and now we
have all the values in the river my
array is not a function it is not your
right push
cool so you don't have to iterate by
ones like we have been doing now
traditionally speaking you probably are
but that doesn't mean that you always
will so you saw you're iterating one at
a time that's only because we set how we
were going to define them you know what
they call the final expression which to
be honest I don't even know what the
hell it was called tell me there go
so here what this one is doing is we're
starting at zero we're saying one zero
is less than 10 and then we're saying at
the end go ahead and set remember what
plus equals means
I really remember but I can't state it
you don't
i plus equals two means ah itself plus
the number two so the value of I is
equal to I plus 2 special plus equals
means it's the value that you're setting
that value and same thing with the minus
and the multiplication in the division
I'm gonna make yourself a coffee or take
5-hour energy cuz I'm gonna get
frustrated with you like this during our
tutoring session I'll be honest with you
I'd rather have you go make a coffee and
take a 5-hour energy I'll split it with
you if you want but you need to wake up
this is serious stuff I know that I
don't know why you want to do it I'm
tired it's almost 6:00
you do it tonight every don't do it hey
so do you do it why don't we go slow
5-hour energy it's Julie you know it's
all right it'll only be 2.5 hours that
would be like a a thaw this alright
can you turn AC on if you're turning
that off is it Keisha cool and I got a a
mile on me I got a mile Oh I got a mile
Oh I'll mr. Milo
that's my water poor April is for me
making sure she she focus as much as the
11-year old girl I used to tutor all
right so all right so in this case
what's going on with this for loop is
it's actually adding even numbers and we
can see this because we start at 0 and
then we're adding two so it's going to
go if we were to add it to the array it
would be 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 is what stop at
10 because of the oh yeah so we want to
do the same thing for odd numbers we're
gonna go one through nine so if we want
to go one through nine what would we set
our iterator at our starting iterator 1
through 9
yeah one good yeah what is our lesson 9
that's what you're saying no it's gonna
be 1 3
so what are we said in highest good and
pulseless or what are we saying
2
all right um so no it's plus two because
remember we only want to do odds if we
were increasing by one you go one two
yeah or if it's up by two it's one three
five yeah - so it's - it's two plus plus
equals - okay and then we're going to
what - the array sorry Jason we're gonna
push to the array what 11-year old uh I
used to tutor at eleven year old uh when
I was in school and I really needed some
money it was good money I got paid fifty
dollars an hour hour and a half twice a
week so you know hundred fifty bucks a
week when you're barely paying the bills
barely eaten I used to drive like an
hour out of my way to go do it - we
needed the money though that's for sure
hmmm alright so we can actually set it
up to count backwards as well cool
what is your fault engaging no you don't
know what you're doing you're not
engaging look I so in the example here
we have our array and we're starting off
by setting I is greater than or is equal
to 10 and we're saying I is greater than
zero so while I remember this is we're
evaluating this to be true and we're
saying while I is greater than zero
continue on and then we are decrementing
by two by two each iteration so what
would what would our array here return
when this for loop is complete so we're
starting at ten mmm so what would our
array look like because we're going
backwards would - oh ten nine
no biasing by two by two
so okay so it's evens counting down so
that's ten eight six four two zero no
zero because we can't push 0 into 0 is
not greater than zero
alright so now this is the same thing
except we want to do frauds so how are
we setting up our for loop we want to
get nine seven five three one so what
are we going to set I
9 good job cuz now we're doing odds now
yeah alright so I is equal to 9 and what
Y is greater than 0 I is equal minus
equals 2 and so then we push to the area
really the point of this is showing you
that you can go by as many numbers as
you want you can go up or you can go
down ok how would you use something like
this one say you wanted to auto load the
buttons into your calculator by running
a for loop so good 1 through 9 left foot
in there say you had something that
needed to count to ten thousand you
needed to run one line of code ten
thousand times or hundred times um why
would you need to run a line of code ten
thousand dollars because you're
filtering something in your JSON object
what would you filter say the date was
in the correct form in correct format
and it was not compatible because I
started as a string and not a date
object so you would write a for loop
that will convert that single line every
time it existed or you wanted to add a
number you could but use a for loop for
much a lot of other things so let's take
let's take our calculator for instance
the way that it's going to run through
each of those indexes that it's joining
the numbers right so we're doing 1 plus
1 plus 4 times 3 minus 5 times 8 the way
that it's going to do that is we're
going to keep track of total in a for
loop and we're going to run for the
length of that array remember the dot
length property so in this case it bi is
less than our calculation array dot
length and then for each iteration we
want to just add those values together
or run those calculations
so you use it use for loops all the time
so remember our functions we write
function so that we can repeat them we
write for loops so that we can call them
as much as we need sometimes or we can
run little bits of code almost like mini
functions again and get it again without
calling it well you have to call you
have to somewhere your for loop a skate
call ya bit but it many times that it's
gonna loop you don't need to call it
those yeah you don't need to like call
the function four times you just have to
set it in the for loop that you're
running it four times
okay you ready done to start a reality
TV show called Oh April make a portfolio
guy can you imagine if a hundred days in
we're just like super super I'm
ready I'm ready
relax I'm ready to go out on the
reality TV show bring the crazy I just
could imagine like all of a sudden like
the the nation's watching the hour of
code marathon and then it's just like
it's just like oh my god behind the code
yeah really we find the code we finally
hit the hundred days and I'm like thank
God but I'm like but we're getting like
10,000 viewers I guess I should keep
going just drained out of my mind
alright um you guys get to watch all the
pivot scenes of our daily lives all
those like a hangar you know hangar
reality TV show gimmicks that they have
or it's like you see me throw in a
 plate you're like oh wait till
you see next week's it's like eSports I
actually make something useful yeah um
okay so
Oh what colored thing that you'll do is
you'll iterate through the length of an
array because typically what happens is
if you're if you're doing something to
in a list
you're probably going to do it to the
entire list and if you're not you'll
have an if statement to check to see if
you should do it or not but you need to
check every value to do it does that
make sense yeah Dylan does that make
sense
what leave it alone for that yeah pay
for the crazy okay I so in this case
remember remember our late array
function dot Lane um is now a zoo she's
not she's not paying me sadly and my
rate is not $70 an hour at seventy five
and I'm not being paid for it oh so she
technically owes me eight hundred and
fifty dollars right now for these eleven
days of coding um anyhow I'm a letter
slide on 325 excuse me another twenty
five at the end of it at the end of a
hundred days of coding she she would
have owed me $7,500 if she was a paying
client seventy five hundred seventy five
dollars an hour hundred hours ah but
girlfriend discount one hundred percent
I would probably if someone actually
ordered a hundred hours of my time like
that I would probably give them a
discount down to $60 an hour and so you
probably realistic okay so you'll see
right here a common way that you may run
a for loop which is you're going to run
it for the entire iteration the entire
length of the VLA and then you're going
to set the total so similar like say we
want to add the total for all our values
you would plus equals our total with
our array and you just run through each
index remember starting at index zero
which is why our variable starts here
pass it in so that I you're going to use
that the iterator you can use to access
each index of the array and then do
something with it
now how would we declare and initialize
I'm thinking about going to a web dev
office and asking if I can spend a few
hours with them what do you think that's
what I'm gonna have April do I'm going
to have her once I once we get her dev
portfolio side up I get her to start
messing with github and she starts
playing around JavaScript I'm going to
have her literally go in introduce
herself drop off a resume and say hey
this is where I'm at this is what I'm
trying to do do you have any internships
do you have any you know anything like
that if anything opens up will you
please give me a call I think just have
everything have your resume printed out
have your portfolio sign up have your
speech ready to go and ask if you can
talk to somebody a manager and just
introduce yourself I don't think there's
any harm in it I like a good could come
from it okay anyhow so declare
initialize a variable called total to
zero so we're going to clear this
variable total here to zero and what we
want to do is we just want to add two
three four five and six using a for loop
okay so I don't around together add them
together so I'm going to start at the
zero index where you say look wow that's
less than the length of our array or my
righteous me
add those values let's say ma so we're
going to say total plus equals remember
total is equal to tol plus whatever
we're going to add on the other side my
R and then we're passing in the current
item that we're iterating on or the
current iteration which is zero that
value so what's going to happen is
because they the total is equal to tilde
equal to plus 3 which is 5 5 plus 4
which is 9 9 plus 5 or just 6 not last 8
9 plus 5 is just 14 and then 6 which is
20 that's what's happening for each
iteration and one way to get comfortable
with this is sometimes people get
confused is just drawing it out and
scene writing hand by hand on the
whiteboard each iteration so we kind of
visualize what's happening
all right we're going into the fun stuff
multi-dimensional arrays
um 4 with 4 loops
all right modify them multiply all
function and so that multiplies the
product variable for each so you can
have a for loop within a for loop so if
the outer for loop is supposed to run
five times enter four loops of us are in
twice your instant there's 10 total
iterations because it runs the outer one
which is on index 0 and then when it
hits inner run it one runs that twice
then it jumps back now that outer ones
at index one and the inner one is at 0
again hits it so index one then goes
twice then jumps out and it goes to the
outer loop which is index two hits it
twice one two and then again and again
so every time it hits the nested for
loop it resets that value it runs once
in the outer runs all the code in the
inner in the scope its scope so it hits
the for loop and then resets so let's
try it working this I understand what
you're saying why the does it do
that because that's how logically it
would work okay this is not a logical it
does hit a front the waist always
resetting itself once it's out and then
goes back in because it's a different
index you see
and every time you hit a for-loop it's
setting that variable when when we set
var I is equal to zero in the for loop
if it were to go back to that for loop
it reset it to zero so that's what's
happening there is now we're going to
have a VAR j is equal to zero as our
nested 1 but every time we've rerun our
first for loop and it hits that again
that nested for loop it's going to reset
that equal to zero which is why reruns
now the top one doesn't because it never
hits that again it just goes back to do
the next iteration alright so here we
are in a for loop we say for VAR i is
equal to 0 y is less than our array that
we're passing in dot length i plus plus
and what we want to do is we want to set
product is equal to prod of x equal to
actually after this this first so we
have our first array so you see how we
have a nested array so array of an array
so the first one is to select both of
them so this would be index 0 this would
be indexed 1 this is being next to
alright and we don't count that
not holding all of them correct which is
where I got my brain will retarded the
other day yeah I just wanna make sure
yeah
and so I'm sending you a bill hey man
it's after this I can afford to say that
Villa will alright alright so um
not that you don't owe me a three-year
bill anyways three-year bill are you see
this is you know stretching the truth I
misjudged nitrogen the truth uh you know
what that's not sir
I'm gonna forgive you for this alright
so well you kind of have to because it's
the truth
so alright so each one of these eyes is
the first index so but we want the
actual value in the index and for us to
check the bat length we are going to do
another for loop and what we're going to
do is we're going to say VAR j is equal
to zero we don't want to do i we want to
do a different name of about iterator
because otherwise you'll create an
infinite loop and you're going to keep
resetting hi so that's why we use a
different one or say well J is less than
R and what's going to happen here is
we're gonna pass in I and say dot length
pretty sure is more than three no you
know what just wrong and I'm gonna argue
with this other boy are you out of your
mind
out of your absolute line inhale so and
then we're gonna do our sucking you
 riled up you're gonna be riled
up with this it was four years
doing all right listen pay attention
stop I know you're trying not to pay
attention right now I don't like it so R
because it's a two-dimensional array we
the first array is each one these index
eyes but we want to get the one and we
want to get the two we want to get the
three in the fourth erection another
four
for the length of that index so our zero
dot length would be 2 R 1 dot length
would be 2 R 2 dot dot length would be 3
okay
April will take a crack at it in about
day 30 is when we're gonna transition
over and they 30-day flirting he just
thought this out right now that's
not even uh for sure thing so day thirty
she she should have JavaScript under her
belt and I'm going to help her and
answer questions and that'll be more of
a Q&amp;amp;A than a lecture oriented okay so we
have the Ray nested within there is mean
stop looking at the check
pay attention
so now we have our logic mount X so this
R is each one you understand that this
first R is each is this entire array and
then the RI we're saying for each index
value or for each iteration I we're
passing that in we're getting one of
these the index values are zero
yes and now what we want to do is we
want to multiply all the values that are
in the array by using x equals and then
we're going to say our I and remember
two dimensional right J so if this was 0
1 what would what would the number be no
no it's not 0
what is our 0 1 see what is our 0 1
what's our so what's our 0 which index
is it or which which array is it it's
this one ok now what is till now you're
getting in confused so once you select R
1 R 0 its this index so what's what's
index when I say our array 0 and then
index 1 it's double remember the double
brackets so what that really is is chit
yes do you that yeah this is the easy
part that I get ok
I'm not eggs bossy all the time
all day long she'll eat dinner okay
so dinner a deluxe peek at what you do
or say doesn't cancel out any of what
you do or say after doing something nice
that's a really bad psychological field
oh we should talk about this you're not
gonna be around to talk about this you
 pushing me oh all right yeah see
James Scott gets it I know what
focus and work will get you I'm trying
to get you to focus and do work you know
all right so that was a two-dimensional
array and you can get these down as many
as you want so if it was
three-dimensional four dimensional five
dimensional you would have five loops
iterating through each other good game
we seriously take serious I'm listening
to you okay you can take it down to five
loops again and again and again see only
31 I'm trying to focus this is me trying
to focus I have to laugh otherwise this
gets boring
I was a joke
we can stop if you're not gonna pay
attention I'm paying attention well I
just repeated exactly what you just said
to me all right no more chat
you've lost your privileges I can't see
chat anymore guys I feel alone all right
um so my lives here
in big boy all right so look up profile
look up oh yeah I've been wondering what
this is all right so let's start reading
the instructions and see if we can
figure out what to do so we have an
array called lookup profile it takes in
a name and a problem and what we want to
do is the function should check if a
name is actual contact and the given
property prop is a property of that
content okay so we have our contacts so
we're going to say it's saying it needs
to check or it needs to make sure that
exists so we want to say contacts then
we're going to pass in name which is
Kira excuse me no I have it backwards
let's say prompt so in this case likes
so does that exist does it the likes a
key value here exists that's what we're
saying here
so this is an array of objects so we
have to actually iterate through it
first
see how its underwrite each one of these
index in the array so we have four
objects in the array so what we can do
here is for exactly what we've learned a
minute ago RI is equal to zero we have
to check all then save RI is equal to
zero well I is less is less than
contacts dot length because we want to
check every value in context I plus plus
that's our contact sorry okay and so we
need to check so the function should
check if name is actual contacts first
name and if the property is a
okay so we're saying if the first thing
we're checking this first name that's
what it was asking so in this case of
care would be true so we have to say if
contacts and the way that we target each
one is we pass in the the number that
we're currently at just find the index
index 0 index 1 and X 2 and X 3 this
case since I said I want so what we're
saying is if that exists and is equal to
the name prop this is a net 0 1 2 3
correct and then we're saying using
bracket notation here checking if this
is if this name exists if it does the
next thing we can do is another if
statement function check if the name is
actual contacts first name then the
given prop is the property of that
contact let me do another if within it
we're nesting or if so if that name
exists the next single one check is if
that contact contacts that current index
and that prop is true but for us do that
because prop it likes for instance is an
array
Oh actually we don't do that that's how
we're going to have to do a second for
loop but if that exists what we want to
return is contacts hi prom and that
should return the array does this exist
if it does return it if it doesn't then
it should say no such contact or no such
property and so
name doesn't correspond any context
return no such contact don't you have to
do a different return
there's two different return let me say
real quick yeah we nun like code
worked I hate I up on this one
last time too
he's big on reading the instructions so
I have to when I reset this real quick
you know what I'm like tilted right now
I don't want to do this you have set me
up so we're actually at a good place
where yeah we're at a good place where
we can ask answer some questions since
here on the restless side today
it's Friday boys I need to relax here I
I need to relax
although somebody is over here purposely
 with me
not funny don't be givin them really
help I said we'll take questions so that
for a little bit longer than we normally
did
so what do you what are you working on
today baby without me same why not so
let me working on its boring over here
uh what's the angle for April I believe
it's to get a job right and then she
wants to build some of her own apps and
things like that but right now it's job
what do I know about
model-view-controller it's pretty much
the fundamental design of angular and a
lot of other languages it's it's kind of
how things work for the most part
use the house on property we will later
I've done all this before old tired and
cranky I'll be honest unlock ranky oh
just stressed tired
I want to buy HTC five what is that it's
the virtual reality headset and
controllers and cameras $700
the cheapest petrol positive uh what
what did I get out of reading Rich Dad
Poor Dad um what I really got out of it
was that you need to invest at every
every every continual investment into
yourself and into your finances is what
you should do
no matter your financial circumstances
so in my case what I took out of it was
I needed to continually improve myself
and software and that I needed to
continually improve myself in my
finances which is why I've been hesitant
to do a video about how I invest in why
I invest the way that I do but currently
I am up to 21 percent of my income being
invested and part of that means living
below my means and and um I hope to get
that up to 50 percent but I also
invested myself timewise so every
weekend every day part of the thinking
of that is I think because so many
people out there talk about all the
stats they're like oh people know they
should save but they still don't and the
thing is is like everyone wants to live
in the now and have everything they want
now Rob lab now the thing is is at some
point you have to take a realistic
question be like so I'm 60 do I want to
have money like think about it
like I don't hu think you're going to be
at point where you're not going to be at
your peak performance and you're going
to have to rely on your past for some
type of income survival at one point
you know do you decide that okay 10% is
worth it oh I mean I honestly if I give
you guys one piece of advice and in my
video I talked about this I I would I
the thing I could tell you now is here
if you're 15 save 10% of every dollar if
you're if you're 20 save 15% if you're
every year starting at 18 I would say
start at 10% saving and investing not
just saving putting your money into the
bank does nothing for you investing your
money every year add one percent on and
you'll be falling out of control which
is what I want to be eventually ballin
out of control now I just want to be
succeed I don't want to know I don't
want to be ballin and control what I
want is to be financially independent
and so one way of doing that is
investing your money another way is
starting a business taking chances
putting your investing time into
yourself to better your skill set to
have money to invest you can't invest
 if you don't have any money we
talked a little bit about me wanting to
start my coding box that you know that
could be a chance where I just waste
three thousand four thousand dollars and
but at least I know when I tried it I
went for something that's going to
either make me some money down the road
is going to be a good project could turn
into something more but sometimes you
got to take those chances and that
$3,000 business chance could be
something the those that $3,000 you know
business chance could translate in
something more work it to be you know a
little bit of a hit but the same goes
with YouTube you could spend time and
energy doing any could not pay off but
you have to make the best educated
decision you can David yang says I'm
only asking because I work with a lot of
former salesmen and their negativity to
investing in business doesn't translate
into actionable decisions um I think you
said it right there and Anna Hornish
Alexander makes a good point that
there's a lot of six-figure people out
there living paycheck to paycheck which
is insane
so yeah ever since een it yeah just hand
yeah I mean it's stupid crazy and that
that's what's that's what's strange
right is that my salary is only going up
as a developer and I don't plan on
increasing my like we're moving into a
bigger place and I spent probably a
month and a half trying to find a better
bigger place and my rent went up $50 a
very small amount now I could afford a
place that would actually double our
rent right now but we'd be living
paycheck to paycheck wouldn't be
investing all that sort of stuff not not
the best decision you can make and as
James Scott says has never seen a
millionaire with only one income also a
great point so you you you diversify
your incomes and you make yourself one
not dependent on an employer and two you
try you you know if someone takes a hit
you got five others um but living
paycheck to paycheck after you're making
more than $50,000 $60,000 the average
family in America makes something like
54,000 that's the family that's the two
kids you have working and the husband
and the wife that's the average family
in America 54,000 so if you're making
above that you should be saving money
your pet YouTube with it
mom and dad um but I would highly
encourage you guys to invest in various
ways and various ways are our stocks or
peer to peer lending here lending um
there's also and there's also investing
your time right say so you're
knowledgeable about something make a
youtube channel you're investing your
time to get a return um and my time is I
charge for my time right I charge $75 an
hour and the only reason I can do that
is because people value my time to a
degree and and someone's willing to pay
me that my hourly money that I charge is
correlated with my experience in my and
my my Worth and you can have a YouTube
channel and get some value for your time
putting into the channel and get a
return on that ya mutual funds is a good
one how can I get some people use health
care plans to actually grow their money
because it's a guaranteed growth between
3 and 5 percent so there's other
creative ways you can use things to help
grow your money as well bizarre blast
says how can I get people to invest in
an app I have or a website well turn a
profit turn a profit and prove the
concept and it wouldn't be that hard
there's venture capitalist furnace so if
you really have a good idea don't let it
be an idea start it get it up and
running even if it's not your picture
that's why I'm initially learning code
I'm just that's kind of like my drive
right there bizarre is that I have an
app in mind and I just keep thinking of
that app in my head that I want to I
want to actualize this app and I want to
put it out there
I want to see it just explode
that would be my dream sorry go ahead
how does sell liver on the black market
yeah my liver
um but I mean if you if you need to find
out like people to get involved I mean a
lot I want concern with what you're
saying is a lot of people wait for other
people to deliver their dreams to them
it doesn't work like that it just
doesn't
you have to sadly yeah I if someone
could just have my dream on a platter do
you know how grateful I would be
my god I'd be like worshiping Murphy
yeah yeah what you say yeah I don't care
how gross I would have to get the same
oh my god saying that I'm just saying I
made totally grateful no put you in the
corner um Wow that'd be gross he took
that to a whole new level
you said worshiping their deed no I did
oh that's what I heard not say that
what'd you say I don't remember right
okay oh that's what I heard don't you
deal hold on yeah I don't even know how
I got stirring this traffic
oh yeah you said you can't wait for
someone to hand your dream and I was
like man so I handed me my dream mmm hey
Milo what's up buddy what's up buddy
oh you going to hang out everybody could
come hang out day I'm a big boy
it's on tape now check the replay I will
man Oh big boy um yeah it's interesting
because I've tried to I have a lot of
younger audiences that are like into
this whole time Lopez thing and like
people who are making money by just
saying they have money and then they get
money and then it's like oh man this
guy's genius that reminds me of the
secret you just think it into reality
the secret that if you take the secret
don't you think it into reality you
focus on it I actually have a fan of the
secret play right now
I got fancy I just think it's funny
because some people really take it to
this like weird place and I just think
it was funny uh but yeah so you got to
be careful that you're not fooling the
scam artists or anything like that and I
mean there's a there's a difference
between chasing your dream and then just
paying money thinking you're going to
get money by perpetuating a lifestyle
you don't actually live which I is
unfortunate the real question is which
is the best McDonald's burger it is of
course the steak egg and cheese bagel at
breakfast that's the best burger they
have a big boy
oh so tight Lopez is a good marketer he
came up with a great marketing idea now
we sell speeches and books and things
like that and affiliate links and where
do you scam everyone into thinking
here's a billionaire
Oh sort of yeah do i watch Johnson miss
yes I do
I don't watch every video a lot of his
videos lately have a lot of his videos
yes he does and it's not exactly a car a
lot of Jones videos lately haven't been
too software oriented they've been more
we're lifestyle oriented so they haven't
been as appealing to me although I do
watch them on occasion when I see John
uploads a lot of videos guys we all know
this and it's hard to see it's hard to
stay up-to-date on John's videos I'll
show you guys my dream car it's not
really the name of it oh my god that's
the name of this one of them so my dream
car for somebody who wants it is I'm not
really a I'm not like an over-the-top
sort of I need to have a nice car
but like the car I would have that's
nice and slightly out of my prop my
range would be this car right here
the it's a three wheel it's called the
Raptor they have a couple different ones
oh this one is the oh this one's the BMW
1 this one's out of my price range but
uh
one of the three-wheeler cars I think
the spider is what the one I'm thinking
of uh which is about 20 no sonnet uh is
about it's a three wheeler a sort of car
slash here it is right here
so this is what I would get it's a three
wheel the Polaris slingshot
cigs dope man it's only 20 grand
yeah slingshot I was thinking 20 grand
this would be if I was going to treat
myself if April left me today I'd go out
and buy this car he would need to I'd go
and buy this car to make myself feel
better he would have to I'd go against
all my advice of investing and living
below your means and I'd instantly take
a $600 a month car payment that's the
kind of fit I got I got treat myself
just like Ryan are over here this would
be the car I would get though this
thing's dope man like this
he loves this thing every time we drive
by one he's like look at that boys come
on you know that's dope
I would love to deck this out and like
some type of superhero theme like Batman
would be the easiest one to go with you
know just banging but maybe all creative
we actually I actually saw a pair of
these being driven down the highway when
I was driving from California to Florida
I was just thinking how could you make
that drive in one of those things oh my
gosh
you take it through the wash like that
look at that so I'm in Florida and you
do see a lot of them I saw a few in LA
which is a beach city also but this
would be the car that I would get if I
if I wanted to my quote/unquote dream
car I don't really need a nice car guys
anyhow that'd be the dream car if I was
ever to treat myself to something
extravagant I suppose um with that being
