second part of object-oriented
programming part 1 virtual computer so
we'll be doing using what we did in
regards to object-oriented yesterday or
in last video and looks like we'll be
rebuilding a username and password using
object oriented programming so let's go
ahead and save and submit then we'll
continue on here so first thing I wanna
do is create a class called computer
pretty standard class computer and give
it an initialize method and then in our
death initialize and take some
parameters the body of initial I should
be empty and we're going to end that and
then we're going to end our class as
well let's go ahead and save this wit
did you create a classical I think we
need a capitalized computer there we go
now we want to update our initialized
method to take two parameters username
and password separate it with a comma
alright and we want to set the username
by doing user name equals or at username
equals is your name similar to the this
dot name equal so this ty username
equals username if you're more familiar
like Java that was first language I use
so often I'll be comparing equating it
to that and create a net files instance
variable and set this to an empty hash
alright so let's see if we understand
this correctly so add files and we want
to set it to an empty hash like an empty
string perhaps on open I'm the ash like
this cool so so far we're just setting
it up our our code here we haven't
actually done anything with it yet all
right now add a class variables to your
computer class all right so
users set that equal to an empty a sh
okay in your initialize method say and
at users wait alright so in here we need
to set at users to we're going to fill
up it with the user name this is going
to be keeping track of every single one
and we're going to set that equal to a
password so it's kind of the key and the
door type of thing like the username is
what's inside the door and the password
is the key to open the door to get that
if that makes sense as I typically
remember it up inside your computer
class to find a method called create so
we're going to find another medical def
create and just go ahead and end that
right away with a single parameter file
name so this new stuff file name inside
create declare a variable called time so
we're going to save time is set it equal
to the current time so apparently a ruby
has something called time now which will
define it by whatever current time in
your time zone i'm guessing next
instantly create added me add a new key
value pair it to the appt files hash
using the file name to store the value
time so we're just at files
just found in history all right so add
files and then here we put file name is
equal to time and for the final step and
create please put some puss message
shelling that the user file was created
so foots 550 Wars created and let's see
if we did everything right so far cool
now add a new classmates to your
computer class called computer get users
it should have no parental nurse I add a
new class method so def it goes for
users things and in here
it looks like we might have to find it
like this is what if I understand
correctly and we're going to return at
reasors so this should give us all the
user files correctly and after your
class create a new instance of computer
and start a new variable called my
computer all right so we this is our
entire class so we're going to say this
is a pear store in a new purse all right
so we're going to say my underscore
computer equals computer dot knew if I
remember correctly yet and then in here
we're going to say my user name is pizza
poker guy and my password Joseph a
password save us submit and then we've
created our new instance so there's a
lot of stuff we could have done we could
have had it print out that the file was
created and we could have called all
that but this case all in all we were
able to do what we wanted to do we're
into badge as well and um it's pretty
straightforward if you're familiar with
object-oriented programming up maybe the
hashes are a little bit you know it's
like basically think of it as an array
that opens an array value that's the
best way to think about if that makes
sense but up next we're going to be
doing object-oriented programming too
it's called need-to-know basis and so we
probably will be getting you to a little
more detailed object oriented type code
and i'll see you guys next video and as
always Inc any constructive criticism is
always appreciated thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
