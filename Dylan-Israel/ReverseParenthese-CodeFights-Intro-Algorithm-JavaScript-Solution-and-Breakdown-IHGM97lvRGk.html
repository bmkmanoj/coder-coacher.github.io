in code fights the intro smooth sailing
or first parenthesis so what are we
trying to do here well over in my tests
real quick and we have a string and what
we want to do is anything within two
parenthesis we want to actually reverse
it so you'll see here the B and the C
have been Zack and so on and so forth a
little harder to see with this but you
guys get the idea
wherever there is a parenthesis we want
to reverse those values I am this was
one of the harder ones for me
I'm extremely bad at regular expressions
and in all honesty I I ended up getting
this off a Stack Overflow not the entire
solution but the regular expression that
I was looking for so shout out the stack
overflow I need to get better at it it's
one of my shortcomings as a developer I
just haven't had a chance in a
professional environment word about
required yet but I'm sure it will be in
the near future all right so we're going
to use recursion you could also do this
a little while loop we decided to go
with recursion the sum so if you don't
know what recursion is it's essentially
calling a function within a function
creating a semi infinite loop that
eventually ends that that's how it goes
is if your logic is wrong in recursion
it will create an infinite loop if your
logic is right go break and I'll return
so what we did here was we created a
let's create a function our our
secondary function here call it function
reverse reverse just reverse source and
it takes in its own string now in here
we're going to be calling that function
and when that function finally returns a
string that doesn't have parentheses in
it that's when our recursion ends and
we're going to say look if our current
string that's being passed in includes
a opening bracket opening parentheses we
need to we need to continue we need to
continue running our logic now includes
will check if it's true or false so if
that is the case we just want to return
perverse parentheses and in here we're
going to call our reverse function that
we wrote actually let's name this
something sighs reverse because there's
a a or a function called reverse reverse
reverse reverse recur call it reverse
recur I'm sure you guys come up with
better names reverse so Kirk and we're
going to call our recursion function our
reverse of her career and we're going to
pass in that string because it still has
an opening parenthesis meaning we still
have more to do now if it doesn't we can
go ahead and return s now in fact now
that I'm looking at this we can actually
just return this because it's going to
hit this there's no need for analysis or
both return statements cool now the next
thing that we can do that let's actually
this is this is all we're doing a
reverse thread through both the logic
goes in here so we have this regular
expression here and again I got this off
Stack Overflow shame on me but this name
of the game sometimes essentially what
it does is it finds it's a regular
expression to find an opening
parenthesis and a closing parenthesis
within your string now what we want to
do from here is we want to call we want
to find that substring one credit
variable and call and execute this
regular expression and then grab those
letters in that word that so it's going
to omit the parentheses but it can grab
all the letters within it that's what
we're doing right now we're getting the
substring of it
so we're going to call our regular
expression say X Q will execute on what
the s that's getting passed in the
string that's game passing and then we
want that word so that's what that one
is right there now if you want to see we
can go ahead and come to a log piece by
piece so we can see it as we at the end
because I think a lot of this stuff may
get lost in translation
so we'll console.log that and we'll come
back after that all we have to do is
take our substring remember it's a it's
a string and we need to reverse it we
haven't actually reversed it yet so we
can just go ahead and set this equal to
that and we have to were converting the
string before we put it back right so
substring dot dot split we're turning it
into an array we are then reversing it
and then we are joining it back all
right so that's our substring I'm
reading console.log that right now just
so that everyone can see what's going on
once it all passes and then finally we
have to actually add it back into the
string and we use we're going to use or
the recursive or curt excuse me the
regular expression I'm at cough drops
because I'm sick so I apologize guys if
I'm a little bit off my game
but for say look go ahead and replace
and where are you placing right where
that where the regular expression is
true and put in this substring so we're
basically saying hey get that get that
that word
reverse it and then check our regular
expression which we know is true because
otherwise we wouldn't be here and
replace the B C with C B and after that
it just continues long let's go ahead
and run our test and you'll see here as
we continue there is our B C so right
here we have B C
çb and put it back bamm-bamm let's
actually take these out it's cute so you
can see that we're grabbing it and life
is good
submit our code now this is this is one
where I think you have to have a decent
understanding regular expressions and
you'd also do this in a while loop when
I was when I wisely originally I tried
doing it with law a while loop and then
I came across a solution that was
exactly what I was trying to do and I
ended up going with after looking at
their code I couldn't get the recursive
I am out of my head
either ones probably fine the rehearses
answer is probably a little bit more
geeky so people like that better I would
suppose but either one should work but
um as always I thank you so much for
watching the video and I hope you found
this helpful
I know I learned a lot of the couple of
hours I spent on this doing a little bit
of research about regular expressions
I'm still not very good at it but as
always I'm trying to get better if you
have a better solution and I've looked
through quite a bit because I've now
that I've solved this I can look at the
answers and this is one that I think
kind of kicked it up a notch for a lot
of people myself included but it is I
believe the last one of the section
that's typically how it goes but that's
always guys thank you so much for
watching don't forget to comment like
subscribe and share and if you want to

or support my patreon all those links
are in the description I will see you in
the next video bye hey guys thanks for
watching the video special thanks to our
sponsors dev Mountain if you look for a
coding bootcamp or tuition and housing
is included definitely check them out
appreciate it I'll see you guys in the
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
