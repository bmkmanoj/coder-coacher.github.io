in so we'll learn doing HTML
fundamentals look kind of excited about
this because uh I I have never actually
taken like an official course on html5
not that I would really say this is an
official course it is a course but uh
you know I'll learn a little bit more
about html5 which we move forward but
let's go ahead and jump right into HTML
what is HTML it is hypertext markup
language especially the bones of the
Internet so uh tags use tags to say what
is what basically in HTML there's the
web structure as well so you'll be using
HTML CSS JavaScript PHP sometimes and
sometimes you'll even use the CMS a
content management system such as
WordPress would be probably the most
popular one so rearrange the paragraph
tag so you have an opening paragraph tag
and a closing one to say I am learning
HTML and Sylla learn pretty pretty
straightforward basic HTML data
structure so often not often always
you'll have to have your opening HTML
closing HTML tag to let them know how
where the HTML starts in your file
basically and then you have your head
tag your head tag that's where you're
going to be non visual elements how they
list it a lot of times this is basically
just a library and things like that so
it's going to be within your HTML tags
and your kind of an opening head tag and
a closing head tag as well oops my
mistake here should have HTML put in the
wrong tag and then closing tag there we
go the body tag is where the bulk of
your content goes basically everything
is in here image as they in their
example to give you headings paragraph
list quotes
tags compute panes within the body
that's basically where the bulk of your
content goes that's real I need to know
and kind of learn the structure so in
this case it goes
was the a channel tag ahead and then the
body tags finishing your first HTML page
you'll see right here HL files or text
files so they can be used in any text
editor so they're basically just text
files that get read properly for this so
that's why you can use notepad or
anything like that you don't have to
setup like a server or stuff like that a
text editor although you can use a fully
functional IDE like phpstorm which is
what i use so this is line of text will
actually output it because it is text so
you'll see right here which correct
extension for HTML files is dot HTML the
title tag so the title tag is basically
what's going to open this page up this
right here at the top left corner of the
tab that's what the title tag does and
you'll put that in the head so before
they show we're sure if it's outside you
should put that between the head tags
nice we got a hat trick all right well
thank you here module 1 quiz what is
HTML stands for hypertext markup
language oh let's try a markup language
scripting language hypertext library
programming should assume markup
language which of the main parts is HTML
file consists of it consists of a head
and a body the head the lot and then the
footer right so just starts at the top
and worked its way down which tag
contains the visual part of the web page
that would be the body tag and finally
fill in the blanks you have your a
channel tag then you have a head opening
tag then the closing head tag line you
have opening body tag the stuff in the
body in this case this is a line of text
and the closing body tag sweet so that
was overview a pretty straightforward
basically just gave us a quick rundown
of HTML not too much if you've done HTML
before I'm really just doing it to get
this certificate kind of get some
context for some of it if you're very
very new to so learn as well and learn a
bit a bit more about
html5 but as always guys thank you for
watching don't forget to comment like
subscribe and share and support me on
patreon where we just restructured and
has a lot of new perks and look forward

Friday morning we released an interview
with a developer software professional
anyone in the tech space and we go over
a whole mess of thing so thanks for
watching I'll see you guys in the next
video special thanks to our sponsor dev
Mountain if you're interested in coding
bootcamp why don't you check them out
where they include housing alongside
their tuition so you can get up go and
immerse yourself in the environment if
you want to support me go over to
patreon complex coding tutorials 360s so
we can put out more content thanks for
