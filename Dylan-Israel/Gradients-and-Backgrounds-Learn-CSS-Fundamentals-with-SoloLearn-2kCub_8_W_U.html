back in solo learn the CSS fundamentals
gradients and backgrounds I apologize if
I stumble through these next two
sections but I do know that I need to
improve my CSS which is why we're doing
this course so let's go ahead and move
forward linear gradients kind of refers
to backgrounds going linearly from one
color to the other you can see right
here it's happening you put in color
names text values H TV or HSL basically
different colors as you can see right
right here background if you're using
mobs you're gonna have to use our
Mozilla you're gonna have to use
different things in this case we're
passing in two different colors by name
you can pass them in anywhere you have
linear and then you have radial uh
hexade dust some cmics now whatever CMYK
is if that's a color scheme I apologize
I didn't know that you can do color
stops this becomes a lot easier to do
and quicker using a less or sass of a
CSS pre-compile er as well so we have
gradient blue yellow green pink white so
you just keep going apparently and you
can set how much oh that's kinda cool
eighty-five percent green 30 percent
yellow 20 percent blue I didn't know
that uh I have the mystic color create
sharp lines between the colors so that's
20 and 20 I guess this would 80 and 80
that would be 20% if I understand that
correctly equal to hundred percent
exactly
whoops forgot to turn that off so let's
continue on direction of the grain so
you can also set a direction so we've
been setting the top to bottom you see
we have left to right and so on and so
forth so which the font injection
supported I believe it's probably Center
did you have to go in a direction and
Center isn't really a direction it's
just the center
you also do bottom-left hundred degrees
as well so you have our backgrounds you
get a lot of flexibility is really what
you need to take away from this so if we
have linear gradient left red yellow
that would probably be 45 degrees no
looks good we'll see here bottom left
bottom left is a hundred degrees okay
so zero degrees I guess is left
okay so zero degrees here at the left
bottom left is under degrees got it so
you can also do repeating linear
gradient as so this is really good for
creating like cool backgrounds where
maybe text would go on make it a little
see-through a gradient as well so you
have our repeating linear gradient
what's a radial gradients position shape
or size color stuffs color combination
okay so there was no Direction included
in that setting the shapes so you see
right here things are getting a little
feisty
you have ellipse which is the default
apparently in the circle so ellipse is
the default
ooh in percentages top left cool cool
Oh what is not acceptable for position
percent definitely is I want to say
Radian
so yeah radians you're not gonna use
color stops colors are specified with
the color plus an optional stop position
here's the length of the percentage you
can see right here where it just stops
immediately so add a circle raining a
little green for this the black and red
colors we have that already and color
stops the twenty pixels and 70 pixels
cool background - sighs I didn't realize
this was a new to CSS just three okay so
now now adays you don't need to add the
browser specifically right to this so if
we want a background of a hundred pixels
by 200 pixels oops I got that backwards
its width then height so 200 pixels
hundred pixels it's just background ash
sighs like so now there are two other
possible background sizes contain and
cover contain key word scales image so
that fits the container so if you have a
5,000 by 5,000 size background but you
want it to be contained within the div
which is 500 by 500 used to contain and
it will shrink it down appropriately
however if you want the image to cover
the space to fit properly you can use
the word cover
background - clip not something I'm
familiar with specifies the painting
area of the background you have border
box padding box content box
interesting which valleys don't using
the background - clip probably we're
rock hunting textbooks use text box
so you can kind of add borders now this
light eglee borders to the padding's and
things like that
yes it does work with images transparent
borders so now your borders can be semi
see-through more or less I believe this
was sane so see right here it's now
semis to see through background - border
box
music background - panting box none yeah
I got that wrong let's go back and look
at this real quick background clip
patting box okay so that's where I got
it wrong there we go
multiple background images another thing
you can do it's kind of interesting
seeing a lay over multiple background
images I didn't know this so that's good
just separate it with a comma and
passing the URL to where everything is
and a similar background position
passing a comment I'll go the right
place that's pretty pretty cool as well
the last image of the background image
list will appear at God I have no idea
so I can still appear at the bottom if
you don't specify it so you can change
the position we already talked about
that you can also pass it in just using
background if you want shorter CSS I
personally prefer having everything
broken up into pieces so just me but I
go back and forth about that so do
whatever works for you fill in the
blanks to add to background images to
the element with the first position at
the top left corner so this is gonna be
URL and for specified by comma left top
and the other top right right top cool
and then opacity you can see right here
we're making things a see-through now
this is pretty cool use this a lot for a
lot of things so if we want to a faster
than 2.30
I do wrong
Oh 0.3 there we go
now if you're using ie or commonly known
as the browser that makes
everyone's life difficult as a web
developer you're gonna need to use a
filter alpha to get that pass it'll work
now let's see the quiz here add a circle
radiant gradient to preusse red so
background ready
No one second let's see here background
set radial gradient and color soft so 50
pixels 15 pixels 25 pixels there we go
dang up those number mixed up the radio
and 25 15 and gradient I'm not really
too worried about memorizing this stuff
you really need to learn by reference
when it comes to where's no 25 pixels
wrong at a circular or radial gradient
produced red and blue as color stops a
cool wearing that 25 pixels of 15 pixels
oh whoops radial don't ya one thing to
when it comes to the coding is don't
necessarily worry about memorizing this
stuff so much just knowing that a exists
and being able to being able to remember
oh I can do this and going back to it
and trying to solve it at a later date
fifteen five right yeah yeah I swear it
I'm alright so apparently I don't fully
understand this
so this is 25 this is 15
okay so we're gonna use a hint here cuz
I don't understand how I can't put a
color stop let's try this
all right I need to go back and review
that radial gradient color stop issue
because I don't understand what it's
1515 in the background clip property
which values allow for the creation of
transparent borders you're gonna assign
the padding box fill in the blanks to
makes background image the element a
hundred by hundred pixels so we have a
background has also set the opacity so
where's our background - sighs 100 by
100 set the opacity to 50% so we also
gonna set the URL to this or they
measure this then we're gonna set
opacity to 0.5 cool fill in the blanks
so apply 50% opacity to the diff so it's
gonna be 0.5 and make it also working ie
a aka the shit-ass browser everybody
hates and there we go
cool um stuff a little bit on the radial
gradient part hopefully I'll use that
and get more familiar with it last but
not least we have transitions and
transforms lots of cool stuff in here
