we are back in free code camp doing one
of those intermediate algorithm
scripting bonfires finders keepers so
what are we trying to do here
essentially we want to return the first
value of an array that passes the the
truth test essentially that's that's
really what's going on here so in this
case it our function find passes in an
array and it also passes in a function
that evaluates that returns a number
when it's equal to true so how do we go
about doing this so we only want the
first argument it would be just using a
standard filter to function do that so I
I don't know this is a cheating but I
kind of felt like they wanted this to be
much more complex than it needed to be
so we're gonna we're just going to go
ahead and use filter the array filter
and then do some little quick workaround
using the if and else statement so I
guess it's not cheating it's still
programming so what are we trying to do
here is in this case if you remember
filter will take in egg it will run
filter runs on an array and then it
takes in a function and then we'll add
the the truth so true value so in this
case let's give an example before we get
started here so we're going to set the
Varnum is so to setting it to 0 we're
going to set it equal to our input array
and then we're going to filter it and in
that we're going to use our function so
in this case we have one two three four
so in this case it's going to return a
two and A four and you can see right
here so that's pretty cool so what I did
is that just just a simple if else
statement so first thing we do here is
filter next with it I'm gonna say is if
our num
and if our number array is greater than
one it means that it was able to take in
some value and in this case all we're
going to return is that first value
assessable we're in turn numb else we
can use now so we can just leave it like
that return undefined because it wasn't
greater than zero and it's that simple
so when we run it we're done um I know
probably struggled with this for quite a
bit I know when I first look at it I I
kind of just gazed over it and was like
I don't really understand what they're
asking but after taking a little
two-week vacation on the free cook amp
my mind's working pretty well back on
track so I hope you found this helpful
but as always let's go ahead and put our
comments in our code so we know we did
here so create a variable great oh we
don't you put that at this point you
know we're creating a variable so filter
through array adding only true values
based on inputted function this is more
just describing what are what filter
does and setting it to numb our if
statement is here too sorry I normally
put them below but someone pointed out
that uh you should really put your
comments above and I'm always trying to
improve so let's stay here so in this
case our comment here is checks if num
returned as a true values that's what
the point of this is
values and then finally returns first
index we actually I think we're good
here we may want to put a comment here
for return unto fine returns undefined
if entire array with salsa so as always
guys hope you found this helpful and
don't forget to like and subscribe and
share the video for all those other
campers out there that may need help i
know i went to a javascript meetup and
met up with about 30 javascript people
in about eight or nine we're free code
camp people and they they're really
loving it as much as i am so keep up the
work good work guys and i'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
