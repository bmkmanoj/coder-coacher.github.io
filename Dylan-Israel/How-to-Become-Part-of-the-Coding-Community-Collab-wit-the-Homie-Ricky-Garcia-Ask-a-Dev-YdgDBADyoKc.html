how to become part of the coding
community I'm going to be giving you
some of my ways and I'm also going to
have my buddy Ricky Garcia who also has
a channel which will be linked in the
description below to give some of his
ways as well and he's also gonna
elaborate specifically on how to become
part of the community coding community
if you live in a remote area because
that's something that I've never had the
ability to do really and I think he's
gonna provide a lot of value because a
lot of people do live in areas that
aren't you know Los Angeles and downtown
areas and it's a little harder to
connect with people but we're gonna talk
a little bit about how to connect why
it's important and how you can
contribute to the community of
developers so Before we jump into five
resources as to how you can get involved
in the coding community let's talk about
why it's important right so one we live
in a day and age in which and in an
industry of software and specifically
web development where things are
constantly changing and as an employee
as a potential candidate you need to
stay up-to-date on what's going on
within your industry or you're gonna be
left behind and you're gonna suffer the
consequences that go with it too if you
do it this is one of the unique ways
where you can by being involved in the
community of developers in various
aspects you can find your passion you
can find your love for this industry and
because not everything that we're gonna
be talking about is just you hard coding
things out some of it is taking a
different look at at development that
maybe you aren't accustomed to that will
really help you out in the long term and
I think it's worth taking a look at so
let's go ahead and dive into the first
one and that is joined some Facebook
groups right join something most of us
not all of us but most of us use
Facebook and I happen to recommend this
co tech and caffeine when I stumbled
upon the other day it's fantastic
but uh anyhow for those of you like do
created this group I hope everyone
picked up on the sarcasm but um part of
it is you get to see what other people
are working on you get to see what sort
of topics people are talking about you
can ask your own questions and doesn't
all have to be serious right you can see
right here we have some some some memes
going on yeah it gives you a unique way
to learn as well as you still enjoy what
it is you're discussing right and you
can see right here someone's just a
student looking for some advice about
summer internship and I would encourage
you to join some Facebook groups and
I'll definitely as always have this link
in the description of the video so check
it out
the next thing I would suggest is
checking out meetup comm for potential
meetups and this will give you another
interesting way of connecting with
people where you have the ability to
learn from others as well as teach
others as well as make connections this
in the physical world and go from there
right so recently my my my my normal
meetup would be iron yard in st.
Petersburg our IP but let's see if we
expand this out to about 25 miles see
what comes up but you'll see you'll see
a few things on here st. Petersburg API
so I'm going to check that out so what
Tampa hackerspace board game night
learning to code Kids Academy learning
to go see if you have kids but
essentially what I'm trying to say is oh
here's a good one a very agile Java us
front-end design holiday celebration
that's a very long name but you can see
a couple things but you know so it's a
good way to network it's a good way to
learn something new and it's a different
way to go about - to still learn while
not necessarily immersing your your
being only into a computer screen I
encourage you to check out meetup.com
for that as well there's probably a few
other sites with meetups the main one
that I use the other thing I would
suggest is start going to hackathons
this is something where you can meet a
lot you get introduced to a lot of cool
technologies because a lot of times
companies are there to to see what's
going on and see who can come up with
creative solutions for their api's and
products you
also every time I've gone to these
someone's been looking for the hi Ranger
look into looking to two and you can win
prizes but you can network with people
you can you can build cool projects for
portfolio if you win one it looks great
on a resume even if you just have a
portfolio project it goes from it so you
can see right here there's a couple ones
going on let's just go to North America
we got the money money 20 this is angel
hack calm for those of you who are
interested I've gone to several angel
hack events that I can tell you they are
phenomenal so it usually they charge ten
dollars for you to go but they provide
meals and and drinks and free swag and
all that it's really just to cover a few
basic things but I would highly suggest
if you're interested in and this happens
one of these happens to be near you
let's see where this one is just a
curiosity global Global Monday 17 it's
gonna take forever to load cuz I'm
filming video for whatever is it because
that's how it rolls but I would
encourage you to go to hackathons build
interesting projects and start learning
new things today where is this global
demo hackathon alright so second is it
online it might be online so some of
these hackathons are even online I would
encourage you to go and try to go to
in-person one because I think I think
you'll get more out of it it's a little
bit more fun in my opinion now so the
the fourth thing I would suggest is
start contributing to open source right
if there's something that you're a fan
of let's take free code camp for
instance go on free code camp see what
sort of open tickets they have right see
what bucks they have see if you can us
offer some suggestions it's gonna be
intimidating at first but there's
nothing wrong with just kind of seen
okay well let me look at the issues and
then let me see if I can find something
something easy right so that's not going
to be let's see
cannot convert undefined to null object
that's something you do pretty pretty
easily and it's just more so probably
about a tie pair so you might be able to
look into that it all depends but my
suggestion is start contributing to open
source and that'll look good on a resume
you'll learn a lot and you'll learn what
it's like to actually work with other
developers because that's how it goes
you were working and fix the other
people's code so the other thing I would
say is volunteer volunteer volunteer
volunteer and you're saying done I don't
really know how I can help I'm just a
noob well a lot of times if you've made
a website you're better than 95% of the
population and you can provide a little
bit of value you can go and help on hour
of code I volunteer whenever the state
of Florida calls me so call me Florida
and I will go and give lectures to
children who really all they want to
know is if you build video games but all
the same it's the same you can you can
answer their questions and maybe get
them inspired and they they want to they
actually want to know two things I wanna
know how much money you make and they
want to know did I build minecraft
that's that's those are the two
questions you're gonna get but volunteer
code.org is a great organization who's
all about getting the word out there
trying to get kids involved in the STEM
fields specifically software development
so I encourage you to check that out so
these are just five things that you can
do pretty much starting today to immerse
yourself in the coding community some of
these things you need to be more in in
metropolitan areas right the hackathons
are usually in big cities but that's why
we got our boy Ricky coming up next to
drop some knowledge on how he can what
he will tell you to get involved in the
community as well as the things that you
can do to maybe if you're in a less
compact area we're not as many of these
events are going on that he has found
successful to inject himself into the
coding community hey guys working in an
area where there aren't a lot of
developers you know it can be tough how
do you get the resources that you need
how do you keep in the loop how do you
get yourself out there to improve your
career well for me it's been all about
social media now before this I was a
social media manager where I handled
dozens of accounts quite literally
dozens of accounts so I learned about
Facebook I learned about video
production but what I really learned
about was providing people value and
that's one of the best ways to get
yourself out there and people can see
that everywhere now what does that mean
it means you have to provide an
entertainment education maybe a public
service maybe all these things combined
and then you have to put that out there
somehow whether it be with the podcast a
video a blog these are all great ways
that you can go ahead and get yourself
into the community now how would you go
ahead and do that well you know we can
talk about theory all day long but let
me go ahead and show you in the browser
and I'll give you some examples that
I've done over the years all right like
I said if you're in an isolated area
like me
social media is your friend you can talk
to others halfway across the world with
the same interests such as the web
development or programming and you can
go ahead and distribute content which is
really the key as you can see I am a
avid youtuber and I try to go ahead and
put out content about a web development
let's go and take a look at some of
these videos here so here you can see
that I have a lot of different topics
now hold on I'm not saying that you have
to go ahead and get a YouTube channel
out here but this is the best way that I
found to go ahead and get involved in
the community and just doing live
streams to different topics and you can
really get detailed here as you can see
I have a lot of different thumbnails
but you don't have to do that getting
started is the most important thing but
what if you don't want to go ahead and
create a channel not a big deal you can
really get involved by just having
thoughtful comments or questions on
YouTube channels or other you know other
platforms but you should think outside
the box what I did was actually go on
simple programmer with a video question
let's go ahead and listen hey what's up
john sonmez from simpleprogrammer.com
so I got a video question here from
Ricky Garcia
you can check out the video this was go
ahead and listen to him he wants to know
about branding versus of technical
skills hi John this is Richard love the
show but watching you since you had
about 20,000 subs you had a video about
Udacity nano degrees so as you can see
this is a long video
but I got a lot of screen time on there
and you know john sonmez is or simple
programmer it has a lot of subscribers
and my face is there the audio is there
I'm getting myself into the community
really thought outside the box but I get
it you know not everyone has the camera
set up you don't have to have a fancy
one you can do something with a webcam
like this one and if you don't want to
do that not a big deal be involved with
comments and stuff this is roberto blake
channel here he has a lot of subscribers
he's really well known in the youtube
niche and i've just gone ahead and left
a comment this is currently in the debt
myself great advice it was pertaining to
the video and he replied to me so do you
want me to make a video about that now
he's replied to me on several occasions
and I was in his livestream and I put a
super chat up there for him to answer
great way to get myself into
you know his brain as well as the
audience and talking about live chat if
you are going to a live chat be sure to
go ahead and get involved ask questions
to the streamer and answer a lot of
questions in chat to others as long as
it's helpful that's something that a lot
of people don't do and that will get
people to know who you are I have a lot
of people do that in my live streams
I have Corey there's David lang and you
know a whole bunch of others I can't
just name out but I do have a lot of
them there and they are involved and
that's really important now this isn't
just about YouTube in about video this
does go over two different topics and
different mediums so I subscribe to a
podcast called the deeply graphic design
cast and I sent over an audio clip here
so let's go ahead and take a listen to
that
all right cool so let's go right into we
got a story from Ricky so let's go ahead
and listen to that Mikkel West Nick it's
great to talk to you guys again you said
to send in your worst graphic design
stories so here we are
I work as a web developer but before
this I work late you know let's not talk
about that if you want listen to that
you know do do so on your own time but I
just wanted to go ahead and drive the
point home that you can go ahead and do
this on other platforms and it doesn't
have to be video but what if you don't
want to do video or audio where you
don't have the time or the skill there
is blogging and a lot of people do
blogging one thing to take note of
though
the harder it is the higher the barrier
to entry the more you're gonna stand out
and so that's why I do YouTube it's a
lot harder to do something to take into
account but I got started with blogging
on LinkedIn with LinkedIn articles you
can go ahead and check them out here you
might see that there aren't a lot of
views on some of these or a lot of
clicks and that's okay what we're doing
is trying to get in front of the right
people whether it be on LinkedIn or
YouTube or you know like a podcast we
want to go ahead and distribute content
to the right people let me rephrase we
want to go ahead and create content for
the right people and this is one of the
ways to do it now if you don't consider
yourself an expert just talk about what
you know like I said and that is usually
a great way to go you're gonna get
better at creating posts thinking about
things getting better at writing that's
a great skill to have for anything to be
honest you're gonna really carry that
all throughout your career such as
writing thoughtful emails and stuff
let's go and take a look at one of these
articles here's a headline here's a
picture here's you know all this
formatted stuff that I didn't think
about and organizing my thoughts really
a really great skill to have I highly
recommend that you look into doing
something like this and getting started
with this it's cheap as effective and
you're gonna carry it throughout but you
know we've been talking about creating
content how do we use this and
distribute this to others you know all
around the world where where they aren't
in our teeny tiny little bubble well
that's where stuff like Quora and
twitter and facebook come in you can go
through Cora and do like a reverse
search so here's Udacity nanodegree you
can just type in Udacity and find this
topic nanodegree find a question here is
are you know are you dancing now degrees
worth finding a job and I can go ahead
and leave an answer a lot of these are
detailed these people are getting
involved in the community and trying to
go ahead and get you know that
recognition just by leaving you know
thoughtful thoughtful answers and some
of these can be blog posts as well you
just take them put them in here that's a
quick win but try to customize some of
this stuff that's what I did here left a
really detailed answer and then talked
about the
nanodegree and then left my video here I
have 16 thousand views 11 up votes it's
a great strategy to use always remember
to be helpful that's what really it
comes down to that's how people are
going to come to you or notice you is by
providing something that is insightful
or helpful what's another way that you
could go ahead and distribute this
content well you could go through
Facebook groups
I know YouTube and Facebook don't get
along well but I went ahead and put this
through there and I had a lot of new
faces there it was surprising that's
something that you should do is change
up put your tactics always be learning
something new and then going ahead and
using the best ones from that point
forward you could also distribute this
stuff through Twitter now I am NOT an
avid Twitter user myself I just use it
to basically send out my videos and you
can tell with the followers I have but
as I get further along in my journey
when I get to 100 videos only about five
six videos away I will go ahead and
start using this heavily and there are
all sorts of things here you can see
Twitter analytics and it will give you
some more information and that's on a
ton of these platforms just like
linkedin shows you the clicks and stuff
and you if you go farther you can see
even more like who it was and stuff and
all these social media platforms have
that if you're if you're looking for
that stuff so there are all the
platforms and ways to get out there and
I totally understand if this is
overwhelming like how am I going to get
started this is all foreign to me
don't worry I got you covered you can go
over to HubSpot HubSpot Learning Academy
to be specific now these courses are
free you do have to sign up through the
forum but after that it's free now not
all of these software courses are
available to you because you got to be a
software user but inbound is free it
talks about email marketing what we're
talking about right now as well as the
content marketing strategy here let's go
and take a look at this course actually
and you can see here is a list of the
videos how long they are the video
itself and they also have like they have
resources and stuff if you click on one
of these other videos you can see that
they have free tools and resources like
PDFs
it's amazing let's actually
go ahead and take a little look at this
so now that you know how content
marketing can help build a better
relationship with your prospects and
customers what steps do you take to
create a successful content marketing
plan all right there are some stuff to
get you started now if you have any
questions for me
just go ahead and comment in this video
with something appended like hey Ricky
or hi Ricky
that way I make sure that this question
is addressed to me and I'll do my best
to go ahead and answer it all right talk
to you guys later keep on learning
hey baby would be your advice for
someone trying to get involved in the
coding community quick shout-out to
device plus comm if you're interested in
the latest IOT x' hacks do-it-yourself
projects revolving around Arduino and
Raspberry Pi there's some great how-to
guides I highly encourage you to check
them out and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
