in intermediate algorithm scripting
bonfire missing letters so what are we
trying to do here essentially we're
trying to run through the string of the
alphabet sturdy and a and Z and what we
want to do is input a string and we want
to know at what point does this string
skip the next letter so if it's a BCE
right like right here we want to say oh
wait we want to return D because D is
what's missing DS the first letter
that's missing so how do we go about
doing that it's it's a it's not that
hard in reality there's probably a
couple ways to do it but um the way I
did it and I just set a variable they
called it alphabet and then I just set
it equal to the length of the elf
alphabet so a b c d e f g h i j k l m n
o p q r s t u v w x y and z that looks
about right and then I just split it
so if you don't remember what split does
it splits it based on what you input
here in this case we're splitting it
every character so there's no space
there so what else did did I do in that
I also then took our input string and I
split that as well because we're gonna
compare how we're gonna do it is we're
gonna compare a for loop that's going to
take the input of our string and we're
gonna see if it if that input matches
that so if it has an A
does the alphabet have an A on that one
okay doesn't be match is B match all the
way till we get to the D in this case
and so on and so forth so uh we aren't
split that on the character then we're
just gonna have a standard four loop
here we're so far I is equal to zero
well I is less than STR so we want to do
it for the length of the string not the
length of the alphabet because the laugh
abet is the longest and so what we only
need to do it for the size of the string
plus plus cool so well we're gonna have
a simple if statement here and that's
gonna compare them so we're gonna say if
our current string is not a current
character is not equal to our alphabets
current character
great character so if they're not equal
to each other we want to return alphabet
hi and we're returning alphabet I
because that's the one that's missing so
let's go ahead and Rena I think right
here you can see that we're still
getting it so that the standard case is
right here makes sense but we have to do
another if statement here because this
one doesn't start at a and it needs to
return undefined same thing with y&amp;amp;z so
essentially all we have to do right here
is put an if statement above it this
says if excuse me this is in the for
loop so an if statement in the for loop
above our current if statement that says
if STR at the zero index I guess we
don't have to do it in the for loop
actually is not equal to the character a
so saying if it doesn't start in the
correct order with at least starting on
an a because everything else is its it
want it it wants us to return it
undefined it's basically just what they
want us to do for me personally I think
it should return an a because if it
doesn't start with an A it's missing
today and that's search should start but
that's just me so uh it's gonna take
this weekend oops
so we can actually we don't need this in
here so let's go ahead and throw it
outside of the for loop just because I
think it's better convention and then we
can run it and again so this is checking
if our current if the string at the
first place is not equal today return
undefined and there we go pretty cool so
this is just gonna find the first
missing letter again let's just as
always put comments in our code so that
we can look back at this and understand
what we're doing and you know just fully
cement the concept in our brain so what
are we doing here
create the stream stores the alphabet
movies specific English alphabet split
split alphabet into letter character
alright so we're just splitting into an
array split input string into a
character character right you could drop
it leave a letter and then our if
statement here if our first letter is
not and a return undefined and then here
we at this point I don't think we need a
for loop let's put anything for a for
loop here we're just going to say if
letter don't match or alphabet and
string return Oh current alphabet letter
so that was that's pretty much it so
hope you guys found this helpful as
always questions comments concerns
anything constructive is appreciated and
I'll see you guys in the next video
