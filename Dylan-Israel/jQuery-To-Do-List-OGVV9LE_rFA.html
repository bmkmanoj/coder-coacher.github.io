showcasing a little bit of jQuery today
we're gonna show how to make a simple
to-do list using jQuery so you see right
here here's a perfect example we're
doing we're gonna add something using
jQuery so let's say take out the trash
we want to clean the garage so a few
things going on here but let's just go
ahead and jump right into it and we can
you know we're not gonna make it super
super intense but if you've never worked
with JavaScript in Eclipse I'm using
Eclipse tomorrow so go ahead and create
yourself a new JavaScript source file
and we're going to name this one to-do
list dot HTML oops excuse me so we want
to create a new HTML file I'm not going
to worry about CSS for this if you want
to if you want to style it style it
yourself or use something like bootstrap
to get it done so here's our standard
to-do list here we also are going to
create a new JavaScript source file and
we'll just go ahead and call this to do
the list dot j/s finish so here is we'll
just delete this code so what do we need
to do in regards to getting this set up
it's pretty straightforward first thing
we can do is just go ahead and give the
type of the page a title so it's already
in here so we'll call this - to-do list
- jQuery so there's our title so we also
want to be able to run the script
JavaScript so in order for us to do that
we have to say the script type I'm just
going to go ahead and paste this in here
so that basically gives us access to
saying read our script as text slash
JavaScript and here is the link the
source for our script
then we're gonna need to go ahead and do
the same thing for our JavaScript file
so we're gonna need to go script and
we'll set type equal to text slash Java
Script and then close it there's the
ending tag and don't forget the SRC and
that's going to be equal to two to do
list is so so far we've set up the basic
basic HTML for the to do list maybe we
want to start off by doing a little bit
more HTML to give me an h1 header here
and we'll just say to-do list and if we
really wanted to get fancy earlier I did
like this small and then we'll do - J -
jQuery
cool so we just have a h1 and a smalls
and it's art to do this go ahead and
back that up and so there's our things
so what do we want to do the way we're
going to set up our JavaScript is we're
going to create a unordered list and we
want to be able to call to it so we'll
just give a standard name like to-do
list and so we can initialize the
variable if we want but that's not what
we want to do in here generally you want
to try and have as little text as
possible and your HTML we we really want
to focus more on the JavaScript side of
things so it's a couple things we also
need to do we need to have like a a box
to put text so we need an input type so
let's go to input type and set this
equal to text because that's all we want
we also want to give it an ID and we can
set this equal to add to list so that'll
be our ID and input types are self
closing and then we also want to add a
button so to submit it so not only will
they have a box to put the text in but
we also want a button and we need we're
going to need to call to both these so
that's why we're giving them IDs and
we'll just put add on this because
that's really what the button is and
then we want some text on it we can say
add to list and if we want we can give
it a placeholder here we'll say
placeholder equals enter item to do an
actual escapa lies all those
to do okay so this is it this is all we
need for our and if we wanted to we can
probably add a br slash that so I did
earlier because it looked a little
jumbled so how do we get started on our
guess so by now we should have pretty
much a memorized how we initialize a a
JavaScript file so document dot ready
function bam bam so here we are so what
do we want to do we want to call the
click function when this is equal to ad
so first we have to call on that so we
want to say select the variable or
select the HTML element our ID ad and
when we click on it so select our button
and when you click on it we want to call
a function that's going to do some stuff
as well
all right so what is it that we want to
do so in our input type we have an ID
add to list so so here we want to take
that input and we want to store it in a
variable there's a couple different ways
to do this but this is the easiest way
way so we're gonna say of our new list
item equals you need to set it equal to
the variable in there which we named add
to list and to list did we do all
lowercase yeah we did okay so I'm
already messing up I had two lists and
then we want to get the value of it so
that we'll just set it up as a string
for us and so now we basically have a
string that's equal to our input now
what do we want to do with that well we
don't want it to just keep on adding
empty items so first thing we may want
to do is add an if statement that's
gonna check the length of this so now
list item and there I mean there's a
bunch of guess and check but for me this
is enough for right now so we're gonna
check is it greater than zero if so this
is where the code we wanted to do so so
far we've got the value of our input
we're checking to see if it's not null
or it's empty because we don't want to
add anything empty to the list and next
we want to add to our to-do list so
remember here we created our to-do list
ul so we want to append to that and add
an li instance so let's go ahead we
called that the to-do list alright so
we're gonna select to-do list and we're
gonna dot append so we're going to add
some stuff to it and what do we want to
have we want to add a list object but we
also want to add the new list item
and then we of course you have to close
it so here we are here we got a new list
item and we've added it so let's go
ahead and continue on here and we'll
test all this out in a second but so we
check it's it's not empty we append it
so that it adds a new list item to the
list what else can we do
there's a bunch of things you can do but
for the the only other thing we're gonna
do is we're gonna make it so that it
clears the input bar otherwise it just
keep on having the same input and that's
not really what we want we want it to
want to look somewhat good so if we add
take out garbage it's not just gonna
keep on saying take out garbage and work
this way oh we won't be able to double
click to add it twice accidentally or
anything like that so what we're gonna
do is this was add to list so we're
gonna select add to this and we are all
now going to dot Val and well same thing
here except now when we expect it it's
going to let when we put in the
parameter it's gonna override it so
first it's going to add it to the list
and then it's going to override the
placeholder or the enough placeholder
but the value that's in there so it's
gonna clear up so let's go back and see
where we're at so this was if you don't
know to have realize how to run this you
can go to wherever your workspaces so
here for me it's users Dylan workspace
flat jQuery to-do list is you know so
properties so just go ahead and copy the
location and then you just have to add
the throw it in the bar here so
there's that slash oops you want to you
want a slash to do this HTML so there it
is there's our to-do list enter I don't
to do there's our placeholder and our
button and so if this is working
properly
and it seems to be it's not going to
automatically add it so let's go ahead
and like I said this isn't perfect but
let's do a how to add some spaces and so
it's still not going at it which is good
I believe so alright now let's just put
a garbage take out garbage so okay so
something's not working so what is going
on here
so let's check our work here we have add
to list we are selecting our ad
and to item to do so we're trying to
upend it so
let's see if that will fix it so refresh
our page so we're still having an issue
here so have to do list IJ yes I think I
found where my heir was when we were
comparing the length of the text we
actually forgot to put the dot length
function on it so I I'm not sure but I
believe that maybe where we were having
an issue so we'll just put D had two
lists oh my god that's not it
I was going on here so I have a earlier
example here and when I refer to that
was the one that we did so we're seeing
our new list item text dot append oh my
air I assumed main tears I forgot to
tell this to name that properly so
hopefully this will fix it so little
areas like these still not adding it so
this is why you need to follow standard
naming conventions take a second here
and I noticed that I accidentally
probably not accidentally added a
capital L here and didn't do it over
here so now I'm hoping twelve hours
later there we go so now we can add to
add to it and in this case when we
refresh it because we're not storing
anything and database is just pure HTML
we're gonna do take out the garbage add
to list and you can see here it cleans
it out and puts the the old placeholder
in so that was a bit of our let's make a
from scratch jQuery to-do list and of
course you could probably add a delete
method and you could add it a you know a
user account you could do all this crazy
stuff but this is our standard basic
create a to-do list in jQuery so in the
next video I'll either elaborate more on
this or maybe create a shopping cart
type of thing where it will actually
calculate your prices as well as you go
so I'll see you guys
