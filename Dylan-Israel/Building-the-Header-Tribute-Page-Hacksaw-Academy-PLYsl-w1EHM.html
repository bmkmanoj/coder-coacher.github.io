and let them know that I sent you just
by clicking the link it was appreciated
and will help them sponsor more videos
in the future which means more great
content so let's get started we're going
to be jumping into landing page building
the header so we're gonna looks like
pretty straightforward use a channel to
build a header for the landing page I
kind of messed up in the first two
sections so I'm a little excited we're
going to be doing a lot more CSS and I'm
typically used to so let's say I've got
kind of summarize what it's telling us
here basically your HTML tag is the tag
opening HTML tag and closing HTML tag
that everything goes within of the HTML
document we then have the head tag where
you put things like the name of the
title may be an icon if you want that
but mainly just some resources such as
CSS JavaScript files fonts all that sort
of stuff now let's go ahead and change
our HTML here and we're gonna create a
body tag now the body is typically where
you put all of your content and so we're
gonna have attack an h1 tag here as well
and if you remember correctly the h1 tag
is actually the largest of the headings
and that goes all the way down to h6 so
to see this h4 tag we're about to create
all your feline needs take care of I
think they mean taken care of but again
this is just a beta so you know well let
that slide a little bit and then this is
the next one where I messed up so we get
started here so we're going to go ahead
and display these in line so we're going
to target the h1 and you can target
multiple multiple tags or multiple IDs
or tie
by just putting a comma between them so
maybe in this case we're on target h 1
and h 4 let's go ahead and zoom in real
quick before I forget and we're going to
say look we want h1 tags and h4 tags to
have the same exact styling so let's go
ahead and display them in line and now
you'll see that these h1 tags by default
normally on different lines are now on
the same so next we're going to go ahead
and build the header so we're going to
credit div within our our body here and
let's go ahead and close this div and
you know why we're at it I don't think
we're going to be touching JavaScript so
we'll go ahead and close that as well
you can see right here if you didn't
notice that you can move these around as
well really helpful kind of reminds me
of code pin which everyone should be
familiar with to a degree so we're
creating a header here just a div class
called header and now we're going to
target that in our CSS here and if you
remember when dealing with classes its
dots and ids are hashtags I just made
that mistake the other day so I am just
gonna let y'all know not to make that
alright so we're going to set the color
here now you can set color in the
various ways they have us doing it in
the cygnus call the hexadecimal you'd
also just do it in the word so with like
we could do black for instance but let's
just go ahead and put it back to it and
you could also do rgba our RGB so it's
going to do color now this color you may
sink oh we're setting the background cup
the background here is what we're
setting and in color we're actually
going to set the content here so such as
the h1 so that's what we're targeting
here within our div class so you'll see
right here are some other examples blue
green red white grey and black if you
these are kind of the more common ones
and they tell you to go to color hex com
if you're trying to find out what it is
that you're looking to target so now
we're going to add some more CSS and
we're going to go ahead and target the
body and because the body is a built-in
element of HTML
don't need to use a daughter a hashtag
or anything like that because it's not a
class or a ID so we're going to give it
a margin of zero so you'll see by
default margin has a little bit of
padding right here on their body has a
little bit of padding so we're going to
take that away we don't want that and
then we want to change the font family
font family is just like anything like a
cursive or a you know Times New Roman
whatever you want so we're gonna give it
the the built-in browser cursive there's
about 10 or 12 different types of fonts
that are built in and cursive is one of
them all right next up in our in our
HTML we're going to create a div here
called header inner so we're going to
start nesting our divs here so this is
equal to header dash and of course make
sure you don't make any mistakes like
I'm making right now with your
quotations go ahead and close this dip /
div alright so looks like we're just
creating the class here that will going
to be doing some stuff too so let's jump
back down here and typically when you're
doing your CSS you want to kind of keep
it in order so you'll see right here we
have header so we want to put right
below it header dash dinner that way we
can kind of know what's targeting a
target even those users aren't
necessarily identically related if it
was header and I headed a shiner I
imagine this will be helpful down the
road because they're the real typical
isn't probably somewhat similar padding
so we're add padding here of 0 and then
20 PX so pad oops don't save it that
have it so padding is gonna basically
padding is on the inside of the element
Y margin is on the outside so you'll see
right here we're gonna give a little bit
of margin 0 auto and we haven't really
done anything with this yet so it may
not look like it's doing too much
and then we're going to give it a max
width of 800 pixels so we don't want it
to be any bigger than that head ignition
or header dash in here and then you'll
know sending padding this is shorthand
for 0 20 0 20 or the equivalent of
padding desktop padding dash right
padding dash bottom padding this low so
yeah there's a lot of shorthand CSS and
that's basically what's telling you
about here and it's kind of important to
know so if you see anyone else to CSS
you'll kind of understand how it works
and why it does what it's doing so now
we're going to go ahead and add a border
to this header inner so we can go ahead
and do border and we're going to add a
one pixel border that's of the type
solid and with the color whatever this
is and so you'll see right here we now
have this color red right here it'll
kind of show you that the div is working
kind of nicely so very nice we going to
rerun that nothing to rerun it's going
to go next step now CSS inline-block man
is something you're going to be using
quite a bit so let's go ahead and in our
h 1 and h 4 elements what we want to do
here is change do they want us to change
it yep so they wants to change it from
instead of in line to inline dash block
all right to do so add the following to
your CSS file so now we're going to
actually target the H 1 and H for
individually and again you're going to
want to keep it next to each other just
so that you know what's going on because
you want to jump around find out why
your CSS CSS isn't working so we're
going to add 20 pixels to the right of
the h1 oops keep something this is like
copán it's like autosave so and then
we're going to do the same thing for h4
in which except we're going to add font
ash wait normal so that's gonna make it
less bold enough for weight is basically
the thickness how how intense you want
it to be and there's a couple different
parameters for that if you want to look
up more about font dash wait go ahead
and check up the the section on w3
schools it's a lot of great CSS in there
oh man and I think we finished so we did
that pretty quickly nine minutes and
what they estimated to be 40 so so far
you saw us building a header and using a
lot of CSS this is really something
about liking about a hacksaw Academy is
actually showing us a relevant CSS that
you'll be using when you design your own
website so hope you guys have been
enjoying this hacksaw Academy landing
page up next will be actually building
out the page content as well as putting
the finishing touches on it so make sure
to keep keep keep up with this and we'll
be putting out more and if you like this
