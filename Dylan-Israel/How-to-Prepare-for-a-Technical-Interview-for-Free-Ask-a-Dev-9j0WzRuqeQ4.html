pretty realistic skill that you need as
a developer I about twenty thirty
minutes ago I took a technical interview
for a recruiting agency that asked me to
take one see if they wanted to turn find
me a job and to be honest with you I
bombed it I was historically do very
poorly on these I get very nervous I I
have kind of anxiety about it and and I
you know they're it's not my strong suit
to be honest with you I tried to do
better I've been practicing on code
fights to do such things but there was
three three three problems I didn't even
get the first one done why the other
person is watching and give you
encouraging advices she was very nice
but I won't talk to you about technical
interviews today the reason is that
technical interviews are pretty
practical part of getting your first
developer job and a lot of times those
are algorithm base and they can vary
some are easier for for me some are hard
for me in this example that I crumbled
and failed was a Sudoku solver scene if
it was correct or not essentially had a
nine by nine grid with values in there
three by three by three and so it was
whatever nine times nine times nine is
value Samiha to uh to be nine times nine
so there's 81 total values and you have
to basically see is this a correct
solution or not and I couldn't get the
last part in the time allotted but more
than just me failing I want to tell you
why you need to be prepared and why I
did prepare right I did prepare because
I've been studying algorithms for I've
sold 75 algorithms like code fights in
the last month or so and really it's a
three weeks so I'm doing my best by
preparing and looking at things and what
one thing I want to talk to you about is
a site called primp recently I
interviewed the the CEO of the company
and what primp is is a a free technical
interview site for people who are trying
to get those skills up so that and the
white white get it up like even even if
you are like for me I get very nervous
it's always been effect with me is back
to when I was in school I would crumble
a little bit and get overwhelmed they
don't perform to my fullest and it's
something that I need to get more
comfortable with and that feeling
definitely came across well while I was
having my technical interview because
you know you got some was essentially
watching over so they're not being mean
or anything but it's it's nerve-racking
for me so print is like a cool free
service where you can find someone to
who is an expert and what let's say you
want a JavaScript technical interview
it's a great place for you to go and
have a mock technical interview for free
you sign up and hopefully you'll if you
can provide a technical interview and
you can kind of see it like here it'll
be some sort of JavaScript or not
JavaScript but it'll be a maybe a
question and a you'll have one person on
the other end you'll be on this end and
they'll be giving you a algorithm you
can solve it in the language of your
choice and go from there now for me this
is I've always been really uncomfortable
with technical interviews I much prefer
they just send me an algorithm leave me
alone and I will try and solve it once
someone's on the other side it's oh my
god I feel almost embarrassed sort of
thing but it's it's unfortunate because
I don't necessarily believe it's the
best way to test developers that could
just because I'm bad at them but so
maybe advice but I think that it will I
think that it's an it's a OS a necessary
evil but it is the way of the world in
terms of interviewing software
developers and and getting them to to be
to see if they are qualified it's the
current best way that's doing it and for
me to tell you like hey it sucks
don't bother is it a correct solution I
want to give practical advice
and in my advice here is practice
practice practice in this case I did
poorly in a mock interview but by me
failing I learned a lot I also got over
a little bit of anxiety of mock
interviews it'll probably be a little
bit less I'll still have it things like
that but print is another great way that
you can do it and similar to your phone
interview the advice I gave where you
need to practice practice practice this
is another thing that you can practice
along the way if you don't want to go
maybe or maybe you're too intimidated go
on a free service like cramp you're like
oh my god
there's gonna be a senior developer on
the other end I'm going to embarrass
myself I get it I get all that because
that's how I feel right so it's that if
you're in the same boat as me what you
can do is you could have a friend who's
a developer on the other end and they
could maybe they have a solution to an
algorithm that you think is a decently
hard one to pick up pick a good one off
code fight for instance that a friend of
salt or you assault and have them say
okay or that you haven't solved rather
the feeds the point have them say okay
let's see if you can solve this and
we'll do you know typically you get like
an hour or an hour and a half to solve
three that's usually been my experience
and go through the process so it feels
more natural but do you prepare for your
technical interviews I've been preparing
just in case I ever need it I'm trying
to work on creating content as well and
I was glad that I had the mock technical
interview because if I ever need to take
a real one it's a little bit more
experienced in my belt and maybe I'll do
much better a little bit better and I
plan to continue to do them as well even
now though I feel kind of like a loser
to be honest with you but I'm glad I'm
glad I did it I will continue to do
these mock interviews as much as I can
while still studying and still it can be
good feedback and things like that so
that's my two cents guys I hope that you
are trying to I hope you're one you're
studying algorithms because you're
not you're going too hard timeline a
junior developer role or senior
developer role for that matter for your
junior developer - I hope you're
practicing the mock technical interviews
because it is it's it's the way of the
world I don't necessarily agree with it
again I could be biased I understand
that if I was killing it maybe I would
say the same I don't know a better way
to test somebody other than it maybe
have them walk me through their source
code and or have them recreate something
they've made that say ok this your code
cool let me take your coat and let me
see you recreate it so that might be one
way but anyhow guys that's my two cents
I don't know if I'm trying to vent or
actually give advice it's one or the
other but as always thank you for
watching don't forget to check our
Facebook page code tech and caffeine if
you want to support me you can at
patreon.com slash covert Orioles 360 I
hope you guys are working hard I'm
working hard it feels kind of shitty
right now be honest with you but here we
are we're grinding it out man who you're
one part of the grind you grind to the
nether part it's always a little bit of
a grind so I'll stay motivated guys stay
hungry stay coated daily everything can
I'll see you guys the next video
hey guys thanks for watching the video
special thanks to our sponsors dev
Mountain if you look for a coding
bootcamp or tuition and housing is
included definitely check them out
appreciate it and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
