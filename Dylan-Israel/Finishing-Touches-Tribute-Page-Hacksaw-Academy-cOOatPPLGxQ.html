back in hacksaw Academy we are finishing
up the landing page special thanks to
them for sponsoring this video it's
really appreciated and if you want to
learn more about HTML Javascript CSS and
a project based environment definitely
check them out in the cards annotation
and description below so we're on
finishing touches here the last sprint
and it looks like we're going to add a
way for users to contact us so let's go
ahead and jump right in so ever heading
we have our little cat Center images and
just so you know a little bit of fun fun
our background rather this little fat
cat um let's get started finishing
touches get in touch paragraph we want
how to know the users telling them to
get in touch beneath our images alright
so we're going to go ahead beneath the
images have a paragraph here with class
emphasize text so let's go ahead and
jump into our HTML here did want to be
with inside the div I don't think so
alright so I'm not a hundred percent
sure but I think it wants to be outside
the dish so we'll go ahead and throw it
in like so very cool we want this
particular paragraph to have a little
more emphasis to that let's make it the
text bit larger and darker okay so we're
going to see a little bit of CSS when it
comes to font and styling I'm go ahead
and do it like so so do dot and size
dash text and let's pull up the text so
that we can see exactly what we're
changing so this is our class remember
class is denoted by a dot and the
hashtag is for a ID so we're going to
set the color of it equal to 28 to see
to a which looks to be like a darker
black and then we're going to do the
font size we're going to make a little
bit bigger and we're going to make that
18px and I see why it's not taking
effect so make sure you spell everything
correctly there we go so now there's our
font size and then font weight we're
gonna go ahead and make that bold and
there's a couple different properties
that you can set for font weight I don't
remember it off the top of my head but
definitely look into that as well so
you'll see we made this a little bit
bolder it's a little bit stands out
quite a bit it's a little too near to
the images so it looks like that's what
we're going to be doing here so clearing
floats we already have the top and
bottom padding on the images so why the
text why is the text but needs it so
close to it that's because the images
container is floated which means the
container no longer notice how tall it
should be we need to clear the flows to
give their container the right height
the easiest way to do this is with the
overflow auto so we want to jump into
the image class and we want to go ahead
and set overflow to auto and that should
take that should give us a little bit
more of padding as you can just see
right there so contact the link so we
want to add a button now that when they
click it's gonna populate the user's
email now if you're not familiar with
this you can actually just do this in a
simple anchor tag and you just start off
with male 2 colon and then the email
that you want them to mail it to and
then if you do target equal blanco open
up in a new window as well so it's
pretty simple to create a like email
link for your webpage if you're not
familiar with that in this case we're
just going to create a simple p class
we're going to go ahead and put it
outside here paragraph excuse me and
you'll see this get in touch link
if you hover over you'll see middle to
Hacksaw academy we're not going to click
it because we're doing the video and all
that but definitely keep that in the
back of your mind if you ever need you
that for your own website which I just
did on mine actually so that's kind of
why it's so fresh so now let's go ahead
and style the link so open up our CSS
here and let's jump in and it's a male
underscore male dash us and in here oh
I've never used tech decoration oh maybe
I have so this is how you remove the I
think I've done in a different way that
I think I did style none so you'll see
there now it's not underlined anymore if
we use the text decoration I imagine
that there's quite a bit going on with
that as well so now we want to make it
look more like a button typically I
would probably have used bootstrap to do
this but they're definitely trying to
show us what's going on in those button
classes so pretty straightforward we're
just going to set a background color
this is exactly what is going on in your
like you might use like btn-primary in a
bootstrap class and so it look we set a
background all right cool um doesn't
really necessarily look like button so
much but now let's add some padding
we're gonna add 10 pixels all around and
then we're going to go ahead and add 30
pixels here so it's like lengthen width
and then it transfer it goes I think it
was a top and bottom and then right and
left that's what the that's going on so
it's basically like going 1030 1030 for
the if you were to type it out well this
is a shorthand and everything's better
in program is your hand so for the color
we're gonna change it to white very nice
i'm going to go ahead and set a border
radius here border radius is will make
it curve and we're just going to put it
at five pixels so now it looks much
better and much more like a button so
that says that's as easy it is to make
button so we want to go ahead and add a
male container class now to our CSS and
let's go ahead and do this and then
we're going to do text dash align center
cool so that's centered and now we're
going to go ahead and add a margin of 40
pixels 0 and then 80 80 pixels and
that's just going to give it a little
bit spacing all around it like so keep
in mind that if you're doing zero you
don't actually have to put the PX on
there 0 will be fine as it is now
another way of making something bold is
to use strong so let's go back to our
before and after you'll see right here
is if we then open up our HTML and we're
like we want to just make this specific
thing bold you go ahead and just put the
strong tag on it x and so you'll see
this is much bolder than this one now
we're going to go ahead and add the same
thing here as well now again looks
probably a bunch of different way so you
can kind of make this bold or strong I
think of is bold there may be something
technically different about it i don't
know but you'll see that all in all
you'll know the effect right here so
lots of cool stuff a lot of CSS which is
really appreciated because it's always
been one of the areas that I've kind of
lacked in in web development which is
why I've really like these hacks all
academy projects it forces me to kind of
okay was textin equation do what is you
know a lot of these you will use once or
twice and forget about so it's good to
have quite a nice a nice refresher
course so lots of cool stuff I
thoroughly enjoyed these projects
definitely check out hacks academy and
we'll go ahead and look at the other
projects that i have here you can do a
to-do list portfolio page working with
api's and a lot of people struggle with
that sometimes interactive quiz database
app video editor preforms control paint
clone they're always adding new stuff so
