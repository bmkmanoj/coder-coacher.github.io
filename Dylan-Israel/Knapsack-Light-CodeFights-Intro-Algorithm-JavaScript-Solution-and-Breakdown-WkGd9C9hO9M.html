in code fights the intro section dark
wilderness doing knapsack light so what
is the objective here there's a lot you
get 5 parameters here so it gets kind of
lot if and else if it's how I did this
you just have to kind understand what
they're asking so let's break down the
problem we have two items both items
have a weight and they have a value and
we want to what the maximum total value
of items we can take with us assuming
your max weight capacity that's our max
W so essentially what item can we take
back and what or what's the value that
we can take back based off of how much
we can carry now the first thing and if
you just kind of think logically about
it's not too bad right so the first
thing is I try to put some comments
otherwise it might get a little little
loopy can we carry both items right
because if we can't carry both items
meaning if weight 1 plus weigh 2 is less
than or equal to rather less than or
equal to our max weight if we carry both
items then we can return both values or
we can return the greatest value which
is value 1 plus value 2 now the next
thing that we can check is is weight is
the weight one can we carry weight one
but we can't carry weight two if that's
the case then we can return value one
because the first can't the first item
we can't carry a second item we can then
we'll do the same thing I'm sorry can we
carry item one
but not item two and if that's the case
there are an else--if up here let's say
look if weight to simply weight 1 is
less than or equal to our max weight and
weight 2 is greater than our max weight
then obviously we'd only be able to
carry the weight 1 item X just so we
would return value 1
all right now we just have to do the
next I'll set which yeah ditto item 2
but not iodine 1
so can we carry item 2 but can we not
carry item 1 now if that's the case so
if weight - we can carry but we don't
have enough room to carry weight 1 or we
will have space rather go ahead and
return value - all right now
the last elsif before we hit and else is
what happens if both items are too heavy
so if they're both too heavy we can't
carry either either and we return we
return zero so if weight one is greater
than max W and weight two is greater
than the max late go ahead and return
zero all right and then finally our last
else statement the else statement was
going to have an if if-else statement in
it and it's going to check say hey if
value 2 is greater than value 1 return
value 2 else return value 1
and the idea here is that we're checking
to see if it's only one can fit they
both can fit we're just checking which
value is greater in this case we can
actually get rid of the same and we can
just make this a ternary statement and
when you say look value 2 we don't
actually need that value 2 greater than
value 1 if that's true go ahead and
return value 2 else return value 1
and let's run our test assuming no
syntax there and we're done so a lot of
if you've ever played any video games
this should have been pretty lame
fighting RPGs like some Skyrim or some
so where they make you manage your
inventory or you can only carry some
weight set certain amount of weight on
your items start affecting your stats
everything here should have been pretty
intuitive you just have to kind of
juggle five parameters and break it down
piece by piece and go from there but as
always guys thank you for watching the
video this will snaps AK light if you
won't support me at patreon or you want
to join our Facebook page or you want to
join our discord Channel all those links
are in the description below I'll see
you guys in the next video thank you so
much for watching hey guys thanks for
watching the video special thanks to our
sponsors dev Mountain if you're looking
for a coding boot camp for tuition and
housing is included definitely check
them out
appreciate it I'll see you guys in the
next video
