a home office PC tour so I'm going to do
it all in one video real quick this is
my place of residence also called home a
couple pictures up on the wall
April is having dinner and watching TV
we got our futon out here they used to
be in my office
the the game systems are ps4 pro and
Nintendo classic TV is 55 inch 4k I've
treated myself to that on Black Friday
this was our dining table but we kind of
gave up on it I eat at my desk this is
my boy ha this is the teats hey buddy
this is over here we have the kind of a
cat our April a sir she studies her coat
all that sort of good stuff and then the
massage chair which was an anniversary
present to April and myself I used it
too then we have Achilles turn what
around you think I should turn like
right now no throw a lot back out I over
here this would probably be the dining
area we made it into a little home gym
and more s'more pictures if you guys
want to see the good old days this this
photo we're in Catalina
I think this photo I'm on the way back
after getting sunburned at Catalina
we're snowboarding that is classic tito
right there I believe we're in New
Orleans here this is that April's
graduation this is at a Christmas in
which all the gifted me was energy
drinks because that's just how we roll
sometimes ah
yeah acai like got'em add the bargain
bent and she drinks
oh you prepared to be impressed voila
magic right a pretty standard kitchen
nothing crazy right
fridge sink dishwasher um you'll notice
that I have my my coating posters in the
hallway here washer and dryer bought us
a washer and dryer recently
we're actually this weekend going to
Ikea to add a guest bed in here maybe
well Airbnb it or rent it out or just
have something for when family comes to
visit my bathroom it's right here
another not so special the the knob on
here is too short I'm 6 feet tall and it
sucks so I had to get a new one over
here and then Chuck Norris photo in the
bathroom because we'll tell you guys
that story later the office my where I
spend probably if I'm not sleeping I'm
most likely in the office so you got a
little bit of soundproofing going on
over here mainly for the swagger we got
the the green 3 wall a couple lights
that are kind of pulling out of place
you know you'll see we have the the
whiteboard for when I'm trying to solve
algorithms closet nothing nothing
special over here so where the magic
happens I've treated myself to a new
desk chair when we moved we have the
essential oil diffuser got a video on
coding right now the the blue Yeti for
the microphone the graphics card in the
PC is the GTX 1080 TI and I think it's a
8 gig 4.4 gigahertz processor with 2
terabytes of 2 terabyte hard drive for
4k monitors Oh some cool stuff over here
we have a mask my dad brought me a book
my dad made which was photos that he
took ladies that concert that's David
Bowen there over here we have a
a a vase I made in my only clay class in
high school summer class then we have a
volunteer certificate free code camp
front end certificate it's hard to kind
of see but here we have Tryndamere from
League of Legends next to the root beer
bottles and we have rise over there in
the corner if your League of Legends
sent April and I got that when we went
to the season 2 World Finals God maybe
four years ago five years ago however
olan's April's bathroom she liked my
shower heading so much
she stole my swagger although hers is
nicer and then a little bit of a vanity
here her closet and then where the magic
happens this is also where all the cats
sleep you can see they dragged on the
toy up here we got mr. Milo hey buddy oh
and yeah so a king-sized bed nothing
crazy
yeah that's me that's the house that's
the office I normally don't do too many
sort of vlogs or public things but uh a
lot better than where we came two years
ago so two years ago we were in the
middle of the grind of you know
delivering pizzas and and maybe a little
longer than two years so two and a half
three years ago we're delivering pizzas
unemployed but worked hard that's still
working hard plenty of web developers
the best of my ability and been rewarded
to be able to not have a microwave in
the bedroom in the kitchen in the
bedroom and other things and get more
cat so as you can tell I like cats so if
I ever buy a place I'll probably get a
cat one or two more cats yes that's me
that's the house how many guys ask to
the house in the office a couple times
so it's some kind of crazy because we
have a lot of extra space here that we
don't need but compared to LA we're
paying about half of what we would here
and so for an extra hundred bucks you
get an extra
room that we could have just for guests
it's kind of a crazy thing because I
would never happened in Los Angeles
I'm originally from so definitely look
out for if you're if you're kind of
thinking hey I don't want to leave a big
city you might want to reconsider it
even if it's just for a few years
because you the amount of money you
might be able to save and invest say for
your future start a business
Justin rent alone and cost a living can
I get off topic but just a little some
food for thought its kind of what I'm
trying to do right now so as always guys
thank you for watching I hope you found
a little bit of my life interesting a
little bit of it maybe inspirational for
those of you who remember the microwave
remember the grind the coding in the
closets all this ourselves so I hope you
