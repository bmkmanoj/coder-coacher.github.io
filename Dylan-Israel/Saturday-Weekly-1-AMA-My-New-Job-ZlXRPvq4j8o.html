everybody to the new I would say
improved but we haven't done it before
but the new weekly lectures so we're
going to be doing a weekly live stream
we're basically we talked about whatever
has happened that week whatever has gone
on my life in terms of coding software
all that great stuff so I'm happy to to
answer any any questions you have then
kind of it's been a crazy couple two
weeks between just sort of wrapping up
my current job moving to a new workplace
starting Monday the hurricane I'm kind
of sick I've all this stress of what's
going on I think has kind of overwhelmed
my immune system and so I'm I'm getting
over a cold right now I've been having
this real stomach virus / head cold
going on I'm hoping to go in a hundred
percent though on Monday don't want to
show up stick on the first day of work
and it's not a good look you know but
I'm very very excited so submit come on
I think it's your audio that's not
working man everyone seriously do it oh
right on mine was my new job I'll be
doing front-end for a marketing company
a very large marketing company they
basically market health and beauty
products so yeah I'm I probably do a
video about I don't want necessarily
make it about me but the benefits of
working on a small team versus a large
team I'll probably do a small team first
because that's what I'm most familiar
with I'll be going to work with a large
team Mike my current work which I think
they have 20 and they're going up to 80
or they have 40 and they're going up to
80 developers something like that so
lots of lots of things can be learned
when you're going from a three
four-person team to a 10-person team and
there's multiple groups of 10% teams a
lot of times what happens is is that you
have a lot more control we have a lot
more control in smaller teams and you're
a little bit more specialized in the
larger teams so yeah we're good men
we just said throw some food out from
the hurricane
just because the power went out but we
left we went to motel 6 I can't wait I'm
actually gonna edit it today I have the
you guys really will have to watch what
sort of mission it was to get to motel 6
in New Orleans and back and the
shenanigans that went on you guys are
gonna see the very first you never seen
you've never stayed at such a fancy
place before where you have a ceiling
fountain I bet you didn't even know that
was the thing a ceiling fountain alright
so look forward to seeing that it's one
of a kind all right your JavaScript
algorithms gave me a huge breakthrough a
JavaScript thank you so much I'm grad no
Nora I'm glad they helped if you're
looking I don't know if you're talking
about the free code camp ones or the
code fight ones but I highly encourage
you to to check them both out and work
through them as well I think it really
helps becoming familiar with how to
think like a like a developer in terms
of just pure JavaScript and also it
helps you helps you become more familiar
with the the language and and what sort
of methods are available for you
yeah I have about 40 or 50 or 60 uh-huh
algorithms up for four code fights as
well
how much JavaScript should I know before
learning angular 4 hmm how much
JavaScript do you know finished what
project Jamal he suggested I see
motivated to code well try to find
what's fun about coding for you I really
think you should have to you really need
to figure out what makes software fun
for you and for me it's YouTube and I
mean I enjoy it all but YouTube's the
part that I enjoy the most and when you
do get burnt out I have a video coming
out on Monday talking about the
importance of taking breaks and how to
sort of understand that you need to take
them in web development or I don't know
talk about like week-long breaks I'm
talking like one or two day breaks but
the importance of that and I encourage
you to watch that I talked about some of
the ways I do and I recommend some books
that I read us a hobby and some games
that I play and just things that I spent
maybe an hour every other week but just
enough to kind of take me out of the
sort of mindset but for you I would say
start a side project something that's
yours something that your baby that you
can you can build off of like something
that it's a long-term project that you
enjoy doing and that you can turn a
profit with and once you make a little
bit of money is really much more
enjoyable in terms of that sense but
remember why you're learning and try to
start a side project because not only
will help you in your career also just
help you enjoy a lot more because it's
you bit passionate about it and also
also I would say find what you enjoy
maybe you enjoyed the more social aspect
of going to the meetups
the Facebook groups the you know the the
chats on whatever it is so it really
depends on on what you enjoy but find
that because you're always going to be
writing code now find the thing where
it's coding related that makes you love
it and for me it's YouTube I can't
understand how people like the meetups
I love the meetups I just haven't had as
much time to go to as many I normally
try to go to about two months I haven't
gone to one in about six to eight weeks
so I would say find your sort of side
project and then also finds the ASP
because there's a lot of different stuff
and to help you out with that you'll see
the super super confidential list here
your boys working on the list of 50
different types of side projects that
you can get I did I finish the final
project for Udacity no I have not
I'm I'm like I'm still in the reduction
I haven't I haven't touched it in about
two weeks because everything has been
going on but all that's linked not
probably not next week but the weekend
going into next week assuming that
everything goes well at my new work
because that's my priority I'll jump in
and knock out the Redux section
we're not buy all my shirts you know I
would tell you but they won't sponsor me
so jinx.com is where these shirts all
cover and I have to say all these shirts
that you guys have seen are like four
years old and they're all holding
together pretty well
but you know this is like a I had a very
awkward conversation I so I wear a lot
of gaming shirts as you guys see it's
pretty much all I wear gaming and coding
shirts and I April and I went grocery
shopping last night and there's a very
awkward out of World of Warcraft shirt
on and there's very awkward guy who was
who was saw my World of Warcraft shirt
and and he starts having all these
philosophical Congress
he's like he's one of those guys who's
awkward and trying not to be awkward and
he goes he's just on my long lines of do
you play any other blizzard properties
and he says it like this right like I'm
not just you know like a lot of hand
movements and in this sort of not
flamboyant but very almost comical way
and I was like yeah you know I played
Starcraft and I've played Warcraft and
in Diablo and he goes yes uh would you
say that Starcraft is your favorite RTS
and I'm like now you know it's probably
work at any any sure it's uh he starts
going on he's like he's like he goes uh
Warcraft he starts going he's like you
know would you say with the races of all
the in Warcraft that they are catering
to a certain another are you getting
what I'm slight is slinging here and I
was just like uh you have some sort of
undertone going on right now man but I I
don't I'm not I'm not getting he's like
that's alright ain't just any how so the
point I was trying to make was when
April I left the grocery store and this
by the way this is not an uncommon thing
to happen because I wear gaming shirts
all the timings like nine times out of
ten of a mass of texture and on or
something it's always say a man not sure
I said thank you right um but about one
out of ten I get one of those sort of
really really awkward guys that are just
all over the place right I don't mind
but it's always kind of awkward but uh
the reason I bring that up is that was
an awkward individual trying not to be
awkward and I I commend him for that
right he's trying to break out of his
shell and it's very easy because that's
his world to do that and I I ain't
commend him for its first stepping out
of the shell even though it's incredibly
awkward for everybody else it's fine you
need work on communication skills so I
was telling April that she thinks I have
very poor communication skills most of
the time and my entire family thinks I'm
an introvert and there's some true
that but I would say that this
individual probably makes up a solid 40
percent of developers I've worked with
in the past of terms of communication
skills so if you and the reason I
brought that up to it was to really make
a point of how communication as a
developer is so important because a lot
of developers are really really awkward
and bad and not to not to like on
him or anything like that I'm just using
him as an example obviously we don't I
can't like point them out I wouldn't but
just something I wanted to say um I
would definitely recommend getting an
internship over freelancing for a junior
role I I did get a new job yes I'll be
uh I'll be working as a front end
individual at a marketing company for
health and beauty products how much is
your salary I don't have a problem
saying that but I don't know that my my
employers would appreciate it so uh I
I'm not gonna answer that I will say
that I am being compensated more and
various aspects than my previous role
and my previous role paid pretty well so
I got more pay I got a bonus structure
and I got about an extra week in of PTO
I'll have about 20 days of PTL after
everything's said and done which is
quite a bit so I'll tell yous the PTO I
have a bonus structure and I'm making a
little bit a little bit more money than
I was before
yeah I got the cash you he's the the the
bagger at Publix be like bitch it ain't
no I wasn't that look Jeannie develop
for now did you
Jimmy advice for someone who's
self-employed who doesn't lean towards
design for web development when it seems
like design is so important I can tell
you right now I suck at design I suck at
CSS and there's plenty of people that go
into that for you before you go into
that that skillset there's UI and UX
guys and you ought it depends right a
lot of times is nor hi what happens is
maybe it's important depending on what
you're kind of currently qualify for but
as you move up to working with
frameworks and and back-end and stuff
like that it becomes less so because
your your role becomes more specialized
he also depends what type of role you're
in right if you're working at us at a
shop that all they do is build you know
basic web applications websites for
customers you may run into a little bit
an issue
um Pro Set cons of angular first react
something something i I I made a video
about I don't think I ever released it
though does anyone here to remember if I
release it I know I made the video but I
think I accidentally deleted I want to
wipe my hard drive so I would say two
things and I'm talking about angular 4
and react so in terms of what I'm
learning is react and the reason for
that is two things is one I want to
learn something new
from a very practical standpoint when it
became apparent that I was going to
start accepting job offers and looking
for work and things like that and I
thought that hey I've angularjs
experience and maybe that would be
enough to give me an angular 4 role but
I don't have any react experience and
that that's going to be a little bit
harder of a cell so from practical
standpoint that's why I chose react now
also when it comes to react it's not as
heavy as angular for angular 4 is really
built for enterprise production like
massive applications there's very few
people building just fun little angular
4 projects it's not built for that but
react has a little bit more of a fun
it's like if you go up and look up like
get up statistics about what people are
putting in their github it's like 90
percent react versus angular 4 but so
that's really where my thought process
came from what I asked you why I chose
react is I want to learn something new I
wanted something that was going to help
expand my skill set in terms of the
JavaScript frameworks and then I also
wanted something I could build other
projects in an angular for having dived
into react and angular for a little bit
kind of lean towards react now when
learning both I think in comparison I
think both are great in terms of the
work world and I know at my current work
I'm excited to dive into angular for a
little bit more we are currently in
angularjs shocked with but we're moving
to angular for I believe in the next six
months so we'll be doing some reworks
and new applications and stuff in
angular 4 so I'm excited about that I
just happened to choose react because I
wanted something slightly different and
a practical standpoint I I would say
however choose whichever ones you would
I would do both if I had to say go to
one way it would be react but the hard
part about both of these frameworks
right now is
that they're very new and so trying to
find up-to-date material for cheap and
free not always the best thing I could
tell you that one of the biggest
benefits of the Udacity and a degree is
that everything is current with a saw
I'm doing it and there's so many little
libraries and frameworks that unless you
were a reactive elder or you had a
reactive helper friend who is mentoring
you you wouldn't even know existed and
you'd never have been exposed to so they
expose you to a lot of these little mini
libraries that people use that are
commonplace and react and same thing
happens when you're working with like
node and Express as well where you're
like okay how do I do authentication
okay well you got to use passport okay
how do I do
how will how is how do i do MongoDB okay
well you should install Mongoose and so
we're becoming a lot more of this sort
of it's been happening for a while but
it's become even more prevalent in now
the JavaScript frameworks then just you
know there's not - when you would
install jQuery it's not like you're
pulling a bunch of other jQuery little
libraries to it and when you were
installing you know angularjs there are
other angular suite projects from like
angular UI would be a big one but
besides that there aren't too many that
you're pulling from now it's like Bam
Bam Bam I'm only pulling a function from
this bitch just whatever's get
exported over here right so it's kind of
it's it's much more so than than it used
to be do you think reiax license issues
will have companies shift away from
react I don't know enough about it but I
could tell you just that statement alone
that they are having licensing issues
regardless of the context regardless of
of what what is really going on I should
say cuz I'm not super educated about it
we have just I've just heard enough that
there are some sort of licensing
licensing issues going on I can tell you
that companies as a whole tend to be on
the conservative side and because
they're just worth smoke let's not see
you know there's smoke right there's no
fire there's smoke
naturally people are going to shy away
because there aren't any angular 4
issues right there aren't any angular
for licensing issues so naturally people
above her like look I don't want to
suspend millions or hundreds of
thousands of dollars building this out
in react and they have to rebuild in
angular 4 for X Y &amp;amp; Z reasons even if
there's a 5% chance a 2% chance whatever
it is so naturally it's going to have
people shift away I don't know how much
but yes it will be some sort of issue
how was April did she get a software job
remember I'm your teacher what do you
think about you Jess so um April Smith's
ending project management for about a
month and a half she's actually today
and tomorrow taking a prot practice a
practice test for a certificate that
she's been studying for and built some
projects for in project management
specifically with Six Sigma in lean and
agile methodologies so that's what she's
been up to
she's been studying and she has a
practice test this last few weeks she
was hoping to take the practice test a
little bit sooner but she's taking the
practice test and then she's gonna be
taking the real test probably a week
later and hopefully once she has that on
her resume she can get a junior project
manager role and go from there she plans
to still learn coding it's just I don't
have to do what I to do what we were
doing before I couldn't continue on and
I think project management might have
been a little bit better fit for her and
she kind of agreed so that's what she's
been up to Friday in Forks back in verse
full-stack which one is better choice
the full stack it really definitely want
to be full stack developer there's a lot
of you get exposed to a lot more things
now it may turn out that like I'm going
from full stack role to a front-end role
but that doesn't mean I can't do full
stack when the time comes or that I
can't help out in other ways really
though full stack is probably the best
choice
that of all of them do you have any
advice for cody sketch more people are
learning the only coding schedule you
need is to code every day after that
you're good roxas welcome Oh
so since there are so many add-ons to
react as your site to find them find
them like there's for Ruby Jones I don't
know man I've just been following the
Udacity program I have been able to dive
into where I'm sure there is something
like NPM like where there's a database
where you can search for stuff but I
don't know my mood my new job I'll be a
front it will be a front-end role I'll
be I'll be working in angularjs and the
company itself markets and sells health
and beauty products they're doing very
well they've doubled their sales in the
last year to a billion and they have
this nice they just spent in 2014 they
spent 10 million dollars on this on this
new headquarters and there's a slide
from like the third storey down to the
first storey so every every Friday your
boys just gonna be like this
I'm out and fried down the slide and uh
but I'm very excited more so than
anything else I am yes it's a it's a
semi local companies about 20 miles away
the things that really attracted me to
this this work place was actually had
higher offers I had an offer as high as
thirty three thousand dollars more than
what I was making but I didn't want I
was really looking for more of a culture
fit and more of a how can I grow as a
developer
and this was the place that fit best for
that so that was what I was looking for
and the people there the the people I've
met with and the environment the team
what I'll be learning what I'll be
working on was very very attractive to
me
and so wasn't about the money for me but
I just and the reason I bring that up
not to say oh well you know Dylan you're
an idiot should take that $33,000 grace
let me tell you should be twenty eight
thousand twenty eight thousand my Maps
it's early a Saturday man I'm a little
brain brain foggy but uh but why did I
why did I turn down the larger of the
race
well because I think the so the people I
met with at this job that offered me
they are and put them in to put them in
a cat I don't wanna name the company
because I don't want to think I'm
 on them or anything like that
but will say that they are a large
financial investment and wealth company
they specifically managed are in the
wealth management field I'd be doing a
similar role however I'd be doing it in
a cubicle and I ain't with the
cubicles man that's the truth than that
so the cubicles might have cost me about
fifteen thousand dollars but also uh it
was a much more corporate feel it was a
much more although I have to say the
people I've met at both companies and I
really had kind of three offers but
those are the two main ones but the
people I met at this one company where
unfortunately I I I turned down the
offer they had brilliant brilliant
people like absolutely like I am worried
to show like I was talking to this one
guy and I asked them so one one question
I asked at all my interviews now I never
you're always supposed to have questions
that you want to ask as the interviewee
to the interviewer at the end right when
they ask have something the only thing I
ask is what side projects are you
working on because I'm generally is
interested and I asked the that same
question and the guy is contracted out
to build a cryptocurrency that's what
his side-project did and I knew they
were all brilliant guys but it was it
was just something that like I knew I
was the dumbest guy in the room but then
once they once they once he said that it
was like they handed me a certificate
that said I'm the dumbest guy in the
room how old am i I am 29 I'll be 30
next month so maybe missing with
cubicles you know what it was it was
really I didn't think it would bother me
as much until I was actually on the
property and and I was walking by and I
saw the like you know the little taped
up sign to be quiet and then we walked
through an aisle of the cubicles and I
saw about on the lice probably saw about
ten different developers on the right
and left they had probably a hundred and
fifty this is a very large company but I
saw them and not one of them looked
happy yeah I mean not one all of them
just looked like they were kind of I
think I didn't get the hey I'm happy to
be here vhere look right and that was
something that was and that's that goes
back to the culture thing is is you need
to find a place that you want to work
and I want to work with this new company
that I'm working with
so oh it was not Goldman Sachs but it's
in that it's in that same sort of
category I'll leave it at that I look
way younger than 30th the braces man I
also don't smoke or drink so welcome to
me learn you back and yeah all the
projects I want to build have to have a
back-end so did I have to solve any
algorithms during the interview yes I
had to I exhaust and boat at so let's
talk about these two interviews since we
got talked about it at one interview the
one that I ended up getting hired by I
had a single whiteboard question at the
other one I had three which I've never
had three like it usually the way that
it works is most of the time they'll
give you a single algorithm and then
they will go and they will have you
continue to they'll continue to hammer
it out they'll add new cases or the
they'll have you say how can you
refactor this to make it be more
productive you know how can we improve
upon this why did you do this how could
you fix that that's usually been my
experience that I've had about I don't
fifteen of these in person I would say
in my lifetime now this other one gave
me three by three different people with
escalating difficulty it was brutal
I also not only had the the white lady
ready and white board interview am I do
every time I'm there I'm always thinking
like I hope I don't throw up on these
people because I am
there's something about job interviews
that are just nos da ting to me just the
the pressure and whatnot I crumble you
know grant I did okay because I got
offers and I got a job right but in the
moment I feel like this this ship is
burning not only is sinking so
living on fire before it went down right
so that's how I feel in the moment but I
also had a take home project as well a
basic JavaScript in the hint sent me
like one page of instructions this is
what it should do and and it basically
just wanted to see if you could build a
you know something that updates to leaps
adds never hide you should not if you
don't have to you should maybe make a
duplicate but that's one of the things
people people hate me for putting in my
video so mind you these a lot of my
videos by the way guys when I'm actually
going through and building projects
please take them with a grain of salt
this is just one person on his journey
to becoming a developer a lot of the
algorithms a lot of my projects that I
built I would have done in a much better
way then then are up there it does work
but it's not always the best but just to
understand because a lot of us are
worried like oh man this awful awful
code I have written on my github right I
got awful awful code that are videos of
me from a year two years ago I'm a much
better developer than I was two years
three years ago but uh the reason I
bring that up is uh some of the
practices I had then not always the best
so when you are doing it think more
about the thought process and understand
that there are a million different ways
to solve algorithms and that this is
probably not when the best but it works
that's why that's why I'm bringing that
I do they care about your thought
thought process it's the fact that
you've got to correct oh yeah they
definitely cared
there's plenty of they wanted me to
break down the code why did I do this
because I am I do as I mentioned I was
I'm always extremely nervous so my code
is not perfect right so they be like why
did you put this I
like cuz I'm nervous that doesn't need
to be there let's erase that right so
it's and it's one thing when you're in a
text editor you're typing this up right
and you're running your code it's
another thing when you're there with
three people in the room and you're like
you know you've done two phone
interviews you feel that a couple apps
you've done all this sort of stuff so
it's a whole nother experience because
you're on your now it's game day right
so it's a it's a whole another thing and
I think you get some leeway in your
whiteboard interviews than you do in
your your you're like maybe a take-home
interview I happen to do both usually
the take-home interviews are more so in
the algorithm base the one I had was
actually building something out what
technologies will use it I'll mainly be
doing stuff that revolves around
angularjs I know they have a couple
different teams I know they have a
dotnet team as well so we'll see I'm
hoping to work I don't know how
test-driven development will change what
technologies we use or don't use or if
it's just a thought process change which
I believe it is have you ever been given
a problem that you couldn't solve if so
how did you handle that I I did actually
I have an interview with Amazon not too
long ago
Amazon reached out to me said hey we
think you'd be good for this role in
Seattle I wasn't necessarily looking to
go to Seattle but Washington was one of
the areas I was considering moving to
before I went to Florida and it's
 Amazon right and so uh I did
have a interview with Amazon they
reached out to me on LinkedIn I
responded I had two phone calls and then
I had a technical interview and it was
not a super hard problem it was just one
of those problems that because I it
involved regular expressions to solve
in a I just make between the pressure
and the sort of not be like memorizing
regular expressions I did very poorly
and naturally they make me an offer it
was very enlightening to know that I
could actually give an interview with
Amazon because I I mean I I didn't apply
to them and they were looking to hire
people and that would look great on my
resume but yeah I've been the one that
comes to mind really though that's a
fairly recent one the one that comes to
mind for for algorithms that were super
hard
whereas I before I accepted my previous
role that I just ended I was
interviewing simultaneously with this
company in Las Vegas where I was going
to get a little bit of equity with the
company and a little bit of a lower
salary but the interview process was
crazy you had four different skills test
so the first skills test you got to do
two algorithms not that bad right but
the thing is is they want you to solve
it in different languages that you're
not going to be using so they give you a
list of like four or five different
languages like rust go Python and and
like Scala like vary languages that are
very specific that most JavaScript
developers wouldn't have now I did in
Python and the other ones I just by the
time I end up getting my offer I was I
think I was messing around with Russ but
it was they specifically wanted you to
solve it before like in different
languages that you wouldn't even be
using it that like that
I understand kind of where they're
coming from but it kind of just pisses
me off more than anything else but
wouldn't you do stuff like that you have
a much much higher chance of getting a
job because very few people actually
fall through with it so much so that
when I got a job for more money dropped
it I got time to gamble with you guys
especially when there's like three more
skills test coming up no they had such a
long interview process
oh my god it was meet with the recruiter
have a phone call have a skills test
this is where I stopped talked with the
people you'd be if they pass you pass
you on cool after that you have another
skill set school meet with the the talk
with the the seat the CEO or CTO and
then half of your final skills test and
then an actual in-person after that like
how much money you paying me to do this
job what's the best tax out of use I
don't know man everyone's got their
favorite I like visual studio code the
best right now I've had issues with
sublime and brackets and atom eventually
they just crash for some reason I've
never had that issue with Visual Studio
code it was it was a seriously cool
company though it was one of those
companies where I was like hell yeah I
would like to work like I'm kind of one
of those people that just want to work
in everything like I don't really have a
preference like I'm not I don't have
anything I don't want to work in but
there are a few things I would want to
work in they specifically were doing
analytics for social media for companies
right so like say your Sony and you paid
me a thousand dollars
they want to know how what that thousand
dollars got them and so it was a very
cool stuff and that's a very big
contracts and they were a start-up
startup in the sense of they have like
25 million dollars funding and so I I
remember correctly he was a $10,000 less
offer but I did get like a third of a
percent of equity or a tenth of the
percent of equity you never know how big
that will get but it was the crazy the
craziest jointer you know it's funny you
should ask
you should ask Matt Tran engineer truth
about it cuz I recommended him to the
roll and he got the skills tests also
and and he was just like this is a
stupid first
like what a pain in the ass yeah
how are you applying for jobs I cannot
seem to get a response there's a lot of
reasons that that could be could you
possibly review my program in portfolio
you got it you'd have to book like a
mentor in session or something like that
where we could sit down for an hour I
can go over your portfolio I can go over
your resume your your hopefully your
portfolio site your your github your
LinkedIn we can really sort of hammer
out those things of how you can improve
what's your cover letter to make you
stand out so but that I charge for the
next week or two I charge $75 an hour
pretty soon it's gonna go up John dude
um give us some tips to effectively
market yourself as a single developer
who's a multi developer here um can you
throw a plug for your mentor II yeah
guys uh if you guys are interested in
here
the reason the price is going up is I've
always kept it at somewhere between two
and a third and two and a half times
what my hourly rate is for a developer
I'll throw a link in chat right now $75
for an hour
rookie session definitely usually make
sure that I can help you but um will sit
down for an hour on on skype on Google
Hangouts it's recorded so that you guys
if you don't want it to require I delete
it but I usually record it so I can send
you a copy so if you don't write
anything down in the hour you have a
documentation for that but uh I mean
five tips to market yourself as
developer I just did have five things
you need to do to lane a web dev job a
lot of those things were going to dish
details in the mentorian as well so I
would encourage you to watch that video
so do you guys think it so far these
weekly live streams this is a new thing
I want to start where I every Saturday
we're gonna be talking about whatever it
seems to be going pretty well so far
I did a poll Saturday or Sunday I guess
it's kind of relative because my
Saturday maybe or Sunday so I'm
definitely gonna be doing it for next
week next the rest of the year at least
and then we'll see how it goes
I'd like I wanted to integrate live
streams I don't know how I'm trying to
come up with ways to grow the channel
and I think live streams might be
something that that will help people not
only watch my videos when they come out
but also you know we kind of provide
some value people listen to in the car
so as long as as long as you guys enjoy
them I'll keep doing them if you want to
make sure you do get notified so you
don't have this issue you got to go to
the little notification Bell and click
it so that you'll you will get notified
for the live streams so I uh I got some
good videos coming out for you guys too
one of the one of the things that I want
to do in the next week or two is between
between between transitioning jobs a lot
of stuff a lot of stuff happens where we
talk a little bit more in detail about
job searches we can talk a little bit
more in detail about interviews we talk
a little bit more in detail of
of writing cover letters what to have on
your resume so those are four videos I'm
going to be doing we can also talk in
detail about what else interviewing so
these are like five things that I'm
going to be making videos about things
that have I've recently happened to do
and I'm not saying I'm an expert in but
if you've never had a technical
interview before if you've never had
never really if you're not getting a lot
of responses on your resume then these
are all things asked you that how I may
be able to help you because I think I do
decently well for where I'm at in my my
career and maybe I can help you guys out
no I my new role is a on the junior
level I think I can advance relatively
quickly I don't really care what they
call me at the end of the day so for me
it's it's kind of a environment and a
money situation so if I was a senior
developer and they wanted to pay me more
and call me a junior I'd be happy with
it just fine and that's kind of I'm not
a senior developer why they have junior
in my title but realistically in terms
of years of experience I'm definitely in
the junior level I'm I think I'm a
decent junior developer but that's where
I'm at
I have a new one Christ I'm deaf am i
working for a larger company yes the
company I I'll be working with will be
doing about a billion dollars in sales
from what I've read and and the one that
I was working at isn't in the tens of
the millions so much larger do I simply
video games I kind of started playing a
little bit recently to kind of take a
break and relax
I've really get stressed out by the
interviews and all the stuff that goes
along with that
so I started playing a game called
Dragon Quest builders it's kind of like
a it's kinda like a if you ever play
dark cloud back in the day on
PlayStation it kind of reminds me a
little bit of that with Minecraft mixed
in basically you're crafting your you're
attacking monsters and you're taking
back a world and whatnot but you're also
building up your base and building rooms
the stuff like that and you got your
your in you got your equipment room you
got your your your cook you got your
your shop your workshop where you're
building things so it's kind of a very
sort of minecraft inspired RPG now based
off the Dragon Quest series it's a lot
of fun I rip it's it's made for like
children but it's a very simple and fun
game and so I like to sit down for about
thirty minutes to an hour every other
day which is a lot for me normally it's
like an hour every three weeks which
means I'm really enjoying it but also I
I kind of needed some way to take myself
out of life for a minute but I've been
I've been loving it so I typically only
play games that have endings now the one
that I learned my lesson with League of
Legends and like World of Warcraft where
if a game does not have an end I don't
want to play it I only want to play a
game it actually comes to a defensive
stop so but I did give up gaming
entirely for about a year and a half or
nine months because I I did think it was
too much of a distraction and I
didn't want to I wanted to focus on
becoming a developer and becoming a
better developer syak I completely
understand that am i working on any
rescue side projects yes so the main
ones obviously YouTube but I'm starting
a podcast we're actually filming the
first one tomorrow and so that will be
my newest side project the when I
finished the react project which is
probably about I haven't Mabel put in as
much work as I wanted to into it because
of everything going on but um when I
finish that about let's say a month
maybe five weeks I will be building some
youtuber tools that'll be my next big
side project I'm very excited about that
oh and the most exciting of them all
that I'm actively working on before I
build the cheap tools is how to build a
coding Channel course it's going to be
my first course ever built I've been
working on the syllabus making sure I I
have all my my my eyes dotted the t's
crossed and all that other people
say when they're on top of it it's cool
that is what I'm working on
I'm very really really excited about
that so I'm I can't wait to to get that
get that out and get that going right
now I I'm kind of still in the stage of
working up syllabus and it's gonna be
not only on a coding Channel but also a
YouTube channel with that focus is on
coding so if you want to start let's say
an engineering channel you want to start
a a infotainment channel whatever it is
in your career you're gonna be able to
take about 90% of what's in there and
apply it so it's going to be relatable
it's just gonna happen that that if you
want to start a coding channel that
you're going to it's going to be very
tailored to you for that so that's
probably the the side project I'm most
excited about I've always wanted to make
a course you know there's a very
practical stuff of hey you
I have a coding Channel audience you
know who that they probably liked coding
courses right so there's that aspect of
making residual money but I've always
been kind of hesitant because I don't
know I don't know how good I am to be
able to sell you that like I have pretty
high standards about what I want to sell
as my first couple courses and so
instead of taking something that is very
specific and because you know I'm
competing in that in the in the sort of
JavaScript course world I'm competing
against people like traversing media and
developers have ten or twenty years
experience and it's a little hard and I
want to make sure I put out something
that's quality so I decided to go down
something that I think I can provide a
quality course on for sure
and that's unique at the same time which
is kind of fun right which is how to
create a youtube channel slash coding
course base their coding channel with
the coding channel aspect to it so
that's what I'm I'll be working on I'm
hoping I wanted to have it out by the
end of this month but I think it's going
to be pushed back a month I've ever
played peggle know why do you choose a
traditional job over freelancing uh I
freelance a little bit but freelancing
it's hard to maintain especially as a
junior developer I think a lot of people
when they think I'm sort of the digital
nomad lifestyle that involves
freelancing a lot of people who can do
that I've already existing clients have
maybe worked a traditional job and
they're willing to let them sort of go
out of that of the workplace to keep
their job and I think mainly a lot of
those freelancing roles and a lot of the
remote jobs those are mainly for
intermediate to senior developers so
maybe one day right now I have my main
concern is that I want to be a better
developer and to do that I need to
myself with quality developers and
strive myself with quality developers I
need to be there in person most of the
time your boss will go weeks at a time
without giving me any projects is that
normal does he still think you're
working on your previous project you
just haven't told them
why don't you ask him for a new project
nothing wrong with being a little bit of
for not forceful but being like hey I
need something to work on and if he just
kind of looks at you blankly start
filling out applications I have a job
pretty soon a very well may prepare need
to prepare them more it just kind of
depends right just that's one way to be
working on it I know every situation is
very very unique but I would be kind of
worried if I didn't have enough work at
a job cuz usually it's the opposite
right usually there's so much to do you
only get to some of it so when there's
only some to do then you got nothing to
nothing left I have issues maybe you ask
your boss how you can help with this
workload you know maybe there's some
tasks that are slightly above your skill
level slightly below his and you say
okay this is what I need you to do I'm
gonna be throwing up on udemy
jonbi so the the Cody Channel course
I'll throw it up on udemy I'll probably
be 25 or 50 bucks with you know a
special that brings it down to 15 or 10
or something like that so it's it's
definitely gonna be up on one of those
sites
would you consider code combat more of a
game than educational until no I think
it's an educational tool I mean the the
mechanics of the game are you coding
things out and really thinking how to
solve this problem which essentially the
problem is basically you breaking in an
algorithm and ain't going from there is
14 months too soon to move on no I moved
on after a year and my previous job was
9 months but it wasn't a developer role
the reason I say that is the average
developer stays that job for about 18
months right now now at 14 months you
can probably leave for at least a
$10,000 race if you just wait and a
better situation and whatnot so I don't
know what you're making or what your
market is I know in the American market
if you could probably get $10,000 raised
pretty easily how high are you giving
those chances it's just oil man just oil
nothing nothing like that I will say
that you will get questioned about it
though so just be prepared to have an
honest good answer and they say why did
you leave your work after you know one
year and four months cuz I that came up
in mind mine's a little my situation is
a little bit different um you know I
have very good reasons as to why I left
and I've dive in that another another
video or another topic I don't want my
previous work to think that there's any
any issues with them cuz it would not
necessarily necessarily wasn't on my end
but I had a very very good answer
very true answer as well as to why I was
leaving after just a year and another
thing is that if you are like me who is
a transplant meaning that I left from
California to Florida they're always
going to be wondering why and they're
always going to be wondering when you're
going back so you need to have a a solid
answer to to elaborate to put their
concerns and so it's a it's a fair
concern why did you leave California
why'd you come to Florida and how do we
know that you're not going to leave us
after a year so you need to be ready to
have all those answers selected
what do you suggest for learning more
math post-college
I imagine there's probably some courses
on udemy Iowa I would also say that math
just like coding and something that you
have to do kind of daily so start start
incrementing it into your day and going
from there
yeah I uh I haven't had to study any
math but in front-end and back-end
there's very little Matt's really
transom what you would say
with my current computer monitor setup
well I have four 4k monitors unlike a
rack on a automated standing desk and
then my computer has a four point four
AMD eight core processor if I remember
correctly with a gtx 980ti a and a one
terabyte SSD and a two ter terabyte HDD
at the where is h HD the old one um so I
thought that answers your question or
not um then I have my my
monitoring or my mic and headphones all
that's or self HDD thank you yeah so I
would say that I have a pretty good PC
my it's one of the few things I've
treated myself on I save about 50% my
income right now save slash invest I
should say I I mainly invest I keep very
little money on me I invest about fifty
percent of my income and the I'm still
able to I'm lucky enough to still be
able to treat myself to an office and
using upgrading my computer when needed
although I don't really need anything
else how do you feel about using
texworks to learn web development I
think it is so bad so bad oh my goodness
I think textbooks are so incredibly bad
to learn web development I think video
video courses are a million times better
because they can provide additional
context also when you go and buy a video
of course oftentimes if you have
questions there's a community or a forum
or even the original creator to go and
answer your questions and it provides a
lot more context than then a book does a
book and if it's a pretty book you're
already done you
updated you can't you know if it's if
it's a ebook maybe you can get it
updated if they update it right so I I
think that textbooks in general have
always been a sham and this goes for a
lot of things I mean you could say like
there's certain topics that aren't going
to change like history history is
history right we're not going to be
changing too much but in terms of web
development and JavaScript it's hard to
even find a video tutorial on YouTube
for current react in angular 4 so it's
all those things where I would stay away
from from from very it's it's hard it's
better to read papers and what I mean
it's like 20 to 30 page papers if
someone's written about whatever it is
you want to learn that actually to try
and read a 300 page textbook on whatever
and I've done it
I've started it and before I realized I
bought three books in my lifetime and
I've never read through all three
because by the end of chapter two or
three I've already realized that this
stuff is outdated it's talking about
version one in their own version four
and it's only been a year right so it's
just one of those things I would
definitely say if you can video
tutorials the way to go got a run thanks
for the info hard-working shall take
care thank you man how did my place -
with arrow we did okay power went out
somebody's sliding glass doors it broke
some sliding Lester throw some trees
claps ripped the doors off of the trash
compactor outside some of the roof
shingles got got taken down but our
apartment specifically was perfect wish
we never left so we did all right when
we came back we our power went on like I
think two hours before we got back I
have a friend enroll for a marketing
company for health and beauty products
so
so how do you still consider yourself a
junior developer when you seem to have
quite a lot of knowledge and experience
uh it's hard not to I mean I don't know
when I wouldn't I don't think I'll call
myself a senior developer until I have
five years experience and but by the way
what you do as a senior developer is
different than what you do as a junior
developer so I'm definitely not a senior
developer you could if you want to throw
me into a category you can throw me an
interview but realistically I have one
year full stack experience about six
months freelance and internship nine
months in just the field not related to
not specifically software so I could
fall into a mid-level the where my
strength comes from and what is that
even though at best I have two years
experience let's say at best after two
years experience about one and a half is
development so at best we'll say two
years that might throw me a mid-level
but realistically I'm not too concerned
about titles where the strength comes
from and where you saying like knowledge
and experience is the shear amount of
hours right
the I'm doing this every single day like
literally every single day I'm also
studying other things I'm building
projects I have a Facebook group I have
a discord channel of a youtube channel
I'm always reading up on this and I'm
very I can I think I I'm able to
understand situations very clearly and
hopefully articulate it back in an
educated manner and part of that is
being able to make videos and getting
better over time sort of communicating
and you know that that's gonna translate
into the workplace so I would say and
you this is something I some people may
have disagree but I would say that
there's more value in a junior developer
who can communicate clearly than an
intermediate developer who can't and so
you're in one of those spots
me personally I I don't know until I
have people under me I will consider
myself sort of a junior developer
patreon supporter Thank You Nora I know
I've got a few I haven't been able to go
and think that I've gone like two or
three people have supported $5 or $1 on
patreon patreon comm / going to RS 360
and uh and I haven't really been able to
follow on I do I have a favorite tech
news source not right now I get a lot of
people that share in the Facebook page
tech and news if you guys aren't a
member of the Facebook group co tech and
caffeine which coincidentally is the
name of the podcast look forward to that
soon it is uh is something that I get a
lot of my stuff from just from Facebook
and YouTube
I have like 400 channels I'm subscribed
to and about 200 of them are related to
software in code I'm doing 180 websites
in 180 days challenge and I'm running
out ideas got any for me I would say do
three websites in 180 days to make sure
they're quality over quantity if you're
a junior developer than I am a junior to
fluster
well I am a junior developer it's in my
title now I don't even remember what my
title is I'm going from web engineer to
junior music UI
junior front-end engineer junior
front-end you I don't remember wrote it
my title is I don't care women they
could call me that dude that does
 IT actually don't call me that
does IT that's one of the things that
always drives me nuts as people say you
work in IT no I don't work with IT
developer
it's like one of those Street you ever
get that you're the IT guy no man not
the IT guy is a massive difference and
like now you work with computers right
it's like I just give up it's like all
right mom yes I work with computers I'm
mighty God whatever you want to say mom
uh so uh but yeah hearin I would say
you'd be better suited building a
quality web application that you can
actually turn to make a profit on with
some ad revenue or whatever it may be
they actually building a hundred eighty
websites other days that was that gonna
dude no one's got a look at 180 websites
matter of fact I don't even think you'll
get better like substantially better by
building a hundred eighty websites
because how much time can you put into a
website in one day like realistically
how much can you improve if you're
building something brand new every day
tell us more about April we love her I
don't mind talking about April but it's
weird when you asked talk about April
like someone when we were in the hotel
in my motel the motel 6 with the the
amazing ceiling fountain look forward to
that video on Wednesday I'll say
Wednesday look for that video on
Wednesday it's always someone's like hey
show us April you know I don't mind
April doesn't mind be on camera and tell
you asks for her to be on camera and
then it gets weird
all right then it gets weird right
alright guys I appreciate you guys
showing up and having some great
conversations with me in our very first
Saturday weekly a little bit of AMA a

got stuff about how to get into coding
how to get in a web preview a resume how
to write a better cover letter how to do
LinkedIn optimization all these sorts of
things I actually bought one myself and
I'm going to be reading up on that so
that I can have a better portfolio
myself it maybe I'll make a video or
viewing each one of the books that I'm
reading but the link is in chat in in
chat there and if you're interested in
it please check that out I'll throw it
