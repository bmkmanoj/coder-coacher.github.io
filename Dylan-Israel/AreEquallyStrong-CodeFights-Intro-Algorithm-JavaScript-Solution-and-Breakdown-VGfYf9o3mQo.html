in code fights the intro island of
knowledge are equally strong that's
where we're at and what are what we're
tasked with here is to find out are
these two arms equally strong between
you and your friend right so you have
your left arm your right arm and your
friends left in your friends right so
we're juggling four parameters here I'm
just probably the hardest part about
this as well as trying to understand
what this Dodson says so what you're
basically need to do is find out if your
strongest arm is equal to your friend
strongest arm and your weakest arm is
equal to your friend's weakest arm in
terms of strength then it's a true
statement if that's not true then it's a
false statement that's all so the way
that I did this was I just I created
four variables one for your weakest one
for your strongest one for a friend's
weakest and ones for our friend
strongest and then I did ternary
operator in each to find out what is
what so let's go ahead and get started
with that so we got to find our
strongest let's go ahead and open this
up just a little bit there we go
so this ternary ones are going to get
kind of long so far your weakest is
equal to and then here's our statement
for our ternary says your left is less
than or equal to your right and I
originally did lesson but uh for all
these but you have to do equal to or
else it doesn't work with your logic and
it works fine so you're left so if
that's the true statement if your left
arm is is the same strength or less than
your right arm you need to go ahead and
set the value to your left it isn't set
it to your right so okay now we know
what the weak your weakest arm is now
let's go ahead
and do your strongest and in here you in
our here in our statement here we has a
is your left which is her person is
greater than or equal to your right and
if that's the case then go ahead and
return your left arm because it's the
strongest or your right arm again these
are just values right so that's why the
less than or equal works is just ten
fifteen cetera so now we know which are
your of the part of the your who has the
strongest arm and on you and who has the
weakest arm on you which arm is with
what those values are and we're going to
take that same logic and we're going to
say hey what is our friends weakest
equal here and this will be friends left
greater then or equal to friends right
if that's true we're going to return
friends left if it's false we're going
to return friends right and finally
friends strongest is going to be equal
to here and it'll be friends left plus
then excusing greater than or equal to
friends right and then here it is going
to be friends left again or friends
right let's go ahead and and split it up
a little bit alright so now that we have
that what we need to do is just
essentially check our values so is your
strongest exactly equal to your friends
strongest and is your weakest
exactly equal to friends weakest and you
know what I didn't do this in the
original one but we don't need the dis
statement we can just do a return
statement that's a ternary and so it's
basically we did this whole time might
as well continue the trick so there's
our statement so if that's true go ahead
and return true if it's not return false
and I believe assuming no syntax error
which is big assumption and you're thank
you look let's see here so you're left
less than equal to your right
let's actually see if maybe this ternary
messed it up but I'm pretty sure I have
a syntax error somewhere
yeah okay listen Jax there let's see
friends left is greater than equal to
friends right friends left : friends
right alright so that's okay then we
have friends left oh here it is
that needs to be less than or equal all
right and I believe we should be good
now submit and we're done the hardest
part about this challenge was kind
understanding what they were asking
which is typical codified fashion
there's probably actually a mathematical
way you can go about this doing some
pluses and minuses and modulo and stuff
like that and I'm sorry I left to live
shirt and shot up accidentally for that
sorry about that for the people will be
watching this video later but this is
how I solve it and as always guys thank
you for watching the video don't forget

patreon if you can and if in join our
discord channel all those links are in
