back in beta dot hack saw Don Academy
we're going to be doing the working with
an API project Thank You them for
sponsoring this video by the way I
appreciate it helps to the channel grow
and it's led a lot of good things going
on lots of different projects here the
reason i'm choosing to do the api one is
i feel like this is something that a lot
of people have trouble understanding and
i'm hoping that they do a pretty good
job doing that so far the ones i've done
have been pretty straightforward so
we're going to go ahead and jump into
sprint one an introduction to api so
there's five sprints and we're gonna but
if you're not familiar with the one API
is a restful or a rest api basically is
a way of getting data and either usually
a fan motor must of our purpose will be
getting the data and then doing
something with it to make our web page
dynamic for instance on my website we'll
go ahead and check it out real quick
coding taurus 360.com I'm using the
YouTube API to be able to get my most
recent video and display it here and
then down here I also have these numbers
these aren't hard coded these are go
through the API and show my subscribers
my lifetime used in the total public
videos I have this is all information
from the YouTube API so let's go ahead
and jump right in so again if you're new
to Hacksaw a beta to Hacksaw academy you
have your HTML CSS jesús you can kind
of reposition everything as needed all
right we're going to go ahead and jump
right in and get started what is an api
and api since our application
programming interface basically a way of
interacting with other applications and
getting data from those other
applications
so you can set a request you send a
request and then you get a response back
in data typically so when you get a
response back that's called a get
request as you'll see here you also this
will be an example of a response where
you'll have the meta object with a bunch
of key value pairs same thing with the
objects of ray this is pretty common
you'll see this is considered JSON
format so if you if you've seen JSON
before what that basically means is
JavaScript object notation it's probably
the most popular rest api and that in
terms of formatting now what do I mean
by rest rest is there are multiple api's
but rest really stands for that it has
basically four things in common it has a
git which you get the data as a put
where it changes the data as a post
where it creates new data to add and
then it has a delete where it removes
data and those for those four aspects
are what make a restful api fetching
data so let's go ahead and jump right
into here so you see are you see they
have a little bit of code already typed
up for us let's don't really add a div
anywhere in our HTML so just go ahead
and add it in between we're gonna give
it a div well remember a div is nothing
more than a container now we're gonna
give it the idea of temporary and now
what we want to do is we want to go
ahead and jump into it looks like we're
going to be doing this API call in
jQuery which is pretty common uh doing
it in like vanilla JavaScript is kind of
a pain in the butt so don't don't be
intimidated by that if you're not too
familiar with jquery
now we need to add functions to the API
object forgetting and then rendering the
data to your preview so it looks like
they want us to add these functions and
you see the dot get what's basically
happening here let's go ahead and add
this to our API what this dot get is get
you passing a URL that's the location of
the data in this case is somewhat
relative and then the function that does
something with it and then this data
callback is something else and we're
gonna we're going to go ahead and work
with this net now document document
already if you're not too familiar with
the job jquery don't sweat it all this
basically means here is run on page load
our jquery that's what's going on here
and so what we're going to do here is
where you go api dot let's go ahead and
rewrite you'll see right here we now
have all our api data typically you'd
probably do this in a JavaScript object
but you see we have a bunch of data here
this is a quick way on how we can get
our API did it so it looks like this is
the end of the lesson what you need to
understand from this you really need to
understand what a restful api is his way
of getting data sending data deleting
data and updating data that is
interactive with other applications so
that like in my example you were able to
get the YouTube API and then the jQuery
if you're not too familiar jquery it's
definitely going to help you to brush up
moving forward on that but as you can
see we've passed in some objects here
like so we have our metadata limit this
is all just data that we're getting back
and then we're going to do something
with it so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video moving forward I'm pretty excited
about api's I really think is something
that really makes your websites and web
applications look great and they're a
huge part of web development so you need
to get comfortable with it but again
