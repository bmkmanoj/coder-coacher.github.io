code fights comm it will be what we'll
be using for the algorithm examples the
reason that I like code fights a couple
reasons let's start first let's start
why you should practice algorithms well
in reality a lot of technical interviews
are just that their algorithm says they
give you maybe three problems you have
nine ninety minutes or an hour and then
once you solve all three or try to solve
all three I should say most of the time
I don't solve all three now code fights
is great because it actually keeps track
of your rank and they give you hints if
you with the you're in gold by solving
stuff so sometimes you can get a little
bit hang on those more technical ones
also the interview practice breaks it up
into a very nice section of questions
that are used for real interview
questions from companies like Google
Apple Microsoft the mate Facebook all
the major tech companies so that's
really cool but also I like the UI and I
like the setup and I like the the nest
of the order of operations in this you
can see there's 380 outcomes here I've
done about 50 and they just reworked
this section actually did 19 of these
and they reworked it I lost I lost ten
algorithms I'm hoping to get them back
they were supposed to be part of this
course but as always guys the the arcade
some of the arcade videos will be on the
YouTube and if you're if you're new to
how I do some of my courses is I'm going
to work through all of these algorithms
and I'll have I'll have it up on udemy
if you just want this course I'll have
it on my site coders course comm which
will have all my courses for a small
monthly fee and I usually include a
little bit extra content there as well
but let's go ahead and get started I
will show you the first example of the
arcade and that's where we're going to
start working through our cade is broken
up into a couple sections you have the
intro and then you have core Python and
graphs we haven't got to yet but we will
eventually we're going to start with
intro let's go ahead and get started
alright guys so we are in the very first
one at this is a basic basic example as
always we're going to be doing this in
JavaScript
now it may come a time in place where I
start solving these in PHP or Python
down the road but for the time being
we'll be solving this in JavaScript if I
do do that it'll be part of my course
that I'm going to be selling one of my
courses or that scoters course or udemy
course now this is a pretty simple one
but if you're new to to JavaScript let
me explain what's happening we have a
function which essentially is as april
like say a recipe and we're taking in
our two ingredients or parameters it's
called add and then down below in terms
of the UI let's talk about that is you
have solutions here that you can look at
once you've solved the problem so if you
want to see someone solve a better
problem that's where you go you're
graded on a score of 300 there's a bunch
of stuff that goes into that there's
also common so sometimes you can get
some comments in there sometimes there's
people who actually put answers in there
which isn't cool and then you have some
input and output and a little bit
distracted directions rather write a
function that returns the sum of two
numbers you have one parameter and a
second parameter add them together
return that so now the thing that you're
going to run into a lot at least I did
was this time limit depending on how how
long your it takes your code to run if
it runs longer than the time limit even
if the logic is correct you will
actually not pass the test so keep that
in mind once you get to these more
advanced algorithms but to get started
with this per amp oh and then you have
the test down here so you can see okay
well if we call the add function pram 1
min 1 and parameter V 2 it's you can see
it's supposed to return 3 and notice
this locked up one right here this is
actually a hidden test so you'll be able
to see certain tests I like to test you
will not so you can't like hard code
answers or anything and and you can go
ahead and create custom tests as well if
you think you can guess what one of
those hidden tests may be but in this
instance it's pretty straightforward
we want to use the return statement to
return Ram 1 plus
program 2 now that's probably the most
efficient way of doing it you run your
test real quick and say all right cool
step two sample test test now I have to
see if we toss the hidden test we submit
we have we are coding God but a pretty
pretty straightforward one as always
guys thank you for watching I look
forward to explaining the next one now
it's going to it's going to ramp up
pretty quickly something we're just
going to be adding m.i.c numbers but
it'll be fun stuff guys hopefully you'll
learn some functions and you'll learn a
little bit of logic in the process
hey guys thanks for watching the video
special thanks to our sponsors dev
Mountain if you look for a coding
bootcamp or tuition and housing is
included definitely check them out
appreciate it and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
