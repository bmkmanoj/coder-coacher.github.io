in free code camp we are going to be
doing the JavaScript calculator now just
give you a quick view of what it looks
like when it's completely done it's just
a basic calculator does everything that
you needed to do like so forth then we
can continue on minus 8 so let's be 10
you can clear everything or clear one
and then I'll clear everything and keep
on going
so your basic calculator did some
minimal styling but let's go ahead and
jump right into this so we're we're
gonna be using code pin as usual to be
doing this if you're not familiar with
code pin go ahead and create an account
it's completely free we're gonna start
off by just go ahead and naming this and
for me I'll I'll call it Java Script or
jQuery jQuery Cal Q later the FCC and
then YouTube long name for mine but just
so I know what I'm gonna do with it
later on
so this first video we're going to kind
of set up the the HTML so that we know
what it is that we're trying to do
first off let's go ahead and import all
the resources that we're going to be
using we're going to be using bootstrap
we're also going to be using the jQuery
library as well so make sure to go ahead
and import that so the reason that we
use bootstrap is just saves us a little
bit of time so we'll go ahead and start
off by creating a simple div and we're
going to give it a class called Tech
Center this is a bootstrap class it's
basically just centers your text you
know this is a key to anything but it is
helpful we're then going to have an h1
tag here that is basically just going to
be the title of our page here which is
jQuery calculator
FCC will put free code okay so there's
that ah yeah it looks alright and then
we'll have an h2 here so that we can if
anyone stumbles upon it we can kind of
promote ourselves and people may they
may say oh well this guy has a youtube
channel let's check it out and just go
ahead and put your name if you're going
to do something like that cool so we
have our basic set up thus far now the
next thing that I did was for the top
rounded part of the calculator I created
a div called calc output that's going to
be what we're gonna when our text is
changing from zero plus or minus one to
three divide the total it's all going to
be outputted into this div that's called
calc output so let's go ahead and create
that we have a div we're not gonna be
able to see it quite yet because it's
not going to have anything in it but
this is basically just for later on
where we're going to then be outputting
our data rather we can go ahead and
lower that a little bit and then within
here I just created a simple span that's
going to be targeted for it to be
outputted too now the div is there to do
the styling aspects within here we have
the span that is going to we'll put a
default zero in here so that when the
page loads it starts off at it starts
off empty with an empty like array was
just quotations in it and then from
there we just this is just for display
purposes and you could do this a variety
of ways I just thought it was easiest to
have it set up to start with the zero
and we're going to this ID called steps
this will be targeted later on and then
we're gonna put in a little a char here
for styling a little horizontal rule or
a line basically now it doesn't look too
too clear but this is our line that if
you saw briefly there's a smaller line
that we messed with so here's our we
have our first area that's set up for
our output you see our zero right here
to the side now the next thing that
we're going to do is we're going to
create another class another div with
the class equal to Tech Center and this
is going to be the the gray part of the
calculator bulk of where all the buttons
are so we're going to just do a little
something-something now I I just use
some line breaks because of what some
people are going to probably ask them
comments how come you didn't use rows
and and columns because the way a
calculator organized you really don't
want it to shift around calculators have
sort of a very certain design and so
that's why we're we're not going to be
making this responsive so we're going to
this ID also called calculator so that
we can do the CSS and target it in our
jQuery now within here we're going to
have a few things we're just going to
basically create our buttons now all the
buttons are the same except the first
two because because we're making them
red just to stand out because they're
the ones that delete things so to do
that we're just going to use anchor tags
and we're going to use a class that's
defined in bootstrap that's BTN BTN -
danger the only difference between this
and the BTN primary that we're going to
be saying is the color this is going to
have an ID also so each one of these is
going to need an ID so that we can
target them in our in our jQuery this
one's going to be delete all it'll be
our button AC which will then delete all
the values in the calculator that are in
there to that point so that we can start
fresh if we make a mistake so you'll see
here's our AC we're going to do the same
thing now for the back one class are
basically to just go back a step and
this is also going to be BTN BTN -
danger and then we're going to give it
an ID call it back one I try to what I'm
doing this I always try to name it as
what everything does the best I can so
this will be RCE
and now we're going to change it up a
little bit it's going to be pretty
similar
but we're going to go ahead and create a
class here that the only difference is
it's going to now we're now going to
move on to the BTN primary classes and
these are all going to be blue that's
the only difference and then in here
we're going to have a class equal to now
in here I said I just get everything by
the ID because there's really no reason
to name it seven or or divided or
anything
if these operators are the same in your
calculator work in JavaScript now you
can do it a variety of ways this is just
how I did it and this actually needs to
be ID excuse me so this is our division
so put a slash so you see everything's
kind of coming together what is that
word I mess up and put our slash right
here there we go
so let's go ahead and pull this up a
little bit so you can see what's going
on here and now we're going to do one
more for the multiplication and then
it's just a time I'm just going to kind
of copy and paste this in here but it's
the same exact thing except we're
putting in the multiplication like so so
everything's looking pretty clean-cut
thus far now what we're going to do is
we're going to put a line break you do
that by simply putting a br slash and
the reason we're doing this is we want
everything to line up nice and pretty
like and as we go on we're going to do
the same thing for seven eight nine ten
and - so let's go ahead and just ctrl C
this into here and we'll you'll see
right now we have our seven eight nine
ten and then the minus section
everything's up pretty straightforward
thus far I hope you'll see that this is
in here so each one of these lines we're
going to go ahead and do another BR
slash or a line break and we're going to
put in the next values which is four
five six and then the plus sign
so go ahead and pause the videos this is
moving a little too fast cause I know
I'm control pasting this in here one
second so we have a we have our final
line which will be the 1 2 3 and then
the dot excuse me I take that back this
is a we have one more line so we'll put
a br slash here and then we have the 1 2
3 the dot and then we have our 0 in
total and these ones are slightly
different the reason for that is I just
wanted them to take up a little bit more
because it's not even even thing so we
have a a class that's equal to be TN and
BTN - primary and then our custom class
that we'll get into in the next video
called big button and then we'll give
this ID equal to 0 and then we'll go
ahead and close this put a 0 in here and
then finally we'll give it a class and
same thing here this is going to be BTN
BTN - primary and this our custom class
big button and then this ID will set
equal the total go ahead put the equal
sign slash a and that completes the HTML
portion of what we're going to do right
now so I hope so I forgot to put the
equal sign somewhere I'll put the equals
save it so in the next video what we're
going to do is we're going to go ahead
and style it so you see we have all our
buttons we have the general layout we're
going to do the styling so that as we're
working at this we can see the output
easily and everything and then in the
following video we'll follow up with the
CSS so hope you guys found this helpful
