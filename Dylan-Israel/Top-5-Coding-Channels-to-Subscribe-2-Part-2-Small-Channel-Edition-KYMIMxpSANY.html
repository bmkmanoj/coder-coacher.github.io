video of the top five coding channels
you should subscribe to you and that
just happened that most of them were a
little bit bigger than me some some a
lot bit bigger than me
then my channel and I thought I'd take
this opportunity to actually show a
little bit of love to these smaller
channels which was actually a pretty
hard list to put together not because
there's not good small channels but a
lot of the channels that I've subscribed
on YouTube last two or three years
coding channel wise eventually they give
up
unfortunately they they you know maybe
they're thinking oh it's I'll make a
quick buck in YouTube's really not a
quick buck game most of the time and so
to make the list I basically have to be
a fan of yours and you have to upload
frequently there's a lot of people who
stopped uploading videos six months ago
a year ago two years ago in some cases
and even though their content was really
good and I was a fan they just stopped
putting out the content so these are
five developers that are smaller smaller
channels that I think have great quality
content in one way or another let's go
ahead and jump into it speaking of
quality content might I recommend our
friends over at dev Mountain coding boot
camp dev Mountain comm check them out if
you're interested in design you're
interested in QA you're interested in
full stack web development dev Mountain
is the place for you where you get not
only the tuition but free housing
included so you can get up and go today
you'll have a place to stay save some
money on rent
and all that goodness go ahead and check
them out dev Mountain com
I don't watch every one of her videos
but every now and again one of her
thumbnails but she has some great
thumbnails she does a really good job on
that I'm kind of see here they're very
very very interesting and good but one
things that makes her very unique that
kind of attracts me she has a she takes
a lot of time with her videos in terms
of the editing there's usually very high
quality but also it has a lot of
personality a lot of a lot of
entertainment value to it
I think the first video I watched was
maybe
six or nine months back of which of
which she was basically did like a mock
interview where like it was supposed to
be like a technical interview over Skype
and then she was playing both parts and
one of the she was like taking a bong he
was like hold up hold up in house that
was when I subscribed I really liked
that video I thought was pretty funny I
highly encourage you to check her out
especially if you just want something
that's not only informative but
entertainment as well it's a great
infotainment channel and I'm a big fan
of it all right the next thing to the
next channel rather now this is less
software more in the IT hardware space
server setup and that's IT career
questions and he does an excellent job
he he recently actually started doing
YouTube full-time he's chasing that
YouTube dream I don't blame him top five
he does a great great job with it
he's a very heartfelt guy a lot of these
guys are that you know they're just you
know the average guy who just wants to
you know share what they've learned over
their years in the career and he talks
about a whole bunch of stuff you can see
he's uploading almost daily sometimes
more than once a day and he's really
going hard after those IT career
questions so if you're interested in
server configurations and the more
Hardware set up sort of aspects that go
along in today's software and technology
fields he's kind of your go-to guy and I
think he does a great job with that and
I expect his channel to to grow
relatively quickly I know he hasn't been
uploading for all that long let's see if
we can go down to like what's his oldest
video let's see here so this is when he
started this doesn't really count
because he kind of gave up around here
but in recent times about the last two
years or so so he's been uploading about
as long as I have and I I expect his
channel to kind of jump out opes jump in
subscribers in the in the near future
because I don't think there's a lot of
there's not a lot of software channels
that upload frequently and there's even
less Hardware channels in my opinion
they kind of fall into that so I
encourage you if
you're interested in the more Hardware
aspect that goes along with software and
technology to check him out as well this
is a kind of unique one for the list but
I like christen leaks content I always
have and I don't always agree with all
of it but I agree with the message so
she is a UX UI designer currently and
she's gone to a coding bootcamp that's
kind of when she started doing her
videos and then eventually she got tired
talking about coding boot camps not that
I don't blame her by any means answering
the same questions time and time again
can be a little bit tiring
now she kind of focuses a little bit on
the self help slash UI UX aspects and
everything in between health she's
focusing on look which is something that
in all honesty as a developer I mean I
don't know about you guys but stay in
shape and being healthy and eating
healthy unfortunately isn't my top
priority is something I'm looking to
change in 2018 but I think this is a
good channel check out for a little bit
of UI UX topics I think it's great in
that aspect all right then we got a Eric
program with Eric who is a coding
channel currently he's doing a lot of
views view tutorials he's writing his
second book I believe his first book was
on ember j/s Eric does a lot of similar
content to my own where you know talks
about topics that he finds relevant and
that he thinks helps out as well as
tutorials I don't always agree with
Eric's advice I think I think a lot of
people come from a different side track
sometimes when you're watching YouTube
videos Eric has a master's degree in
computer science and you know many years
of experience and some of his advice
that he gives I don't always agree with
but I do respect that he is sharing what
he thinks is good advice but I do
encourage you to hear different opinions
hear different hair different resources
and and go from there
and if you're interested in view he's
uploading things on view all the time so
check out program
with Eric and I'll try to include a link
to all these if I don't get lazy in the
description below
alright probably the channel I watch the
most is Rikki Garcia
so Ricky's a good guy I actually just
went on his channel recently look at
this look at this stud right here
I wouldn't on his channel recently and
he we talked about my first year as a
developer
he started recently a new series where
he's interviewing a bunch of developers
to talk about their first year as a
developer a lot of times that is a very
intimidating situation an intimidating
thing he also does a weekly live stream
which I pretty much watch every weekend
it's usually on a Saturday where he
talks you know it's just sort of similar
to my live stream show up talking about
things and and go from there he takes a
lot of care with his editing so if you
like the more well edited versions of
things I would encourage you to check
him out he is a self-taught developer
and learning as he goes and you know
working his way up I enjoy his channel
because I it's a pretty genuine thing
and a lot of people are very interested
in like nanodegrees and you know udemy
or team treehouse he does a lot of
comparison videos like hey you know what
is the benefits Udacity was the benefits
udemy we're the benefits the plural site
these are kind of things that he chooses
to focus on so if you're interested in
that type of content I encourage you to
check them out
and those are my top five small channels
one of the things that I wish I could do
is share more but honestly as I said
before it's really hard to find channels
that are not only uploading content that
you like and I like a lot of coding
content but there are channels that
start for you know they put up 10 videos
and they get you know a couple hundred
views in some cases tens of views but as
we all started from somewhere and they
give up and so if you're starting a
channel and and you're trying to go and
you want to have a YouTube channel and
you think it's a great portfolio item
where you just enjoy it what I would
encourage you to do is do your best not
to
burn yourself out it's unfortunate but
it happens quite often set realistic
goals for yourself
what that realistic number is is up to
interpretation but try and set realistic
goals and try to understand that when
you're starting a coding Channel when
you're Trust starting anything new in
life that takes a lot of hard work often
times it is a marathon not a sprint I
definitely consider YouTube one of those
things where you know if you look if
you're checking your analytics every day
when you first start and I think a lot
of us are guilty of that I know I used
to check my analytics on a daily basis
when I was uploading a video a day that
was how I was gonna do a video day video
a day and what I found was that I was
going insane and I was getting
discouraged
I remember seeing when I would say no
views so or you were like you were some
days you even lost a subscriber and so I
would encourage you to just understand
that it's kind of a marathon that's not
to say that you can't explode and
succeed but just set realistic goals for
yourself because it it was kind of sad I
went through I have about 300
subscriptions I subscribed to various
content not only coding but about 40
coding channels and of the 40 only about
15 still post on there unfortunately and
so about 25 of them stopped posting for
you know six months or a year plus and
it's sad because I want to see I want to
see people succeed and I think it's I
think it's all good right I think the
more software content that's out there
the better it is for all of us right
it's not like I'm trying to hoard all
the views or I want to steal views from
Rickey or from anyone else I want people
to succeed and I think you know one
coding channel success is a channel
success that comes to mind cuz more
people get interested in the space and
eventually you want to see different
interpretations of the same content so
anyhow those are my five channels that I
think you should should subscribe to
that I think have great content that go
in different directions
various different directions so check
them out I appreciate you guys watching
this video don't forget to comment like
subscribe share support me on patreon
all that good stuff I'll see you next
time bye okay baby
yeah what do you think about me shouting
out some of the smaller channels hey
guys if you're interested in nice
