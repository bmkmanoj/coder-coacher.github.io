of a technical videos that I normally do
usually my ask a bit videos our topic
oriented but today we're going to talk
about markdown because it it's a quick
and easy thing that you can do to
implement in your work into your
workflow especially as you're trying to
build out a github page so let's talk
about what is markdown markdown is a way
to write and you we're looking at it
right here
this all appears to be HTML and it is
the markdown allows us to quickly and
effectively write HTML and it's
specifically for your like readme files
for forget hub you see we have our H
ones and things like that this is all
created using markdown in a much faster
way because and different syntax and
allows you to see if we actually click
on it if we can pull it up it's actually
just going to render it it's not going
to show it to us that's okay I'm going
to show you some examples so why use
markdown well one github accepts it and
so you should and two it's a it's an
easy skill that you can put on the
resume that in about 10 minutes to an
hour you can pretty much master markdown
or the basics of it and that's what
we're going to talk about today github
is the only place I'm using it for it's
probably the most popular place and what
we're going to be remaking here is
essentially I've been doing my code
fights videos and I want to put a readme
document here or a markdown document
that is the instructions here to add
context to what we're doing so we're
going to re build this using markdown so
let's go ahead and launch our editor
here and the one thing that you need is
AMD file and so let's go ahead and
create a file all markdown files are are
usually dot MB I believe older markdown
might be let's call this example dot MD
older markdown I think is dot markdown
but I think it's all MD so for for what
we're doing here Ivan
called this extension for Visual Studio
code which is the text editor that I use
here and look at that for some reason I
typed in an example MD and it brought up
some stuff I didn't want it to bring
anything up but uh I might have hit some
sort of that's a welcome MD so I example
undo there's nothing in there but I'm
using a little extension called Mark
markdown previewer to make sure I know
I'm doing and also if I'm going to
include two links that I found helpful
in the description here to learn the
basis of markdown because we're only
going to cover a couple things we're
going to cover how to create links we're
going to cover how to create h1s bold
italic and images but anything you can
anything you want right here you can put
in put in and great thing about markdown
is if even if there isn't something you
could actually just use a regular HTML
as well as this cheat sheet kind of
reference some of the things we were
talking about so check out those links
because we're going to give you a pretty
quick rundown to build out what you want
what I suggested here so let's start
with what I would include in my file
right which is a a an h1 tag or h3 tag
so each one of these hash tags here
refers to our age tags so eight one hash
tag would be a 1 3 is an h3 and to do a
link in markdown you would put your text
like so and we'll say we'll put check
out my youtube channel make youtube
channel a link so check out my youtube
channel and goes oops we forgot youtube
channel actually has to go in there so
that's what the text that's going to be
highlighted and then we're going to put
in parenthesis no cloak ations right
here we're going to put the locations
http:www.youtube.com/watch
three-sixty save that and we'll use our
previewer and you'll see here that it is
now this is now an h3 and we have our
link highlighted much faster than having
credit anchor tag h1 tag so on and so
forth and we could continue doing this
for as much as we want and again these
hash tags we wanted to be bigger we go
ahead and use that now we have an h1
instead of an h3 so the next thing is
let's say we actually wanted to separate
this we could do so with a so three
dashes will give us a horizontal rule
like so so maybe we want to separate
that section out and say we want to then
add some text oh we're actually I forgot
that we're actually doing this code
fight section so let's go ahead and copy
this text this text is just text so not
much to do with that we'll just paste
that in there looking pretty good so far
we've horizontal line we got our we have
our text the next thing I want to do is
add an image so we're just going to copy
this image address to do that and it's
going to look similar to the the anchor
tag except it's going to have a not sign
and in here we're going to put alt text
like let's say we want to have I don't
know I'll just put alt text or now and
now within here we see how it's saying
alt text if nothing's a sling but within
here we're going to go ahead and throw
our image in there and now we have now
we have our our image in our markdown
file that we wanted next let's say we
want our what's next the example right
here let's copy we're going to copy this
whole section here and jump back in and
go ahead and control V and so okay well
what do we want we want the example to
be to be both and we can do that with
two asterisks on each side now note that
these have to be touching you're worried
if one of these is off it's going to
throw everything off so example then we
have text and we say okay well we want
these to be list items all we have to do
is a - it's now a list item and if we
want it to be bold a bold list item like
it is in our example would you do it
like so and then again for here which
was the example and then finally for a
single italics we can just use one star
and one star and then in this case we
need to break up a little bit and then
after asterik a stroke a stroke and bam
and we're done and we've we've recreated
that essentially the text document in
markdown that will go on our github and
display as this and so they get to see
not only our our actual code for for
whatever this example problem was shape
area but they also get to see the
problem rubric so it's pretty helpful
when you're trying to create maybe a
text document on github is a great
little skill that you can add to your
resume you can do a bunch of a bunch of
elements with it pretty quickly to
recreate it without having to you know
go into crazy divs and tags and but
again all that stuff works so I hope you
guys start usually marked down and I
hope you start uploading regularly to
get up it's something I'm trying to get
better with to have an active github and
if you're interested in following my
github where I'm uploading all of my my
free code camp content where I'm
uploading all of my code fights contents
and projects and things like that I'll
include a link of that in the
description as well but that's always
guys thanks so much for watching the
video we're going to be giving away
I forget what course but one of steven
grinders courses and for the keyword
we'll use the word
markdown for the video so this was your
what how and why use markdown video a
quick rundown make sure to check out the
links out join our Facebook page join
our discord channel if you want to
support me you can at patreon that's
where you can support me patreon and
maybe I'll do a complete intensive video
on markdown going piece by piece down
down the road but as always guys also I
appreciate it and I'll see you next time
bye hey guys thanks for watching the
video special thanks to our sponsors dev
Mountain if you look for a coding boot
camp where tuition and housing is
included definitely check them out
appreciate it I'll see you guys in the
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
