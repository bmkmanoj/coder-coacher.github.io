about the trifecta of software
development learning which is the
traditional education software coding
boot camps and then of course
self-taught we're talking a little bit
about the pros and the cons of each and
then we're also going to dive into what
I knowing what I know now what would I
do
and why might I suggest after watching
this video a few things a man at coding
boot camp thing sounds like a great idea
might you go ahead and check out dev
Mountain and get more information at
dead mountain com they got courses on
web development iOS development QA
Salesforce they got it all baby and you
can get it to get that edumacation over
at dev mountain comm I appreciate them
sponsoring this channel they've been a
longtime sponsor of us got nothing but
love for them check them out dead
mountain comm so let's go ahead and talk
a little bit about we'll start with
college thin coding boot camps and
self-taught and then we'll search set up
set it up with pros and cons because I
think it's important and set the how my
brain works and how how looking back
knowing what I know now what I would
specifically do and why it's solely
based part off of Who I am as a person
as well as what each environment entails
so start with college so college is uh
the most structured of the three I would
say it is also the longest commitment in
terms of just hard commitment there's no
way around it in terms of time and in
terms of money as well a lot of people
when they think about college all they
really are thinking about is getting a
degree and thinking that a job is
guaranteed for them at the end which
isn't necessarily sure there's plenty of
people who graduate college with a lot
debt can't get a job and the thing I
would suggest if you are considering
going to college for software
development computer science software
engineering whatever it may be is that
you understand what it's going to take
to succeed outside of college as well as
what it takes to succeed inside of
college just let's talk a little bit
about the inside of
as part well as I mentioned its most
structured structured program there is
you're gonna be investing probably a
minimum four to six years for a full
bachelor's degree which is the minimum
that is really gonna be respected which
is some people ask questions about you
know is an associate's worth going and
getting know that that's kind of the
cold hard truth is you go and get a
bachelor's degree in computer science or
software development because companies
respected because it helps open doors
along the way
and it's is worth mentioning that as a
self-taught developer I can really speak
to this is that I've had phone
interviews where they just assumed that
I had a college degree and they may it's
got overlooked and I'm sure they're
looking through tons of resumes going
very well and then they ask you a little
bit about college and then you you
explained that oh well you know I don't
have a degree I'm self-taught and you
know you sell yourself a little bit but
the the interview pretty much ends I so
unfortunately a requirement for this job
is that you have at college degree and a
lot of times you can't even get that
first interview so it is a it is a real
thing there are companies and I believe
a lot of government jobs won't hire you
at all unless you have a degree no this
is slowly breaking down and not a
must-have but you're you have to step
outside of the norm of what is expected
of a software developer to overcome this
for some companies now so with college
it's the most structured you're not
gonna decide what you want to learn on
your own and to me that's that's that
doesn't sound like a good experience but
to some I couldn't understand how
especially in web development you get so
overwhelmed by everything that's out
there that instead someone sits you down
says this is what you're going to do
this is what you're gonna learn and
you're a lot of people may enjoy that so
by the way if you got a problem with me
drinking straight from the bottle you
need to give me a man up it's my house I
drink from the bottle of what to I
should grab a cup down now I'm in jail
get a cup when you don't drink for the
ball - as I say not as I do
right but college so the pros of college
is that it is respected amongst a
bachelor's degree in computer science
software engineering is what we're
talking about specifically is respected
among the companies that are out there
in the world that like them and it does
give you an air of oh hey this guy might
know what he's doing now I would suggest
that if you are in college that you do
start a side project that you do start
learning because one of the downsides of
college is it takes them a very long
time to update their teachings to their
lessons their courses and the stuff that
you're going to be learning it's gonna
be usually more Theory based which is
fine some of the time but it's gonna not
be very practical which is going to be
the hardest berieve intro is July you
have to learn outside of work right
you're gonna graduate and think of jobs
guarantee for you but you know it's kind
of like the old adage like the
entry-level job with 3 to 5 years
experience right or two years experience
and so but College will open up doors in
terms of internships right there's a lot
of internship programs that are with
colleges and so there are some benefits
to that now what are some of the cons
right we've talked about how it opens up
doors through internships and companies
just being willing to look at you
some of the cons being a little bit more
theory based typically not very
practical and some outdated to a degree
but also there's a very big time
commitment 4 to 6 years I would say it's
probably pretty realistic for a CS
degree you also have to account that
your that is what you are doing not only
in terms of what you're doing for the
next four to six years but also the fact
that you're losing out and on 46 years
of potential resume experience potential
income you're taking on a massive amount
of debt the average college grad I wanna
say in 2017 was graduating with 37
thousand dollars worth of debt that's
graduating I'm sure they were actually
paying off some of that through
part-time jobs or whatever that
typically a lot of times you're probably
just being a waiter or bartender or
delivering pizzas like I was in college
just to have some money for food God
knows that you know
paying much of that debt off delivering
pizzas right um most time I'm just happy
to take a pizza home you know I mean
have some money for the utilities try
keep these lights on and some free pizza
in the fridge so I that is a massive
thing and something that a lot of people
they just think that oh well you know
I'm gonna I'm gonna take this forty
thousand dollars of debt sometimes more
sometimes less but about forty thousand
dollars of debt on and I'm going to pay
it off through my degree so now
essentially you have this lump which now
when you graduate differently you will
pay interest on your loans and
everything and so you're paying off this
stuff four five ten you know I work with
software developers who make more than I
do of five six seven years experience
who are still to this day paying off
their their student loans and it's it's
a bit depressing and unfortunate because
you are strapped with this debt that you
need to pay off now you can make the
argument that will you took this debt on
to get a good job and pay for it but
also you may make the base off are two
other things we're gonna talk about
maybe you don't have to take on such a
large amount at so you have to kind of
weigh those options is that the cons are
you're taking on a large amount of debt
for a very long time
most likely now if you can get
scholarships or your your folks are
gonna pay for it hey maybe maybe it's
for you right you don't have to take on
that debt that's something to consider
part of the reason I was in college was
my father was paying for it and part of
the reason I'm going back as I feel
guilty that he paid for it and I didn't
graduate and here we are boys paying for
it out of pocket now that we're a
developer so so that's something
consider so it's just summarized for
college companies due respect that may
open doors internships potentially cons
it's a very big time commitment which
takes away your time from going and
learning the practical things as well as
potentially getting resume experience as
potentially starting today starting
tomorrow right whenever you feel like
you can and that big amount of debt that
I don't think a ton of people actually
realize how big it is and what a big
portion of of
of your life your check will go to and
so how unfortunately that is so
something to consider all right so next
up is Kony boot camps what are some of
the pros and cons of coding boot camps
pros it is a something instead of going
for the very theory base and this again
it's in differ by coding boot camp but
they they traditionally traditionally
they they typically have a more
practical practical aspect to them they
are trying to they adapt their
curriculum very quickly because their
programs aren't four-year programs right
there or their three-month programs a
lot of times three to four sometimes six
months programs where they're able to
update their their curriculum to the job
market not only to the job market
most of these coding boot camps are
regionally based and so they will update
their curriculum to be based off what's
going on in you know Utah for instance
what the tech community is like in
Seattle in San Francisco and so they
will update their curriculum based off
that and very rapidly right if es7 es
ESA es 9 whatever it is comes out
they're gonna want to make sure that you
know that and they're gonna have people
there and one of the things that I will
say that I really do respect about a lot
of coding boot camps is as someone who
would love to work in one amos looked
into it the thing that when they most of
them and this this varies by company but
all the good ones typically will require
that the the instructors have seven
eight years experience as a working
developer so that they can really teach
you those hands-on things that you're
really going to only learn on the job
and I don't know how many of my computer
science teachers ever actually work I I
mean I do and it's about one third of my
teachers actually ever worked as
developers and to me that was something
that I always found very unacceptable I
felt like if you are teaching me how to
be a developer I want you to be a
developer I want you to that one point
in time be a developer now you that
people can have difference of opinion
about but I would say in coding boot
camps it is very nice that you do have
someone who RC
that's on-the-job experience and I I
really like that about that so another
thing is that time commitment we already
talked about the time commitment in a in
a software degree program in a coding
boot camp you're looking at three to
four months typically of actual time in
the boot camp a lot of time now don't go
into a coding boot camp if you think
you're just going to sort of jump around
and just like oh I'm gonna get a
certificate I'm guaranteed job it's so
bad mentality to have man your bet
you're probably gonna waste about ten
thousand dollars but for those who are
motivated and who understand that you're
gonna probably need to study three to
six months before you go into the coding
boot camp coding boot camps a lot of
people who don't understand coding boot
camps think that you go to a coding boot
camp to learn to code and that's a
really bad mentality to have you should
already know how to code when you go
into a coding boot camp now what a
coding boot camps going to do is it's
going to take you from us an enthusiast
someone who's just trying to learn to
code to someone who actually learns to
code and can write production level code
at least that's that's the goal so
you're gonna want to spend three to six
months studying the technologies before
you actually even go into the coding
boot camp from there they're gonna
refine you set some good habits maybe
teach you some frameworks some of the
latest tools that you know you didn't
necessarily work with so in terms of
time commitment I really see the time
commitment about nine months for a
coding boot camp even though you're
probably only going to be on on campus
about three months
because I do think you need that prep to
go into it and then after you graduate
most coding boot camps although there
are some out there that will guarantee
you a three month internship I I read
recently and it's very very interesting
thing but most coding boot camps they do
have hiring days and from my
understanding about when engineer truth
went to dev Mountain about half of the
students got hired within the first
week and a half which is pretty
impressive you asked me when in this web
dev curriculum so but I would say that's
probably high to get hiring your first
week and a half I would also suggest
that understand that when you're coding
boot camp ends a lot of people suffer
from this is that they they take a break
they're like oh man thank God I just got
done with this three-month boot camp I'm
just gonna take a week off that is an
awful mentality you have you really need
to stick at it because this is something
that's cumulative so in terms of pros
time commitment nine months not bad
money commitment you're looking at about
ten thousand dollars which compared to
forty thousand dollars it's much smaller
it's a little bit higher when you sort
of think about the per capita uh alright
the amount per time rather but ten
thousand compared to forty thousand a
lot of you may be able to pay for half
of that upfront or all of it up at once
or you know take out a smaller loan and
some boot camps have scholarships help
you out and whatnot but learning
relevant the cons are it is most
definitely not respected in terms of
what a computer science degree would get
for you it is not normally going to open
the same doors you're still going to
have the barrier of entry to those
companies that won't hire you without a
degree I would say that you can get some
internships with it based off the
organization how well they run their
their program also it is a quick way to
waste ten thousand dollars if you're the
wrong individual going to a coding boot
camp and from my understanding talking
with again people have gone to coding
boot camps talking with mat is that
there's a good about third of students
who enroll in a coding boot camp they're
they're people looking for a career
change there are people who see the you
know 95 percent hiring with a hundred
thousand dollars salary sort of
clickbait if you will and they just a
man if I get a job it's gonna pay me
it's gonna pay me more than the the
 job I have now
 I'll do anything and they realized
that this is not a I'll do anything job
you really have to sort of understand
what you're getting into and there's
been tons of people that I've heard
from several people have been in coding
bootcamp so you go and you see people
like at on campus playing league of
legends that guy just wasted ten
thousand dollars as far as I'm concerned
because you're really I promise you you
don't have time to play League of
Legends every day on campus so but
there's about a third of students who
will go they will enroll and they see
the sort of get rich quick scheme aspect
in their mind and they don't realize
that it is just as grueling as a degree
program because now not only are you
only do it for three months it's up to
you to continue your learning after the
fact so if you are they do have the
structured aspect for those three months
but the previous part before isn't
structured right as you're preparing and
the part after where you're continuing
your learning isn't structured either so
if you really need a structured
environment a coding bootcamp may not be
for you when you actually add it all
together now if you think that you can
just need those three or four months to
really just get you going it's probably
a good option especially if you're later
in life you have kids you have families
you're like look man I can't wait six
years to do a career change I just can't
I understand man so a coding boot camp
might be something that would work
better for you so those are the pros and
the cons they're self taught so this is
probably the hardest category of all of
them to go about because you're on your
own right you're uh you're you're kinda
on your own this is I'm a self-taught
developer and I can tell you it's been a
journey
ah in uh in very in the very essence of
the guard and part of that is that there
is no structured miss you have to really
hold yourself accountable you have to
know what to study and you have to know
what's relevant and you have to know
what employers want and there's no one
who's going to really tell you that
right and I'm I personally am okay with
that because I the way that I've always
said how I know what to study what I
want to learn I just go look at the job
apps who's hiring
what are they hiring for and what
direction do I want my career to go in
if I want to be a front-end engineer
what are people studying to be a
front-end
or what are people hiring for right now
if I were to go on LinkedIn and look at
the top 100 front-engined front-end
engineers in Seattle in San Francisco
what is it that they want that's how
I've always gone about studying and
learning and holding myself accountable
right some people can't wake up every
day and say look I'm gonna study a web
development they need to go to class
right somewhere there you know where
they're paying money out of pocket and
that that keeps them accountable that's
okay different type of person that's not
the first thing I am I pretty much
prefer to not learn the theory and
learning the practical skills but I can
understand how the theory can be helpful
God knows it's helpful in the technical
interviews so as a some of the the pros
is that it is a less structured
environment unless you if that's what
you need because you want to set your
own structure right why should try to
force yourself to abduct to what
somebody else says is good when you said
look this is how I work I work this way
I'm going to work within this way and
I'll be successful as long as I stick to
it now not everyone has that ability and
that's a major major con because a lot
of people would you know they if they
have to hold themselves accountable they
just don't do it that it's much it's
very easy to say hey man Dylan I forgive
you bro you're great guy didn't I I know
you meant well done I know you meant to
code today but uh don't worry I ain't
gonna hold it against you said Dylan I
appreciate that very much sir
you're you're a great guy for for
allowing me to slip up a little bit not
judging me
I'm gonna go out with the boys tonight
we're gonna have a beer we're gonna do
some other things that depending on the
state may be illegal or legal and you
know we're just gonna keep it 100 all
right
but you get what I'm saying you say it's
very easy to fall out of your system if
you can't hold yourself accountable
right you know if you can't wake up
every morning or go home after work and
do these things and you don't have these
same the same doors that are opening
there are no doors you have to open your
own doors right that's that's the thing
is you don't have a degree you know I
have a certificate
you don't have you know alumni you don't
have internship programs set up
specifically for the self-taught
developer the self-taught developer has
to open their own doors so how might you
go about doing that well we have a
separate video coming out next week
talking exactly about that but a few
things is you have to you have to show
that you can code you have to you have
to be an interesting candidate you have
to start projects volunteer maybe go and
get some certs and you're off time right
that do you Demi courses build up a web
presence you know there's there's a ton
of things that you can do but you have
to go do them and these are all things
that would work great with the bootcamp
work great with the college degree but
that's just gonna add on to and make you
that much of a better candidate you as a
self-taught dev you don't have a choice
as far as I'm concerned you need to
prove that you are just as good if not
better right and so you are the one who
has to no one's opening doors for you
you are opening your own doors and to do
that you have to work hard you have to
get creative and you have to you have to
show them that you just got stand out
amongst a crowd now that's that's a hard
task for a lot of people because there's
a lot of hard work so something consider
pros again typically gonna spend very
little money when I dropped out of
school and I was studying web
development this may surprise some
people but I never bought a course on
udemy
I never every everything I did was
YouTube videos everything I did was free
tutorials and I I I don't suggest not
spending money on udemy courses this
actually one of the things I would
change about how I learned to code is
you know money was tight but you can
always spare 12 dollars for a course I
would actually have done done that and
learned some more relevant skills but
that that was that was from went from
dropping out of college to studying web
development to getting a job there was
not $1 spent on a course there was not a
dollar spent on team treehouse or code
Khadem ePro or any of that crap it was
free materials YouTube building projects
and essentially just everyday grinding
going to meet
meetups getting some free pizza at some
of those meetups a lot of meetups supply
food so if some of you who are in the
grind and need a free meal thrown it out
there learn and get fed so it is it's
one of those things where in terms of
money it can be very low right I would
say that you could probably take $500
just some number get a ton of courses on
udemy probably 50 right around 50
courses you do all 50 courses your
master dev if you actually build stuff
outside of those courses on top of it
and learn a ton of amazing things but so
the money aspect is there the time
commitment varies so it's so hard to
give a hard time commitment because you
will you will need to be very
accountable and everyone goes a
different pace and you'll need to
understand how to handle when you get
stuck and how to understand how to
transition what to learn and how to get
help when you know if you're in a boot
camp you're in a college program gimmie
help this is much easier than when
you're look man I'm so low hey it's just
a tema me and I you know I mean like so
I ain't nothing but me and I here trying
to keep it together right and me and I
is keeping us accountable me and I is
helping yourself so you're gonna need to
learn how to Google I which is the skill
you need as a developer anyhow but it's
a it's a much harder path for a lot of
people it is something that I have found
that will make you a better developer
because you do most of the time need to
be able to have the skills to teach
yourself into debug by yourself and to
continue your education as yourself
there's a reason that 90% of developers
consider themselves taught even though
they have bachelor's degrees and
bootcamp certs and things like that
because it you are essentially going to
teach yourself after you get done with
your bachelor's you are essentially
going to teach yourself after you get
done with your bootcamp and you are of
course going to teach yourself at even
after your first development job of
self-taught developer so it's a much
harder thing to hold yourself
accountable which is the largest the
largest issue
um this video has been going on about 23
minutes so uh I'm gonna wrap it up I did
say what I would do and why I'm gonna
actually make that a separate video
would be a video after this so I'll try
and link both videos in there maybe I'll
make this part one or something but um I
appreciate you guys watching this video
I hope you guys don't think I clicked
beta or anything like that I'm gonna
tell you what I'm going what I would
change and why and I hope this sort of
opened your mind up a little bit about
some of the pros and the cons some
things to consider as you're out there
preparing for boot camp considering
going to college considering going the
self-taught route what it actually takes
the the sort of strength the strict
schedule you have to hold yourself
accountable to right because at the end
of the day you know in my case I could I
was delivering pizzas and I I could
always have just kept delivering pizzas
if I didn't want to and there's
something wrong with working a job right
I deliver pizzas for about four or five
years until I finally got my
together and and everyone has to live
their life but just understand that you
are the one who has to hold yourself
accountable and some people need a more
structured environment so I don't
necessarily advise everyone to go the
self-taught route but I do think it is
the route that was best for me but um
let's go ahead and say thank you for
watching this very long video I hope you
found it helpful guys don't forget to
comment like subscribe share support me
on patreon all that good stuff check out
my courses I see you guys next time bye
take one last swig real quick for the
homies who gave up learning and cut
along the way hey guys if you're
interested in a nice javascript course I
just released my second course and in
here we're actually going to be breaking
down JavaScript as a language as well as
give you some opportunities to solve
some algorithms and build some build up
your github as well as introduce you a
little bit to markdown there's a link in
the description to get the course for
just $15 if you're interested as always
thanks for watching I'll see you next
