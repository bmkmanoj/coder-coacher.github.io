specifically while loops we're doing
introduction of while loops in
JavaScript kind of like for loops I
guess we're in this they are but they
don't really require all eyes and
increments they just go until they hit
at some sort of value all right so check
out the while loop in the editor don't
worry about the math dot floor we'll
check that out later I guess
so let's face it says Walt coin face is
equal to zero keep running this so tails
done flipping all right so let's see
let's create our own while loop now
let's try it yourself completes a while
loop and editor so that for now I'm
learning on loops don't change the line
don't change line 5 or you could get
infinite loop so we'll say well
understand equals equals equals true and
then it's gonna break and turn false
here so something that I ran at once
don't run the code the way it is all
right so we have another loop change
value understand here so we need to
change it to equal false else it will
keep on running so there we go
simple enough bullying's are great for
while loops there's a lot of things you
used to change while loop we've written
less succinct version corrected for a
more elegant version
alright so in this case it's saying that
for a while loop we can just insert the
actual boolean variable which is equal
to true so while true and bam so a
little less code maybe if you already
know what you're doing do it like that I
personally don't like doing that I just
like to see it that's just me right a
while loop that logs I'm looping to the
console three times all right all right
well but not with three console so I'll
count here we'll say count equals zero
I'm looping sounds like you're on some
drugs almost and then don't forget to
increment count and then you can see
right here so kind of a little more like
a for loop than the other while links
we're using alright so inside the solo
function right a while loops well
alright that takes an initial condition
true all true
then I wants us to log moved once and
then change initial condition couch is
probably a bad day for this but we're
actually keeping anything mid lesson
breathe all right so it's just reminding
us not to create infinite loops and
crash our browser when to use wall and
use for right to loops in that everyone
while on for no restrictions on this one
just make sure these are synthetic
syntactically correct so we'll do count
equals zero and I will say well and then
we'll do a for loop doing the same thing
or I to I plus plus and I'll say
just copy and paste and it should you
can see oh it doesn't okay so we see you
have extremely 0 1 to 200 or because
we're running through count again let me
change that I there we go oops yeah I
would have fixed it we'll just keep it
going here
thanks save see the loop in action it
runs once because do tells it to but the
never against because the loop condition
is false
okay so the do condition will always run
your loop at least once whether it's
true enough
so the do-while loop I'm going to stop
looping because my condition is false
all right right I do while loop inside
the function we've created for get to
the top so you start up with do and then
you end it so what do we want it to do
get to a dot top and we'll say well
bully buster
Oh
you never change the valuable so we just
created an infinite loop in crash art
program so let's see if we can exit out
here
so I'll kill that page okay so do not do
what I just did there great stuff and
then all trick and this should run it
just once why is it only why is it
crashes
oh wait actually so we re crashed for a
third time I believe the program so now
it only prints once because we set our
bull variable to false even though just
a reminder do wiles will run at least
once as well and runs once thing and to
finish up and prove your loot master
right three synthetically correct loops
editor one for one while one dupe all
right so let's start off with for loop
say I equals zero I is less than two I
plus plus console.log print out I and
I'll do a while loop I'll say bull
ankles true say all true well what will
you can do will is equal to go through
will say well true bull then we'll say
well equals equals r equals and then
we'll do it
I plus wool and then we'll say well
equals equals equals I'll just leave
well alone actually and then we'll say
wow trip well pull equals equals and
pull is going to be false so just won't
crash our program so we should be
getting 0 1 then we should get true and
that we should get one false
one true
maybe takes that's interesting I thought
she'd be false
maybe I made mistake uh but uh in this
next section we're going to be doing
something called Dragon Slayer
looks like we're gonna be using
everything we've learned so far and
trying to slay a dragon so in JavaScript
so I'll see you guys for that one and
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
