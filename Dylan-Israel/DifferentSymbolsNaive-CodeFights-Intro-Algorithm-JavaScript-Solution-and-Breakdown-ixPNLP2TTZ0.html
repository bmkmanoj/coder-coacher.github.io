in code fights doing different symbols
naive I guess I'm not quite sure what if
that's not even what the deal is but it
doesn't matter so we are what we're
tasked with here is we get a string and
we want to find out how many unique
elements that strings contains the way
that I did it was I use includes again
and I just created an array that I push
the values to a new array that pushes
values to then I check to see if we
already have it if we don't we go ahead
and add it to the array and at the end
we just return the length of that array
so let's go ahead and get started we
create a rank that I call letter array
this is going to be to store the values
after we iterate through the string that
we did now we get a string so we have to
turn it into a character array there we
go here now once we have done that we
just need to iterate through the entire
string and we're going to use a for each
function do that so for each element in
there we're going to run through our
essentially just create a for loop and
we're going to say if our letter rank
got includes again includes we'll check
to see if this value is part of the
letter right our element if that is
exactly equal to false meaning that we
don't have it in there yet go ahead and
take our letter array and push that
value to it so in this first one C isn't
going to be in it so we push C but then
it does hit C him we don't push that to
it we don't need it now now that we know
what letters are unique and we can check
real quick and return s or excuse me
letter right so we return letter array
and you'll see that it's going to return
all unique characters which should be C
a b c a b there's our cap we just take
that letter right and return the length
of it to find out how many unique
characters we have
submit it and that that's it again you
could probably go through a whole bunch
of hassle of splicing out unique
characters from a string and doing all
this other crazy stuff I don't really
think it's necessary so it might be
faster though because we are using
includes which is going to check every
element in an array but in this case I
think it doesn't necessarily matter
because a letter array will only have at
most what 26 letters in the English
language so it doesn't matter but I'm
sure there's a bunch of ways to solve
this as it's always the case in
programming but I hope you guys found
this helpful
it's just one way to solve it thank you
