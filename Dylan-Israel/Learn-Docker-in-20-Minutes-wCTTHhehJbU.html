stack web developer and in this series
of videos I'm going to be showing you
how to implement docker into your
development workflow docker has many
uses but for the purpose of this
tutorial I'm going to be showing you how
to host your local files on a Linux
virtual machine this means no more
headaches when you're trying to transfer
your project from Windows to Linux
you'll be able to develop with your
destination platform as a first-class
citizen let's get started
in order to install docker you're going
to need to go to dr. calm you're going
to click on get started so it's going to
take you to docker for Windows and
you're going to need Microsoft Windows
10 professional or Enterprise 64-bit
you're also going to need a Intel CPU
that supports virtualization so you're
going to have to do some research and
figure out if your CPU supports
virtualization and more specifically if
it supports hyper-v so you're going to
download and get on to installing docker
so the install process is actually
fairly simple you just click install go
through the prompts and there you go it
should finish relatively quickly
now I'm going to go over some more
advanced things that docker does so you
can get a general grasp of what it's
used for
the number one benefit of using docker
is the fact that you can easily
configure environments and share them on
any platform now environments don't just
have to be like node or Python or a bun
- just something simple with docker
specializes in is actually massive
horizontal scaling each environment can
be composed of many many different
containers and each container would be
say a node.js instance or a Postgres
database or a reddit store or an engine
X front and as your system requires more
and more resources docker will spawn
instances of what it needs in order to
provide the resources necessary that's
all I'm going to say about this for now
but if you are interested in seeing what
docker is capable of I highly recommend
you checking out their site and looking
through it
so now that doctor has finished
installing we're just going to launch
docker
if you happen to be running darker on a
virtual machine like I'm doing here
you
so now docker is up and running where
you see your little prompt it's going to
ask you to test some of the commands and
do whatever you want to do so if you
want to follow the prompt and do some of
this you can but I'm just going to skip
past that we're just going to open up
Windows PowerShell we're going to do a
simple hello world so with docker
let's just quickly check to the version
so dr. - V and there you go
you get our version mine's 1.13 you
might be on a newer build actually very
simple we just type docker run hello -
world now docker is going to
automatically detect that you don't have
the hello world image on your computer
unless you do for some odd reason but if
you don't have an image docker will
automatically download it and voila
there we go it's already done
hello from dr. this message shows that
your application appears to be working
correctly and that's all you need to do
in order to run hello world
okay so now we're going to do something
a little bit more crazy which is getting
bash running in right here on the
Windows PowerShell terminal and in order
to do that we're going to enter the same
command docker run but pass it an IT
argument so - IT and then you're going
to right move on - which I'm horrible at
doing apparently but I'm going to show
you exactly what IT is before we run
that so you're going to do - - health in
order to get a list of all the possible
arguments and here - I which is
interactive so it's going to open an
interactive shell and then T which is
going to make a sweet o terminal which
is basically like when you ssh into a
server or something
so in order to do this now we're just
going to do docker run - IT bun - and
it's going to automatically install the
Ubuntu container which is not an exact
replica of what would normally ship with
a bun - like you're not going to get vim
and like the Nano text editor because
these are these are scaled down very
small so they're performing and all that
like not going to waste a lot of space
on your machine as you can see it's only
50 megabytes which the ones who's pretty
small already as is compared to released
Windows but 50 megabytes is ludicrously
tiny ok so now we are in the shell we
are in Ubuntu so in order to prove that
you could just type LS which is going to
list all the items in your working
directory and voila
everything you would expect from an
Ubuntu install ok so now let me go over
some of the things that are you know
quality of life and things you need to
know for the shell when you're running
docker with a bun - so when you create a
container you're going to want to give
it a name in order to do so you just do
- - name and then pass in whatever name
you want in most cases you're going to
want to give you a container a name
about what it does or what it posts and
why log where in the shell so the reason
for naming this is because in order to
exit the shell you have two options
control PQ which will return you to
where you are but continue to run the
Ubuntu image and so you can type docker
PS to view your available containers and
here we have a container ID image
command created in the name right here
which is James and in order to get back
into our Ubuntu container or Ubuntu
shell we just write docker attached
dames
so enter the container ID now see here
how it looks like it's paused
it's just because you have to add some
kind of input in order for it to
register I don't know why it does that
but it's just a tiny bug that they still
haven't got around to fixing now another
way to exit is to literally just type
exit in the shell which is going to
close the container the container will
not be running anymore so if we write
dr. PS you can see that it's missing
it's not there now another thing you can
do is docker images which is going to
show you all your downloaded images and
as you can see here we have run through
in a hello world right now
we don't need hello world so you can
type docker remove I like RMI which does
remove image and we just type hello -
world now if it doesn't work you just do
remove and you pass it a force variable
okay
and voila it's gone so now we write
docker images and all we have is Ubuntu
now so let's clear the screen and show
you one last thing
so say I have my eye doctor shell
and I use control P Q in order to exit
it and I still have my shell open my
container is still running say I want to
remove it without entering it I would
just run docker RM dash F the force
variable to make sure you know gets rid
of it and then docker assigns random
names if you don't name your container
so this one is called clever Shannon so
let's just remove clever Shannon and
there we go and now if we run docker PS
no more clever Shannon
okay now that we have a basic grasp on
how to use docker and what it does let's
move on to implementing it into our
development workflow because that's the
fastest way to learn so I've gone ahead
and created a github repository here
with some little system little stuff all
it does it's just a simple nodejs
application that prints the node
environment and it prints the
environment that the file is being
served from so if it's running on Linux
it's going to print Linux if it's
running on Windows it's going to print
when it's running on Mac it's going to
print some crazy stuff so let me put the
URLs down here at the bottom and let me
copy this and we're just going to do a
git loan well guess what clone it into
HS and there we go
now we're going to navigate to docker
hub so hub docker comm and we're going
to look up the node package because this
is a node file this is a node
application that we're going to be
serving
go to the node package we scroll down
until we come to here we're going to
create our own docker file so I'm going
to open up sublime text
and I'm going to ash these to the sides
we're going to copy right here what they
have
pasted here to remove this so we have
from note so what trum means in a docker
file is what is it going to base itself
off of what images are going to use to
create itself say I wanted to create an
Ubuntu application I would be replacing
this with Ubuntu now note actually has
its own from move on to like it's on an
Ubuntu server itself and then we have
exposed here which is going to expose
the port that our application is running
on now the application I have made is
running on port 80
I chose port 80 because that's the
standard port when it comes to hosting a
website off of a server and you're not
able to do it on your host PC typically
begins the protected port
now I'm going to save this docker file
into the directory that I cloned my repo
into now this is very important you need
to make sure it's called dot dr. file
same casing because this is the file
that docker will be looking for and this
is literally the file type is docker
file these save and there we go we have
it finished now we're done with this we
move over here back into our terminal
and put this to the side actually
now let's get around to actually
building our application so what's CD
into our repo and let's quickly just
open that up for me to explain we need
to have our application our docker file
in here and the application together
because it's going to build this
application in this repo it's going to
be looking for it relative to its
position so it has to be in here and
they provide us with the command to
build our applications let's copy-paste
that now docker build - tea now - tea
means tag is what you're going to be
naming your image so in my case I'm
going to be naming this hello system
and then got this dot here which is you
know the relative file path so is this
is where it's going to be searching to
build the application and in my case
this does not work so I have to add
another argument which is dash F so file
because we're going to going to be
telling it what file to look for so in
my case is going to be looking for a dot
docker file and then we have to put in
of course the relative path again and
now it will start building now I have no
idea why it does this on my machine of
course I am running this all off of a
virtual machine so there's a lot of
problems here but you know you got to
learn to adapt
okay so our build is finished and now we
can move on to the next step which is
actually running our application so they
provide us with the command to do so and
don't worry I'll go through with each of
these arguments mean and here we are so
basically what this is going to do is
it's going to run the application and
it's going to do the - I - just like you
would run with a the Ubuntu because it
is Ubuntu and so - I interactive - T TTY
a suede o terminal - - R M now what this
does is every time you start the app
it's going to start fresh it's going to
delete everything it had before and
basically just boot from what it came
with and then here - - name we've
already gone through which is my running
app and then my no js' - app and we
could just run this now but of course we
have to replace that with our image name
which is hello system and voila
here we are it's running so in order to
access this we're actually not going to
be able to get to this through our
localhost right now if I go to localhost
80 of course it's not going to work
want to access our application that's
being served on the containers port in
this case it's a tea and bind it to
whatever port we want on our local
machine we're going to actually have to
add a port command so let's just do that
real quick so - P and then our port this
is the port that we're going to bind it
to so in my case you know let's just go
a little crazy here with 1337 and then
add in the containers port this is what
the application is being served on so in
our case it's port 80 and then we can
just pass the name so let's call it high
and then pass it the image
hello system it's going to run here we
are and we come here to localhost and
it's going to greet us with hello Linux
which is what is being served off of
now say we want to make some changes to
the file and let's just go ahead and do
that real quick let me show you the
problem with actually changing the file
right now and it's not going to work so
let's go in here let's edit this and
here we have hello and let's just change
this to hello there buddy
and then it's going to say whatever
now changed but the problem is even if
we run the same command
ah now if you went into this error you
actually have to remove the you have to
remove the container even if it stopped
like it won't show up here in dr. PS but
it still exists like I can actually just
run doctor's start and I believe I can
just leave out all of the arguments and
your undock starts hi
and it should just start whatever I had
and it's actually going to start it in a
detached mode if I wanted to start it
attached I would of course passed the IP
parameter but in this case it's detached
here we are we can just come over here
and it's running right now as you can
see it's running
if I wanted to get back into that I
could just docker attach myself to hi
and here we are we're in it it doesn't
show anything of course nothing is being
logged to the console so let's just
cancel it close it and now in order to
remove this from it we're just going to
have to do exactly as I've shown
previously which is docker remove -
force hi and remove it from the system
now we are able to re execute the
command and the changes you're going to
see have not been made the changes
aren't here so in order to get these
changes pushed to our application we're
actually going to have to think like our
file system to the containers file
system now we could just constantly
rebuilding applications every time we
made a change but that is a hassle and
that takes a lot of time so to avoid
said hassle we're just going to bind our
file system to the Linux file system in
order to do that you're actually going
to have to come down here to the little
rail go to settings go to shared drives
and select your your drive that you're
serving the application whatever file
you want to bind you have to that
whatever Drive it's on you have to share
it
so now we just run docker run it P 1337
80 and just to show that I can make this
port whatever whatever I want let's
change it back to 3000 here
and then - feet now on windows you can't
do this okay you can't name your file
something like that like a C or
something you have to do it this way the
Linux way you would do - - the slash
users slash whatever you are wherever
the file is in this case for me it's in
the HS folder and then we're going to
find this - in this case on the node
thing it's going to bind your app like
your app is going to be located at user
slash source slash app and then let's
give it the name again the name hi and
then hello - system here we are
13:37 anymore and with wala there are
are changes
now this can actually be done live
anything with images anything that's not
that it doesn't have to be recompiled by
note every time you do it like static
images or like ugh template files like
HTML files but you know it services and
stuff it could just be done live you can
just change it keep the thing running
and you don't have to restart it every
time you edit the files in this case
though because the server is running on
this I have to restart it every time I
make a change now I'm going to show you
how I use docker to support my
development workflow
so here we have my portfolio website
directory and here's the docker file
exactly the same from the previous parts
of the tutorial now in order to actually
start working with docker of course you
need to run it so doctor and I'm going
to check my images to see what I've got
here you see I have my portfolio so I
just do dr. run - i.t portfolio but
let's not forget we need to include our
P so in this case 3080 because it's
being my application is being served on
port 80 let me just show that right here
port 80 we also need to sync up the
libraries and there we go
the libraries and now all we need to do
is run this
and there we are my website is running
so let's take a look and voila
my website is currently being hosted on
docker
you
so now let's just show a little bit of
that live file changing that I mentioned
so in that case if I go over here to my
views and then into my index because the
directories are synced using docker
volumes I can just do whatever I want
here say I want to add an h1 so this is
using the pug templating engine so h1
doctor is here save and now all I need
to do is refresh and there it is pretty
cool right so that's the basics of what
you need to get started with
implementing docker into your
development workflow my name is Tomas
