back in SAS let's ask for Coke Adam e
we're in unit for sustainable scss
little note here that it can be
confusing if it you don't organize it
properly definitely kind of follow the
standard organization parrot shows us
how a lot of this a lot of things and
sass are organized it looks like
components such as buttons castles
covers are in the components help
various layout pages just the general
sort of paso if you if you kind of want
to keep this Mary screenshot it download
it also it looks like by default d at
import so at import URL is how you're
going to import import like html5 ir
excuse me like styling files for
instance this one looks like a font
family from Google's API called pacifico
so that's how we would use that and
you'll see how our fonts change in
comparison so it also don't you know
it'll be similar to how you've already
done it except you're importing it in a
slightly different manner not not not
too not too confusing alright so we're
going to import the variables partial
right now so that import and then it's a
helper / variables
it's going to run that and see what
happens so you see something got
imported a reminder that helper refers
to resources like variables mixings
functions etc those are your elements
that help grow the foundation of your
code base so it looks like help area is
defined with a gonna find the file that
we're looking for so what this is a file
path right here so we're saying helper /
find the / variables if you go back to
that first sort of file path that they
have you'll see that that's what's going
on here
so we import this and that's why the
lemonade banner works the absolute class
selector has false position dot absolute
alright so we're going to find something
new the dot absolute is nothing more
than a idea that we're creating is a
position absolute and then extend this
class inside of both dot slogan and of
span so we have our class here this is
our absolute class and excuse me I said
id this is a class and we're going to go
ahead and extend it and slogan and in
sites r and so on what I imagine this
does is this will inherit the class that
we defined by using dot B it by using at
extent so we're going to inherit the
values here not absolute and then at
extend
so I extend out lemonade eyes are going
to run this and see if we understood
this correctly it's Pierce that we did
very nice quite an interesting
background to learn this I'm not quite
sure what I would have done but lemonade
is something that's a little interesting
sometimes you may have to create classes
solely for the purpose of extending them
and never actually use them aside your
HTML sasses anticipa-- this allows
special type of selector called a place
holder you can think of placeholders
behaving just like a class or ID but
instead using the % all right so where
you can use the % to only use stuff
within your sass document notice how we
never actually used dot absolute
anywhere in the HTML so we go here it's
never actually called anywhere this is
simply a SAS class so what we can do is
actually change this so it this will
help organize our code a little bit and
it will work all the same except we just
have to know from the get-go that when
we do that we're going to have to we're
gonna have to do it in every person
every every instance where we extended
that class we're gonna have to change
that over notice our code our visuals
are still the same but we're extending
this class to only be used in size
so a whole lot of stuff going on here
let's go ahead and see what they're
trying to say so we want to remove the
center mix in in the helper / mix in dot
CSS it doesn't take a variable instead
be sure to change the include same as
suit remove the center mix in ice let's
find the center mixin so at include
Center so that's been that's h1 and
we're looking for span do you like so I
don't think that's all we need to do we
actually have to do some other stuff so
we did that first remove the center
mixing how do we do that I don't see the
center mix in
r oh they want us to open up into five
so we have helper / underscore Mixon so
let's go our helper Mixon remove the sin
to make sending the helper harshal it
does not take in a variable and instead
make it a placeholder inside the helper
underscore placeholder alright so this
is the one that they want us to take out
and then they want to go placeholder
only they want us to put it into their I
believe that is what we need to do
in valacea sad include an identifier was
and include expected identifier was all
i think i forgot to let's go ahead and
close this real quick so i think what we
needed to do was an hour span and h1 we
didn't extend it i think i just threw it
in there yeah I said instead of adding
clewd we wanted to do at extend let's go
ahead and take this one retelling so
include we want to extend
where are you my child so just one I
thought there was 2i here just add
extend the center
the selector lavoie was not found so
what was supposed to happen once you're
supposed to import this placeholder and
from there we're supposed to be able is
targeted
and extend center what was our air right
here the selector Center was not found
use at extend / center if the x10 should
be able to fail on line 8
so we're oh it's in everything so you
can actually set this up to fail I don't
think that's what they want us to do
hmm
we moved Eric mix in center
remove the center mixin we did that in
the helper so I should mix i ns alright
so we're good there and instead make it
a placeholder inside helper dot place
litter do I not define the placeholder
correctly I see what was going on here
so I I left this as a mixin while we
actually needed to keep change it to a
placeholder class there we go alright um
does I hope that makes it so essentially
it was we it was the wrong sort of
variable if you want to think of it like
that we needed to change the type of it
the variable is proud of the wrong word
to use pretty cool um definitely a good
introduction to sass um I highly
encourage using this / CSS in the future
I will be personally I may not fully be
able to understand when you use the
placeholder and when not to but that's
part of programming get into it and
learn it along the way I think this is a
great opportunity to kind of have a
basic foundation and the next step is
maybe just to force yourself when you're
styling to use Sasson eventually you'll
use it a little bit more and a little
more complex but um as always guys thank
you for the supporting on patreon and
thank you for the likes and shares they
helped a ton and as always guys I'll see
you in the next video thanks for
watching hey guys thanks for watching
the video my good friend Matt at
engineered truth has a three-part
interview with Quincy Larson the founder
of free code camp go ahead and check
that out and so you'll get a lot of
really cool stuff thanks for watching
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
