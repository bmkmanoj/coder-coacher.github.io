it's out we're on the final section data
structures data structures so let's go
ahead and just jump right into it we're
gonna take a look at this code and let's
see what's going on here so we're
importing a special file it's we have
our class Olympics then we have our main
method in our main method we create an
ArrayList of strings ArrayList is
something that you store items in or
values so say we need to catalog phone
numbers we could store an ArrayList of
phone numbers and we would name a
catalog or whatever and cool we're
adding some stuff to our ArrayList
printing some stuff out we're running a
for loop here what's going on here
it's it saying you go for the datatype
in this case it's a string then this
normally I would use I that's just my
convention this is just what the value
is of increased by one for Olympic
sports which is our ArrayList so iterate
through the strings one at a time for
our ArrayList and in this case it's
printing out the value we use something
here called a hashmap which is this is a
string and an integer and you kind of
can work off both of them you can't the
value of both but usually use this it's
like maybe you'll have coordinates and
then you put in the coordinates and it
will tell you the city or if that makes
more sense so you don't really care
about the coordinates you care about the
value so it's a value and a key
typically and then we have another for
loop and this is saying if they posted
before 2016 or after 2016 so let's go
ahead and run it and it's gonna tell us
some stuff just for now so stuff cool so
let's get started with that so
so um the way you normally would write a
for loop is you would declare variable
in this case it's water-level
I always use I so you said it in tier
and this is going to be where you start
in what you're basing your levels off of
so we'll say water level is less than
and we're seven this is saying wall it
is less than water level while water
level is less than seven continue
running this for loop and then how do we
break out of the for loop we increment
by one every time so set set a int at
whatever works for you typically it's
zero or one and then keep running it and
then increment it by 1 so now when we
run it it should run 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
times if you start at 0 so
I guess so one two three four five six
seven go inside the main method create
an ArrayList object called weekly
temperatures and integer datatype so
inside the main what we're gonna do is
we're gonna create an array list and
this you'll notice that we imported this
utility from important it's because it's
not five default included most of time
so we're creating an array list of
integers and we want to call it weekly
temperatures and we're gonna set it
equal to a new ArrayList integer and
then always if you're me you always
forget that this is not there and just
edit our try to figure out why you're
really this doesn't work so make sure
when you're creating that ArrayList like
that that you do do everything you need
to cool so we're obviously nothing
prints out we're just creating our
ArrayList here now we want to add some
ArrayList so it's an integer so what are
we gonna add integers so to do that all
we do is we call our weekly temperatures
and what do we want to say we will say
dot add and in here we put our parameter
in this case it's a number so we'll say
78 run our code we'll do it again
we'll do it weekly temperatures and what
we're doing right now is we are adding
the integer to our ArrayList so this one
would take up the first spot which is
the zero index and then this one would
take up the second spot which is the
first index lists and and a lot of
things in Java start on zero instead of
one so just keep that in mind and that's
going to be important for your for loops
and like calling dot Lanes sometimes
I'll do plus one sometimes you do minus
one just fine so let's kind of finish up
here weekly temperatures dot add and
we'll have had 89
so have been some great weather more
like a hundred eight hundred ten hundred
and eleven in California it's been
miserable
weekly and finally we're going to add
the final one of ninety four so we have
four we have four uh in sent are a list
with I know we are going to call get on
them this is a get nice here so we want
to print out so system : and what do we
want to print out the lowest temperature
all right so we're gonna call weekly
temperatures again we're gonna call dunk
it and this is gonna be how we get our
index value here so don't get and we
want it to get the zero position it
looks like
can I find simple
all the lowest okay so in their example
ertai
I thought the lowest as in zero so what
we're actually trying to get is the
lowest number here so we're looking for
67 and so like I said this is index 0
and this is index 1 all the way up to
index 2 and finally index 3 so which one
would we want we want to get 67 I think
that's what's going on here No Oh or you
forget an hour instead of a tea strainer
my no.10 very confused see ya let's see
what's going on here so this is kind of
cool to actually give you the code
that's what I had oh my god let's go
back
and then run it that's exactly what I
had I tried that yeah
so you call the arraylist got get in the
word this actually goes to the next
value whole 101 in the next cool
inserting a new temperature and index
choo so how do we do that we want to say
we we want to to overwrite it we are
going to put the index value first so
index 2 0 1 2 so 89 we don't want 89
anymore what we want is for the second
index to be 100 honor in 11 make sure
you get the number right cool and use
the get method get that print out the
temperature of 89
just not French and we are going to say
println - oops of weekly temperatures
weekly temperatures dot gets and
semicolon run that
huh so on it next time you say it man's
pronounced temperature 89
oh okay this doesn't actually override
it I apologize for that so when we
actually we're actually doing here is
inserting right here at the second index
the so this would be actually inserting
right here excuse me
so we're inserting right here the weekly
temperature dot add at that index point
so this is we're inserting it so what
we're actually we're trying to call
eighty nine I made a mistake and thought
we were overriding it that's not what
we're doing we're actually just
inserting it at the second index point
so in this case to get eighty nine we
want to look we want to call it index
four because it's uno 7811 6789 maybe
for what one two three what is going on
with this thing
okay so apparently Sarah won Oh - the
fact that your I had to - one for the
index so don't forget that's indexes
start at zero and one so that's what
happened right there
insider inside of a for loop print out
the elements of the weekly temperatures
a trade list so we're going to say for
anti for anti it's equal to zero
semicolon so it's less than and then
here we're gonna we don't sure we could
put in a we could put in a hard number
like seven or the better way to do it is
put dot size because later on we may
change our code and we need a for loops
all to work accordingly and then we're
gonna increase I PI plus plus so the dot
size method is used for just getting the
size of the array list thing you're
doing it from there so in this case we
want to system dot out dot print and
then I'll print out what do we want to
print out the elements so what are the
elements the elements are weekly
temperature so it's our object and the
dot get method and at the end of this
what are we getting we are getting I so
I is our number starts at zero zero one
two three four so that's what we're
getting we're getting a number it
inserted in there and then we are
printing it out so it should print out
all these numbers in order seventy-eight
six seven oh and then the two lemons so
78 111
so many 67 after
Oh Gatemouth unfavorable J you can use
the example used to get method and the
int variable J you can you me right now
I have to change this J they're really
making me do that I don't think that's
the air though oh my god that was the
air so make sure you use J instead of I
someone who doesn't have their glasses
on right now let me tell you they look
very similar so the current block is
that kind of the editor is saying
complete finished the for each loop so
we have an integer so we're putting in
numbers so first thing we have to do is
to clear the parameter type in this case
it's an integer next we need to declare
this is like our I was already playing
there and then finally the object that
we are iterating through or the
ArrayList in this case and then we print
it up and that should be it
and that should be it so we are going to
create a hashmap so this is basically
adorned nikki is kind of how I think
about it all right a door to a value a
key to a key to a door
whatever just whatever helps you make
remember how how the hashman works or it
will work for you so in this case hash
map is our string and then integer and
then we're gonna say and these you can
change these so you can you could do int
and an int or a boolean and you know a
class so it's not exclusive a string
integer it's probably just the easiest
way to do it and we are calling this
restaurant map and what are we doing
from here so next we need to say new a
hash map of strings and integers
and of course don't forget the brackets
at the end so
and if you're a bad bad bad speller like
me and this is actually menu let's see
if that fixes it cool so we created our
hash map here haven't done anything with
it it's gonna get it that key which is
gonna be the integer and it's going to
tell us about you truly a stream so
let's add some food items some prices
charm menu you put mints it to add it
turkey burger with the value so a foot
will add the value so let's put it into
our hash map it's kind of how you should
think of it so in our case we're
actually working with just a restaurant
menu goddamn I'm just gonna copy this
word cuz I'm gonna spell I still wrote
it still worked one of those words where
I'm like oh man I'm so bad I I know I'm
bad at spelling and then you add in
restaurant and there's just like words I
like no I I should learn to spell my
don't okay so let's put that in a turkey
burger so in this case we're doing a
mini right so we have a turkey burger
and what's our what's the price $13 for
so for $13 so you can give to a turkey
burger and vice versa so let's go ahead
and run the get our turkey burger we
want to add a we want to put in a new
item to the menu in this case it's non
pizza which isn't none a Jewish food if
I remember correctly like naan bread and
then we're going to add some C we're
gonna put in here now the value 10 run
that nope excuse me I forgot the
Cranberry Salad cranberry kale salad
I have a friend who's on the scale hyper
train so apparently ever wrote this Java
app is on the same one there we go
and so now we want to get the data so
how do we do that for hashmaps well it's
it's pretty simple in this case we want
to print it out so that we can see it so
let's start that start there it's a very
intuitive it's exactly like the
ArrayList except in this case we're
actually going to put in a value here so
what do we want to get in this case
print we want to print out non pizza so
what do we want to get we can put in 11
and it's going to scan these values and
it should print out oh we want
so what correlate so it's our 11 a non
pizza steak a little loaded on this one
check our code for an infinite loop
sit still not out no friend alone
restaurant menu don't get
oh it wants us to print out the price
whoops yeah so again print it out we're
we're checked we're actually in this
case checking with a string to get the
price so that's why we weren't gonna
devalue us calling the bat this is
actually the value and this is your your
key this is your password this is a
password and when you open the vault
this is what you get all right so
complete the unfinished code statement
on line 12 print out the size the
restaurant menu so complete the
unfinished pronounce oh so restaurant
menu size will tell you how big it is so
that's what that size does let's go
ahead and run that so we should get at 3
0 1 2 3 3 got values though so uncomment
the code so this lets get rid of our
multi-line comment here I'll comment the
code between 13 19 X complete for each
loop alright so for each loop again what
are we working with here if we look back
at the menu we're working with strings
so we want to iterate through string and
then in this case we'll call it item and
then we're gonna mess with the
restaurant menu dot key set and so this
will check the keys so that it's not
gonna check the whole thing we're saying
check the keys and see and do some stuff
with it in our for loop so let me run it
turkey burger so a space item that's our
item our item is our string so turkey
burger then restroom month menu dot get
items so at turkey burger parameter
turkey burger our string print that
print out that and then doing it for all
the other ones finally inside the main
method I think this might be the last
part so how much more someone's
quick-quick Java introduction but I do
like it
I hope they expand upon it actually
alright so the main method
and before the for each loop create
ArrayList called sports that stores
string types so create an ArrayList so
we have ArrayList and we are storing
strings in it and we're going to call it
sports we're gonna set it equal to a new
ArrayList string not strings like I put
the other ones supposed to go back to
fix that so ArrayList of strings of type
string let's run it cool wants us to add
football to sports so we are going to
say um sports dot add don't forget your
quotes football
hopefully we're remembering dollar
syntax correctly
it's going to refresh the page
that's certain one more time it might
not be dot ad oh that worked okay so
we're gonna do the same thing we're
going to sort on ad we're gonna have
boxing now and we're gonna run this and
the first for each loop in the code
editor in this ago that should be ran
before eh I'm tired it's just one out
for in sport alright so we just want to
print out what's going on in our sports
are a list so we a system dot out dot
println and we want to print out sports
so this is just the value of the string
so this is getting the string from the
ArrayList so now when you're ready it
should print out football followed by
boxing
cool uncomment that incomplete so as to
remove this multi-line comment here and
what do we want to do so we have an
array we have a hash map here of strings
and integers called major cities and
then we've put in four cities so let's
go ahead and declare what we're working
with or we're working with strings here
and we're just gonna name it city and
it's going to be our major cities dot
key set and let's look at the hash keys
so that we can do what we need to do
with it and now when we run it it's
going to print out the city and when it
was founded in so city will be New York
when we call it get city it's going to
get the value which would be 1624
infinite loop let's try this one more
time
I think code cad amis just kind of
running a little slow there we go cool
so that was it we finished the Java
course if you're I know if this is
probably your first first course I can
recommend some other good ones if you
are if you're not if you're in front
front-end design HTML CSS and JavaScript
is really cool and PHP Python and if all
else fails if you've already kind of
knocked out everything to do on code
Khadem e like I'm getting down to
basically angularjs and Ruby rails so I
don't want to do either but I will
eventually go ahead and head over and do
free code camp come and get your get
your certificate 800 hours of work I
think we can do it in about 250 and up
