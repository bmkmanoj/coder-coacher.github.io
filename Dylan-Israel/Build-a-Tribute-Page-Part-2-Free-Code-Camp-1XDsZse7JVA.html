in freakin camp we're making our tribute
page so this is what we currently have
and we now want to have it look like
this we want things to be centered we
want this to look a little different one
change the fonts up and we also want
this to be on hover change the image
that's going over it it looks like we're
changing the color over it but we really
just did a little bit of Photoshop
beforehand and so any on hover it
displays it when you're off it just goes
back to normal so let's go ahead and
edit this up and I think the first thing
to do is just to create the on hover
effect now this is pretty
straightforward at the end of the day so
by default we have this image in our SRC
the next thing that we're gonna do is
give it I'll give it the on onmouseover
equals a little juice of stuff and then
on Mouse out equals so basically we
define what the images originally we
then set a non Mouse out by changing the
SRC the source so we're just going to
say this dot SRC is equal to and then
within here we have our link which I
believe we're missing Willows well so
this isn't going to look like anything's
change because this is onmouseout so
nothing's changed so we're going to do
the same thing except in here we're
going to instead set it to our new image
that we had already previously edited so
this is SRC equals and then
and copypasta that in
cool and now oops looks like we messed
up our brackets
let's go ahead and do it like I believe
I originally did it quotation marks so
onmouseover onmouseout go ahead do the
same thing here so there we go so make
sure your quotation marks are right so
you'll see here now all that's happening
is were swapping out these images so go
we have our Apple lets changing colors
the true heroes being shown so what we
have to do next is just a little bit of
styling we're going to go ahead and
change the font we're also going to
float this left and we're going to
Center the rest of this so probably the
easiest thing to do is use bootstrap so
everything is in the body tag so what we
can do is we can actually I don't even
think we need to do the body what we can
do here is create a div and we will
little credit div and we'll just give it
the class text - Center and then we'll
have to close the data of course so
you'll notice everything centered but we
didn't want this centered so let's go
ahead and just create a div around the
paragraphs as well and we will go ahead
and give it
excess left so it could give here make
sure we'll close that Dib there and then
we'll create a div right here and we
will go ahead and say give class equals
text - left so now our paragraphs are
all going to be aligned with the left
because usually that's how you want
paragraphs to look left or right it
makes it just looks cleaner that way the
next thing we kind of want to do is just
change the color scheme of what
everything is going on here now I don't
know what your personal favorite font is
but mine I like a lobster some people
really hate it so we're just going to go
ahead and throw this up here import this
font now how do we use it so everything
is within the body so this will be just
fine so all we have to do is go font -
family and we can we want to set up a
backup font of Times New Roman so you'll
notice that it's already changed but
that's our backup font so all we have to
do here is throw in the font in
quotations because we're importing it a
lobster and now when we save it you'll
see that everything is in lobster font
now if you're not really sure how this
works basically you take the link tag
the location of the font then you set
the rail to the style sheet then type
text/css it's pretty much the same for
everything so last but not least what we
can do here is set the background -
color too
the background - color - black because
I'm not very original that's a little
hard to see so instead we'll just go to
the color like property - white as well
and you'll notice everything is white so
um I don't like how small this is so
let's go ahead and target the h1 and we
can just set the font - sighs - let's
say let's see what 100 pixels looks like
cool the bottom of that is a little bit
too close to this so what we can do here
is just add margin - bottom of 25 px and
you'll see that it's a little bit lower
now now that's it I mean there's a ton
of stuff you can do but at the end of
the day all we had to really do was
create a few things oh the last thing is
when we click this we don't really want
it to go to the same page instead what
we want is we want it to actually open
up in a new window so the way that we do
that is we just set target equal to link
and now when we click on our let's go
ahead and do this full page because
we're officially done now when we click
on our stuff it'll pop up in a new
window so that's pretty much it it's
kind of a quick and fun example and I
definitely think we did a little is kind
of cool adding this on mouse hover and
on on Mouse Center on mouse exit or
outro but that's pretty much it for this
tribute project there's just two user
stories put an image in there and a link
that opens to a new page and some
information so if you guys enjoyed this
sort of introductory front-end project
and I appreciate you for liking this
describing and I'll see you guys in the
next video thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
