next project we're going to be doing the
open weather API project in angularjs
what we're going to go over is a we're
going to obviously review data binding
and setting up our app and our
controller if you haven't done the
tribute page I'd do that one first as
that's what the main video what the
videos main purpose is we're also going
to be using ng href which is going to
allow us to dynamically set the href of
anchor tags we're going to be using our
first filter to change things to
uppercase by default we're also going to
be using ng source as well as ng and
knit where you can essentially
initialize a variable using angular
ng-show and ng-hide you use on a almost
daily basis I feel like but that is
those are the key concepts that we're
going to cover this is going to be in
two parts so go ahead and check out this
first part where we get this the
foundation of it's setup and the second
part where we connect some more the
logic as well style it a bit but as
always thanks for watching let's go
ahead and jump right into it alright
guys today we are going to be doing show
the local weather project using
angularjs now if you're not familiar
with angular I do a previous version
where it's the tribute page where it
goes over some of the more basic stuff
don't sweat down everything each one
needs go pretty slow might explain as we
go along so even if you're not
comfortable with angular like you have
ok understanding a JavaScript you should
be able to follow along just fine so
what are we building we're taking the
intermediate project show the local
weather from free code camp and we're
going to allow it to show our current
location whether by the current location
change a background image based on the
weather we're also then going to have a
fairing height or Celsius toggle button
and we're gonna use the open weather API
do that at the end of it you'll have
something like this oops
where you have button it's going to show
the icon for the fur
the general leather general description
we're going to use a couple other things
as well and then we're going to format
this and then this button is going to go
ahead and show and hide based off when
we click it on my example I throw a
little bit of promotion on here so we
can we can go ahead and showcase out
there some images in as well one is too
much out on the other is to my patreon
page so if you want to support me that's
great if not that's a great thing you're
just watching the video so let's go
ahead and jump in and get started the
first thing that we're going to need to
do to get our angular app and I think
we'll probably end up doing this in two
different videos is we're going to need
to import angular for this we just go
ahead and open up our JavaScript and
throw that in there now the reason I'm
doing it in code pin instead of like a
typical text editor is because this is
going to be an introductory sort of
learning process I just wanted to make
the barrier of entry a little bit less
we're also going to import bootstrap to
our CSS it's going to save that as well
cool
now what do we need to do here we're
going to go ahead and jump into the
JavaScript portion of this first so
let's go ahead and do this zoom in a
little bit now in angular you need to
essentially a Stan she ate the angular
application the way that we're going to
go ahead and do this because we're using
code pin we're going to go ahead and
create a variable and call this class
app we're going to set this equal to the
angular module and at this point this is
where we name the weather app so this is
the name of the application and these
other these brackets we're throwing in
here this array this would be
dependencies so maybe we wanted to
import lesser used parts of the angular
library this is where we could do it for
the time being but don't worry about
that for now but this essentially is
going to stand she ate our out at this
point we're going to go ahead and take
our class app and we're going to
instantiate a controller controllers
basically where all our code goes and in
this example we're going to just go
ahead and passing the controller name
similar that we name our app and this is
going to be whether ctrl and then we're
going to pass a function that we're
going to use down the line I'm going to
take this out now the first thing that
we're going to need to pass in to this
is something called scope scope is
basically how the how the compiler knows
to connect our code basically it's how
we connect variables in our JavaScript
to output in our HTML that's really what
you need know about scope and for our
example instead of a outputting scope
every time we're going to go ahead and
actually just scope to a variable like
so and this isn't something you have to
do this is really just something I do to
shorten the it's just a kind of a tip of
the trade so first thing that we are
going to want to do now is now that we
have all this set up this is basically
our angular app is set up we have to go
into the HTML and define where it's
going to run so we're going to go ahead
and throw a body tag here
and we're going to throw another body
tag typically if we weren't working
within code pin you would actually put
the ng app that we're about to
instantiate you'd actually typically put
this in your HTML so remember how we had
our app name which we named weather app
we're going to go ahead and pass that
into our ng app like so we're also going
to go ahead and pass in ng controller
now the application this basically it
saturates where our angular app is going
to run and the controller is where our
controller is going to run now you can
put these in the same same thing but you
can never put the controller outside of
the app so just keep that in mind and
they don't have to be in the same spot
as well so we're going to go ahead and
instantiate our ng-controller go ahead
and put weather controller and there we
go so the first thing we want to do is
make sure we have everything set up
because they're good pts syntax there it
could be anything else so let's go ahead
and output a little something called
test
so we'll put test and then we're going
to go over here and we'll put VM dot
test is equal to and I'll just
some numbers and I should output it just
fine so you'll see right here it's
everything's working our test is going
it's also a good example of how you
would set an angular value now the way I
like to start is I typically like to
just get out all the HTML content if you
remember correctly we had a section
where we put the name of the project
that we're working with so let's go
ahead and create a object and we'll go
ahead and put this up a VM dot I called
it channel info you can probably come up
with a better name and we're going to
create a variable here called channel
info within here we're going to have a
key value pair and the heading is going
to be is what I call it open weather API
project now let's go ahead and output
that right now now if you're not
familiar with how you would link the
these things you just do dot notation so
channel info dot heading and now we'll
have our information out cool so we have
our open weather API project nice we're
going to do one more where we put
another little little subheading believe
I call that stuff anyone and this was
free code camp front-end project
now I'm looking at it the assuming
project so we're going to take that
project out very nice and you'll see
we're going to slowly just start
outputting kind of the general flow of
what we want here so we have channel
info dot sub adding one there we go
it's out there don't worry about the
looks quite yet if you wanted to
continue on and put any API information
like I did we can you could do that as
well actually why don't we do that
so maybe because maybe you have a
portfolio you'll want to do the same
thing so for your subheading - this
might be where you put your portfolio
link for me I'm going to go ahead and
put my channel - link people back from
code pin who might want to follow more
of my work so let's do that just go
ahead and put in the URL like you
normally would
or better yet let's let's do it let's do
a little bit of nesting so we have
subheading two and we want to create
another object one is going to be the
name and we'll maybe a check out maybe
we'll do a check out my youtube channel
so that will be our text and then we'll
go ahead and we'll actually add a link
value and we'll just call this link and
this will be where we put our HTTP colon
slash slash www.youtube.com / coding
tutorials 360 so he's lagging a little
bit there
now one comma okay so I forgot to put
the last quote here that's where our air
was a little little syntax here but now
if we wanted to go ahead and get the
text out so check out my youtube channel
or maybe you want to put check out my my
portfolio you go to channel info dot
subheading two dot name and that will be
outputted all right a little bit later
on will actually assign this link to our
subheading two but right now we're just
worried about getting all the
information out correctly so what do we
need to do next
next we actually have to start doing the
get calls this will be pretty
straightforward if you don't have a a
API key quite yet you're going to need
to go over to open weather and get your
key what we're going to do here is two
things first we're going to get our
we're actually going to go and get our
we're going to need to instantiate HTTP
so remember how we instantiate scope
here in our controller we actually need
to go ahead and do this thing for HTTP
this is what we'll actually be using in
order to do the get calls you just need
to basically say hey have our controller
use this and I'll know what it is the
way that you do a get call there's a
couple ways the simplest way is to do
HTTP GET and then you pass in the URL in
our case to get our local our local our
local location or geolocation where this
is basically a IPF free api that will
give us your general location it's based
off your basically space off your
internet service provider like the
nearest server so it's close enough so
we're going to go ahead and pass that in
and from here we're just going to call
dot success that takes a function
and return some data that we then do
something with that data so you pass in
the URL and then on success you do
something with the data now if you
remember we need to get our latitude and
our longitude so that would be data dot
lat and then data on so let's go ahead
and create some variables here call VM
date VM dot lat
we'll set that equal to data dot lat and
we'll say V m dot long we'll set that
equal to data dot lon
now that we have our latitude and
longitude we can go ahead and just nest
another API call because we're going to
want to use the open weather URL what
we're going to need to change something
in our URL first off you're gonna need
an API key so I like to create a
variable you don't have to do this but
perhaps your API key changes this is the
easiest way to slop it out you have your
API key pass that in you can get this
from open weathers API page you just
have to apply for one it takes about
maybe three minutes if that and then
we're going to go ahead and take our
create a variable here that's going to
actually be the URL we're going to pass
in so we'll call this var open weather
URL and we'll set this equal to HTTP
colon slash slash I'm actually just
going to go ahead and copy pasta this
over here so I don't make any syntax
errors and I'll explain what we did here
so you'll see we have our VM dot lat
so this is passing in our current
latitude and then the VM got long and
this is passing in our current longitude
I believe it was long yeah so take that
as latin lon
not long and then you for the app ID
this is actually where we paste in our
API key basically our complete URL now
that we're going to pass in into an HTTP
GET call to get some data from there so
we're going to the same thing get and in
here we're just going to pass in open
weather URL and then we're going to call
it dot success
that is then going to pass a function in
that takes more data that we're actually
going to do some stuff with so now that
we're here what do we need from here
well it's been a minute since we've
looked at our art thing so let's go get
a refresher real quick what we need from
this is basically five things we need
the weather description oops
we need the icon here we need the miles
per hour we need the location and then
we need the temperature so at this point
let's go ahead and and I already know
what that is but let's go ahead and
console dot log out the open weather URL
and then we need to take a look at you
take a look at the data before we just
go ahead and output it so here is our
full URL let's look and see how the data
is structured by just throwing it into
our browser here I usually am if you
don't have a plugin this is what's going
to come out looking like if you use this
JSON format or extension it'll make your
life a lot easier so close that so you
see weather here we have main and then
we have descriptions so let's go ahead
and get the description pretty
straightforward go ahead and get rid of
that let's go ahead and get rid of that
as well and this let's create a VM dot
description
and this is going to be equal to our
data dot weather and if we remember
correctly this is actually an array so
weather zero so weather 0 dot
description the next thing we're going
to need to get is the speed so let's go
ahead and look here we have speed right
here so that's wind speed so we'll do a
VM dot speed is equal to data dot wind
speed now this one's slightly different
because it comes out in I believe it's
knots we have to actually convert this
to be miles per hour so let's go ahead
and do that right now it's pretty
straightforward I just got this formula
off of the internet but a rough estimate
is two point two three seven times our
return value and then we want it down to
basically one integer so we can call it
dot to fix this we'll bring it down to
one space so let's go ahead and console
dot log this out so we can see our new
actually while we're at it let's forget
everything I just did right here let's
go ahead and show what it is before so
we can actually see what we want to do
so we have dated it all wind speed so
we'll console dot log out the speed or
better yet now that we are already
outputting the data let's go ahead and
just do it like so so we have our VM
description so we can just output
description save that and you'll see now
we have clear sky now let's go ahead and
output the speed and you'll see right
here this is eight point zero one but
this is actually and I believe it's a
knots if I remember correctly so we
actually need to change that into miles
per hour so we're going to do two point
three seven times wind speed so there we
go this isn't supposed to be two point
three seven there we go
two point two three seven sorry guys
but you'll see this number is kind of
big are the floating numbers are like
once floating so we're going to call to
fix on it and we want to get that down
to one character so now there and there
we go seventeen point nine and while
we're at it we can go ahead and add some
strings to it so that it makes a little
bit makes a little bit more sense here
so what we're going to do is we're just
going to concatenate a URL here all
right excuse me our thing and now this
is going to be seventeen point nine
miles per hour so that's our speed we
then need the name excuse me the sedated
name yes a name right here is location
so we're going to go ahead and put that
out as well so we're going to do VM dot
name and I typically try and get these
names somewhat similar to what they are
in the database so that you know if you
need to go back what it was you're
trying to get so that's why I kind of
normally I might call it location but
we're gonna call it David name because
that's what it is there let me go ahead
and output that as well we have data dot
name excuse me I just named forget what
I just did there and then finally we're
going to need to get the temperature
which I believe is in Kelvin and we're
going to do some things with that in a
minute so we'll do a VM temp mm dot temp
and this is going to be equal to data
dot main dot temp
so here we go here so this is temp now
temp I believe is in Kelvin so we're
gonna actually have to fix all this
now I already did the math and whatnot
so let's go ahead and just create two
variables here that you can kind of see
now the reason we're just going to
convert this into two is the way that I
ended up setting the button there's
various ways you can do it so let's call
this VM dot F temp and we'll set this
equal to the formula here now we're
going to take our VM temp that we got
and we're gonna times it by 9 over 5
then we're going to go ahead and minus
459 point you know what I'm actually
just gonna copy foster this in here I'm
gonna mess this up so basically we pass
in a formula that's going to convert
this into what we need it to like so and
then we're going to change temp we can
go ahead and put make this F temp so we
can see that you'll see right there it's
about 72 degrees right now and then
we're going to do the same thing for
Celsius V m dot C temp and we're going
to set it equal to this formula here
which is going to convert our Kelvin
into Fahrenheit and then finally we're
going to output this now we have just
basically finished everything that's
going on in the get call what we're
going to be doing moving forward is
we're going to in the next video there's
going to be a two-part video so we have
all our data we're now going to format
it we're going to add some functionality
the two things the functionality we're
going to add is when you click the
button when you click the button here
this needs to swap between the two and
then we also going to add the
functionality of the backgrounds
changing based on what the description
is for the sky so that's how we how
we're going to do that we'll get started
in the next video doing that as always
