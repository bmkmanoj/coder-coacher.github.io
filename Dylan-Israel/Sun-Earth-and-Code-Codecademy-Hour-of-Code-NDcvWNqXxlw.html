in free code camp we're celebrating hour
of code not familiar its hour of code
you know can we calm slash error code
find a code Academy meetup the volunteer
or help out or you can go to code.org
and do it there as well but to celebrate
that we're gonna build the Sun the earth
and code build your own galaxy so let's
go ahead and work our way slowly through
this what we're gonna be doing here is
going to be a combination of HTML CSS
and I believe a little bit of JavaScript
so it's been a while since I've done it
I think I've wreath reset the whole
thing so what's going on here is it's
asking us to in our index.html right so
we're writing out there to add the
Earth's image tag so let's go ahead and
do that pretty simple so our idea is the
name in this case it's Earth so that's
how it knows we're targeting that if we
take that away know oh we're setting the
idea here rather if we take away the
source the source is where we're getting
our information there you go so pretty
simple this is an image ID we're gonna
saying Sun so we can target it later in
the stylesheet and then our source in
this case is a yellow circle it looks
like it's going to save and submit
and what are we doing now so what we
want to do now is a little bit of CSS we
want to edit in our stylesheet up here
this is giving us this is telling us
what we want to do so forth of the Sun
this is a that what we're applying to it
we want to do the same thing for the
Earth's here what are we going to do
let's so top let's do top and we'll set
that at 25% and then we'll do left at
25% as well and you can see right there
we're already kind of moving it around
so now it's not touching and then for a
position we'll set it at absolute so you
can see it's slowly moving in and out
cool so we've we've changed a little bit
of what's going on here although it's
not animated yet so there's a lot of
stuff going on here but we want to
change we want to basically want to
style our Sun our our Sun so they give
us a couple examples of how they did it
so let's see where we're at here so in
this case they're giving it a bunch of
border parameters and border styling so
if you know if you're not familiar with
border let's start with border - color
our border - style and well what's going
here is we're gonna let the border
around the yellow circle we want to get
make sure that it's solid you can do -
you can do dotted but we can't see it so
we need to give it a color
and in this case ring give it orange so
this isn't exactly what we wanted either
but this is a we're gonna change the
radius on it but you can see now that we
have an orange radius and we want it to
be a little bit thicker so we're gonna
be giving it a width of 8 pixels it's
looking pretty pretty thick right there
and finally border radius
oops order - radius of 50% will turn it
into a circle and there you go so now
our son has a nice little radius don't
forget your semicolon and that's how we
were able to get the filler and there's
a box shadow effect here so I see here
so now we can see a little bit of
humming so the red I believe this zero
zero is where to start in the image I
believe it so if you have it at zero
zero it's going to or originated there
let me see here you mess with it let's
so let's say 100 maybe too much let's
try 50 oh so you're gonna you're gonna
have to look at the documentation
because I don't fully remember what box
shadow is oh I guess it probably has to
do with so sort of intensity but that in
itself will give us a little bit of some
pretty cool or effect so what what else
are we trying to do here next there's
something we are going to locate our
image ID tag Earth so here it is here
we've located it surround the Earth
image with by adding its own by adding a
div a div is a container and so we're
gonna add a div with a container that
does some stuff so div with the ID equal
to earth
- orbit and then we need to close the ID
the div here and the reason oh it looks
like I may have already done this so let
me do it so we're gonna add the div ID
earth dam and then
/ - excuse me so cool
we haven't actually programmed anything
in here all we're doing is targeting
this we're saying look for whatever goes
on in our earth orbit please apply it to
our earth object right here alright so
in this case we're now going to be
adding some styling to our Earth orbit
so Oh to edit Earth so we're gonna make
earth a standard size so we're gonna set
the height of Earth right here oh we
want to change the position so let's
start there to zero so the position of
the earth for the top starts at zero
meaning that it touches the edge right
here so we're not messing with it and we
want it to go out to the left a little
bit more and then we want to set the
height to fifty pixels we want to set
the width to 50 pixels we want to give
it a margin - left - 25 px so that's
gonna change in the position of it and
then a margin - top so - 25 px cool so
let me zoom out a little bit so we can
see what's going on here so you can see
that it's it's kind of off the screen a
little bit and that's fine that's how
it's designed so far so next next up
what we want to do is work on the Earth
orbit so we're in our Earth orbit
section we want to give it a position of
absolute
we want to give it a top of 50% you want
to give it a so you can see when you
give it a top of 50% it's basically
centered with the page now we want to
give it a left of 50% as well and now
you can see that centered in the center
of everything our clothes - the it's off
a little bit because we are we have some
other effects on here such as the - 25px
in the margin - left margin I stopped I
believe that's probably gonna change
right now
so next we're gonna set the width of it
and rerender remember this is a div that
we're setting up here so the reason
that's important you just have to
understand what is actually getting
targeted because our little blue dot it
is getting targeted by quite a few
things at this point so with and then
we're gonna do margin - top is negative
250 pixels until a new margin
- left is maybe of tuna fish - pixels
will do margin oh we're not doing margin
and now we're gonna give it a little bit
of a border color so we're gonna do
border - width and what this is gonna do
is give it a circular effect so we can
kind of see it as it's traveling around
the Sun so we're gonna just kind of give
a small border:2px but I believe the
standard color for this is black so
that's why it's not showing you out so
we're gonna do border - style we're
gonna do dotted and then border
- color we're gonna make that white and
then you can see right there so we kind
of see it traveling and again to make it
circular we're gonna get into the radius
of 50% border - maybe is a 50% cool when
you say minute let's see what's going on
here and then now what we're going into
is we're gonna be adding a bunch of
animations to it and probably
traditionally you do this in in Java
Script in jQuery but now you can also do
it it's just as some of these animations
don't work in all all browsers anymore
my understanding is so they're kind of
getting weaved out so they want us to
copy the following CSS and add it
oops to our CSS file let's just go ahead
it here cool and then they want us to
add
they want us to add this and we add this
to our Earth orbit section and now you
can see when we make this fullscreen
that our earth is rotating around the
Sun this is actually incorrect because
we rotate in a a ellipse form if I
remember correctly not a circle let's
see if I think they fix that
oh no but that is the sun-earth and code
