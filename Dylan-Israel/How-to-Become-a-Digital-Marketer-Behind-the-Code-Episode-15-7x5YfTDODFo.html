you for your taking the time my pleasure
can you hear me now i just changed
microphones yeah everything everything's
good on my end good very good that's
good to meet you yeah you too so I know
we didn't talk I normally want to do
these interviews I like to not really
give too much instruction so we can kind
of get the pure and honest truth yeah
good but recently i did i read a survey
on stack overflow and it was a like
65,000 developers and sixty-five percent
of them said that one of the reason they
chose software was because they wanted
to work remotely at some point which is
a kind of how I wanted to start this
conversation off because we're going to
talk about your kind of your social
media manager course and how one might
work remotely with that and that I think
there's a lot of interesting stuff there
yeah um so which would you kind of mind
explaining just a little bit about you
so people kind know your background yeah
so um my background going way back is
actually in film production so I had an
art school degree which is pretty
worthless if you know anything about the
dog I mean a degree in general liberal
arts degree is not very valuable but art
school degree particularly worthless so
I spent you know of many a while trying
to figure out what to do because that
you know I didn't get any training in
school and about five years ago is when
I stumbled into digital marketing um I
had you know heard about I didn't know
much about the internet or web searches
or Google and I sort of um I think I
went to a seminar or something it's
almost talking about building a website
and selling things on websites and I
suddenly realized oh my god there's all
this
commerce and interaction happening on
the web and I started to teach myself
all about building websites and getting
traffic to those websites and engaging
people on websites and specifically
actually I wanted to take my film
knowledge and my film passion and
somehow monetize that that was my big my
big dream because I'd seen people
selling courses and things like that
online and so in about 2010-2011 i
created a film course called film school
secrets where I've taught young people
how to get into the film industry or
make it on films without wasting money
on film school and what happened
peripheral is I was all excited like a
lot of people when they start out and
they want to make money online they
think oh I'm going to make all this
money right away doesn't work that way
it takes anything to take a lot of time
a lot of hard work so I was making you
know an extra few hundred dollars a
month it wasn't enough to live on but
what happened is by trying to teach
myself how to do this I taught myself
all these skills that were in demand
that I had no idea that employers
actually wanted who could not initially
I wasn't you know a developer but I was
learning how to optimize sites for
Google organic traffic and you paid
traffic and social media traffic for my
own product um and then I started
searching you know for jobs because I
wasn't working at the time and I found
an entry level job at this agency and I
had no experience I had no nothing on my
resume that indicated I should be
working in this people you know I was
like I had the art degree and random
office jobs and I waited tables and done
all sorts of other kooky stuff and I got
hired because of my knowledge because I
could actually implement and actually do
the job and because i had the skills and
from that from that entry-level job five
or six years ago the career has just
expanded and expanded um i went from
working in an entry-level position and
getting paid you know sort of decent
wages but not big money and then about a
year in I didn't even know this I
I didn't know to put up a linkedin
profile I put up my LinkedIn profile
recruiters were on me like hey do you
want a new job and my salary went up and
up and up and you know the thing I
realized is that the the sense the
colleges do not teach this this skill
set is still very in demand so hope I
answered your question I know I I could
tell you all sorts of things about
myself but I figured I'd tell you that
no oh there's or there's a lot of
there's like two main things that stood
out out from that every three or four
because I tend to agree that arts degree
is pretty stupid it's almost like a
liberal arts degree in general um but
the fact that recruiters are reaching
out to you is kind of kind of goes to a
similarity between like software and
social media is there the demand is
higher than the supply at the end of
that yeah and it's from what you said
about not really have any relevant
experience but having the relevant skill
set I really like that because I think
that speaks to kind of how software
works as well as if you actually can do
the job you think you can get a job yes
absolutely and so with talking about
about the course specifically what was
it that at what point did you kind of
say you know what I am going to make a
course and there's I can add some value
to it for people like what would what
would you say we're kind of was the
moment where you're like kick-started
and like okay I got to make this course
well I I always enjoyed teaching ever
since I did that film course I realized
that I love I just love teaching I love
explaining things and I'm pretty good at
it people seem to enjoy make things
interesting and fun especially seemingly
dry topics like digital marketing and
you know most other videos I've seen
about digital marketing are very dry you
know and they're like welcome to this
video well we're going to learn about
acting us and now this is actually blue
it's really I found it really exciting
and I like to translate that excitement
what happened to did that I was working
on I basically got
I had wanted forever which was to be
making six figures at a job you know I
was like I made it now my parents are
proud of me all this stuff you know and
i'm like working a job and I'm doing 925
and everything and I'm you know the good
job and then after a few months I know
because I don't think I was ever
designed for that I started to realize I
can't do this for the rest of my life I
need the freedom you know so um 2009 he
was was at 14 I quit actually two
two-hundred-thousand-dollar jobs um one
wasn't within three months of each other
because I had left one for the for the
other which happens in the business a
lot and you don't make that much
initially this is after years of
experience but what happened is I was
sitting here and as I was trying to work
on other projects and things I kept
getting recruiters kept reaching out to
me and I'm sitting here thinking I don't
want a job but there's so many jobs and
so many people that need jobs and they
don't know about these jobs so I was
like well this is this is like this is a
weight that sucks you know I better talk
to my friends in the business we'd all
kind of laugh it this is like insane
everyone on the news is saying all the
economy stinks there's no time didja
thousands of jobs here and just because
the schools are so out of touch nobody
knows about it and I I have that kind of
like a rebel thing where i'm like oh I
want to go against the system and teach
things that people don't know so you
know I thought to myself I know if I put
together a course where I give them just
the same basics that I learned and I
teach them how to speak the language
they will be able to get into these jobs
and even if the you know as I say to my
students even if the job posting says
you need two to three years experience
that's that's BS it's like I say that's
like um I say it's like on a dating
profile when someone's like I want a man
who's six foot four and don't like a you
know like a more sensitive what's that
is looking for a unicorn is ya
like like I went I was traveling and I
I ended up in Tennessee I was in the
middle of Tennessee I'm in Nashville and
a suburb right and I just did a i went
there i looked at craigslist and i saw a
posting and i ended up getting a client
this way right but here's what was funny
as they said we want a digital media
manager um who's got five years
experience and I just said you might
find in anyone in this area that's got
one year experience much left five years
experience oh I was like I got this and
I did I got the job you know I got the
contract and I'm like um so anyway that
that um that inspired me to make the
course you know and then you know um we
started doing it back in April last year
as when I you know when i started to i
talked to matt tran about it we did an
interview and since then it's just it's
just been awesome because people have
actually come into the course follow my
instructions in there getting jobs you
know what i see all the time on
engineered truths facebook pages he'll
be posting like emails that you guys get
talking about their success stories and
like how they can now like 11 girl i
read she wanted to work remotely took
her course and now can go live with like
her boyfriend in Texas and so it seems
like there's a lot of success going on
with this yeah i mean when i started the
course i just knew that I knew it would
work I just had but it was still theory
and then you know people are actually
applying it and it's true it's still
true these the agencies and the
companies have as you said there's a
higher demand than there is supply of
people and that changes the dynamics so
much because most of these most college
graduates would come out without any
skill sets our next the reverse there's
a flood of supply there's a million
college graduates who are just
completely they can't offer any value to
these companies because they have no
practical skills no practical experience
no not even the aptitude in many cases
because they've been in school for so
long they don't know how to function in
a workplace so just by reorienting
people and teaching them you know
sometimes it's really simple but I have
to keep people listen don't you know I'm
your resume don't talk about your school
and your education and you know
when I moved
I moved to LA I remember a temp agency
person was a first person that said me
Kate your education put it at the bottom
and that was mind-blowing to me because
I was like why would to college should
not be at the top no put it at the
bottom because an employer needs needs
you to help them and they do that by
seeing what skills do you have how can i
plug you into my company and just by
making that ship and giving them these
skills you know then what's exciting to
me is you know um at the very least I
think it's funny I get a lot of students
like so many of them get introduced and
many of them get jobs but there are
people who are in the course who have
come out of college and they couldn't
even get an interview and now that I got
five introduced you know and they're not
going to get every job you know but to
even get an interview after learning a
skill select this is just remarkable any
excitement excitement I i like i like i
like that uh I I did a little bit of
social media way back in the day when I
was looking for freelance work and i
found that especially for the
entry-level contracts sometimes they go
hand in hand quite well like they all
have someone who wants you to maintain
their website and at the same time kind
of manage their social media accounts on
the website and out of the website so
like I've always been very kind of love
hate relationship with it but i like i
like the fact that they kind of overlap
as well and i think that having having
skill sets in both will make you a much
more interesting candidate down the road
well let me speak to that for a second
just to clarify something so there's a
distinction between social media paid
search paid social search organic search
it's all under the umbrella digital
marketing so social media marketing is
the way that a lot of companies are set
up some of them do sort of try to match
the two and I think you're right if you
are a programmer and you understand
basic facebook you know management
that's definitely can be a bonus but
what I what I focus on in the course is
actually not social media um that is
definitely part of it but the skill set
that is the most in demand is for
Adwords it's for paid search so
oh and the reason being is that if you
know anything about Google if people
most people don't realize the notion how
did how does Google make all their money
it's all through ads no matter how
virtuous they are how giant they are
it's all through these clicks and most
people don't even they think I never
click on these ads when you do a search
sue and every time someone clicks on an
ad someone pays for that click and those
companies hire people to manage that
advertising because it's very powerful
and very precise it's also very
different social media because social
media while very effective in its own
way you are you're trying to interrupt
somebody you know you're on Facebook and
you know and then you see an ad or maybe
you see someone else's page pop up the
person is not looking for a service but
on Google search the reason it's so so
massive is because if someone's typing
in I want to buy a new pair of sneakers
that's a buyer you know and you can
actually so I don't mean to geek out on
this too much well my point is on social
media is uh it's just one aspect of
digital marketing and it's actually from
a salary standpoint is it's actually not
the highest paying one or the one that
most of my most of my students are not
being hired for you some of them a few
of them have been hired for social media
but it's a diff they are its social
media as far as um paid paid advertising
because facebook ads are also very
important but Google and paid AdWords
advertising and SEL which is the search
engine optimization helping a person's
website rank higher is is what the
course focus on and there are some there
are some companies who will try to like
stay web development and SEO should go
hand in hand and those clients I would
say that's a red flag because you know
if you're a developer duets do as well
they're two separate skill sets and
they're both should pay a lot um so some
people like try there you know you know
get something for nothing
I think it's important to distinguish
that because I know you want to make
sure you're being paid what you're worth
and so some was like yeah you know build
our website at door s yeah like well
this is to two totally separate things
it's funny that you mentioned that
because it reminds me of my internship
where I had an internship and like the
first like three weeks they were having
me doing SEO and they recharge in big
money for it I had no idea what I was
doing and they basically just said yeah
I figured it out and so I could I could
totally see how the companies would just
take advantage of you in a web design
setting like that yeah they I mean
listen digital marketing is like the
Wild West and it still is it's insane to
me I had worked at companies I was hired
in house at a drug rehab center two
years ago and that's where the most
competitive market places you can even
imagine you know people pay thirty forty
fifty dollars per click who so that
means that if you google if you google
like drug rehab centers or if you google
DUI attorney right and you click on one
of those add someone is going to pay a
50-buck 100 bucks for that click which
is just kind of insane right so that
company that I was working for they had
an SEO company they're paying I don't
know if I should say it but it was let's
just say it's more than most people's
salaries per year per month they were
paying an obscene amount of money for
SEO and that um it's a very you know
it's so it's just it's a very wild
market because like you know if you're
going to sell a car or you know a TV
you're going to have kind of a price
range you know between this amount in
that amount but SEO prices can range and
that's also where a lot of the
opportunity is because these you know
they will outsource it say hey let's try
to do this really cheap and then they'll
realize that nowadays um it's really
Google cares about quality so what I
teach my students to do is you know how
do you deliver quality to your clients
in such a way that they actually want
you know feel good about paying you the
right amount of money now
in the course you cover but ways to kind
of maybe like how to get the position to
be a remote position or you cover like
how to land the job not only the skill
set more like us talking with you you
seem like a very practical guy and I
like that about you so I imagine you to
cover some of the more practical skills
that like yeah we're going to teach you
the knowledge set but let me teach you
about these sort of soft skills that you
need to actually land the job yeah
actually I mean it's so weird to toot my
own horn on this but I you know I am a
consumer of courses myself and I always
would look to see what's missing so
that's why I you know this course is
like 11 hours of training it's very in
depth because I didn't want to lead
people being like we're a hater when you
buy something or a course and it's like
hey this is a really give you a concept
or a dream and then they don't give you
the actual steps to realize it so a big
chunk of the course is actually how to
get the job which is something I haven't
seen in any other course on digital
marketing because they always and that's
one of the things I tell people is that
don't blow thousands of dollars learning
deep analytics learning in you know deep
deep digital marketing skills in a
theoretical online course because then
you have to go to the agency and they're
going to be like what have you actually
worked on and then they're going to put
you into a in a role where that series
just not going to be applicable because
you're going to be learning more on the
job so yah the soft skills as you put it
and it's funny I just saw an article
where I was saying education is actually
at the bottom of this of the soft skills
you know it's things like communication
but I actually in the course I show you
how to set up your resume and it's funny
because some a lot of students follow my
instructions and some completely don't
listen and then they'll show me that
resume and I'm like to use the template
that's what it's there for this is how
you should actually take your skills and
turn them into a resume and what you
should say to the employer to get the
interview and then when you're an
interview here is the type of thing you
should talk about in the inner
you now we asked about remote position
so I started out um the intention of
this course was to help you look at deja
jobs you know because I said listen I'm
not a day job guy but I work day jobs
and I know a lot of people want them so
the brunt the bulk of the course was is
um you know was said about how to get
the interview how to land a physician
companies and things like that um and I
sort of had there are remote positions
you know I got offered a position about
two years ago they're kind of blew my
mind where it was like a 75 k position
completely remote you know and I was
just like really let's get well why not
I mean you're working on your computer
why do you have to be in an office um
but those positions are not as common
but what happened is that my students
would come in and some of them started
getting remote jobs and then other
people were asking about freelancing
like you talk about with software so i
created another module to talk about
freelancing getting your own clients and
and finding remote work and the cool the
coolest thing about the skills is that
there's just just a lot you can do with
it you know I never insisted that I
learn these things accidentally and then
I realize I could get a day job I've
done contract work I've worked remotely
I come in and consulted with a company
for a couple hours and then paid for
that you know um there's just a lot you
can do once you have the skills and then
everybody has their own you know some
people want that nine to five job and
they love it some people want to pick up
freelance clients um you know but
there's just it gives you a power that
most students don't have to actually
make choices about what you're doing
instead of being stuck and just oh I
have to work at this crappy job you know
it's abuse about the way a lot of skill
set of being able to potentially work
remote right so like I I would love to
work remote but I'm also a junior level
in my career but maybe with a few years
experience where you have a proven track
record you know two three years down the
road a company may consider you know
what this guy is resumes good its
experience is good we can let them work
remote half the time or all the time but
the fact that you have a skill set that
you can work that you can potentially
make that argument it's what i like
about digital marketing and adwords
and things like that yeah absolutely
let's also I mean it's a very you don't
unless you're working at an agency or if
you've been hired by a company in a
house they're like hey we want you to be
our digital marketing person come to the
office five hours a week you know
there's no practical reason to work in
an office you know because your job is
all on the computer but the other thing
about the the job that I that I talk
about is the quality of life work-life
balance um if even if you do get a day
job in this field it's very different
than other field because the the culture
is very young um it's very it's a very
sort of i don't i hate this war but
holistic because if you go to almost any
agency website they will actually sort
of brag about their culture which is
something i don't think that you really
see in like a lot of other fields
they'll talk about a lot of a lot of
companies have like flex days or days
off or like you know ping pong tables or
just like stuff to make the job cool ok
yeah to less like a job yeah I what I
was working part-time at this company
called decks and i remember it was my
first experience of just there's a lot
of you know a lot of cool people ping
pong table catered lunch pool table it
means everything was hilarious i used to
play ping pong twice a day it made a
real difference just in how i felt
coming to the office you know um but but
yeah so it's like it works both ways and
then of course yet you want to work
remotely you know it's possible
freelancing is just you know and you
could you could freelance to you know
it's like you don't know I I and I
advertis got WordPress development jobs
by talking to people because people
always ask you know what you do and I'd
be like oh I work on what you know to
digital marketing like well I need a
website and I'd be like well I know how
to you know I know how to do a
themeforest install
of a wordpress theme and the people you
know most people are just like what they
don't understand it and then you can do
it for them and they're happy and you're
happy you know it if anybody has any
questions four sets go ahead and type
them in the in the chat now was it was
there anything that you wanted to make
sure that we covered um no I think I
probably talked enough so if you know
i'd like to see where the where the
audience is and see what their questions
are and if you have any more questions
um let me know I'm a talker so oh yeah
it's good I I am I like some people and
it's funny that you mentioned about like
people not necessarily following the
advice with the resume because sometimes
people only want to hear what they want
to hear and I feel like you can't help
those students sometimes like they're
just gonna I know what's right and I'm
gonna do it my way improve this guy
wrong well because I i do like mentoring
sessions myself and like people will
keep asking the same questions until you
give them the answer they want it's like
it's just boot camp a good program and
i'll tell their wife well what about
this and so it kinda reminded me of that
it's a you know I've been very fortunate
that my students have been you know the
program is really really really
inexpensive especially compared to other
programs and if you have a link you know
I do the free course to their I teach
people more about the jobs of the skills
and stuff and there's always a risk when
you do that that you're going to get
kind of bad when you if you don't charge
enough money for something that's that
is valuable you can risk getting people
who are going to be like bad customers
and bad students and my students have
been amazing they are passionate they
are driven they are smart you know
anytime anyone gives me I hear anyone
talk about Millennials like older laser
you're entitled or some I'm
like you yeah you know that's the
stats of generalization because have so
much passion did you know things like it
talk so much crap
for so many years just like I was and
you were like they actually tune into
something that's like good they are
totally lit up so most of them I just
have to kind of gently remind them hey
go back and you know you say watch this
video I'm not going to be explained
everything to you and most of them
follow the instructions I've only had
and hundreds of students I've only had a
couple of sort of belligerent
know-it-alls and and yeah but but but
you're right back that's definitely a
possibility that can happen when you're
trying to teach people so what one
really good question we got on here is
we're looking for work through you know
what would be some good sites and when
when typing in job titles to search by
you know what digital digital marketer
would be social media manager AdWords
what would be the sites you use it from
your experience and what would be the
titles for the search engine the kind of
charm file jobs sure and in fact if you
go to my channel I you see I do these
search and sometimes I do videos or I
actually do a live search for these
thing so first you can just type in so
LinkedIn is like number one for me on
linkedin and type in digital marketing
as the search term and do it anywhere
and you'll see a lot of results you can
also type in the term PPC which stands
to pay per click at co which stands for
search engine optimization and you can
also do social media manager you also
indeed actually it's funny because when
I started out I always kind of was like
add indeed is kind of a you know crap
site but it's mind-blowing to me i
remember i did a search um i did a video
just recently i think it was in kansas
city no kansas city missouri like not
the hub of you know it's not to look on
valley a lot of jobs there and a lot of
melissa done indeed um those are the two
big ones the other thing i encourage
people to do in is to do a google search
for digital marketing agency in your
area and you'll be surprised again I
mean a lot of the if you live in a
really rural area you're probably not
going to find too much but
even you know looking like Columbus Ohio
Kansas City Louisville these smaller
cities some of them have five six seven
agencies and those agencies sometimes a
lot of the times you'll see in some of
my videos I just I do these live videos
where I'll do a search and I sometimes I
haven't even like research what I'm
going to search for its live and i just
will be like excited because i'll be
like a careers page careers page careers
page and usually these agencies will
have a page but they'll even say if we
don't have a job opening send us your
resume because especially if you're in
one of these cities that's why i like i
have a student was in um overland park
or it's some city in Kansas Gabriel's
his name and you know he's breaking into
agency in Kansas and he had no
