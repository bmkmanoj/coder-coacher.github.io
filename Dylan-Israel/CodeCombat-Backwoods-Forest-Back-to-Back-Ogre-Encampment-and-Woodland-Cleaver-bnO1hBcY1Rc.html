back to it back-to-back patrol the
villages interest with state offensive
so let's just jump right in so the
villagers must survive and we have to
eliminate the odors seems pretty
straightforward so basically we just
want to stay in this circle here we want
to make codes of the gaya taxing returns
back to centre
if the enemy's dead so they set up some
code here for us I joined really quickly
so while this is true we create a enemy
if enemy we want to have our hero attack
the enemy and because most of these guys
died with two attacks we're gonna do it
twice else we want to move back to the
39:34 notice found out right
4034 so let's go ahead and change let's
see what this how this has gone so back
to Center and Bam Bam Bam FX Oh
it looks like it's gonna work so look at
its a minute I'm out cool let's continue
ochre encampment so we're gonna use
basic tax argument strings variables
while loops and if statements it's gotta
move forward here break open the chest
all right so wants us to attack the
chest
all right so if there's a chest but if
there if there's an enemy attack it else
so here so we'll see if okay create the
variable first well save our enemy
equals find near center me and then
we'll say if there is an enemy so if an
enemy exists we want to attack them
twice so here actually it's just attack
enemy twice attack enemy twice we could
actually leave we don't need the else in
here this is gonna run this and then do
this anyhow so I think you're just a
minute let's here
we might have to increase our armor
though all right so it's time to go back
to the let's back it up we'll go the
items start right now
so you
let's see if this should be enough all
right let's go back to the level unique
lift our shield up all right this should
make us a little bit take here and we're
gonna block some damage now so basically
40% of those attacks aren't gonna
register depending on how well RNG Jesus
loves us all right let's go ahead and
submit this let's see we don't do a
whole ton of damage if for some reason I
think you should work it's looking like
it's working pretty hard the other
ground we could have done was increase
our attack oh it looks like we just got
a new weapon and a new helmet maybe
let's do Oracle is here sue died
wristwatch and the long story
not too bad alright let's do one more
wood land cleaver so let's take a look
at the new items that we got so this is
going the wristband here is gonna give
us an ability that checks if an action
is ready to be used so that's our is
ready and this is gonna give us the
cleave ability so cool if I remember
correctly the cleave ability is a AoE
like a tap so it's a skill obviously if
you could do it as much as an attack it
made me a little overpowered so you know
you gotta wait on so is ready cleave so
we're gonna pass in the string and the
cleave is gonna be the ability that
we're passing in else we want to attack
so we want to use cleave on cooldown
essentially so if it's ready we want the
hero to cleave the enemy else we just
want the hero to attack the enemy
so Harold's gonna move to this set
position while this is true we're gonna
find a near Center me if the we don't
care if an enemy exists even if the
cleave ability is ready go ahead and
cleave it and so will cleave the enemy
right here and then we'll say else here
ah die attack enemy so I think we should
be good with this so move here leave
attack
so we cleaved again after ten seconds
one final plea not too shabby
it looks like reading a new item as well
just when I bought a shield probably a
new show yeah all right oh all that
wasted gold so up next is back with
