about my five favorite Chrome extensions
that I use when I'm developing just
things I kind of make my life a little
bit easier as a developer and then I
find helpful and I hope that they help
with your workflow and as you continue
to learn development yes Before we jump
in today's video why you're out there
saving all that time with these awesome
suggestions from these Chrome extensions
I'm going to recommend might you use
some of that time to relax with a humble
monthly bundle where you can get h1z1
along with two crates in game plus $100
of other games every month and you get
h1z1 today and you can see some of their
past crates so you can see that you're
really getting you know more than twelve
dollars worth of value easy so if you do
that you can support me interesting a
little fun way and reward yourself in
the process
alright so all the links to all of these
will be in the description below so if
you liked any of them
you know we search for them where you
just click the link and go get it that
way so the first one I want to talk
about is JSON format err this one I've
been using for quite some time and I'm a
big fan of and one of the reasons for it
is just the fact that oftentimes when
you're giving JSON in the URL it comes
unformatted this way we can actually
collapse it on each object each array
and we see a very formatted detailed
amount of JSON it's just something that
is pretty basic but it is just a nice
tool there's nothing extra you have to
do other than install the application
and wham-bam it works now it's not going
to work for everything because you know
as you move forward with with more
complicated stuff you're gonna have to
be working with web tokens and and
things that you can't necessarily pass
into a URL but this is one of my
favorite ones I've had for a while for
working on personal projects where I'm
not too worried about the authentication
now there's also I'm not even sure how
to say this but I think it's wop-wop
Eliezer and what it what it is is it
essentially allows you to see hey what
is running on this website
I'm on all I gotta do is click the
little icon it will tell you and you're
good to go so like in this example here
they have a WordPress CMS blog that PHP
jQuery Google Analytics and something
called Gravatar so if you're ever on a
website and you're just curious what
it's running how it's working what
frameworks its uses what libraries it
uses this is a cool little one to kind
of give you some insight into that and
maybe you can look more into things down
the road so the next the next one is a
little extension called clear cache and
for those of you don't know which I was
surprised a lot of people didn't know
this but say you're developing if you
want to actually clear your cache in
chrome you can just hold your left click
over the Refresh just click and hold and
it'll give you the option here to do a
normal load hard to reload or empty
cache and hardly reload but you also
have whoops what happened to the chrome
excision but you also have this clear
cache extension that will you don't see
it on here because I just installed this
one this is the one I wasn't too
familiar with but I'm pretty excited to
try out actually where you could just
have a button there that will clear the
cache for you and you can even set it to
removed additional forms of data such as
cookies and and things of that nature so
that you can really sort of clear your
caches I don't know how many times you
guys have had caching issues as a
developer but it happens to me all the
time
and so it's my first go-to when
something doesn't load that should load
right clear cache so uh the other one is
form filler this is a great one I really
like this and what it basically does is
oftentimes as you're building your
millionth crud application for those who
aren't familiar to crud what that
basically means is create read update
delete sort of your post put delete and
get calls your cred calls or as I like
to call it when I want to get fancy dark
delete update because you can only make
so many credits but uh you know so as
you're building these credits what
you'll find happening
that when you're inputting data you're
manually inputting data so instead of
that all you need to do is hit form
filler for the longest time I thought
this was form filler and I thought that
was way more gangster but hang on that's
a side note but form filler and what it
basically does is it will just populate
it with random data
this works for drop downs and input
boxes text areas and essentially takes
your lorem Epson stuff and puts it in
there for when you're just testing an
application and you don't care what's
going in it and it just saves a ton of
time
this next one some of you may disagree
about this but it's the light shot tool
they also have a desktop application and
what this basically allows you to do is
to with just sitting the print key to
take a screenshot of your window and
then actually put some text on it I use
this a lot when I'm just stuck on one
thing and someone sees a bit of code or
I want to showcase where I'm at what
does that work I want to showcase where
I'm at so that people can see how this
works and what it does and you can see
here like okay cool and then I want to
search you know say oh look this code
right here this is where I'm stuck and
you know if I wanted to add some text I
could and say what the why doesn't
it work question mark and I could save
it and then I can send it to the person
and it's just a good tool that I've used
pretty pretty much every day I feel like
for various things as I've you know
continued to better my skill set and
continue to be a developer now there's
there's other tools that are more
specific I really was only going to do
five of these but there are like the
react developer tools if you're active L
per and they have angular developer
tools I'm forgetting the name of it I
have it on my my my work computer but
there's also the Redux developer tools
and the reason you need those a lot of
times is your HTML your
template will change and you may not
have all your resources by default in a
web in your web page because of how your
code has changed and so you have these
developer tools that help that there's
also on a side note I don't advise these
in this alone anymore even though I use
it but I have this allow control
basically if you've ever had a
cross-origin request
err what this extension the Corsair does
is it will insert into your header or
something that allows cross-origin
requests about 90% of the time it's all
said of that issue just when you're
testing on things or in an environment
that you're not too worried about but
for the most part is a bad practice to
have but these are so yeah I hope you
found some of these tools helpful
another thing that people suggested in
the in the Facebook group when I asked
him about this topic was that they have
a video speed extension I don't know
which one but they have a video speed
extension so they can watch videos at a
faster pace all the way up to like 3.5
times yeah so there are other extensions
that allow you to increase your video
Street although I don't really recommend
it I know some people really like to
watch videos at 2 times the speed I
don't know I I've tried doing this in
the past is not I'm not really a fan of
it
these are just my five everyone has
their own opinion about what works best
for them and I encourage them to to try
it out and if you guys have any
extensions that you use that I left out
that you think would be great assets let
me know because I'm always trying to do
something that makes me do less work
right and makes me a better developer in
the process so thank you so much for
watching the video guys I appreciate it
don't forget to comment with your
suggestions don't forget to like the
video share the video if you found it
helpful and if you want support me you
can on patreon and I appreciate you all
I do these videos because I enjoy them
and I appreciate you guys watching them
so I'll see you next time bye
hey baby what chrome extension should we
get
don't work pants
