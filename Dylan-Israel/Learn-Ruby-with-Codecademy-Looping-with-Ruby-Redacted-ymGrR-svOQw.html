my name is major part of programming it
says recover hashes on lighter coarser a
simple program to change user input hit
save and submit so let's work our way
through this before we do that so you
know what's going on here so it's gonna
print this out it's going to ask us for
some text it's going to then say what
words so we want to redact out of it and
it's going to split it and then we're
going to do the loop where it's not each
do this and we're gonna say if this word
is not equal to redact print the word
plus a space else print redacted all
right so let's see here texts to search
through JM is cool period word Torah
duct is Dylan redacted cool and then you
can see that it broke up what we had
into an array by the looks of it and
then detective cool alright next lesson
so use the puts prompt for a user to
input two times for the first puts
declare a variable called text and
instead of equal to these input via gets
chomp alright so this is going on the
puts
please enter X and I'll say I actually
forgot how they have used okay so then
we'll say text it goes get such off okay
please answer some more tips I'll sleep
six - OH
they give us an all right this is
actually called redact I set it equal to
okay so that should work done is real
alright next we're going to be using the
dot split checks a string and returns
array if we pass it okay a delimiter so
it wants just eclair variable called
words words and set equal their cult of
Kali not split all right so there text
so tech equals text dot split and in
this case we're splitting it with a
space in this example might be it would
be a comma if we had like maybe a list
or something but what we're doing I go
you're splitting all right take out see
we don't actually take it out yet but
sure you can set in fill all right cool
so let's start simple write a dot each
loop that goes through the words it just
prints out the words as it finds all
right so
we'll say words each do X X clean up or
code a little bit
I tech I typically like to keep things
with a space in between it just so I can
kind of go back and write code in later
just prints on gel because we're only
doing the text dot split so that works
maybe I should done better example but a
living a learn all right so we're gonna
add herself
else statement or dot each if the
current word equals the word to be
redacted different active time and
exercise alright
if so we're going to say if x equals
exact
alright ok yeah that doesn't need me -
Ruby 13
it's
oh maybe and that's it we're going down
the do loop syntax are unexpected in
expecting keyword underscore in I should
sequel that print taught else print that
hmm seems pretty simple I don't see
let's see if they have if this take this
action I'll stick this other action and
whoops
we're gonna go back to its ok so we had
our we had our end in the wrong spot so
now that this is our last sort of
statement we're not sure like that
I reset this code and we're going to say
if X is equal to redact contacts yeah
it's just fine got something to it or if
it's equal that else all right so we're
going to look you a forums
and we are on five six
all right this heart wasn't very hopeful
all right
so that success
yeah I don't think that's
huh all right slip back
I live two ants whoops all right simple
enough air all right
brain fart all right so we officially
printed out our radec I wrote I redact
class right here I guess you wanna call
time so now we can check our work will
do my doing is cool like cool whip I
wanna move cool
Dylan is redacted like redacted whip all
right cool so there you go
sorry about the little brain fart
they're still my first time using Ruby
first class on Ruby so that was our
redacted kind of let's put everything
together next we're going to be using
data structures we're gonna be creating
arrays by the looks of it so it should
be some pretty cool pretty fun stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
