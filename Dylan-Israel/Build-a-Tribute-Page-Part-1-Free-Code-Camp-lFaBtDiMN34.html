we're going to be doing the build a
tribute page you can see Quincy's at the
belief quincy was one who made this
basically we're just going to have a
heading a quote an image we're going to
add a little fanciness char image a some
info and a link that will pop up a new
page so this is kind of cool
what we're going to be doing is I did it
on one of my more favorite anime
characters Light Yagami so you'll see
we're gonna remake this page right now
identical and the only thing that I
added that really wasn't in there and
you can see the way the page opens up we
have this image is I I created an image
and did like kind of a hover over effect
just because I thought it would be kind
of cool because it's a pretty basic
project so I thought man let's take an
extra second and see what we can do with
it so uh I apologize my photoshop skills
aren't the best but that's what we're
going to be doing we're going to be
creating a heading we're going to Center
everything we're gonna do a little bit
of CSS and then we're going to show how
to hover over this image so let's go
ahead and get started with a brand new
theme a new pin fuel and we'll go ahead
and title this whitey tribute this is so
I I know which one it is it's basically
just tells me you to tribute we're not
going to use in ejs we're simply going
to use CSS and for CSS we're going to go
ahead and import bootstrap and the way
that we're going to do this is we're
going to first do the HTML part and the
second part of the video we will then go
ahead and do the styling to it so first
thing that we can do is just create a
basic heading so we have light excuse me
I'm going to make that h1 name is Light
Yagami
and like so alright so there's our
heading we then want to do a small area
we'll say age five and then we'll go
ahead and put in the quote if we catch
Kira he is evil if he wins the real
world than he is justice alright so we
have our h1 our H five the next thing
that we want to do is insert an image so
you do that with image src' because of
html5 we don't have to put that slash
anymore and let me go ahead and pull
this up first so here we go so here's
our image notice it's not changing it
well we'll go ahead and get to that in
just a second and then last but not
least for God I have about five
paragraphs of text so you'll notice that
we have several P's so we're going to
throw some peas in here so I'm going to
just go paragraph by paragraph and throw
it in so depending on their example they
use some list objects I kind of just
like the paragraphs it's just more my
style
so we go ahead and throw this first one
in here like so you'll notice there's an
attack here because I use Light Yagami
as the place to open up the Light Yagami
Wikipedia page so let me go ahead and
pull that out real quick just in case
you want to learn anything from this so
I did get this straight out of their
Wikipedia page to begin with so let me
go ahead and do the other paragraphs or
the other list items depending on what
you're doing
I definitely encourage people to kind of
look at my videos as a guideline
especially with something like this
where we are you're essentially being
asked to be a little bit creative so
that's why I kind of tend to go to my
hobbies as well so we have another
paragraph here let's go ahead and
another paragraph I believe I have five
one more
Oh last but not least alright so let's
go ahead and change view so we can get a
full page view and see what's going on
here so this is it this is essentially
all the HTML that we will have to write
now with the image we are going to make
it so that when we hover over it another
image is displayed that's basically all
we're going to do there and so we'll do
that along with the CSS in the next
video see you guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
