about something I've seen quite often a
lot in a couple of my comments on my
videos and then like Facebook groups now
the topic today is coding is boring what
do I do or I don't enjoy coding what do
I do and it seems really prevalent that
people are trying to force themselves to
learn coding and they don't enjoy it or
the other situation is they went to like
a coding bootcamp because they're smart
people and they wanted to make a good
decision career-wise where it could help
them out and they understand that tech
and software is very beneficial so cool
I can learn anything in three months and
you know they learn the basics in three
months and they realized at the end of
it
I don't enjoy this what do I do
and my answer makes it you know let's
give a long-winded answer but in in the
gist the TLDR version as the kids would
say is do something else is my honest
opinion now you have to be certain that
you're just not burnt out there's a
difference between not enjoying it at
all
just being burnt out which is fine I
just did a video day before or two days
ago about being burnt out now the reason
I say do something else move onto a
different path is not because software
is beyond your capability it's not
because software is a bad choice it's a
great one for a career it's because life
is so short something like 70 or 80
percent of people hate their jobs and
you don't want to be one of those people
think back to anyone who has really not
enjoyed their job you find coding boring
if you have a boring job you're gonna
hate your job you don't enjoy it you're
going to eat your job and it's coding
it's one of those things where
especially in web development I can
really only speak from a web developer
standpoint but something where you're
constantly learning you need to enjoy
this stuff otherwise you're never you're
just going to collect a paycheck and
you're not going to be a good developer
and you're gonna have a really hard time
going to work every day because you have
to show results at the end of the day
and if you don't enjoy it you're never
going to get there
now what happens when you do enjoy your
job it's fun you have a great time and
as much as we can you know working for
somebody else right but the biggest
thing is when you don't enjoy your life
it adds stress it not good for your
health and that that's my advice if you
truly are bored by coding and you can't
come home and start a side project or
find some way to motivate yourself you
need to you need to have really evaluate
and find out what is it that you enjoy
to do and go and put your efforts that
you were going to put towards coding
into that thing and you'll be much
happier in the long run now how to know
if it's temporary or long term well
that's really up to you my advice is if
you're if you if if you used to enjoy
coding or if you just got out of the
boot camp and you're just really you and
that sort of bootcamp grind and now
you're ready to go into the real world
and you haven't coded since the boot
camp which seems to be kind of a common
theme as you go do your 90 days and then
you get out of you're like I'm done and
you don't actually continue your
learning like you need to then you know
get a job and I've had a couple people
like this you know about a year and a
half ago I was at a random Meetup and I
had six guys from coding dojo who had
graduated six months ago in LA area
weren't able to get jobs so it's not and
I don't know I know one of them I talked
in detail with one of them they just
sort of like look I just did this for a
good career choice I don't really even
enjoy it all that much and that's
probably part of the problem but what
how can you kind of tell or what steps
should you take because I don't want you
to invest all your time and potentially
not be a developer not be a programmer
because it is a great opportunity it's a
great life and there's you can do a lot
cool things on your own that maybe with
an you know quote-unquote normal job you
wouldn't be able to do such as develop
your own projects and things like that
and that's that that goes into one one
of my suggestions
by notice it's just kind of a temporary
thing did I did you just overwork
yourself and now you need a break that's
fine take it you know step one is take
like a three-day break and see where it
leads you if you're not recharged at
three days you try sit down and you
can't sit down for 30 minutes or an hour
and get passionate about learning
something new and diving into it and and
trying something else out you need to
you need to you know really consider it
and consider that maybe this isn't for
you try and the second thing is try
something else like try something new
like of your front-end developer and
you're getting burnt out on the front
end you're sick of JavaScript frameworks
jump into jump into the back end jump
into node jump into to Express jump into
the databases if you're sick of
databases like relational databases jump
in does no SQL databases document base
databases try something new software
related to give yourself sort of
something fresh something that maybe
it's less repetitive than what you've
been doing so that that's my first
suggestion your second one wherever I
was and the other the other thing is
start your own project I found that for
me personally the thing that keeps me
interested is always having a new
project because with your project you do
whatever you want with it right my big
project has always been my youtube
channel and I I love the fact that at
the end of the day it sinks or a sales
based off of what I do I don't have to I
don't have to listen somebody else and
do what they want to do I could do all
the things I want to do it today I
wanted to end my channel and I said you
know what this used to be a coding
Channel and now it is officially a
Starcraft Channel hey it may work out it
may not work out but that's my decision
and I'll be happy with there I feel like
you need to find a project that works
for you and I think coding is one of the
interesting things where you have the
skill if you have the skill set right
you can do a lot of interesting things
where you can build something to show
somebody right it's very almost artistic
right where tangible where hey look what
I built this is my baby this is what and
that's why I really enjoy about YouTube
Jones well is this is what I've built
look
look at you know we got all these
awesome subscribers with all these
interesting comments sharing things or
Facebook groups and things like that but
that that's my biggest suggestion is
other than trying something new taking a
break start your own project and start
making something for yourself and you
know try and dive into a piece by piece
by piece and really evaluate am i burnt
out or do I really just don't enjoy this
and if you don't enjoy it I can't stress
it enough really really think about so
going in a different direction and it
could be something it could be you're
like well I want to be in tech and
software look I this is a great industry
I want to be in it there's different
avenues that don't necessarily involve
coding and you're just having a slight
little background in coding or a
experience that coding will be really
valuable for you as well so maybe
instead of being a you know front-end
developer back-end developer full stack
developer or whatever it may be you
could go down the project management
route but that would be a great and
variable paying route maybe you're more
into being very artistic with your
skillset and you know UI UX is great as
well where maybe you just want to design
things you know you want to create icons
you want to create the waste webpages
flow user flowcharts wireframes things
like that maybe you're more interested
in testing now I I happen to find
testing very boring but some people kind
of like they like that stuff so maybe
you need to find where you're you're
sort of coding niches if you will and
that's why i really suggest you should
jump around and try different things as
well and you may find out that you know
what I actually really enjoy doing QA
engineers I love nothing more than
writing tests and finding bugs in your
code to send back to you developers like
that should be your thing right you'd be
like a bug hunter you know what design
there's a lot of different avenues that
you can go down and you I think you
really desert if you are if coding is
boring you don't enjoy it and you even
if you've invested time and money you
know parts
thousand dollars on a bootcamp plus for
your happiness and your financial
well-being I encourage you to explore
other options
before you do that you really need to
consider what that means and make sure
that you're just on having a moment
right
we all have moments myself included
where you think yourself is this for me
I don't know I'm bored by this I you
know uh and it could be personal things
and you go back and forth but I think
the smart and safe decision is really at
the end of the day to evaluate why
you're feeling the way that you're
feeling and decide is this something
temporary is this something long-term
because long-term you don't want to be
one of the 80 percent that are bored and
hates their job because it's not good
for your success and it's not good for
your health as well that's my two cents
about what you can do if you find coding
boring I wish I could tell you that
there is a magic thing to do that would
fix all that but you really just got to
try those things try something new see
if maybe you have like enjoy different
aspect of it take a break or you know
start your own project and if any of
those don't work you really probably
should consider a new path I don't say
that to discourage anybody I say that
because I want you to try these other
things before you give up right because
I want everyone to be a developer I
really do I think is I think it's a
great I think software and tech is
really one of the only great spaces left
in the job market and it can better a
lot of people's lives my life has been
very has increased much better because
of my happiness I'm very happy because
of it you know I interviewed Chris Sean
who his life has changed and you know
he's very passionate about being a web
developer there's a lot of good that can
come from in terms of a lifestyle a job
but not if you don't enjoy it and not if
you're bored by it
you might as well find something that
you are passionate about II do enjoy
because not everything is for everyone
my two cents hope you guys enjoyed
that's always go ahead and
join our Facebook group Kotak and
caffeine link is in description once for
me you can at patreon.com slash coding
to RL 360 I hope if you're one of those
people who are bored by coding that
instead of giving up you try a few
things let's see what may or may not
work out for you and if you truly are
this isn't for you try and find
something where you can take the int or
kit within the industry and that's all

whatever start a band and build yourself
a website with those skills do ya just
find something that works for you thanks
