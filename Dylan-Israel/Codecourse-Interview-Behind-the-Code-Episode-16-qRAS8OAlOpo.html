code course who is a very interesting
guy by the way I really enjoyed talking
to them very relaxed guy if you're not
going to course YouTube channel he's got
a I believe quarter million subscribers
right now and it's a PHP channel a lot
of people have asked me about PHP I do a
little bit at work not really a fan of
it myself but there's a lot of work in
PHP because it's used as a great
middleware but we talked about PHP we
talked about how he gets started it was
really a good sort of origin story
interview and someone who I kind of
related to he also I don't want were in
the interview so I'll leave that that
but I think this is a good one you guys
like it and enjoy nice so thank you for
taking the time man I know I know
everyone's busy doing life and YouTube
and all that yeah we and it's because I
long stop because of time zones and a
we're here now that's all that matters
I've had people cancel and never end
cancel I I had one guy canceling me four
times and I just stopped trying to set
it up yet hi
wow wow I counted when you once so not
now what's what small things um but uh
yeah so uh I actually discovered your
channel a while back when I was trying
to do like when I was back learning PHP
doing it I believe is like something
basic like a to-do list right yeah yeah
signed yes it's like the literally
debate at basic of a PHP project as you
can give but it is very well done and
I've been a subscriber ever since then
and one thing that that I don't remember
when it was but I was very inspired to
see that you're actually you're doing a
YouTube full time now or - yeah I'm
doing many focus on the website so kind
of shift in and there's been away from
YouTube and but yeah I'm essentially
creating content from time so what's
your website if people want to check it
out it's Co course com
risa link on the YouTube channel anyone
on YouTube channel reddit yeah and I
think originally is your channel is
called PHP academy' right yeah I mean I
changed the name of it it was it was PHP
academy' for about eight years I think
and then that was switched over I
probably talked about a year and a bit
ago maybe maybe a little more than that
when I rebranded I guess two cohorts I
mean it's all just still the same mr.
different name sakes
Amen brandings everything we were just
talking about ty Lopez being a scam
artist
so it's branded himself to success so
it's kind of a yeah but as before we go
down that rabbit hole oh so you've been
doing um YouTube for eight years is that
is that right - yeah yeah wow man I I I
like that girl I like that determination
haha yes I mean when I was back and I
think how long have we been doing this
for and then I realize it's been about
nine years and it's absolutely crazy so
yeah I see I'm coming up on my two-year
anniversary I guess but that's what
we're going to call it and thank you
thank you you know I uh so uh but a so
what what inspired you originally
because just the stay with to start a
channel for one and were there any
stumbling blocks along the way because
I've heard stories of people who have
been on YouTube for so long that you
know a year two years in they say you
know this isn't doing for me what I
wanted it to but it seems like you've
stuck with it yeah so I'm I really sight
I went to university to study computer
science and I actually hated it so I was
trying to think of anything I could do
to get out of you know doing any real
work so I I was actually learning PHP at
the time I was terrible as you know with
most people when you start out you
actually work for them you have no clue
what you're doing and everything seems
completely foreign all the concepts
seem to be all right and I thought you
know what I just start uploading content
to YouTube and kind of learn as I go
through obviously not expecting it to
into anything whatsoever and then I
think it if you have a YouTube channel
or if anyone has a YouTube channel so
they can relate to this as you start to
see one view 10 News you know hundred
views not your own views obviously then
you earn the new something or actually
people are you know real people are
actually watching I'm doing and to be
honest the rest is just history it kind
of just grew from there
and I just started uploading normal
content if I've done something wrong
like you know redo it again and you know
it's just kind of continual learning
process to me and then I dropped out
beauty so it was more of just a kind of
just practice you know share why why was
doing and in terms of something doctor
didn't really have any at that time
because people I wasn't taking it as
seriously as I do now and it was more
just putting out content and that was
pretty much it to be honest now ice it's
been a while since I watched a video
when you kind of announce that you're
going to be doing this full-time well is
what was it that changed for you that
made you decide that I'm going to now be
working on YouTube and the site
full-time versus I don't remember where
you were employed at the time yeah so I
have any work to to companies I was at
quite a while I just didn't I didn't
enjoy it and I was starting to enjoy
content creation more and more teaching
even more more the only problem with
that is I began home about seven o'clock
and then I denied and then I would be
working till midnight maybe 1:00 2:00 in
the morning waiting up at 6:00 and that
was just my continuous cycle and I
thought to myself I don't want to just
leave a space in YouTube because it's a
very kind of volatile platform I was
making a little bit money for my videos
which was nice that was never the goal
but it kind of you know least validated
what I was doing and then I thought you
know why not start kind of
subscription-based service where I can
just you know do try and do this
full-time took me a good few years after
having a subscription service to build
up
wonderful customers and you know then
give me great feedback and then I just
got to the point where I thought you
know what I'm just going to do it
because I'm really bad for holding out
on things so I just thought you know
what just do it so I just I kind of quit
my job and and that's it really and
built it up now and I found that the
amount of time I had free just let me
just power through it so it was the best
decision I've ever made to be honest
nice so I always encourage people to
take risks educated risks right I think
I think a lot of people unfortunately
and it's you know it could be a
combination of our parents always want
us to do what safest right look
what's very stable but yeah nowadays I
think that when you take these educated
risks you can have a huge payoff as I'm
sure your lifestyle has changed a little
bit as well you can you can work on the
things you want to and so what so what
is a typical work week for you now that
you're kind of working for yourself and
just doing what up and said you know I
spend my mornings recording so first
thing Monday morning I'll just start
recording probably up until about one
o'clock and I'm sure like if anyone has
ever made a video tutorial they realize
that our video tutorial takes about five
hours of work maybe but you know
depending on the content so spending a
lot of time recording morning and then
in the afternoon those write code or
tutorials and then the cycle we
literally just repeats I mean that kind
of have it recording you're making you
know building content and then you know
other things I have to do like
accounting you know all that boring
stuff but yeah I'm just like doing what
I love every day just putting content
out for people to enjoy and Koli that's
my life basically that's that's a great
life because I don't know how many stats
we all need to see we're like 80% of the
population hate their job and like only
5% like it and like 10% ain't like
exactly yeah
I mean I'm incredibly lucky that I never
underestimate how lucky I am and you
know it's just it's nice to be able to
to just do what I like and have a lot of
free time as well you know the weekend
before I was just working on code of
course and I had a full time job now I
can actually no set them down and
actually enjoy myself and so yeah I'm
just you know it's just why I nice no I
I don't think luck has anything to do
with it I think it's been eight years of
dedication it tickets you who are you
alright okay and I know that's it's a
which is which is but you know kind of
the thing I say a lot is look you can
read all these sort of inspirational
quotes but unless you kind of actually
apply the hard work to your dream you
know no one's going to go after there
and get it for you right I'll show ya no
now have you had anybody who's helped
you along this journey that is kind of
maybe when you needed it to kind of get
you to that to what you needed to be
Jenny well I think a lot of my
particularly when I was deciding whether
I wants to leave might have to do
content full-time I just read so many
books I still do and I find that if you
read much as possible even if you're not
entirely focusing on while you're
reading and you're just kind of
absorbing bit so interesting tear you
actually get that inspiration you know
you think oh where did I hear that
quotable weather hitter advice that
you're kind of subconsciously applying
it to your own life without realizing it
and I still read a huge amount of books
and I actually give them the way on my
Twitter account to people that anyone
want some when I'm done with them which
is really nice as well because I like to
you know share why why broken people but
yeah it was just really just reading a
lot you know watching things like TED
talks and and just practicing and
feeling confident enough to to go ahead
and do it full-time
and that's that's just how I kind of
keep myself motivated now you had
mentioned that you had dropped out of
the university I
if you know I did the same thing I'm
okay yeah so I I'm curious and I people
asked me about this all the time but I'm
curious about what you didn't like
specifically about the CS program so the
thing with me is I am awful at maths
I just I'm sure I could do it as most
people but I just find it boring and I
find it interesting as a kind of
unlocker to it but I just can't do it
so basically when I left college which
is like I know where stiffly in the
states but we have like college and then
university so I didn't do an a-level in
maths so when I went to university I had
most of my course we still are in the
first year of max modules and I also had
to do physics as well which to me just
didn't make sense so that was the first
University into I actually ended up
switching to another university which
was kind of straight into the computer
science modules I wanted to do and then
I just I mean I love things like I love
things like assembly code I really enjoy
doing that I really though level
programming but I just didn't find it
like I was getting anywhere I didn't
feel like I was learning enough so I
decided you know what instead of
spending more money on this just drop
out and get a job and and yeah drop down
and go to a junior developer yeah I we
tend to have a similar opinion about the
calculus and the physics just being a
bunch of and waste a time it's
kind of but uh that's nice to kind of
hear that somebody thinks a little bit
the same way I do what is your stance on
coding boot camps because those are more
of a for me I'm very positive about it
because I think they actually teach
practical skills which the university
lacks a lot of the times so I'm
interested what's your stance on yeah I
think I think it's a really good idea
because essentially what you're doing is
you're you're replacing formal outdated
education with going straight into what
you would do in a normal job just coding
stuff and building stuff and that's the
whole point
you know you depending on your style of
learning using the ANA should go and you
know you get stuck with something you
need to solve a specific problem
you need to build us to product so you
build it and you just learn that you go
and you know I'm not massively familiar
with coding boot camps and how they work
and I know they're kind of more popular
we're talking offline in the in the US
and other areas we don't really have
much like that in the UK as I like what
I know but yeah I think you know that's
that's a good way to go and I think
people can achieve what they want to
achieve by going on a less traditional
route and I very Pro of them because I
to me it's all comes down to I think
there's a loss of why do we go into
college and if you're if you're doing CS
the idea is to make good money and to
get a job and if you're doing like
liberal arts I don't know why but like
it's just the fence and I think
sometimes it gets a little lost that
you're learning these outdated
technologies or you're learning you know
I've been a developer for quite some
time now and I couldn't tell you the
last time I ever used physics like I
know I could choose to even even max
which people think of so tightly
integrated into you know programming I
guess it is to some extent but you only
really need to learn what you need to
know that you yeah now not going off
that you only need to learn what you
need to know what would you say for
people who are interested in in
programming what should they be learning
they're just starting out today's day
one how would you tell them to get
started I mean I think it's so difficult
to put yourself in someone's position
that that's just I now because you
overlook things like basic programming
concepts so I probably I mean like if
you feel like completely new you need to
do something like you know code Academy
where you can just learn what if
statement years or what a while loop is
and what a variable is because as
developers we just see these with
everyday parts of our lives but for most
people they have absolute idea
whatsoever so you know I always start
with something like that rather than
diving into building things that you
want to
because you're just going to get
completely lost and not be able to do
anything and then I just start thinking
about what what you want to build I'm
very much kind of practical oriented I I
think the best way to learn is to pick
something you wanna build me it's such a
problem vehicle you just want to show it
to someone like coughing you've built
and then just do that and just work hard
on making it work and don't give up so I
think a lot of people they get stuck
with you know I want to build a forum or
I want to build my own blog and then you
know they know you just sort of power
through it and just build it and get it
finished and and that sense of
achievement I think drives people to
just carry on once you have a tangible
product in your hands rather than know
this abstract knowledge nice see I like
that because you know a lot of times you
don't even know what you need to learn
until you get started you can get
started and then you're like okay I want
to build this and you're like actually
how do I get something from YouTube
analytics and stuff like that I don't
even know and then you discover oh
there's API is what's an API and you
start going down this sort of path
that's I mean that's how I got
introduced to api's I had no idea what
they were and I wanted to build my my
website I was like I want my subscribers
on my that's what I want I was like how
the do I do that it was group yeah
exactly yeah yeah it is one of them
things and it's just googling I just
live or why the search engine you use
you know like a lot of the things not
the time to sit down and I want to build
a project to teach I think actually how
long how do I approach this even now I
mean you know no one knows everything
just got a just do a little bit research
and I think is lead you down different
paths and then you've got to kind of try
stuff out all that's not quite working
properly I could do that better you know
there's so many resources online now
it's hard
you have to mount making more and make
sense of them but you know you just got
to like hunt around and like you said
with your API problem you just got to
look around and eventually we figure out
you know how you need to solve something
well right guys if you have any
questions are talking around and chat
Oh was there anything that you wanted to
talk about any any topics that you think
you could uh provide some great
information for people
mmm that's really interesting for me on
the spot and I know like I will tell you
if there are things I want to talk about
okay I mean I can make something off my
mom no no no worries like so I don't
like people to prepare for these which
is why I didn't gave you like a list of
what we're going to talk about to us I
didn't even I just jumped in now and
yeah oh yeah
ambushed I ambushed it because I want I
want the real answers we don't want this
sort of premeditated oh yeah I don't to
pretend my answer to that you know so
James Shackelford asks do you see
yourself working in any other major
languages the size PHP a or do you
already I don't actually and I have a
kind of have this philosophy at the
moment where I want to learn to do one
thing really really well and I get asked
all the time you know are you ever going
to do anything else other than PHP and
just honest with people and I just say
you know maybe in the future but
learning something takes time you know
even if you know the basics of just
generally programming so at the moment
I'm hugely focused on PHP learning as
many frameworks as I can just making
sure I'm like 100 100 cents you can
never be hundred in that I think rather
than be a generalist I'd rather be a
specialist among particular thing and I
do work with JavaScript a lot and
massively progressed with that over the
last year and yeah I must be stuck with
PHP and trying to do is you know trying
to do justice because a lot of people
don't like it yeah I I uh I I'm one of
those people by the way in all fairness
so it's okay
I got like for whatever reason theory
has eluded me
but onion but I like I like your
statement about kind of being a
specialist which is what I tell people
to like dive into the mean sack or the
myrn sack because it's all JavaScript
and it's like you know you're basically
just
it's much easier to become specialized
in one language and it is to become a
generalist or specialize in two and I
like I like your attitude about that
with PHP I think it's a great advice and
I think mr. particular PhD I mean I was
actually ready to give up at one point
because it was there were a lot of good
frameworks that were so hard to use and
I know not everyone likes using a
framework and that's a whole other topic
I think that we could go on for hours
about but and when laravel came along
and it just it just got stuff done and
although I do dive into smaller
frameworks and go a little bit kind of
at the lower level because Largo
abstracts or not and you know the goal
at the end of days to build something as
long as you know the underlying you know
functionality and how it works and you
just use a framework to get your job
done and that's and that's why I love
now how is this the coding scene in the
UK is it is it a lawyer
like like a specialist if ecclesia
treated I read the job is that kind of
the in-demand language I know you're not
looking at job at regularly but I'm sure
you get hit up by recruiters oh yeah I
do yeah and because I'm in London pretty
lucky and because there's a huge tech
scene in London both in terms of
startups look around you know
particularly around the East End and but
everywhere else in the country apart
from the major city seems to be
completely flat and a salary for
development I know cognitive developers
live the north of the UK the salaries
are terrible there is no neat art
there's not much demand because you know
there's not a lot of work for it but
definitely in London its its thriving
and not show up PhD I'm not sure you
know about know how popular PHP is in
terms up but they were all linked up to
know both meetups and something outside
so quite good nice innit
we're going to bring up the fact that
it's different depending on the regions
because I tell people all the time that
to be open to relocating so I'm
I'm in Florida and not the best offer I
got was in Florida I I live in
California my whole life I just packed
up my car and drove 2,800 miles and I
think it's especially when you're just
getting started like it may always be
really hard to get kind of your foot in
the door but once you do it's relatively
easy to get another job yeah yeah it's a
funny problem actually it's kind of like
an ongoing joke how are you going to you
know a lot of tech companies want you to
have years of experience how are you
ever going to get that experience if
you've never been employed before I
think by just going back to the kind of
remote regions where there's no physical
jobs you know with programming freelance
or work for a company remotely you know
that's that's that's the beauty of of
being in this industry you can work
wherever you want whenever you want
and still do you know really great
things so I have to encourage people to
work remotely if you can't get the
experience you need like where you live
well thank you for taking so working
people follow you to you know stay
up-to-date on your YouTube channel or
your Twitter or anything else so website
is code course comm I have a personal
switch that I just usually round about
my cat and post pictures of her so team
code course team focus on Twitter and
yeah I mean if anyone has any questions
and anyone wants to know any advice or
just chat and my personal Twitter is
Alex okay you go I believe but you will
find me just just search search I would
thank you again so much for taking the
time and I put I post photos with my cat
all the time as well I make three cats
so I'll polish since I can so I can keep
up to date on your three all three all
three uh
the more the merrier right so the head
thank you again man I appreciate the
time and hopefully we can do it again in
the future
yeah happy - thank you very much for
having me I thank you have a good one
thing you take that away okay so that
was a coke our interview with code
course a really nice guy ran I always
find that you know I watch a couple of
videos
back in the day when I was trying to
learn PHP before I dove into MongoDB and
known an Express and all that and dived
100% into the mean stack I love what
he's doing I love the grind he's got
over 1100 videos on YouTube quarter
million subscribers been had at eight
years that's a grind run that's a real
grind right there um I I love I love
kind of kind of a real guy we tend to
agree on universities being outdated and
so I'm nice to see that he's
self-employed guys thanks for watching
the video if you're interested in coding
boot camp check out dev Mountain com
where housing is included in your price
of tuition and don't forget to Like
comment subscribe and share and support
me on patreon I'll see you guys in the
next video thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
