time we should have to get your
geolocation using the API now we're just
on back on this page real quick to look
at like if we're filling or headed in
the right direction of our user stories
so I can see the weather in my current
location almost there we're just not
displaying it all yet I can see a
different icon or background image that
we're gonna tackle this last and then I
can push a button to toggle between
Fahrenheit and Celsius okay so this is
probably the next one that is on our
list so here's our API now if you if you
don't remember how to store stuff in
variables we're gonna show that right
now so we wanted to do Fahrenheit and
Celsius
see if there's a temp there is this is
in Kelvin I looked it up beforehand when
I did this so how we're gonna do this is
we're simply this is a object that has
some data in it so we're gonna go ahead
and just call the object and get the
data so in this example it would be data
domain temp and let's make sure that's
what I did right here so cool so you'll
see right here data am it comes out in
Kelvin Kelvin is no good for us they
want it in Celsius or they want it in in
Fahrenheit so we have a few other things
we're gonna do up here I created a
variable called temp we're actually
going to change this to Fahrenheit
we'll just put fair far but far actually
F temp would probably be best
F time there we go so in this example
we're gonna take F temp here and simply
convert it to Kelvin I'm not I'm awful
with physics so or take convert it to
Fahrenheit so this is basically just a
formula for converting Kelvin to
Fahrenheit now what we could also do
here is we can set a Celsius so because
we're gonna need to be able to switch
back and forth so we'll just create a
var here called C temp leave it empty
and you don't have to do it this way I
just typically like to keep it's kind of
a some bad habit from learning Java
first but I like it um that's neither
here nor there sorry so here's our
Fahrenheit temp Kelvin we should
probably change that to K temp to follow
the the path we have chosen with our
naming convention and just go ahead and
do this as well we don't have to but
it's how I prefers to do it
actually probably better do it within
this specific function so that's bad on
me yeah do that but anyhow so we have
our F temp K temp and now we need to set
our C temp this u temp is going to be
equal to let's find the formula so we
have our K temp it's K tau minus 273 and
that will take our Kelvin temperature
convert it to Celsius now we don't need
to convert between Celsius and
Fahrenheit because we've already done
this and all we have to actually do when
toggle is switch between them so in the
next video we'll create a button to
toggle with this and then we'll start
styling it styling the buttons adding a
default background and in that after
that's done we're gonna go ahead and
actually write the conditions for which
a new background would come in if it's
snowy or it's raining etc etc so I'll
see you guys in the next video
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
