basic algorithm scripting we did finish
this section but they have added a new
one called Caesar cipher excuse me so
what we're trying to do here is we are
going to move it's basically a simple
way of coding stuff and or decoding
stuff rather so if it inputs an A it
needs to return an N a B and O we're
shifting everything by thirteen so it
goes up by thirteen there's a lot of
ways that you can do this I thought this
was the easiest way it took me probably
about 20 minutes to figure this out but
it's more just the knowing how to do it
was the easy part in just executing it
as always is a little bit of the harder
part so let's go ahead and get started
about my thought process here so I'm
gonna try in future videos to talk more
about my thought process before I
actually start writing code the reason
for that is you really need to think
like a programmer before you you just
learn code because if you can think like
a programmer you can figure it out
so in this case what I thought I would
do is I would create an alphabet an
array of alphabet characters that if
it's equal to it I would then just
increase it to the 13.1 so how do would
we do that
so first thing we're gonna do is create
an alphabet and you notice here that in
this and the new ones they're actually
giving us a little bit more code than
they normally would and some people may
find this helpful I in it I'm sure it is
but I actually think this is a bad
decision on their part but that's just
me so in this case we are going to add
an alphabet not a to Z but A to Z and
then 13 more the reason for that is
there's a lot of complicated ways where
you could then reiterate through and
start back at zero but at the same time
we know we're only going to be
increasing to 13 so at at the end at the
highest point it
Z will go to let's see here once I paste
this in Z will go all the way up to M at
the highest point so huzi comes in it
will return an M the reason that we're
gonna do it like this is this just makes
it very simple we just have one array we
don't need to put a bunch of complex
code you know a bunch of regular
expressions just something that it's
very intuitive if you're a beginner in
programming or you like I just write
what I think is the easiest code from
the get-go so create your your alphabet
here next what we're gonna notice that
we don't have anything here for
punctuation for spaces that's the first
thing we're gonna need to address so
we're gonna iterate through a little bit
of space here I'm gonna zoom out just a
little bit so we're gonna iterate
through here and we're going to start
just a standard four loop of our I is
equal to zero well I is less than our
code array which right here is our
inputted string that could split up
something we would have done but they
did it for us here exactly what I would
have done so we're gonna say take the
length of that we're just gonna increase
it by one so the first thing I did was I
created an if and else statement that
first the if statement is gonna check if
if it's not contained within our string
and if you remember index it within our
alphabet rather so we're gonna have if
and then we're gonna have an else and
then we're gonna have some brackets here
so if statement is gonna be if it's not
in our alphabet an else statement is
gonna be if it is in our alphabet and
then we're gonna have to do a little bit
more code for the for loop and all that
sort of stuff so we're gonna say if our
alphabet dot index up remember if index
up returns a negative one is not
contained within the alphabet so if our
alphabet array does not contain our code
R and the current value
that we're on I doesn't like attained
then if it's negative one it's not
within there we're just gonna take our
empty Dakota door right here and then
we're gonna just add that value to it so
we're gonna say Dakota right up push our
our code our original split string here
and we're just going to add that value
so at this point let's see I believe if
we put like an exclamation point it
should just return an exclamation point
cool so it's it's kind of working it's
not what we need to do yet so that's our
if statement this might be if you're not
familiar with a mix of and you might get
a little caught up in the the for loop
and all that sort of stuff it might be a
little confusing but you should kind of
have a at this point hopefully figure
out like oh well how are some ways to do
this oh I could use regular expressions
I personally think just creating an
array an alphabet array is easiest so
the next thing you're gonna need to do
or I did rather was I created a second
for loop that's going to iterate through
our alphabet and compare it with the
current value in our in our code array
so if it's an a we want it to say oh if
it's equal to a in here then we're just
gonna add it plus 13 to our new array so
let's go ahead and just create a second
for loop or say VAR j is equal to 0 well
J is less than alphabet dot length
because we're iterating through the
alphabet then J plus plus cool and then
we're gonna say in this case we're gonna
say if our current value of our code
array and this is an I because we're
checking the code array value that it's
currently on and it only comes to this
point if it passes our if tests or fails
if tests rather and we're gonna say if
it's equal to a letter in our alphabet
at J we're then going to just go ahead
and add it to our alphabet
excuse me add it to our decoded array
except in this case we're going to add a
current value that we're on plus 13 so
the reason that we are doing it like
this with the J is you actually the
issue I was having earlier is you need
to keep track of where you are in the
code array
versus your alphabet and that's why you
have two different two different
variables in this case because you can't
increase your eye your eye is going to
be increasing every turn and the J needs
a reset every turn and the reason for
that is otherwise you're going to be one
off and then two off and then three off
at least huh this is how I did it and I
think there should be everything oops
so let's see what did I what did I break
here let's go ahead and throw in some
code real quick say J plus we're just
throwing serr and see what it returns
code R is not there we go
so let's go ahead and throw in some some
comments here and I always do it
underneath but it is better practice to
do it above so let's go ahead and do it
like this so character all right cool
and the next this explains the point in
this array this is our for loop and
we're gonna say iterate through inputted
array
a little bit and put it right through
inputted string array and then here
we're gonna check we're gonna say if if
current value is value decoded are all
right and then here we're gonna say
iterate through alphabet and the reason
we're gonna do that it's doing you could
probably do this in one comment if you
wanted we're gonna say iterate through
alphabet and saying if current value in
is equal to alphabet so meaning if this
is an A and it finds an A in here you
could actually ditch this if statement
now that I think about it and probably
work just fine because we already
checked right here by now so if that's
correct we are going to add value to the
decoded alright and value coded are plus
thirteen indexed shifts and then it's
going to change the array back to a
string so that's basically what were you
doing here you're gonna need to know
index of you're gonna need to be really
familiar with arrays and this may look
like a lot of code but it's only about
six lines of code
just a couple brackets so I hope you
guys found this helpful and I hope they
keep on adding a lot of these basic
algorithm scripting sections I find them
a lot of fun so as always guys thanks
for watching don't forget to Like and
subscribe and comment I appreciate it
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
