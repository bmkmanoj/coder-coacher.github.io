when we're trying to get our foot in
door struggles getting some relevant
resume experience usually internships
are a pretty good place to start and I
try to stay away from giving like
must-have advice and that's not what
this video is about this video is about
telling you how I got my first
internship and maybe you can get yours
if you follow the same sort of thing and
you do the same things I did hopefully
it will work out for you so one thing
that a lot of people don't know about is
that obviously you're going to be
applying to jobs and you're gonna be
applying to internships but you can
actually post your resume on Craigslist
now you'll see right here where in the
resume section we just typed in
developer and these are people with
years of experience but you also can
post you're looking for internships when
I when I got my first internship I was
applying and I saw this resume section I
started I posted my resume and it's the
same thing that we have here we have our
little novo resume download you can go
ahead and make your own for free on
their website novo resume com huge fan
if I'm not sponsoring anything but this
is what I put up as a picture but I also
gave a detailed description obviously my
LinkedIn was set up as well and I ended
up getting three or four calls over the
next week for people asking me to come
in and if I was interested at be
interviewed I ended up taking the first
one that was I offered at a web design
shop that was like an hour and 45
minutes away for like $12 an hour but
more importantly I was just excited to
get that relevant resume experience
where I had an internship then I ended
up getting hired as a freelancer with
that company but this was kind of a
something that I don't think a lot of
people know that there's even a resume
section to Craigslist so if that's
something that you would be comfortable
doing and that you're looking for
internships go ahead and post it on the
resume section and you never know you
may get a call I got a couple in the
week that I put it up and I had filled
out hundreds after that like just
LinkedIn zip recruiter Craigslist and I
saw the resume section this was ended up
being how I got my first internship and
relevant work experience and I you know
I don't know if you'll get a great like
high paying internship but at least
you'll get that resume experience and
obviously depends on the company but
make sure you use all the relevant
keywords maybe put every language in
there JavaScript front-end developer
back-end developer web design Android
whatever you're looking whatever you're
looking to get into make sure you go
ahead and put that in there so that when
those companies are looking to hire
you know summer intern or maybe just
someone for part time they have they can
find you in the resume section on
Craigslist well that's my two bits
that's how I got my first internship and
I hope if you if you haven't got one
you're looking for one you take
advantage of this it's about five
minutes of your time and if you got an
internship another way I'd love to know
go ahead and tell me in the comments
below and maybe we'll share a ten ways
of getting an internship and software
because I know it's a grind guys so
