to get better at solving algorithms now
in the past I've always talked about how
to really think like a programmer and
once you are once you can rather you'll
have a easier time being a developer a
lot of people struggle when they're on
free code camp for instance of solving
algorithms and your basic college
coursework your first couple courses
will be over algorithms and solving
things and I think it's really hard when
you're just getting started and what
helps me other than just hours of
practice and pushing it forward and
googling functions and that are built in
the JavaScript was using whiteboards so
let's see we have this tiny whiteboard
here and this is an example of how to
reverse a string right now I want to let
you be known that it's not the size of
the whiteboard that matters but how you
use it but it doesn't hurt if you happen
to have a big whiteboard now it doesn't
mean you're any less of a man if you got
a small whiteboard or a big whiteboard
was about how you use it right so but
right enough with the penis jokes but
similar but let's take this example for
here and I you by the way I use white
boards all the time yeah for a lot of
things on here if I want to just have
something in my lap you look over to my
shoulder here I have another whiteboard
on the in the corner there that I
usually write ideas down and kind I used
to solve around grimaces on that on the
one I just held up what's on here is
some basic architecture and this is you
know this is just for me so if I was
going to write this out for other people
but basically this is architecture for a
document in the MongoDB mongoose
database so I use these things all the
time and the reason I use them is I like
to be able to visualize so that's what
it comes down to is being able to
visualize these things so let's take
this very basic exam
well and this was this is from the last
time I use this which was to answer this
exact question to a subscriber who asked
how can I get better get yourself a
white board that big one I got was nine
dollars at at a Walmart you can get any
of these for somewhere between ten nine
to twenty dollars right so it's a it's
worth the investment for the you know
relative small amount of money so if we
wanted to do the reverse a string we'd
have to kind of think it out like okay
well what would we do well we'd write a
function so we have step one write a
function slash create right step two
we need a parameter what did we need a
string right we need to know how to
reverse it and what do we want it to
look like at the end what do we want to
return so in this case it's hello and we
want to return the reverse of that so we
start making correlations between here
and stare at it right look at it and try
and think like how do I do how do I you
know what's a function okay well it's
something it's code that I call so step
one write a function and you don't need
to have you know this is all pseudocode
right but really write it out and look
at it and say does this make sense like
maybe you don't even know how to do it
yet but logically
when you're working through this and
you're looking Isis does this make sense
okay
create a function pass in a string you
have a couple steps here somehow I
reverse it right and then I return the
result so you're looking for that body
part where you may be struggling okay
well let me do some research on how to
reverse this how to reverse things can I
reverse a string is there function built
into that can I take each individual
letter and start thinking about all the
all the options and break it down and
you know am I gonna need an if statement
okay I learned how to reverse the string
now maybe I want to have you know maybe
I'm more complex thing you're like okay
well I want to reverse a string and then
I want to get the first letter out of
the string how do I do that is there a
way to pull characters from a string do
a little bit of research but the idea is
at the end of the day to visualize it
and break it down into parts that are
more obtainable parts that are easier
understood and that's really how you
become
a good developers you start thinking
these things out instead of just keeping
them all in here you actually write them
down and formulate your thoughts in the
process and what you'll find happens is
when you break it down into instead of
just being this one grand global idea if
you break it down into individual pieces
that starts becoming less overwhelming
right like the traditional person
learning code they might they may freeze
when they have an empty text editor and
they need to build something but if as a
developer you should be able to say okay
this is where I get started I'm gonna
tackle this little piece right here that
little piece is gonna help me tackle
this piece these two pieces will help me
tackle this and then I have X amount of
things done you need to be able to start
breaking it down piece by piece and the
same goes for algorithms where you have
to sit down write out the steps and even
if you don't know how to even if you
don't know how those steps are gonna
work yet in terms of code you should be
able to figure it out in terms of just
logic right I need a reverse I need to
reverse a word that's pretty
straightforward so so where I need two
input I need to get a word right and
then with steps I need to transition the
letter so you could say something like
that
and then I need to return the word all
right now let's we have kind of a
general theme and you start breaking up
piece by piece and that's how I got
better with algorithms as I started
writing it out in steps that I could
understand and then I started seeing how
I could accomplish each individual step
and start just giving the checks on each
one of these cross them off the list
erase them whatever however you'd like
to do it and eventually it didn't become
so intimidating and got a lot easier and
I'm not the best at it but it is
something that you need to get good with
because a lot of job interviews or
algorithm tests unfortunately I actually
think it's an awful idea
mekka just because I'm not the best
epoch but who knows maybe I'm biased but
that's my two cents I get yourself a
whiteboard start drawing it out
visualizing it hit the steps piece by
piece draw out what you know and just
start investigating after that and it'll
get easier the more you do it and the
more you learn
