in free code camp doing the events
algorithm scripting pairwise now what
are we trying to do we have a function
that takes an array such as this one
here and then it takes in a number and
what we want to do is see if any of the
indexes when added together equal that
number and then we want to return the to
index spots added together and any other
matches and return that number so
essentially in our example here we're
looking to see if any of the numbers add
up to 20 so 7 plus 13 does 7 is the zero
index 13 is the third index so that's 3
and then 9 and 11 is 1 in 2 so that's 3
so we would return 6 so how did I solve
this one so I saw a lot of really
complicated solutions I always try to
use make things as simple as possible
the way that I did it was I created a
variable called total this will be what
we end up storing the indexes in and
what we ultimately end up returning I
then created an array VAR called varcek
or check index now why I created an
array is pretty simple if we don't have
the array to check we're gonna actually
get duplicates now there's a couple ways
that you could probably do this now I'm
thinking about it you probably could
have just divided by 2 and it would've
worked just fine I didn't even think of
that till right about now but I hey hey
that probably wouldn't work now they
think about the but we'll see how I did
it the first thing that we're gonna do
is extra create two for loops the first
for loop is is going to be to iterate
through the first index that you're
checking so we're gonna set var I is
equal to 0 while I is less than our
argument our array argument or a raper
ammeter dot length and then we want to
iterate up plus 1 so I plus plus
now because we're comparing two we're
going to compare the zero index to every
index after it to see if that adds up we
need another for loop in this one
because it's going to always start at
whatever I is plus 1 so if it says you
started at zero index you're gonna check
with one two three if you're at the one
index you're gonna check 2 3 4 5 etc so
we're gonna start with VAR j is equal to
I plus 1 and then this is going to be
same same sort of thing it's gonna be
the while J is less than our dot length
J plus plus so we have our two for loops
if you got to here troubleshooting this
should be pretty straightforward the
next thing we need is our conditional
statement basically saying look if the
current index our first index i + our
second index excuse me that we check
checking if this is actually equal to
the argument that we pass in or equal to
in our case 7 here and we want to check
our index right now our index array and
I say look index of I is equal equal to
negative 1 this means that it's not
contained within the array that's what
we're checking right now and we're gonna
do the same thing for our second value
or the index spot 1 1 / that we're
adding if that's also equal to 2
negative 1 meaning that it's not in the
array the first thing that we want to do
is go ahead and just add it so that we
don't get duplicates down the road so
we're just gonna push that index the I
and then we're gonna go ahead and check
index stop push the J and now we're
gonna go ahead and add to our total set
total is equal to or plus equals 2
plus J we're gonna add those values at
the end of it here all we need to do is
go ahead and return total and we'll have
it solved let's go I'm ready make sure
we didn't get any errors I seem to have
made a slight error somewhere so let me
check my work real quick oh I see our
air so we have a little air right here
this is accidentally put it equals we
actually need to put that and now when
we return total wham bam thank you ma'am
so our logic was good we just had a
little air here but let's go ahead and
work through the code one more time
you'll see here that we have a total to
keep track of the indexes that we're
adding our check index array is there so
that we don't have duplicates when we're
adding this we then have a for loop this
is going to take one index that we're
gonna iterate through the rest of the
array with our second for loop the J
here is set to be one step ahead of the
J this is really so that we don't add
one index over each other as well as
save some time iterating in the code but
that's just a side effect we then add
check if that value equals the number
and it's not contained in the array then
we add it to the array so they don't get
duplicate data add it to total and we
return total hope you guys found this
helpful
I hope hopefully I'll be able to do more
of these pretty soon as always thanks
