in HTML on Cilla learned read something
call challenges so see what this is all
about Scott challenge one is with 100
and 100 percent the same feel so I don't
know this but I'm gonna say no because I
believe this inherits pixels are staying
through the case all right fill in the
blanks to create an h1 heading
containing the text my first website
followed by an h2 tag containing example
fade so we're going to have a an h1
opening tag and an h1 closing tag and
same thing here with H 2 and H 2 fill in
the blanks to make a paragraph bold
using the B tag so we need our open
paragraph tag also need our opening be
tag and our /b and then our B / no
excuse me / B oh no I'm staying here
let's go ahead and do that cool
during the page creation which tag adds
the page in will show in the title bar
of users that would be the title
remember that fits the name is page it's
almost like to make the first paragraph
a comment so we want to do that it would
be caret exclamation point - - then - -
carrot to end the comment cool
films like to say that the image tree so
remember we have just used a Michigan
the location of it using the source or
SRC and then we want to give it a height
Oh Gary to give it height excuse me hey
with 500 pixels and this feels like to
create an unordered list so let's go
ahead and finish this h4 statement and
forget don't forget the ordered list
start so L and Ansel it's like closing
how alt tag excuse me this is the
closing Li tag here and then this is the
closing a well
and finally fill in the blanks align the
table to the center so first off let's
go ahead and close our head tag and then
we want to table and want set the align
equal to center and then here we have a
closing ul by the looks of it and then
we have a closing table tag okay I
forgot the flash and then here we have a
closing body tag as well and then
finally filled like to the website so
alluring comm opens font clicking the
image so we have href this is equal to
solo www dot solo learn comm and the oh
and then of course the closing back
there you put the backslash in there
excuse me
so we need the carrot and then we go
ahead and close the anchor tag as well
nice so that was the challenge is
singular
maybe I'll add more in the future but
move forward do the html5 and then we're
all done with this html5 section looks
pretty big covers a lot of stuff and
this is where I think I'll slow down a
little bit for me because I think I'll
be able to absorb a lot of things out of
crap so I skipped over in the future or
in the past rather that's always guys
