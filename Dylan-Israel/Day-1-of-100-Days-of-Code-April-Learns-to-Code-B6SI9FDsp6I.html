and running
no one's here yet to show questions just
one pauses okay cool so today is the
official and oh my god is that the hey
don't paws like that no that's not the
image it's just my it is not kind so um
today is uh I saw so let's try let's try
a safe as focused as possible so today
is day one of coding challenge now so
far you've spent about three or four
weeks practicing on your own and now we
have committed to the 60 minutes a day
or so
after work and you were studying for how
long today two and a half hours on her
own and she was able to finish the
tribute page project on okay that's fine
okay well what word going I was under
the impression it was totally done well
it's totally done according to the
standards okay but I mean as if I were
to want it
like display and that's that's
completely fine all right so what we're
gonna do a couple we're gonna do a
couple things today guys the first one
is we are going to one we're gonna check
off to make sure that she fulfilled the
user stories cool too
we are I am going to explain to her as I
refactor some of her code to show her
better principles that she will then
tomorrow do you on your own as well as
your normal stuff right and if you get
lost you have the video to watch back
right obviously you try to retain
everything you can right now and if
there's time we are I'm going to
actually take it off here and showcase
what code pin actually provides for you
and show you how to use a text editor
than what text editor you're in use okay
as well as proper file structure and
things like that right now code pens do
a lot of stuff so if you guys are
unfamiliar with the tribute page we are
in the front end certificate the first
basic project give you an idea we she is
right here build a tribute page and so
we're gonna go ahead and review this
let's go ahead and before we go me
nervous so this is her tribute page
so the requirements for this was a
tribute page with image and text okay
you got that click on a link to take me
to an external website for their
information on the topic nice so it's
going to exit that out so you
accomplished it I'm actually very
impressed this is pretty clean for
someone's first real page no no no no I
mean this is a simple thing I mean yeah
function yeah and you did you I mean you
had to the table
you added a heading you you you did this
and what so so I was a little confused
when I thought I said text and picture I
thought because I was looking at the
example there was tags inside of the
picture like okay well we can talk about
how to go about that
there's no gradient is what what do you
like about it
oh that's a background color so we're
gonna so but and by the way guys she did
this 100% without my help did very good
job and so I I like what I see I'm I'm
impressed now let's go ahead and we're
going to review the code and what we're
gonna do is in a previous video in
previous video I talked about what was
refactoring refactoring and if yet if
you're not familiar with that
essentially it is taking code and making
it better and
proving upon it and making it more
efficient now he's not gonna be too much
refactoring here but we are going to
show how April can improve her code here
as well as features that she wanted to
add how we can go about improving that
now we're gonna close this for a second
when I got start from the bottom now I
like that you added this front-end
basics title here oh you're actually
doing some stuff here so yeah I had a
link on there but code pins like oh you
don't need to do that yeah so one thing
that code pins doing it for you is this
body tag here so basically this whole
thing in here code pin assumes is the
body so this this HTML tag I'll bring up
a text editor and show you so the way
that you let the now you know I believe
you don't have to do this but all the
time but if you're do to HTML Abdallah
coming in a minute then we go to
index.html you'll see that I have this
doctype HTML you don't well you don't
need to HTML tag at all in here or the
head tag so code connection does this
for you now do you know what this title
tag does yeah yeah so I just wanted to
get used to it
nice so we're gonna comment this out and
even the the body tag because this is
part of code fit and so you're creating
duplicates and it's confusing code pin
now and in practicality and if you want
to comment things out you go down
control select it and / or you can of
course just you can do the comments you
can type it out but this is this is a ha
ha hotkeys big hockey fan right here
okay um so got a lot of divs going on
yeah one way that we can approve an you
see none of your code change right we
hit run nothing change everything's good
by the way this is just me pulling it's
not affecting your actual code okay
varices all right guys we watch a lot of
yeah okay another thing that we can do
is we can tidy our HTML to make this a
little bit more readable yeah to show
you what's within what now if you've got
it if you're not familiar with tribute
html5 I'm glad you're using that this is
something that I don't use too much and
I should but let's see so and you
shouldn't either anymore because this is
no longer supported so you always want
to be coding in html5 in the book right
so right now your code is not centered
or it is centered but we're no longer
use that so we got to take all that out
and so everything up don't work
is all about sometimes you gotta get rid
of the bad to make good make room for
the good alright and so we're gonna get
rid of all these aligns I mean this
something like this where you were to
show this to an interview they they will
maybe laugh at you or just not give you
the job because you you're typing
something that's just is no longer
occurring so instead as instructed by by
the documentation use you CSS instead
what is this project know some yeah yeah
and you're already using CSS baby every
time you do the style tag that CSS you
just not you're doing inline styling
which is the same thing the next thing
that we're gonna do is you have to this
div is going hand-in-hand so they're the
same thing
NES bootstrap does have a Tech Center
but April's not going to become
dependent on third-party libraries
especially starting out so remember how
you've wrapped everything in this div
and it looks like you want everything to
be center-right so following the same
sort of convention what we could do here
do a style
and we can do you know what I think it's
more urgent now we'll just do some sex
how to center text and html5 so you'll
see the first thing to come it's a
Center tag which isn't supported in its
shimla so we're not gonna use that
right so quick little that's text Asha
line there we go so we're gonna add the
text align Center now let's go ahead and
save this and run it and you'll see now
everything is centered it's at that
table so chances are this table is not
in the same diff
you give it a different diff see yes one
is here and so we're gonna go ahead and
have an inline style tag equal to text
Center or a text - align Center now
let's go ahead and look at the
documentation real quick for that the
only time that will matter is later on
when you are using it to store strings
if you want to use a single quote like
say you have its you have an apostrophe
you'll need to use double quotes on the
inside to use the single quote in there
yeah it doesn't matter so in our text
Asha line from the looking at it you can
align to the left you can never line to
the middle or you can align to the right
so keep that in mind as one of the CSS
attributes for aligning texts and things
like that now
now we are going to go ahead and run
that and it looks like did I not yes
however it looks like that's only going
to work on images and text how to center
table kind of my hand hurts
so to Center a table because it's not
treated as the same type of element and
the reason that it so the display:block
means it's like its own item and we can
that we can center in line elements but
block elements we have to add margin to
so what we can do is instead of doing
tech centers so let's go jump that we're
having an issue our style isn't working
and I think it's because our width and
the way we can test this is we can go
ahead and have with a wit to it so I
think was having me as our div isn't
taking up enough space I won't add 500
pixels and then here table style tag and
save that and run it now let's see if we
fixed that
so y'all seen see how it's centering now
so by deep well its centering of our 500
pixel wit div uh let's let me show you a
let's add some color the background to
add some context so we'll add a
background color it's your favorite
color baby green green alright so we're
gonna have a background color here and
so you see what's happening here is it's
entering in this div that's why it
didn't look like it was moving first
because the divs only gonna take up as
much space as is you give it so if we
want this to actually center the whole
way what we can do is we can set the
width of it to 100%
and we'll do that right now so set width
to 100% we'll run it and you'll see now
obviously we don't want this background
color anymore but it's Center and the
the the the reason for this is just a
couple things once the how much how much
space it takes up and also to the type
of element it is to display home too and
don't worry if if it's a little
confusing because I get confused even
now but just know kind of what to look
for when the time comes where you're
like oh I can't move divs why was it
again alright so that's good that looks
clean and everything's back to where it
was right so let's see what else we
centered everything we have our style
tags here we are also have our div so
this div is in this h1 and and we don't
actually need this diff so you seem to
have a habit so far if adding extra divs
but there's no there's no reason for it
like you don't know why there's why
can't I have each one because it's it's
a it's a container there's no reason to
have it as its own div that's not
free code camp would have you believe I
think you probably just misunderstood
what they were saying so so so like
these for instance go together right
this is a heading and this is the
subheading so you may have that in one
div right because that may be your
header image sure your header see that's
fine but there's also it's not good
practice
so did I mean divs are there to group
things together yeah so this in this
instance it's bad because this clearly
goes with this right so let's go ahead
and get rid of this extra div and you'll
see when we save and run it it doesn't
do anything to your code you see it's
just extra stuff that's taking up space
at this point okay
now let's continue on you have your did
for the image and that's fine but again
right here this div would go with this
right and we see we have a floating a
tag that goes nowhere okay and you know
what the alt tag does okay so so sorry
I'm sure image of two
so what the what the alt tag is is for
when an image doesn't show up that's
what gets displayed so let's go ahead
and show this you'll see her oh yeah
yeah so on the nose doesn't show up
it'll give a brief description of what
it is so if we do 2:22 or something like
that we run it you'll see smiley face
right there that's what the alt tag does
okay cool so you're adding padding now
our padding padding like this is
perfectly fine and probably the better
way of going about it
are you it's called it's called it's
called clockwise notation yeah top right
bottom left what's north east south west
no in html5 you know neat longer need
this backslash either this is what's
called a self closing tag yeah so you
also have why do you trap in here
all right because on the example they
show you they have you do that okay so
thank you
well I'll let you slide with this one
but I didn't want you use but using
bootstrap on here but you did a lot of
your own CSS so that's fine we're gonna
be using bootstrap in the portfolio
project know they have you before you
start your project in here ya know
before this section they have you have
it they prep you for it and the prep
stages go back I swear to God are you
talking about go to the map this step
right here get set for our front-end
development projects that have you set
good shopping cuz I don't have you do
you want CSS Oh looks like their streams
having issues
all right so all right so they okay so
you're using a little bootstrap
now that Center text is the same as the
text-align:center that's what that class
says now we'll leave this padding on
here but again you probably would have
just wanted this div to you would want
this diff to not be here because it
don't this goes with this image it's
grouped easily with this image I try to
do that but the padding up here
separated the words from it and I didn't
want that so I found a way to get it the
way I wanted good alright so and then
this oh maybe that's okay oh well here
is it it's a preference thing for this
one and you it would probably have
worked better if if oops
if just better practices this see it on
the spot now I said house code because
it broke
alright so throw that in there go ahead
and comment this out that's gonna save
and run
let's see what it looks like so there it
is right there okay so the image padding
so okay wait
like to what okay so you put the padding
here with the paragraph do I still need
padding here because this is what was
affecting my right yes so are you
talking about the padding was going down
or though pushes my words down yeah so
remember this is the 40 you were
probably doing 40 40 40 40 I was and
then I fixed it and then I was still
doing it so like what was I think what
if I understand it correctly it would
looked like this yeah that's because you
had padding and here still or you had
padding in the top part yeah so I need
padding in both sections then No so take
cutting off of the thing because that's
what I was saying yeah so you'll see
here that you have zero padding on the
on the bottom of this picture uh what
for them you could put the top padding
to it to this or bottom padding to this
now there's padding that goes on the
left on the right on the top for the
image and there's padding now that goes
to the left to the right and the top for
the yes some issues here all right one
second
I myself thumbs up my own video it's
working fine for me sorry guys if you're
if you're struggling over there alright
so yeah so you understand that that each
each element that you put padding to has
its own padding right okay so you're
saying that okay wait and the way so I
need this padding here and this padding
here to go it this is right here pattern
you have on there nothing yes or no
question right yes yes okay cuz you're
studying no padding to this image okay
okay on the bottom and no padding to the
text on the top okay so because cuz even
though it's in the same div Facebook
they both still need their own patty yes
yes yes okay so each one has his own
patty okay I got that we've established
this with yes or no questions next so
what you're saying is is that the P
power graph doesn't necessarily need to
be in its own div that's just not
brought because they're part of the same
group all right good
around this very nice oh this div we
already talked about the deal with and
you understand why we have to do that
right take it for the table to be Center
yeah is that just because that's like a
hack thing or is that like how you
properly Center it now well because this
table isn't in the same diff
it's it's what we had do to work with
what we have and that's fine it's fine
putting this in its own div I actually
think it's probably okay in this case
because it is kind of different than the
rest of the application it's part of
this whole thing but and it's all within
the body so it's fine to do it this way
it's not really a hack because yes so
you will very rarely use tables but
they're so damn complicated it took me
forever to understand out a table okay
so we're going to see when you we need
to design tables you don't really want
to use this portrait tag either this is
gonna be in a class or CSS so since you
did inline styling what we're gonna do
and let's go ahead and type in a table
order CSS so I'm going to show you the
way that
the way that you do styling oops
here we see this border - style but
there's also where's border just border
and there's just border so typically the
way that you would do it is you put so
you so remember how we had solid solid
aid all that we actually condensed it
into one CSS parameter so you put how
how much you want the width to be what
type of border followed by the color I
don't that's fine baby so here instead
of this border tack we're gonna get rid
of this border save and run
and you'll see your borders gone through
this table it's still formatted like a
table but now what we're gonna do it
read order and you want to do so what
goes first how thick do you wanna be how
about five what type of line do you want
- - and then what write that number for
read do you know all right well it
depends on how you put it there's many
different ways to do colors there's RGB
RGB a there's hexadecimal and there's
the word I know I have it in my notes
yes guys so you see that's now your new
border hey where's my internal borders
that's a good point
you broke my god because he has zero
patience and I'm a super slow typer oh
so no one what's going on
so why why I'm sorry that's not working
out for you um so why I'm typing for
April right now is because this is just
an example she's actually going to go
back and do this on her own
I'm not gonna sit here and do it but
she'll have it the video as a reference
if she gets stuck and I mean that's
that's basically it I'm not sure that's
not actually doing are we missing
something
oh that's interesting I'm not sure why
that's not going over let's try this
hey how did you get that dashboard
herself yeah the last 15 mini hey so we
added it back to the header I'm not sure
why it's not having this is something
that I'd have to look into it maybe you
got to put it in the table body no it
should show in the table body see what
happens I mean that will do it also very
so we'll leave it right there for now
inevitably I would stick it into each
thing and I'd be fine I'd be a good way
that the test thing you're doing what
you want to so what we actually need is
the table row
he's so so the reason that we're having
an issue here I'm not sure what's
causing it but what we would you could
go ahead and throw this into every table
body every table head every in life
styling so the table head is a part of a
table but instead what we're gonna do is
we're gonna because this is all CSS
right and the reason that we use CSS
sheets and classes and things like that
is so that we don't have to keep adding
this style tag and making her code
cluttered we already know what we want
to add okay so on here with code pandu I
need to add that link thing no okay but
I really need to learn how to make that
link thing cuz I'm scared I don't
actually know how to do that that's fine
we're gonna we're gonna get today so so
how would we if we wanted to target just
a table head we know we already know the
CSS right we said we said it yes so tags
like this they're elements what they're
called so elements you can write in for
classes we use a dot and then for IDs we
use the hash tag IDs you only use once
and classes you use them as many times
as you need so right now we could go
ahead and add a class to all of these
and call it whatever we want and then we
go and we'd have to go in here and add
it or we could go and do something like
this where we go ahead and paste it in
here
and this would work as well and we run
it and all our table data's will have
but the problem with this is this is bad
convention what because it's the same
code and we want it to do the same thing
and the way that we can do it is by just
putting in a comma and putting in a TD
instead
run it and you'll see we have the same
result that's pretty cool now it's okay
to do elements styled this way for but
usually you're gonna create a class
because you don't necessarily want all
your elements to look alike and so like
that all our table if we had say we had
a massive website of tables they would
all be this style or class depending on
what you want to do okay okay yeah okay
so and this goes the same for your
padding so alright so now I know now
that we've got to know how is my
structure for my table you you did good
so uh
the tables are pretty straightforward
once you understand what you have you
have your overall table tag which is
kind of like the table div right and
then you have the head of your table
which is usually it's like the title
your in this case gardening basics 101
that's what your table head is there for
and then you have associated with the
whole age yeah a little bit all right
then your table body that's kind of the
bulk of your table and you don't have it
in here but there's also a table footer
so let's say that these were all numbers
for instance and you wanted to have the
bottom the bottom be added that would be
something you might put in the footer
and the reason you put it in a footer
there's various reasons but you may have
it be a different color to show that
it's a footer and then the table row you
get that these are rows going down and
then each one of these is the data table
data so actually the stuff that goes in
it yeah
so our excuse me row so so you're going
rows across so you're creating this
whole thing is your table row and then
the data right so each one of these TD
soils got dirt
then you have another table row table
data table data table row table
yes and then you did the cost man which
sets up how it how much width it takes
up right takes about twice normally so
just just to read it so the calls fan
yes how much of the column it takes up
right so for my thing take so two takes
up two spaces instead of one take up six
out of the ten whatever whatever it is
it doesn't matter okay
to reiterate for somebody who's new
that's what's the difference between an
ID in the class you want to answer that
for somebody what do you what's the
difference between an ID and a class IDs
are one classes are many yes so all
right so what she means by that is you
can reuse a class an example of how you
would define a class would be dot class
you don't have to use the word in it but
also to call x1 would be with a dot and
you'd have your see us in here now an ID
you'd have with the hashtag let's call
this a x2 and you'd have your brackets
in here now how you would assign that in
your HTML in the class you would just go
ahead and throw in there something
doesn't have a class yet class in here
you could use a x1 and because it's a
class you would be alright for you using
a table row as well now if it was an ID
you can just sign it like this as an ID
one thing to keep in mind is even though
you can create classes and I'd use the
same name do not do it is bad convention
and it's only gonna confuse you and
other people
it's bad very bad convention so yeah
that's the difference for ideas class
okay cool
so now that we've kind of explained that
we've done the bulk of the refactoring
in in here what I want so what we need
to do now is do you want the what I
would suggest is taking your inline
styling and jump into CSS and doing it
however that's that'd be kind of a
stickler thing to do no I don't mind
going back and just quickly putting it
into CSS I would like that I think that
least I see it in HTML and then I'll be
able to refer your something into CSS
okay so we'll continue with that then I
don't think we're going to get to the
having you do it in a text editor
but tomorrow at the very least what you
can do is you can start you can start
you can fit you can do this on your own
along with starting the portfolio and
seeing what you can do tomorrow all
right so we have these H ones and
because you only have one h1 we can go
ahead and style these the same again if
there is multiple H ones you probably
wouldn't do this okay
actually let's go ahead and create an ID
oh I do what do you want this IDs we
call each one awful idea hashtag hashtag
heading heading one all right so ID
hashtag one no I don't but we're gonna
be adding an extra step yeah she doesn't
need two separate HTML CSS for this
project we're just trying to show good
convention yeah just because I think
it'll be good for me to see it as HTML
and then let's say I ever came up across
a website that was just strictly HTML at
least I would know how to take that and
see it in CSS just from this a little
bit here okay okay so all we have to do
with our inline styling is first we're
gonna go ahead and cut this out and
usually when you do CSS you can do it on
the same line but it's not good practice
so you're always going to have one
attribute pure per line now since we've
got rid of the style tag you go ahead
and run the ID and we'll set this equal
to I notice how you don't have to add
the hashtag to the ID don't we just go
ahead and throw heading 1 in there we'll
save then we run again and it will look
identical
hey cool now let's go ahead and create a
class here called center text actually
that's the same class as bootstrap so
we're not gonna do that now what's
actually we didn't go through detail
your name is just great baby you added
height you added with I asked you about
the alt tag which I was fairly certain
you probably weren't sure about um is
anyone ready to get this
- with tag on that damn image okay but
what about good about my links yeah look
at my links oh you're right I don't look
at your links sloppy - your links are
good
you understand what the blank does yep
opens in a new page because code pins
got some security issues that's exactly
what I tell you know what it does by
default if you don't set that so you all
know it you did you surpassed my
expectations and we're gonna continue
with the head tag again I saw the head
tag not to be confused with the heading
ID the head tag stores links to CSS
files to JavaScript files also stores
kind of stuff that runs in the
background as we use the head tag for a
source of title tag it'll store an icon
for your page as well asking a question
oh because I'd like headings one through
six or like the heading that we have
there what are you talking about I'm
curious now well there's only one head
tag where it's in here it's right here
but remember how we set up our document
the HTML then we have the head tags oh
that's what you're referring to I think
so that's it you don't even know you
should have asked yours
Oh beat you
all right so all right so we set up our
heading ID there's only one image so
we'll go ahead and call this hashtag
carat Mike this is a Fischer to carry it
so we'll give this ID equal to okay
and in here we're gonna go ahead and cut
out our Patti and we'll delete our style
tag and we can also delete our height
and width as well delete it or cut it
delete it and we'll see what it looks
like before we move forward yeah cuz it
looks extremely different well Pam so we
can go ahead and set the height to what
what was it I don't know six I think it
was six hundred pixels actually no
that's the width so this is height to
300 pixels and we'll save and run it and
you'll see that we don't actually need
to set the width because it's going to
we set one of the other animal down
scale it proportionally now we can and
I'll show you what happens if we do if
we know the portions that's cool if not
though and we set a width equal to 300
pixels which is not a square right so
we're gonna get is this elongated skinny
dick looking Carey all right so
and there's nothing wrong with so here
alright so you see how we set the
carriage that's actually really cool now
we only have one paragraph and I guess
for the sick do we only have one pair oh
yeah all right good for you for using
different I tried I really did I tried
to diversify my portfolio in this one
Asia because you know what guys
takes me forever to learn
something so in here we're gonna go
ahead and paste that in there and you'll
see as we're doing this love that our
code is actually getting much simpler
and oh yeah I know it's a separation of
concerns right we want to have as little
as possible in our HTML section as a CSS
section and you may be thinking like oh
well what's the difference
well one organization but two because
this will become very this this is how
your later on is a big part of code okay
so okay so we'd set up the paragraph and
we have about ten minutes left and what
I want to do for our last ten minutes of
all these live streams is like I want us
to answer questions and mainly you
answer questions I'll fill in and people
can ask questions so if you guys have
any questions about what we went over
today and and if you want to ask April
any questions about what she's learning
so this was day 1 guys of what April my
tutoring session with April are viewing
our code and up you got you got eight
more minutes of to and the reason that
we're not just focus I think basically
the gist of what we have left here she
gets the point and there's no reason for
us to go line by line and swap the code
out for this project based off of what
she has on here there's no there's
nothing else to cover this is this would
be similar to how I might do a tutoring
session with one of you if you wanted me
to critique your tribute page so that
when you're looking for an internship or
something like that or want to get
better I would showcase how you can look
more like a professional developer and
and do things in a correct manner off
topic
like salsa is clearly how you come up
with a name like that so it'll be
impressive so tomorrow what what I'm
hoping you'll have done is I'm hoping
that you will go you will go and you
will do what we do is functions
functions
oh so Juan Alexander functions are
specific to programming languages such
as JavaScript what you haven't got to
yet you've actually been using them in
jQuery not realize it oh thanks Jake
where's my JavaScript I'm excited about
JavaScript because I love jQuery
let me tell ya so yeah so but in terms
of classes we have explained why we're
using classes you might have told me
that I can use w3 schools to learn code
is it recommended so that's one of the
resources you've been using right yeah
it is and have you found it helpful I
have so w3 schools is really great I use
it I was actually using it today I'm ace
subscription
I am a salaried web developer and I use
it quite often
I set w3 schools is mainly used as a
documentation resource you can see that
as we were going through here I was
pulling up several examples to showcase
how things are used you'll see a text
align in this case the image alt tag
it's really great because you can see
things in action and when you're
learning when you're just getting
started I think it's really important to
do fully understand especially with HTML
and CSS to just see it right 5px solid
read for a border isn't maybe super
intuitive but it is good if you you
instantly know what it does when you see
it thanks for subscribe
so w3schools is great when you're
looking for documentation it's
definitely going to be one of the tools
that you use when you're when you're
getting started as well as it I use it
on occasion when I want to look at some
quick and easy documentation as well
organized and well-written
there's also Stack Overflow is a common
use for that Sacco flows a little beyond
her capabilities right now not that she
can't go onto Stack Overflow and try and
find what she's looking for
but it's a little bit more advanced have
you used any other things to help you
learn that one I actually like that one
most of all cuz like I really do
understand it and sometimes I'll use
YouTube so I was looking at free code
cam videos earlier on some of the ones
that they suggested in their group chats
and I was like skipping through it so
you've been doing you've been joining
their group chats on free code ok yeah
not that I really like those because you
know I'm feeling kind of weird today
very introverted
so I felt weird I didn't want to talk to
anyone right now okay also I used code
pen there's a link on the section where
the project is for the example and I
looked at that examples codes just
that's good so one way that you can
learn is by looking at other people's
example code it's awesome it's not a
particular way that I've learned very
well and really I haven't heard of that
I'll have to check it out yeah I I'm a
big believer of online coating tutorials
yeah and YouTube as a way of learning I
think I think it's about time to wrap it
up I my wrist was hurting me a little
bit guys from the surgery so I apologize
this is going to be on the 60 minute
livestream versus 490 also I wanted to
give you that as something that my tutor
told me was weird was that I take actual
physical notes I don't know if you guys
can see him but I was having a really
hard time remembering my code and like
my references and stuff like that so as
they go through the the math class or
thing he's on code Academy or free code
camp I kind of write down everything
that they're having us practice or some
of the vocabulary for things and just
the act of writing it helps me to add
stimulant to creating those new neurons
that creates the ability to learn
something new in your brain for me it's
just another way for me to learn I like
doing seeing listening all that stuff so
who cares if anyone tells you it's weird
just do what you need to do in
order to get the job done
yeah I I do find it weird and strange
I've never heard of anyone actually
writing like a lot of notes down they
might write little little snippets but I
I am a believer that you need if it
works for you then that's all that
matters right so it wouldn't work for me
I learned by building projects but if it
works for her that's great
I got my braces about three or four
weeks ago in terms of what type are they
I don't know
they're just braces you do thanks one I
feel better about my journaling yeah as
always I go back and I use it that's how
actually it actually really helped me to
build my project with the HTML and I was
able to look back and actually
understand my notes which is another
plus because you know it's a skill just
writing notes in themselves all right
guys we're gonna sign off now I want to
say thank you for watching as April
continues to learn we'll be back at it
tomorrow for day two with hopefully the
beginnings of a portfolio as well as an
improved tribute page and as always
don't forget to support me on patreon
comment or else 360 and join our
Facebook group code Tech and caffeine
the link is in the description I
appreciate you guys watching and I hope
you found today's lesson helpful I'll
see you next time goodbye code long and
prosper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
