now what does that all mean algorithm is
really nothing more than set of steps to
complete something in an efficient
manner we use algorithms all the time in
our daily lives without even knowing it
for example let's make a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich there's actually an
algorithm to that for most of us and we
don't even know that we're doing it step
one get the materials out step two pull
out a plate of the bread on that step
three
spread some peanut butter on it step
four spread some jelly on it step five
smash it together step six cut it cut it
in half step seven eat it step eight
maybe make another one but this is an
algorithm it's a step of things to
accomplish attacks task in a quick and
efficient manner now what does that mean
we're talking about algorithms and
programming well a lot of programming in
terms of your functions is storing an
algorithm in there or your code that
then will do some steps and then return
our result in an efficient manner free
code camp has a lot of great algorithm
examples let's take their very first one
from the basic algorithm scripting
section reverse a string step one you
might break the string up into a char
array from there you might think called
a reverse array method which would then
reverse the components in that array
step three you may join it back together
without any spaces and then return it
that's an example the basic reverse a
string algorithm it's a series of steps
that in a quick and efficient manner
returns you the correct result for
watching the video don't forget to check
out my collaboration with ericsurf6
going over how to get started coding and
if you're looking for some coding help
go to code mentor using the annotation
or card and if you're looking for
internships or part-time jobs or full
time jobs as a student or recent grad
check out way up
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
