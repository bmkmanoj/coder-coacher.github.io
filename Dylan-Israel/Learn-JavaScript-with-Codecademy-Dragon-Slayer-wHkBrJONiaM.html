videos came out that so I'm going to
redo them real quick starting with
Dragon Slayer right here so let's go
ahead and get started I'm going to be
refreshing the code as we go along it's
been a little bit since I've worked on
some JavaScript so let's go ahead and
reset this coat this is what we're
actually going to be creating if I
remember correctly it's a little bit of
like a text based RPG dragon slayer type
of thing so let's go ahead and get
started son undo what we're doing here I
so declare set the following variables
you want to set a bar slain equal the
truth and you hit want to set that to
equal to mass dot floor math dot random
others too alright so what this does is
it sets you hit to a random number
that's having zero which JavaScript will
read is false or one was JavaScript full
three does too okay and then we'll
create the variable damage this round
and we want to set this equal to math
dot floor thought random and times five
and if I'd s 5 plus 1 so this should be
between 1 and 6 no one in five this is
this and then we want to set our total
damage equal to zero go ahead save it
cool so it basically just
rated for variables we haven't done
anything with them in I don't remember
what the map thought floor is met by
random is usually matha floor I can look
up it's probably just something to say
start at zero and go from there all
right so it's going to reset this code
all right now wants us to create a while
loop see are you it's been a while since
I've worked on JavaScript so say wow
slain is equal equal to I think there's
three equals in JavaScript paramotor
proper we want it to do some stuff all
right so we also need it's saying here
to override slain and set it equal to
false so we don't have an infinite loop
they're real okay so we don't need to
use the triple equals in a while loop
all right so while true reset the stuff
falls inside your wallet create an
if-else statement that checks the value
of you hit if it's one if its one true
it should send bola thing else falls
away message other whistling should be
set to false okay so we're going to say
if you hit is really go to one you want
to do some stuff else wanted to do some
other stuff well in both cases slain is
equally
I'm gonna say let's now console dot log
I remember correctly you would hit the
dragon cool so in our first case
scenario we hit them we could even put
something sames we missed just going to
reset that go ahead and set total damage
to total damage plus damage this round
do they want us to do that and our yeah
they want us to do it in our when we hit
all right let me guess a total damage is
equal to total damage plus damage this
round and let's see you here then inside
your first if statement create a second
if statement inside you first decide
career seconds that checks to see it
till damage it's greater than or equal
to 4 alright so the total damage is
greater than or equal to 4
you should log in the console players
lose the dragon okay we'll say
console.log i will say will say
that's uh you absolutely dragging and I
should be but I believe the city told
damaged very light before you sleep the
dragon all right if told damage isn't
greater than or equal to four you hit
should be assigned to a new random this
is as easy sudden you hit to the same
expression suits in the first one so
it's going to go look here oh so whilst
lying is equal to true if you hit is
equal to one console dot log you hit the
drawing in oh I did my if statements
that order that makes I thought
something was throwing me off here okay
so let's go ahead and we have to switch
around a little bit of stuff here this
is our first if statement so it has to
hit before we can slay but also we need
to pull this out or it's gonna end with
Luke because it doesn't end there
because it could still be alive so we
need to move me slain equal to false
inside the total damage else we want to
for a second if statement else we're
going to reset nooob you hit equal to
the same thing that we had before you'll
see and it's going to continue running
the loop and we can put a console log
saying something along the lines gk cool
oh I think we might have run an infinite
loop somehow thats lame is equal equal
to false may not be what we needed I so
we're going to go ahead and refresh our
page here the good old infinite loops
this is a new tab see it so here we go
alright this is where we're at oh so
this is my old code it's pretty much the
same a little more exciting text here
but let's go to reset this actually we
worked out all the way through here so
let's just work our way through the code
so if you hit is equal to true and mind
you we can take out those doubles equals
I mean if they hit you want to say you
hit the dragon we want to adjust the
total and add it and then we want to
check if the total damage is greater
than equal before if it is you killed
the dragon we close the loop and else
you say you hit again and it says
whether we missed or not and then we
want to say right here if we got hit
slain is equal to false so it's gotta
save a cement you hit the dragon hit the
dragon kill the dragon BAM and then I'm
reminder that to use plus equals but not
what I like to do so little bit of a fun
thing if you wanted to take a little bit
of time and write like an old-school RPG
I kind of like this one so I didn't
really mind doing it over so much i know
we worked through pretty quickly but uh
as always let's check out the next
section see what's going on here and I
already did this section but uh it looks
like we're going to be doing a little
bit more with control flow and i'll see
you guys in the next video and I'm sorry
if I'm recert but like I said I couldn't
find the video for this but any
questions comments concerns leave am I
love when you guys leave me comments
please do i'll see you next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
