the chat up here here we go there we go
alright how is everybody doing today we
so we have hit for those of you new to
the channel basically every thousand
subscribers what I like to do is I like
to try and give back in whatever way I
can one of those ways is to try and
provide some answers some questions some
some mentoring whatever it is I know
that was something that I always
struggle with and they have access to
you with someone to kind of answer my
questions give me advice why don't I say
and I have all the answers but you know
there are some things I might be able to
answer at least give you my opinion
about something so that's that's kind of
what these every thousand subscriber
livestreams are about I really enjoyed
them
I like live-streaming unfortunately it
doesn't do too much for the channel but
that's not what these are about
so 4,000 of you who are new thank you
welcome we are officially part of the
fam and uh we're rolling in at 27 deep
right now a 7,000 deep and to 26,000 of
you that were here before thank you and
thank you for the new thousand so
hopefully we'll continue to grow and
just be a good thing for us so it is a
Tuesday evening I just got off work
MMN mmm this is new well welcome welcome
you are one one-thousandth of the reason
that we are here don't feel any less
special though because here at you your
you're amazing okay so
starting a new job that I'm in week 3
loving it so the first week and a half I
didn't really do too much is a culture
fit sort of thing trying to meet people
learn out the procedures the processes
and now that I'm up and going baby I'm
building stuff it's fun man I'm diving
deep into angular 4 and really loving
life almost done with the current not
done but I'm at a working point in my
current project and it's nice to have a
separation of duties and and things like
that and although I do plan on learning
the the back end that that my current
work uses but first I have to get caught
up on my my own stuff right my current
stuff so it's been fun I've been
enjoying it and in loving life and
having a good time back be paid that's
always cool paydays dope Michael how's
it going man welcome welcome
so um payday is always nice my hair is
growing back that's also cool it doesn't
really look like too much right now but
I promise you it's probably twice the
length it was when I got a cut so
growing the hair back life is good let
me get your nación real quick
well yeah so uh this is our thousand new
subscriber livestream I want to do this
literally every thousand subscribers
which is about I'm getting about fifteen
hundred subs a month on average so we do
one of these about every three weeks or
so maybe a little less than that every
two and a half weeks it's really nice it
uh it's well those things where it's a
cool way I look forward to to these and
I hang I I would live stream every day
if I thought I would help the channel
out or if you guys would show up so
that's that's another thing on a
personal note I've gotten really
interested in investing in the last I
don't three months or so so I'm
investing a lot of different things and
and really having fun with it and it's
been a it's been a wild ride to say the
least because a lot of times you're
learning and you're growing and you're
figuring things out piece by piece you
really don't know what you're doing
until you do something about losing
money that makes you figure out how to
get it back very quickly yeah so
investing has been kind of something
I've been I might do some videos just
not necessarily on investment techniques
but maybe something just sort of showing
what I'm investing the tools I'm using
where I go and what why I'm investing
maybe explain some of the concepts that
maybe you're not used to peer to peer
lending for instance that's kind of a
new concept for a lot of people so I
might do something like that but we'll
see I have so many videos with coding
that just doesn't seem like there ever
would be time for investment videos oh
yeah
so I've been loving it man it's nice to
be able to write in es6 that was
something i was lacking at my last work
cuz everything had to be ie9 compatible
and there wasn't a compiler set up with
babel or anything like that and i was
frustrating so what's going on with you
guys man one of the things I wanted to
offer you always interested is I'm happy
to I get a lot of people say hey can you
look at my portfolio can look at my
project give me some tips
say hey this is where I can improve upon
do you have if you guys have any that
you want to share I'd be HAP now it's a
good time to do it something I want try
and do for these thousand life thousand
subscriber live streams as well
oh my go ahead I'm sit down though I've
been working all day I got to do some
finish up this course that I've been
working on staying there for course it's
the chat bunker you guys just don't have
anything safe to me today that's all
right
we can just I can just serenade you all
with the voice the voice the voice guy
this guy didn't even do a good job of
cutting my hair short uh I'm not really
a very vain person but I do prefer to
have more hair than less hair you
couldn't find code fights on their
website code fights comm what do you
mean you couldn't find code fights just
code fights calm I started I was working
on there like two days ago
it's a it's fun though man I enjoy it
the algorithms I did this here you make
right now without going too much into
detail I am building a dynamic menu
system in it that's basically it
but as well as detail as I can get a lot
of work places don't want to talk about
what you're working on by basically
building a dynamic menu system so if you
want to create a menu and you want to be
able to import or export that menu that
that's what I'm building so for the it
depends on what section you're on world
see if you go to arcade and then intro
that's one section where I videos up and
then if you go to arcade and then core
it'll get you there yeah you have to you
have to go in order also so like I am on
number 49 of intro and I'm on number 44
of the core I did cheat on like two or
three of them where I just like I
don't want to go here and and learn this
actual algorithm like some of them have
mathematical algorithms that are applied
to them and it's just obnoxious to learn
it's not fun at all the section I'm in
right now in the core I really don't
like which is labyrinth of nested loops
it's basically seems to be very math
heavy it's just like math you have to
you have to recognize mathematical now
operations but mathematical patterns and
it's I don't like it I don't like it at
all it's not like a hey let's solve an
algorithm so like hey did you memorize
this math section it's like no no I did
it I would like to finish the intro
section though I'm almost leveled up to
to a soldier a level 1 soldier
v 1,450 points away
it doesn't do anything for you I mean
it's not like the women pop out the
woodwork for the cohhd cohhd fights
ranking but but uh it is something it is
something for me I feel like hell yeah I
did it was I worked hard and I got
something done any other places on
freako camp for basic algorithms
practice code fights is good code fights
comm they're kind of hard but but it's a
good place to start I don't think I'm
using github in the correct option
optimal way could you recommend a low
costing tutorial free even there's a
bunch on there's a bunch on on YouTube
just look for like dark bonus or
traversée media and see the little have
some good ones yeah it's yeah so I've
I've cheated on two or three that's too
crazy you have a project alright submit
it put a link you're gonna have to break
the link up and I'll be happy to review
it I think free code camp is getting
close to releasing the beta because last
I checked that's I checked I think free
code camps tickets were down quite a bit
there's support tickets like that a
while back I looked and they had like
600 support issues or issues and now
they're down to 135 is still a lot but
it is a manageable amount of code of
tickets like they've in comparison so
I'm hoping that pretty soon they're
gonna be they're gonna be releasing the
beta I don't know
while things have changed there down the
crater what it's changed I've changed
I'm moving on baby I'll see what let's
see what our boy Neil is working with
here what I need to do this URL to get
to work if you're just building a
content management system why don't you
just use WordPress I mean that's what
it's there for
I have heard of Salesforce then I can
tell you that as a as a developer is one
of those things that is doing very well
there's a lot of jobs in and there's a
lot of money in it it's one it's
actually one of the it's so slow you say
that but dev Mountain is now offering a
Salesforce Salesforce bootcamp because
how popular it's it's become
so I can't get that URL to work so
you're gonna tell me what to make didn't
get it to work but uh so I mean I don't
know too much about it
yeah compendium I would say I would say
that be happy to learn it because it is
a it is a very high paying a developer
on it seems like a lot of companies are
adopting it alright um what projects
would you recommend to build for a web
dev portfolio well one I'd recommend a
portfolio that's probably the first
thing that you could do to I'd recommend
a a unique project something that's
special to you and that you could figure
out to work on long term - my youtube
channel this is like my long term unique
side project it's something I really
enjoy so and uh I make a little bit of
money at if you can find a way to turn
something that you enjoy and make a
little bit money at at the same time
that would be probably your most
successful side project but definitely
find a long-term project that's unique
don't build something like a weather app
or a random quote machine or something
that there's a tutorial for online you
need to build a web app that's unique to
you and doesn't even have
necessarily be a webapp there's things
that as I mentioned my youtube channel
you have a Facebook group you could have
a meme coding meme Instagram there's
unique projects to show your passion for
it which is just as important as you
actually having projects show your
skills
I don't know too much about Salesforce
to be honest with you world disease I
can't really answer that in detail I
can't just tell you that I've seen a lot
for it I've seen a lot of jobs for it
and I've seen it being one of the higher
ranking and in-demand
positions in terms of a sales force
developer you'd have to go do some
research I really don't know too much
about it when you got hired did you feel
like the people in the company took you
under the their wing I'm kind of nervous
I'll be surrounded by co-workers who
think they're better than me and don't
want to help Exedra
I've never felt like that but I can tell
you that I've interplay interviewed at
places that felt like that and it's
pretty apparent at least to me where and
this was any this was even after my my
first web dev job where I had one year
experience in the field scissors but
I've dinner sauce interviewing maybe the
one interview that comes to mind was
maybe six weeks ago and I could get a
feel that they were kind of looking down
on me a little bit because I wasn't
where they're wanted to be now it could
also be that they were looking for a
mid-level angularjs developer and I was
I had one year experience they wanted
three to four now they did end up making
me offer and they were gonna help train
me and stuff like that but so but with
that being said I've never worked at a
place where people weren't helpful but
also I most
one of those people who study outside of
work so it doesn't take too long right
so I I'm happy to ask as many questions
as people will answer at work I don't
care if they have their headphones in or
not
but I will I will definitely interrupt
if I if I have a question especially
when I'm getting going that's when you
have the mostly way right but I also I'm
happy to help others so if you're one of
those people that that just go and only
ask and never help you're gonna have
issues down the road but now I would say
that's problem you should be able to
tell through the interview process if
you're in get along with people and or
not at least that's been my experience I
can tell you have my last role no one
there like angularjs no one there was an
angularjs developer they were all
picking up so we're all kind of picking
up at the same time so which we are much
willing to be sharing things how do you
go about finding good recruiters well to
be honest it's the recruiters that find
you most of the time so the good ones
are the the low pressure the people who
understand you got to do what's best for
yourself there's good ones there's bad
ones right so like I had a recruit
I would say I would say eight out of ten
or four out of five recruiters are
probably pretty decent and then the two
out of the five or two or ten or one out
of five are kind of a pain in the ass I
don't know it's mainly up to you man I
don't necessarily you won't really need
to go searching for recruiters they will
find you the job I got my current job I
got the recruiter so you know and
one thing is the one thing to watch out
for recruiters because there can be
people who are good recruiters for and
most of mind you most recruiters they
make a commission right they get paid X
amount of dollars when you get signed
over whether it's as an employee or
contract hire or whatever it is so the
thing you have to watch out for is don't
listen to what the recruiter is saying
listen to what you're picking up when
you go into the job interview right so
one example I'll give is that same
company where I thought people were kind
of looking down on me a little bit and
and and one of the things I didn't like
was that the cubicles and that the
developers looked really miserable and
the recruiter obviously would because
they didn't want to miss out on their
Commission was just trying to tell me no
it's not like that I know you're worried
about it but it's really not like that
it's a great work environment well
meanwhile I've interviewed at other
places that we're great work
environments so I guess what I'm trying
to say is don't listen to the words that
let the recruiters get you introductions
that's really all they're good for the
recruiters are really just there to get
your resume in front of companies that
are looking to hire that's all they're
there for don't listen to a single word
that comes out of their mouth about
about the workplace what it's like pick
up on it on your own when you go there
in person and you interview with the
people and you talk with the developers
that's really what you need to make sure
about hey man I'm in college my major is
computer science I want to take a web
development class but I'm kind of person
I like to study on my own so what could
I do to get skills on it I use I I watch
I used to watch your videos and get some
knowledge out of it but I want to learn
fast what can I do in terms of in terms
of of web development free code camp and
beta free code camp or great sources
YouTube tutorials but honestly once you
get done with that just start building
something I would say don't worry about
learning fast worry about learning every
day that would be inconsistent ly
so dedicate one hour a day one hour a
day to to learning everyday and going
going from there that that's really it
and building things actually build your
own projects don't just watch tutorials
where you're building copying someone's
guide coding every day is probably the
best advice anybody can give you to
learn to cut what happened to your hair
what happened to your hair alright I
told the barber a little off the top and
this is what I ended up with and this is
twice the length it was a week ago or
two weeks ago it's great I'm growing it
back out don't sweat it man I'm I'm I'm
growing a little facial here to go with
it though know if you guys can really
tell that ya recruiters some recruiters
are really just there to get your resume
in front of people so it's just one of
those things where where they're always
going to try and get you to sign you
have to understand they're they're
basically a used car salesman and their
job is to sell you your the car and
their job is to sell you to a company
whether you like it or not and so you
have to be willing to say no I'm good
as well it's just that I mean that's all
it is they're there as I believe Chris
Hawkes
I think he gave credit to a friend of
his said their flesh peddlers that's
really what they do they trade flesh and
they get paid for and a lot of them
aren't even technical people right that
that's that's the the funny part so you
have to you have to correlate your
resume so that that a recruiter
understands what's on it because they're
just looking for keywords right so I put
stuff like version control I've given
this example
I give this example a million times
where where I put version control in my
skill section not get or github and all
the recruiters asked me about Gator
github on there and so now I have to put
that on there because recruiters don't
understand what version control this and
which is github it's it's good it's
tortoise SVN all that sir so it's a lot
of aren't technical people they use ie
for God's sakes lot of times well
recruiters take you seriously if you
only have WordPress projects I mean they
will if your WordPress developer if
you're trying to become a full-stack
JavaScript developer now they won't
she's trying to be a wordpress developer
Yana how's your new job verse old one
better environment company size benefits
the environments great I didn't really
have a bad environment I kind of a
neutral / I'd like I'm for this way I
would be happy to go back and work at my
old job if the company if the situation
ever arise for whatever reason it wasn't
that it was bad or those bad people the
environment that I'm in it's just better
in terms of a company size they're about
twenty to twenty or thirty times the
size of the company the benefits are
better I when I was negotiating my
contract I couldn't get them to move up
in pay but because of because I had
multiple offers I felt alright well
maybe I can because I wanted to work
with them out of my current company and
I had other offers but I even for it I
had a fifteen thousand dollar hot a
higher offer but I again it goes back to
wanting to work with Sir with the right
people and being able to learn and grow
I got them too I asked for basically
better benefits and more PTO time so
that was one of the things that I was I
did so I my benefits are very good my my
pay is good I have a bonus structure all
that stuff so I'm very happy with with
in terms of just the pure financial
aspects and environment it's amazing
with the beautiful office building it's
uh it's one of those things that it I'm
very I'm very happy with my choice and
it's been going very well I love the
people I work with you know I'm on a
larger team before is basically a group
of four developers on my team now
there's the development departments
about twenty-five plus not counting all
of DevOps and project managers and and
stuff like that did you ever feel like
you were close to getting let go from
your job for making tons of mistakes as
a new hire no not once I mean I was
worried about it just because I worried
but realistically looking back on I've
never had any any concern the only time
where and but that also but also guys I
the last year of me being a developer -
maybe about the two months I was going
home and studying everyday in various
aspects if you watch my video about what
I learned in last year I picked up
angularjs I started learning react so I
learning or a duck started learning
angular for I picked up node I picked up
MongoDB node Express I picked up PHP
cakephp all those sorts of things and
the reason for that is I was continuing
to learn after work and at work and that
oh also jasmine karma a couple other
things also that that don't come the
money ran out but I was always learning
and so
are you as an employee starting a new
role are you ever aware the other
developers are no even now even now as I
learn angular for I am NOT I am NOT at
where I need to be but I come home I
come home every day and I study angular
for and I'm much better at where I was
where I was a week ago compared to where
I am now dramatic difference dramatic
difference so it's just one of those
things where you have to you have to
understand that if you're working
towards being caught up it's gonna take
you anywhere from a month to three
months depending on on the technology so
what you're doing to catch up but it's
your job as a new hire to get ass caught
up as possible no one's telling you work
yourself into the ground but when you
start a new job you need to be working
outside of work an hour a day on the
weekends four hours a day to get caught
up man
that's just the truth of the matter and
if you don't want to maybe you will
worry I I didn't I didn't really ever
worried the one time I worried was when
I was I got down here and I had only
been in the state for like two weeks or
three weeks and my boss told me and I'm
still just kidding should handle trying
to figure out life I want not buying
clothes and just doing all that
craziness and I was studying just not as
much as I should have but my boss at the
time told me hey make sure you study
this weekend that was when I kicked in
overdrive that was the only time I ever
really worried now I don't think that
they were gonna fire me by any means
three weeks in a lot of times most
places understand right especially when
you're in the junior end and and they it
takes you a while to adjust so like the
first two weeks I was at the courage I
was basically attached to the hip of my
team member and I still I still ask all
the team members for various inputs and
they're really helpful so it's just one
of those things do I Drive a Mobil Oil
diffuser I do not do I have one with me
at work I could my work acts
really has one like a product a product
of theirs is an essential oil diffusers
and essential oils so I'm thinking about
picking one up and thrown at the desk
we'll see um I don't understand why
companies let HR departments and
recruiter write their job adverts when a
lot of times they don't even know what
they're talking about because who else
is gonna do it
I'm not I know what I'm talking about
for the most part yeah in compare in
comparatively speaking I know what I'm
talking about I should say are they
gonna pay me a developer salary to go
find developers if they would add me the
easiest job ever
I know developers I know a lot of
developers do I do any pair programming
at my last work not too much at this
work it's much much more encouraged I'm
currently building the front end of an
application only my main team member is
building the back end and I imagine
we'll do some pairing when either one of
us are kind of at a point where it's
time to merge I am a windows guy I've
always used Windows since I was a child
I started I think I got my first
computer when I was like nine ish or 10
ish I bought it as with my own money and
yeah we're an agile shop although it's
on a teen level so it kind depends
some people are you doing Kanban I'm not
too familiar with convo I just know the
name because people say it so but yeah
so pair programming is interesting it's
something that I use for the first two
weeks and I plan to continue to do it
just right now kind of making leeway so
well
no one's asked to pair with me and this
week anyhow I'm just trying to I'm
trying to get my project done and like I
know how what I want to do for the most
part with it and so and my other team
members are busy and I could sit in with
some other developers and do it I'll
probably do that when I want to learn
the backend a lot more is sit in on the
back end so I wish I could show you guys
some screenshots of it's going to come
together nicely why was your PC's disk
full last time it's the old hard drive I
put in a new SSD and so it works much
better do i do wire framing or
prototyping i have it in the past at my
previous role in the i guess my last two
roles I've done a wire framing I don't
do too much now I'm not the architect of
the project there's an architect you
will sometimes wireframe it out so so I
see so far any I've only known one
project but it's the way that the other
developers are talk it doesn't sound
like it's a common occurrence the wire
framing but yeah I've done quite a bit
of wireframe with balsamic specifically
I've insel project for like a week but
it was such a piece of tool that I
went to balsamic in and I've done that I
do a video on it I've been meaning to
I'm a meaning to what is wire framing
and then also build out wireframes in a
video like learn how the wireframe is 60
minutes anymore your boys soon I never
win while asked anyways I don't know man
I'll let you know when Brad says many
more courses in for his net for his
fourth course or whatever it is my still
working in Florida yes I'm still in
Florida I love it here man I really do
it would cost me about $4,500 just a
state tax code
to California and I ain't doing that I
am NOT doing that
it's a literally it's like $350 a month
into my pocket just by not living in
California that doesn't even count the
cost of living is it good or safe to use
PayPal yeah
nice PayPal all the time how much do I
know about algorithm analysis nothing
absolutely nothing that's very very
detailed and I have no idea what that
actually refers to I mean I could take a
gander but it sounds more like a data
science thing someone asked me if I have
any interest in AI uh I don't know I I
don't know what I would do with AI one
of the appealing things of what
development and JavaScript is that is
that you can you can learn JavaScript
and build almost anything and that makes
me very interested because it's
something that I comply to my personal
life I want to build a website I want to
build an application I want to build
some sort of desktop app a chrome app
whatever it is I can build it and I can
market it and sell it so something I've
always been been very interested in have
I worked with types of services with
angular 4 yes well I watched several
couple hour tutorials on YouTube for
angular 4 I'm also almost done with
angular 4 front to back which is
traversée media's angular 4 course
pipes and services are pretty similar
and concepts to what they are in
angularjs so uh I didn't really feel
like I needed to watch that so much the
services you just have to be more
familiar with how angular for dos
services than anything else
how does
location affect him or her as a
developer greatly uh so uh one of the
things you should do on your resume and
your cover letter is put that you're
willing to relocate if you're if you're
looking to move out of the area
also some companies won't even take you
if you're not in the area they're just
not interested so it definitely can have
an effect but I also encourage you to
apply out of state if you're just trying
to get that first role sorry that wasn't
aimed at you I just see a lot of job
adverts I asked for a two years plus
experience decided for a junior job you
must know XY and Z and like uh I'm never
gonna get hired I don't know man I mean
don't get me wrong I've been working my
ass off for a very long time but I got I
I've gotten two jobs now three
technically I've done everything that
you should do it's it's hard I never
once that was hard wasn't hard I've been
working my ass off so it's it's just one
of those things I just part of the
process sometimes I need the description
of your haircut so I can get a similar
cut it's called a little off the top
actually it's got a little on the top so
it is what it's gone as entry-level
junior developer is knowing algorithms
really necessary get your from the door
for some companies yes being able to
solve like algorithm problems is
probably the more crucial skill to have
than anything else like being able to do
like the algorithms on on free code camp
and code fights and things like that in
a in a effective short manner that's a
very crucial skill we're applying in the
Austin Dallas area before image Florida
yeah so I applied in a bunch of states
basically every state that didn't have
sales tax or sales tax or state tax I
was willing to live in Portland Oregon
was one area specifically because my
brother was there Austin Texas because
they have no state tax I also think
Texas would be cool to live in and I
know some people in Texas
sorry knew some people in Texas at the
time Florida was one of the areas as
well because of the no state tax and the
the lower cost of living so basically
every place that was lower cost of
living in no state tax was kind of on on
the menu Florida was at one of the top
of the list so Florida Texas and
Washington and Portland Oregon
specifically where the four main ones I
was trying to go to do I freelance as a
web developer do you only work for
companies I can I mean it just kind of
depends you know it's it's one of those
things where if people are gonna want me
to freelance they're gonna have to pay a
higher rate I charged ninety an hour for
my mentoring and that's probably what I
would charge as a freelancer so if
somebody wants to hire me for ninety an
hour I'd be happy to put ten hours a
week into a project ninety an hour is
exactly 2.5 times my hourly rate which
is what I would charge as a contract
employee which is what I charge but I
charge for for Mentor eNOS well that's
how I come to that number
Oh Cyr do you think LinkedIn is worth me
it's worth being on to get your first
web dev job yeah you have to be on
LinkedIn someone asked me about Vance
Paro so my buddy van shoutout to the
homie who just got married
he's uh he's doing quite well he's very
happier than so so yeah I finished hey
buddy
yeah he's live streaming so for those of
you who asked about the website I did
finish it this is it right here this is
Vance Faro a little about Me section a
little shout-out to his two stories to
social media
oh it's others charge so this is one
store this is him and a social media his
other store and then this is a his just
a little video portfolio
designed by humans I built this for him
relatively quickly I used a template and
then I just kind of inserted images and
changed a few things around I didn't
charge him for this or anything like
that Ben's done so much free work for me
in graphic design that I I just wanted
to do something nice for him so yeah I
didn't finish that up for him hey Casey
how's it going
I like Casey Casey likes me and I like
Casey good uh-huh yeah reacts
interesting I have kind of a love/hate
relationship with the react people like
react because it's lightweight but then
they add 40 libraries to it it's not so
lightweight after that so that's my
thing is they react starts out with one
library and then you end up with 40 by
the end of your project and then it's
the whole oh it's so lightweight it's so
much better
it really isn't it really if that's why
you're you like it's not really likely I
mean don't get me wrong I like react but
I also like angular but if we're gonna
end up with 40 if we're gonna end up
with like 40 libraries and react why
don't we just use angular angular has
libraries that are meant to be used with
each other so I don't know it's all good
though I I mean you let me react you're
learning an angular angular is not new
for any friendly at all I tend to agree
I won't say that it is I will also say
that I don't think I think react is a
little bit of an easier learning curve
but I mean here's the thing guys it's
like if you put the hours into either
one if you put 40 hours into your acts
and 40 hours into angular you'll be all
right so
it just kind depends cropsey's throwing
out the shade right now it's going
awesome Crosley is feeling pretty
gangsta today yeah so it's uh yeah there
are a lot of react jobs coming but I uh
I also think there's gonna be even more
so coming but my thing is that my thing
is that uh at the end of the day you
really it really doesn't matter as long
as you learn one of the other especially
if you're willing to relocate my thought
process was I had angularjs at my
previous role so maybe I could land in
angular for role and that's why I
started picking up react because I
didn't have any react and maybe it'd be
easier for me to get into there so
that's kind of how how it went for me I
will say that I think there are going to
be more gonna be more angular roles
because I think people are finally
starting to understand angular on a very
macro level and I think it's going to be
one of the good things about it would
you recommend learning a pre CSS pre
compiler like sass or less before
applying for junior you can learn sass
or less than a weekend it's definitely
not something that is gonna make or
break you for a role so I would say yeah
pick it up the probably the most helpful
part of it is just establishing build
tools and building a pre compiler into
your project that will probably be
something you get most out of it
will I ever collaborate with other
youtubers like Joe from coding phase I'm
happy to collaborate on anyone's channel
that that is that that wants to have me
on no one asked me to have them on I've
had other youtubers on in the past I've
had I've had a simple programmer
engineer truth
it's just one of those things where I
may want to learn sass but if you might
go on it you might be able to get away
with less that's a true coder right
there that's the true color he was ready
to drop that um but yeah I mean I'm uh I
uh I don't really have a problem with
coding face I'm not like a fan of his
like there's channels that I'm fans of
and for whatever reason I I enjoy that
he's throwing out coding content and I I
wish him the best but for some reason I
and this is I try I watched you of his
videos last week because I I liked to
like coding channels and I've never been
able to connect with coding face on that
level of actually liking his content I'm
not saying it's bad I just there's
yourself I don't know if I'm not custom
the way he talks I'm not sure what the
deal is but Eric told me that coding
phase was going full-time on YouTube I
said all right cool let me go check that
out so I appreciate that man I
appreciate the grind and and I don't I
don't know it I just my experience is
this with him is he's he's the type of
guy that likes to complain about things
and I don't really like that and and it
doesn't get you anything and it doesn't
result in anything you know I mean like
it's one thing to say hey here's a
here's something that is not right but
there's a difference between that and
complaining and I've been on the end of
some of his complaints and I've seen him
complain about people like Eric ooh Eric
Eric keeps me up to date with this every
time something happens with Eric and
coding phase I get an email from Eric
updating me about the situation I don't
know what it is I don't know what it is
by
it's it's it's a funny thing layout I
don't have a problem with the coding
phase there's one situation where
someone basically called him a liar in
my Facebook group and he popped off and
I banned him from the group just because
I didn't want people screaming and
yelling at each other and so I think he
may interpret that I have an issue with
him but I really don't I wish him the
best and I I mean I wish all the coding
channels the best but I think we're
doing great things as a community and so
I don't want there to be any drama or
any shade darling but uh I've never I
tried to watch some of his videos
recently and they were bad they just
weren't they just weren't for me I guess
that's what I'm trying to say but a lot
of people like his stuff he gets good
views so I mean it's maybe it's not for
me I don't know maybe Hey
down bronx enough room player if that's
a real term boogie down bronx um yeah
you can tell you i blocked him from the
facebook group he was he was uh he was
popping off on somebody somebody
basically posted in the group and i met
I never heard a coney face I think he
had made me like 1500 or 2000
subscribers at that point and I'm on
channel right now actually he's got a
sick banner on here it looks like you're
starting a family vlog channel oh damn
he's into it yeah he's starting a family
vlog channel as well called family face
that's a good name that's a good
name I'll give him that
that's a good name oh well yeah I mean I
and I don't have problem with him
selling his course i I mean I'll
probably sell you guys of course pretty
soon but um teach their own like it's
not uncommon for coding challenge sell
courses right he's trying to do that
John sauce saw him in his life so I'm
looking at it right now three videos a
day I wonder what happened that he is
doing YouTube full-time did anybody say
did like you get laid off or did he quit
or what's what's the deal
any advice for beginner beginner
personal branding I'm currently using
Twitter I have my own blog I wants to
our website eventually thoughts I mean I
would say it here's the thing is I
actually wish I didn't name my channel
coding tutorials 360 I would prefer that
if I had went got jumped by his coworker
oh I know developer at their own punches
like that I would say Stevie bland
you're probably doing everything right
right now it's just consistency right
make sure that you're writing one blog a
month one blog every two weeks one blog
a week whatever it is start implementing
different things as well maybe start
doing a YouTube channel maybe start a
Facebook group it really just depends
but if you have a website that you're
working on consistently with your blog I
think that's probably good enough you're
definitely showing that you're putting
effort into that into that when it comes
to personal branding though having some
over none is really the main advice I
have a lot of people have nothing and
personal branding is pretty big I've
actually been thinking change in the
name of the channel just to Dylan Israel
but I don't know maybe I'll do Dylan
 easier yes that's the name
it's a just my name a little flair to it
yeah I want so uh the course got the job
gotten getting studied up on the job I
was gonna do a blog post every day now
it's TV you don't need a blog post every
day just one a week would be nice you'll
burn yourself out man what a handyman
home-improvement channel would it do on
YouTube Yemen there's a channel for
everything guys
Brad and I should collaborate let's talk
with Brad today actually I want I'm a
big fan
I'd like to collaborate with Brad I just
don't know what we would do if he ever
reaches out to me I've uh I've invited
him on the channel in the past and it's
not something that's gonna work out for
the plot for what I what I offered I
have to think about a new way a new way
for us to collaborate go from there
did you start your YouTube channel for
you a Kody job if so what are you
talking about I did for a short while if
you go back to the way way back days I I
don't remember if I left him up or not
but I actually started doing
subscription box reviews it's actually
something I would like to do I'm
probably gonna order lootcrate one more
time or see if I can get him to ship it
to me and review it every month but uh
that was that was my first channel
before I started before I started
YouTube like YouTube cut for real it's
on the same Channel yeah is it you and
let's build that a parade ream team yeah
I collaborated with Brian also I'm a fan
of his I like Brian Brian right Brian
Anna I've always liked Brian but I
always I felt like by the end of our
like hour-long or hour and half long
conversation I became a bigger fan of it
you know I mean it's just a it's just a
smart nice to talk to you at the other
day no comment Stevie bland ask somebody
who is an employee I cannot comment on
such things it would be unemployed like
of me I gotta keep it pg
would you say three projects on a
portfolio with just html/css would be
enough to interview as a junior
front-end dev no I would not I mean it's
not impossible but you need JavaScript
jQuery and you need probably reactor
angular on the resume as well as some
version control with git if Cody
wouldn't have worked out for you what do
you think he'd be doing I'd probably be
back in school
I don't know one thing I would probably
be doing is writing I always enjoyed
writing journalism was something that I
was very passionate about and I did
write as a staff writer and a data
center while back my planning adding
anything to my picture I just released a
video on the patron I just actually
revamped it at a five-dollar level I'm
putting up like little short clips stuff
that's not read it really for the
channel just unlisted videos for those
two there may be stuff that's a little
bit more controversial
I also added project reviews as well as
added project reviews so like twice a
month I will review your project or code
as well and that's for $30 and at $20 I
will actually go I will actually go and
make a video or answer one of your
questions for that so do you miss your
YouTube channel during job interviews I
do it's one of my best selling points it
shows a lot of things it's right on my
resume in my project section so the why
is it so important well it's a side
project one it's a long-term side
project two three it shows that I'm
passionate about coding and that I'm
always learning for four four five it's
unique
which means that it's not something that
someone can copy and it's it's one of
the things that people look if they're
saying people are looking for the
especially on the junior level that are
passionate can do the job and and and
are looking to learn and with my
specific channel that that pretty much
fills all those roles you need to add
stickers or custom t-shirts as pattern
options so I have I have a stickers on
there at the ten dollar level I'll send
you two laptop stickers we go to we're
going to show you guys actually you see
right here I think if you sign up for
ten bucks on patreon I'll send you some
of these every month I usually send it
once we film or all you got to do is
stay signed up a second month less
anymore
yeah so I have that well what do you
like about Florida besides to know
states tax I like that I don't know
anybody I've been able to focus a lot
cuz I don't know anybody so not that I'm
like antisocial or anything but I've
been able to focus on YouTube and coding
because there's nobody here but April
and me and it's Lucy I don't have to go
to birthdays I don't have to go to
holidays I don't have to go to weddings
anything I don't want to cuz I'm 3,000
miles away baby I got a little hype
there for a second um no um so I get to
focus more about what I want to do and
I'm very work motivating money motivated
right now and that's kind of what I
enjoy I also enjoyed the weather they
actually have weather here and so so the
weather is great the less traffic is
amazing
traffic and the weather and the cost of
living were the main reasons I want to
get out of California
traffic's significantly less than Los
Angeles cost of living is
significantly better and the weather is
better it's not just hot and dry we'll
sticking those stickers on my laptop
make me a better developer not only will
they make you better developer they'll
make you more attractive guaranteed all
right
the ladies will love you
hey girl I see you staring at my laptop
sticker those are main condition limited
edition stickers only a thousand of them
were ever made
when can we play league together so this
is a funny thing
I actually tried to play a game of
League of Legends this weekend with
engineer truth and unfortunately my
computer is too fast to play League of
Legends uh this is a real thing I'm not
I'm not actually it sounds like I'm
trolling you but my computer is too good
to play League of Legends my graphics
card outputs too much so I dropped
frames because of it because it we this
is a real thing that happened with
League of Legends if your computer is
too fast for it you can't actually play
it that's that's a real thing I didn't
know this was a real thing so with my
gtx 980ti and my 8 core 4.4 processor I
can't play League of Legends anymore I
tried for about three hours get the
settings right could a my close
Tallahassee flirt now I'm in the Tampa
area any plans to becoming a full-stack
developer my last role was uh my last
role was as a full stack developer I do
code in full stack and I'm I'm working
as a front-end developer but I am a full
stack developer so it's just one of
those things where I got hired for the
role and full stack the back-end that
they use I'm not familiar with my plan
is to be comfortable in the gate be
comfortable with the stack that I'm
using the front end and then when I'm
there start studying up on the backend
of course I want a full stack developer
I'll get paid a little bit more I can do
more and I just enjoyed learning so
he sounds like my current workplace
needs good front-end developers so that
was kind of gist of what I got from
talking with some of the back-end
developers that got hired hired his
front-end developers and vice versa that
seems like something that they need more
of which is no surprise why they why
they threw me in there up so there's so
much to do with angular there's so much
to do in the front-end that it's just
one of those things where there's so
much to learn right now that I can't
start picking up the backend quite yet
first of all problems yeah hey Roman
hello hello what does the name seem
familiar Roman bozo are they hiring
where you work I don't know I can't tell
you where I work yeah I would say at at
times I use Android I would say at times
that I do miss family and and things
like that
it slows it's all those situations where
where I don't necessarily miss my family
and I don't want them to take this the
wrong way I I've never been happier and
they have nothing to do with that but
I'm very happy where I'm at and they are
always I got three bedrooms here man
it's just April and I on the cats I have
two bedrooms they can come and visit
whenever they want two extra bedrooms I
can come and visit whenever they want
and a living room right and they're
welcome to come out anytime but I'm
looking to buy property I'm looking to
I'm looking to transition my career
set down foundations and the only thing
that I would say is that you know my
folks are getting older right I'll be 30
this month my folks are in their early
60s and they're they're getting older
and so you're at the
stage of life where every year you're
not home or nearby is a year that that
you're not with them right that you're
not spending time with them and that
that's always it's it's hard like I know
I'm doing great I'm doing great where
I'm at but it's hard when you think
about it like in that terms and so
that's the only thing it's like they're
not going to be here forever right and
so that I guess that's what I know I'll
miss when the time comes you know
they're not going anywhere anytime soon
but but you know 15 20 30 years who
knows where they're at right so I mean
that that's that's part of life is you
know neither of them are really retired
yet or anything but that that's just
something I think about you know just I
mean I don't I didn't mean to get to
like deep on you but that's that's the
truth of the answer is I'm not worried
about it right now or in the immediate
future but it is something that's all my
- jus you know yeah I guess yeah you
guys get it where can I learn about
cryptocurrency there's some YouTube
channels man just type in type in a few
cryptocurrency channels I watch a few I
can recommend you a few in a second here
let me pulled up God was his channel
name
I forget the name of this channel I have
300 plus channels so it's just one of
those things just just Google some
YouTube channels and find one that you
like there's a bunch that I do like
daily videos on it can I come live with
you in the next room and learn to code I
can cook and clean you got rent money
man
yeah the start we'll start the will
start the CT 360 in-house boot camp what
do you think of a full-stack react and
loopback ap I'm not gonna back API but
the full-stack react is great if you got
a higher paying job offer in California
when you move back I have got a higher
paying job offer and I said no I got a
job offer at Levi's for $120,000 in San
Francisco realistically after housing
and everything it probably would have
been about a 10 $10,000 raise but after
housing taxes and sales tax I I would
have somewhere between a 10 $20,000
raised but I would have done it I was
only considering it so that I could have
a large corporation on my resume like
Levi's just so that I I can um it's just
better for the resume I guess when you
have when you have more name-brand
companies on there that companies
recognize it lends some Authority to
your to your resume but I eventually
ended up saying no so
have a good one George I did think about
it though I did think about it there's a
long interview process - there's a long
interview process it was like a
three-week interview process with six
different parts and originally what
happened was I wanted a hundred and
twenty thousand dollars to go there and
that's that was on the low end and they
offered me 105 just and I said look I'm
not going anywhere for less than 120 on
day one and this isn't day one there
they say we know what we're looking to
pay for this role
it's a 105 is there a recruiting
interest and I told their career on day
one I said look man the lowest I would
go is 120 you came back the next day so
yeah you know what they said that's okay
let's start the process so we go in this
three week process to get hired and you
know I'm interviewing I'm having phone
calls I'm doing skills tests all that
sort of stuff and anyhow they make me an
offer for 115 and I was I was
furious because three weeks ago three
weeks ago we started this interview
process I'm on day one I made sure that
said look I'm not going anywhere I'm
moving across country this is the salary
that I would need to start and is
actually a contract to hire also at
basically the way that it was going to
work is that one year they were are you
either gonna hire me full-time or they
were going to renew my contract that's
basically is that so I the way I found
out about the role was a recruiter
reached out to me because he saw that I
worked in Los Angeles and Pasadena area
and
and so he reached out to me I said you
know I'm at Florida I'm actually
currently taking job applications and
depending on the company and SF you know
I've never really it wouldn't really
fulfill the things I wanted to do with
my life at the point in time you know I
don't want traffic I don't want high ran
high cost of living that's everything at
SF is but SF is also like the mecca of
software development and I was thinking
like all right that would be amazing you
know I started I started trying to look
at the the positive aspects of it I
could commute and I deal with the
traffic but I saved money on rent I get
I get fat checks and I'd be able to meet
a bunch of interesting people so there's
a bunch of cool things that would that
would work out and so I was like okay
and and the company it was a large
company and I was like okay I would like
to Levis would look good on the record
and the plan would be I would go I'd
worked there for a year and I'd actually
leave to go to Portland Oregon and work
at Nike Nike he's a big hire in Portland
Oregon that would that would be the plan
if I ended up taking that role so I take
the role leave ice and I have
transitioned to Nike and Portland and
they hired me because not I tags have a
similar sort of product under the belt
in same space that was basically the
deal so oh that was my game plan if I
did that so they came back made me an
offer for 115 I told the recruiter very
nicely to shove it and then a week later
a week later they came back with 120 and
I told him it's now 125 I was pissed and
I was the end of the conversation as I
expected it to be so that was kind of
the gist of of what happened with Levi's
so but yeah recruiter reached out to me
from the area that's hiring for for
Levi's and
I think the thing that pissed me off
most about it was I spent like three and
a half weeks doing this interview
process and at the end of it they tried
to cheat me out for five grand they're
like well we have this other person 450
give a about where you're paying
other people so I was like you've paid
them five grand more than you know like
it click fate pay me five the five grand
that we agreed upon before I started
this interview process that was really
what upset me like I can't understand
not them not wanting to pay me but the
fact on day one when they already had my
resume in hand then we went down this
road and they're talking off
you
what do you mean
but uh all right guys just give him the
it's getting a little late I I need to
start studying a little bit before I go
to bed here and I appreciate you so uh
one of the things I like to do at the
end of my last race I like to first off
take a second to think the reason we're
doing this live stream you got a
thousand new subscribers man
we're got thousand new subscribers
that's pretty cool right we're at 27,000
and and we're at twenty-seven thousand
subscribers where we're growing we're
learning I do these every every thousand
subscribers about every ten days
continuing to to mature as a developer
as an individual continue to grow not
only my I guess my personal brand can't
believe it I have a personal brand
I guess stickers man you know you've
made it when you got stickers baby so
for the thousand of you that are new
thank you very much for the the 26,000
of you who are here before and I would
like to thank you as well welcome and as
I like to end my live streams what I
like to do is I like to leave you with a
final thought and today we're gonna talk
about sort of starting from the
beginning right starting from the
beginning and or at twenty seven
thousand subscribers right that's crazy
to me alright I never you know I have
goals but it when you hit some goals
right the first big goal for me was like
25 and now like the next one's 50 right
so we're moving towards a we're
transitioning it's gonna be a long road
right it's gonna be it's gonna be one of
those things where we're slowly grinding
as is life now what what
separate somebody who's successful for
somebody who's not is they continue to
grind right they they they continue to
move forward and grind out we all start
in life with zero subscribers we all
start in life without knowing how to
code anything without knowing what a
variable is how an if statement works
what a for-loop does having no resume
experience not having a portfolio mate
not having a resume made not having a
degree not coming on to bootcamp we all
start in life all these things at the
zero and what separates you as a
developer from those who didn't make it
was you kept going you kept trying you
kept struggling you kept learning when
you started your YouTube channel and you
saw that you would upload a video and it
said no views you looked at it you side
but then tomorrow you uploaded in
another video and when you when you
solved an algorithm or when you didn't
solve an algorithm the day before or you
couldn't figure out what an API was you
sighed and you continue to move forward
so I just want you guys to understand
that we all start at the same place and
it could be that you're grinding in HTML
and CSS it could be that you're grinding
on the YouTube channel on building your
personal brand and building your side
project it could be any number of things
but we all start at the right place so
what will make you successful and what
will make you understand it's that you
may not get to where you want to go at a
certain amount of time but as long as
you keep moving forward maybe you get
once of a day get two subs a day get 3
subs a day you know all of a sudden you
have one project to project maybe it's
on the framework that's the latest but
now you're you're learning how to use
frameworks and we always will want to be
someplace sooner than we are that could
be in your savings and coding and
YouTube whatever it is but the only way
you're going to get theirs even if not
on time
is just like keep moving forward and
understanding that everyone starts at
the same level some people have a little
bit easier some people have it harder
there's not a lot that we can do about
that but what you can do is you can't
work every day to accomplish your goals
no matter what they are in my case its
coding and youtube in your case maybe
it's a family it depends with financial
independence so I wish you guys the best
with whatever it is that you are trying
to become and I encourage you that don't
get persuaded to get negative and sort
of stop what it is that you're trying to
accomplish if you really want it just
work one day at a time to go and
eventually before you know it you'll be
there so I appreciate you all thank you
so much for watching thank you for the
27,000 of you and I look forward to
doing this at 28,000 all the way up to a
million that's the goal baby we're gonna
hit that one mil we gotta get to the
50,000 first though right so I
appreciate you all good luck with
whatever it is that you're doing in your
life join the Facebook group join the
patreon all that great stuff this is
