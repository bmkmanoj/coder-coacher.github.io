doing that learn angularjs just got back
from the bar with some people a little
bit look a little bit a little bit
toasty let's see what we're doing today
there's been a minute since I've done
some angular but I'm ready for it I hope
you're ready for it be ready for it
let's get going hey guys I haven't been
as active as I normally would be
releasing you know somewhere between two
and five videos a week sometimes more
depending on how much i get done on the
weekends i actually just moved to
Florida for a web engineer position for
a basically a government contract
company very excited about it I'll be
doing a lot of front-end development and
they're gonna help to mold me not only
in front-end development but in full
stack so I'll be learning back in once I
kind of get going lots of angular will
be working with PHP PHP my admin for the
sequel servers things like that so I
have lots of cool tutorials and probably
even make some original content for you
guys as well so i definitely look
forward to that i'll be posting a couple
more sections i completed the section of
coke ad amis angular stuff so that will
be coming out shortly really see some
new content as well I've been doing some
interviews with several coding channels
on on YouTube the the most popular ones
thus far is a John saw Sean mess from
simple programmer is rain for about you
know 30 35 minutes have a very great
interview going on there I think it's
you guys are really going to like it I
had a lot of fun doing it so I'm pretty
excited to put that out that will be out
in about a week
also do another interview with Matt
tranform engineer truth my good friend
talked to him for about 15-20 minutes
about his boot camp experience asked him
what he liked what didn't he like what
would he change and improve and who we'd
recommend boot camps for so if you're
interested in those four keep an eye out
for that I'm hoping to do some more
interviews with with some some other
channels as well in the same sort of
coding space I have one more from eric i
believe i believe Eric goes by Eric the
programmer on this website but you'll
see him as well a really nice guy a
smaller coding channel getting his I
believe his master's or his doctorate in
computer science and a small channel of
about 2 300 but it's nice to kind of
talk to people who are doing the same
thing as you I think you guys will enjoy
that as well and i'll come out a little
bit later but yeah so i look forward to
more exciting content i'll probably be
working more on the weekends I'm working
really hard at work you know trying to
meet these deadlines this only day three
for me I just wanted to do a little a
little video blog started I started I'm
gonna start the video off with a little
blooper from how i started the original
angular tutorial and then had to go back
and redo it which is why it's a blooper
and not a full video so yeah look out

go to the comments section and find help
so that's really appreciate it keep
sharing your answers that's another
great resource for people is now we have
kind of this stack overflow of example
answers with with a theory to the videos
