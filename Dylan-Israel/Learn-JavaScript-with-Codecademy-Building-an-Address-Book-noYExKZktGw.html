objects 1 building an address book it's
thing it's pretty short thing of what
we're doing here but uh compared the
last section anyhow so copy the 4 minute
and sorry so they have an object called
Bob here and we basically want to get
Bob's last name and email so just call
the object then the parameter we want
and we'll go last name and then same
thing here the object followed by the
parameter and we want email and then
when we save and submit we should get
all three next up we still have our Bob
object here we want to create an object
called Mary and Mary has the same
parameters as Bob so her first name is
Mary
our last name is Johnson our phone
number
is also a string make sure you use
quotes for this it's six five oh eight
eight eight - eight eight eight and
finally her email is Mary dot Johnson at
example.com and now we're gonna create
an array called contacts of our contacts
equals bracket with our semicolon at the
end they in here put Bob as index 1 -
Mary index 2 so we got Bob comma Mary
and then write a console log statement
that prints out Mary's phone number so
console dot log and then same as
previous ample married up phone number
and I believe that should be good to go
so there is your phone number cool
so we're gonna define a function if you
forget how to do it it's pretty pretty
simple just like a variable except we're
setting up something on the function
side and these hints are always really
good for the most part it's very seldom
that you have to look at what's going on
here you can often just give you some
generic code and it's usually more
syntax than anything in this all right
so this is gonna take a parameter called
person and in the function pronounced
person's so we want to print out person
dot first-name
also dot log first enough first name
then print a space and their last name
and that should be good so we're a new
person dot last name call the print
person function to print out the first
alright so we want to call print person
and in it for a person parameter is
going to be our contacts and we want the
zero index to print then on the next
line called print person again and take
the second item out of the contacts race
a print person and ideally if we wanted
to print all this out we would probably
use an array yeah for loop to run to
iterate through the array but see right
there we got Bob space Jones and then
Mary Johnson so up next we'll be
creating a function that lists all the
users so all right create another
function of our list equals function
this doesn't take any parameters
currently at started the function
defined a variable store the number of
items in the contacts or rate to find
this variable to store the number of
items sold barn number
I'll call it contacts contacts link so
our contacts lanes
and we'll set this equal to contacts dot
size all the items in the rare numbered
starting at zero to cycle through all
the elements create a for loop alright
so we'll do a for our I equals 0 because
index starts today while I is less than
contacts contacts length then I plus
plus and then in here we do some stuff
so let's see here
inside the loop add code to call print
person so we want to call print person
here and we want to do this for contacts
I'm not whatever currently is at the
very bottom of the file called the list
function alright so now we want to call
this and see if we made any mistakes
it looks like the list function didn't
console dot log Bob Jones did you
remember to call this creating it yes
okay so let me see if this it
alright so contact us sighs it's not a
function so why don't we just set this
equal to two let's see what if that does
it better so this looks like it erased
through it twice it shouldn't do that
though it could just be for some reason
the IDE sometimes will run part of this
I'm not sure why I've seen other things
but let's maybe take a look at the hint
array dot length okay so let's try this
that's that's what I was looking for at
length so we have contacts dot lengths
and let's go ahead and submit that one
more time it's still the same thing all
right so it seems to be working just
fine all right create a function called
search so our search equals function
it takes a parameter called last name so
this is gonna take lastname leave the
list function alone so we're creating
our search function it takes in the
parameter last name we're not gonna mess
with the list function like the last
exercise to find a variable store the
number of items in their array they're
in it so we'll just call it VAR con tax
dot length contacts length rather and
this is equal to contacts dot length
we have to because this is a global
variable we can't just call contacts
online so we just this might be bad to
name it the same thing but since they're
local variables it doesn't matter
typically let's see yeah all right so uh
create a for loop for started I for this
one of our I equals 0 I is less than
contacts length I plus plus
and then we want to running out every
guy named Ella Rae on entertainment that
chick sees the lasting property the
object is equal to the last name choice
comes here in the body of the loop
rather than printing out every single
item in the array add an if statement
like so if that says if last name is
equal to contacts I thought last name we
want it to do some stuff so we're
checking if the last name parameter is
equal to the current array last name
current array value last name you want
it to do some stuff if that's the case
we want to call print person contacts
I
at the bottom the file called a search
function passing in Jones as the last
name so in this case we want to call
search with the last name Jones and we
should get Bob Jones
there you go Bob Jones good to go
alright so next create a function called
add so it's gonna create a function here
called a bar add a collection with the
parameters so this is gonna take all the
parameters first name last name email
phone number
so we want to create a new object
you know this to make sure you want to
create a new object like Bob so far
we'll call this first name add this new
object to the contacts right so far how
do we want to name it let's see here do
they give us a name
let's just call it first name and see if
it will actually supplement that in so
if our first thing value is Dylan it
should come it's its value should be
Dylan still so our first name equals
so you have first name first name email
and then we have phone number
actually uh Alyssa sorry I don't like
doing this
so let's rename this to new contact and
then we want to add this new contact to
the contacts right so we'll say contacts
contacts dog-sit dot add there's a way
to add it where's the thing I'm just
gonna be added to the end of array okay
so that's what we want to do so right
here we're gonna call it contacts and
we're gonna check the length and the
length is always gonna be one more than
lower right and then we're gonna say
we're gonna add this new contact to it
basically we're saying for our contacts
array at the length length being one
more than what what is that which is
perfect for our index value we want to
add our new contact perfect and make
sure you call this function at the end
so let's go ahead and call so you want
to call our add function so we're gonna
add will add me so add we'll do pizza
first-name poker guy last name will do
it's a poker guy at email dot-com and
then we'll do and obviously you would
have to if you're trying to make a real
address book you'd have to you'd have to
make sure all these values were accurate
and made sense and but uh
for what we're doing here I think we
should be it and then we just call list
and we should see everything here and
then you can see right there Pizza poker
guys at it so we just finished the
building and address book we're almost
done with the JavaScript section up next
we're going to be doing more
object-oriented programming and we have
about two sections left I'll see you
guys next video and as always anything
constructive is always appreciated see
you next video
