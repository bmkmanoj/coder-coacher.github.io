should you yes you take an unpaid
inertia I don't know I did yes you but
should you take unpaid internship I have
a couple stats that are we're gonna look
at as well as kind of share my opinion
asked you why uh one way or the other so
I've always had a pinion about why you
shouldn't take unpaid internship I never
actually went say hey let's go find out
a few reasons a few stats and kind of
see if I can support my own bias and my
own critical thinking skills as to why I
think they're bad ideas instead of me
just telling you don't take unpaid
internship because Dylan says so I want
instead to find some reputable source to
kind of go over that so in this case
we're looking at the National
Association of Colleges and employers so
this is basically the agency that runs
data and stats and on this sort of thing
it's specifically for college grads and
you'll see here that in 2013 and we're
gonna look in some 2015 statistics I
just thought that this is an interesting
article whose his first one I came
across but I wanted to find something a
little more recent and I'll include the
links to both these articles down below
but in 2013 basically two two out of
three people who got paid internships
were offered jobs at the end of the
internship now you compare that with
unpaid internships which the average
internship usually is about three months
so you're basically working for free on
whatever they want you to work on for
three months were 37% likely to get an
internship and when you compare that to
people who didn't do an unpaid
internship we're only two percent more
likely to actually get a job over the
people who did it so so essentially what
you're saying is for three months you're
working for free for a two percent more
likely chance of getting a job but
usually dealing I get the two percent I
get something good but resume and then
maybe I maybe I'm in the thirty seven
percent and they offer me a job
all right well let's go back down
we're here so as you might if you have
critical thinking skills and you might
say to yourself you know someone who's
so cheap that they're not going to pay
me probably is not going to offer me a
very good salary either and it turns out
that yes you will get screwed over there
as well so here we are and saying okay
well when working for for companies who
paid who actually paid you to show up in
work and by the way I'm not that there
is no barrier of pay we're not saying
you have to pay these people $30 an hour
$20 an hour we're talking about minimum
wage the legal amount the government
says that you can pay somebody who is
useless that's it is that is it the
legal the legal amount that you can pay
somebody not not a sense illegal for you
to pay them less so so that's we can see
here when they actually got job offers
when they took unpaid internships they
were actually paid one-third less or
today how you look at it the people who
took paid internships not only did they
get paid for those three months they
actually make fifty percent more money
than those who did not and in 2015 it
looks like your chance goes up to four
forty four percent as well so so you're
still uh you're you're bad in you know
two out of five on that one two point
five out of five will say compared to
seventy two percent so more people are
getting hired for internships so these
are some stats right these are things I
have always believed and for the most
part knew to be true right as web
developers we oftentimes get those hey
you know I have equity ideas and stuff
like that and this is basically what it
is to me
and when we look at that first stat of
you're going from thirty five percent
chance to get hired to thirty seven
percent and in that thirty seven percent
you are now devoting your time and
energy for a two percent chance while in
reality if you devoted your time and
energy to your own projects you devoted
your time and energy to two
anything else honestly you could
probably or just apply two more jobs
until you got a paid internship you'd be
in a significantly better spot I hate
when I see people tell people to take
unpaid internships because it means you
don't value yourself and I understand if
you're a liberal arts major I understand
that I get it
you don't have a lot of choices and I
don't say that to be mean what I'm
saying that if you have a degree that
doesn't teach you a technical skill I
understand that the job market is
significantly harder for you and this
may and when watching this video I
understand if you take unpaid
internships what I don't understand is
when you are a technical person taking
an unpaid internship when there are
roles out there to be filled and I
understand taking a low-paying job
low-paying internship my first role paid
me $12 an hour I would have been happy
with minimum wage which I think was like
eight at the time but don't ever take an
unpaid internship and most people can't
it's unfair to so it's unfair for
somebody to say hey this person who's
better off because they live at home and
they live with their family and they
don't have any bills maybe they're
younger and they their life isn't
established with mortgages and children
it's unfair it's unfair advantage where
someone can go and take on paid
internship it's an awful premise and I
would never want to work for a company
who takes advantage of people and that's
what I consider it and ask the stats
show if you are willing to not get paid
you are willing to take less than your
field should be as I have seen people
who have taken unpaid internships and
gotten jobs get paid less they then
sometimes put out the message that you
know those stats that you see on like
last door and LinkedIn and all these
reputable massive agencies who collect
more data on what people are actually
making you know that median income that
middle income you know I only make half
of that
so all those all those stats all that
data that they collect from the millions
of jobs that they have on there and and
the hundreds of thousand people who
reported on Glassdoor it's just lies
fake news maybe fake news you know
because I'm making thirty four thousand
and you know this says people who have
my job or making fifty five thousand and
my company wouldn't do me like oh yeah
you mean the company who essentially had
you do indentured servitude for three
months with no guarantee of anything at
the end and if there was three of you
the other two said Oh bye baby we'll
give you a nice letter of recommendation
don't worry about that would you mind
writing that up for us and we'll sign it
and send it to you we don't have the
time we're trying to get some new free
labor in here alright so when you guys
think about this and I understand it's
it's easy to get caught up in the moment
and it's easy to to say you know Dylan I
just want to get my foot in the door
understand that what you're giving up is
essentially a two percent difference
where you are saying hey I'm going to
devote three months of my time for
something that's going to pay me like
garbage and then at the end of it pay me
like garbage if I'm lucky pay me at all
and waste and for a letter
recommendation which has someone in a
technical field I can tell you I've
gotten a letter recommendation not once
has it ever been asked for I offer it
every single time I promise you it's not
going to do very much good your time is
better spent coding your stuff not
running errands in the office and doing
text edits okay no one's going to hire
somebody to build a application from the
ground up not pay them and then charge a
client for that that is a solid
application because you you probably
don't have the skills to do it if you're
taking unpaid work so please please
please think about what why what the
result is and that 2% difference that
you're gonna take a very big gamble and
mind you I'm all about taking educated
risks in life it this is a uneducated
risk
that is the thing is you are taking it
you are investing time and energy into
something that statistically speaking
will not benefit your career and will
actually cost more harm because you're
going to take an opportunity I'm using
that term very loosely you're going to
take an opportunity that even if you do
get a job off for the pay is going to be
33% less than what it should be on
average and you're a technical
individual and if you're a developer
watching this and software and you're
worth more that statistically speaking
you're worth something to somebody even
if it's a little bit of money and you're
better off waiting to do a paid
internship if it does pay that much
because not only will you have a larger
chance of getting hired you will
actually be able to get a liveable
salary at the end of it so if you see
people recommend and unpaid internships
just understand that they don't know
what they're talking about so I wrote I
hope that you guys and it's not to say
it doesn't work out for some people you
know you bet one you could bet your life
savings on roulette eventually someone's
gonna hit it alright so one in three
person is making wouldn't one in three
people here got a job 2 &amp;amp; 3 2003 didn't
and that one in third is making 33% less
than the other two people who went two
out of three got a paid internship got a
role so so that when you look at it like
that maybe wait for the paid internship
and improve your skills in the meantime
work on side projects go to hackathons
continue learning on your own you'll be
better off so that's my two cents on on
unpaid internships I really hope you
guys aren't taking them and I hope
you're valuing yourself moreso than you
know then I think a lot of people are
taking these things that's what scares
me which is why I'm doing this video so
just just keep that in mind and I wish
you all the best of luck man it's rough
out there I understand how you can get
conned into taking an unpaid internship
but try not to
so best of luck to you guys as always
thank you so much for commenting on the
video liking on the video subscribing to
the video and if you have any unpaid
internships stories leave them in the
comments below whether they were
successes whether they were failures you
know it doesn't have to support my
narrative right or the facts like I said
there are outliers to everything unless
no I'm always interested to hear about
people's experiences I will see you next
time and if you're a liberal arts major
don't take it personally but you know
you know you're not you know you have to
take on fate internship but we're
talking about technical people I'm just
giving you guys a hard time if you're a
liberal arts major is the the underwater
basket Weaver's are gonna be popping off
in on this in the chat here hey baby
great news I finally got a role well
it's actually unpaid quick shoutout to
device plus comm if you're interested in
the latest IO T's packs do-it-yourself
projects revolving around Arduino and
Raspberry Pi there's some great how-to
guides I highly encourage you to check
them out and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
