it's time for our weekly last year we
have a couple things to talk about sort
of what I like to do is every week have
a weekend livestream and every thousand
subscribers although I may be just be
cutting it back to every thousand pretty
soon and we'll talk about a little bit
about why in this in this of livestream
but a little bit about me and what I've
been up to with four we dive into the
first topic of the free code camp new
content release date and then what I'll
be doing later today of building a new
computer so now Kendra Rafael welcome so
I went to the company Christmas party
last night I am pretty hungover so I'm a
little bit tired a little bit uh Jerry
just got done doing a little bit of
Christmas shopping for April and myself
as well as for the family send some
gifts back home um I am uh I'm actually
really tired because I I don't stay up
past 11:00 I don't think I went to bed
till 1:00 normally I go to bed about
nine o'clock shout out to our friends in
Croatia to cookie or cookie I don't know
how you might say one thing I would
where was I going with this
I lost my train of thought yeah the
reason I do these live streams is I like
to be able to help provide it's really
an AMA format where you have questions I
will do my best to answer them not
necessarily AMA and the traditional
sense of hey we want to know about you
Dylan by AMA and like Haake and how can
I help you with via some mentorian how
can I help you with a little bit of
guidance that's why I do this every
Saturday which may come to a end or
change because starting on January 1st
which is just two weeks away I will be
officially starting school and finishing
up my degree through Western Governors
University which I'll be doing a
software engineering degree I have about
33% of the degree
done based off transferable credits and
I have I'm gonna start knocking out my
goal is to get it done in six to nine
months which i think is pretty doable
it's gonna cost me between each
semesters about $3,500 so we'll see what
happens so I may have to cut back the
last room just a tad bit why I am
finishing up things part of that will
really just be a for that so I don't
know if I've talked about this too much
but um one I think I can get more money
with a degree is why I'm doing it but
it's a comment based off of me being
confident not that I necessarily need it
but I think down the road it'll
definitely open up some doors to I
actually plan on when I retired being a
teacher so at some point when I am no
longer chasing money it's not a point
that I see anytime in the near future
but when I say you know I got enough
money the house paid off our house is
hopefully let's go let's go actually be
one of the one in five hundred good
teachers out there and so that's gonna
be one in five hundred harsh one in
twenty good teachers out there is really
kind of my stat we get about one in
twenty one and ten if you're lucky at a
good school shout-out to our boy Ricky
Garcia just killing it I hope you found
whatever it was that you were looking
for man to kind of reinvigorate you
about the grind I know you're looking a
little down teaching boot camps are like
an adjunct lecturer a little bit of both
so I could see at some point where I
would maybe if I could make a good
income teaching at a boot camp that
would be something I definitely would be
very much so interested in so but I
could definitely see myself going and
teaching at a college sort of level and
going from there so it's just uh when
the time comes we'll figure that out
this is something that at the earliest
is ten years off as far as I'm concerned
realistically twenty before I even I'm
actually in that position I have no real
interest of teaching right now but
there's something that I know I would
want to do at some
time just because I like the YouTube
aspect where we're kind of teaching and
we're kind of educating we're kind of
going back and forth um and I've always
kind of thought about it but I never
went for it because unfortunately get
paid most of the time and that's
why you gotta get your money right first
right so that's kind of the game plan it
also opens up a very easy path to for a
pension for a for benefits where all
sudden you can teach as a part-time
lecturer out of school and I say this
knowing that a bunch of my professors
did exactly this and then go from there
so that that's another thing that comes
up with that mainly I just want to get
it done and continue on what is your
experience with JavaScript well what do
you want to know I am a I'm a front-end
developer and my current role as a
full-stack developer at my previous role
and I've done vanilla Jas I've done
jQuery react angularjs now I primarily
code in lanius latest version of angular
which is there currently now an
iteration 5.1 really all you have to
know is that angularjs angular 1
everything else is angular which is
angular 2 plus so that's my experience
with angular I'll be starting on I'm
probably going to so the way that the
program works is competency-based so I
could take tests at anytime to test out
of the program and I plan to with the
they have two or three web development
courses that I want to knock out
immediately but back to the bootcamp
question this is something I'm most
definitely interested in doing I've
always been a big fan of boot camps and
I always think it's an environment that
I would thrive in I've never gone to a
boot camp I would like to but I have no
there's no reason for me to at this
point in my career to go to a boot camp
that pay for it out of pocket if a boot
camp wanted to sponsor me per say let's
say hack reactor
dev Mountain or somebody reached out to
me shout out to the sponsors if you're a
nurse to bootcamp go dev Mountain comm
thrown it out there for the homies
supporting the channel but if I if dev
Mountain wanted to sponsor me say hey
you want to come down and take this
bootcamp maybe just do a livestream
about it here there it would be a lot of
fun for me and I would do it but in
reality what I learned something of
course I would but would it make sense
for me to take out ten or fifteen
thousand dollars of of money out of the
bank or loans to do it now
not really just because I'm already
established in my career but it would be
a ton of fun and I totally would do it a
lot of my professors in college were
wealthy and self-made and just got bored
after a retirement you're gonna have all
that money in the world and not feel
fulfilled
I believe it so Kelvin welcome any tips
for the first job interview for a dev
job yeah one show up looking but I mean
this is I'm gonna start with the basics
and it'll get a little bit more
intermediate so first off dress
professional secondly bring a copy of
your resume thirdly practice what it is
you're going to say to sell yourself
okay so those are the basics now my
advice as a junior for your first job
interview as a junior dev be more
personality driven than anything else
they're what they're going to be looking
for is they're gonna make an assumption
that you can do a for loop and solve an
algorithm right that's the assumption
the hope is that you have the drive and
the hunger you're passionate about
software development you study this
outside of work and then you are
continuing to learn and that you want
this is not necessarily more than job
but something that that you really just
love to do and that's because what's
what they're looking they're looking for
someone who's passionate and enjoys it
as a junior developer and it's looking
to grow any tips for the first job all
right why did I stop doing react I got a
job in angular that's basically it the
aha moment while learning coding coding
and web dev so I just did a video
this week I think it was Monday's video
saying I'm dreaming about coding and
part of that I talked about my aha
moment that aha moment was for me was
when I started dreaming about the
projects I was working on and that's
basically that was the real like I think
I I go in deep in for a lot of 1215
minutes so that recently happened again
because I've been coding so much and
things are starting to click like
they've never clicked before and I would
encourage you to go watch that video
because that's what a lot of the video
is actually about but yeah so with react
I was doing the react now and agree I
was really liking it I had taken that
from a practical standpoint of I have
angularjs maybe I can get angular 2 plus
role based off that and then I I said
okay let's look at react there's a lot
of jobs and I got a job in angular 2 and
that was really I just transition from
learning to react to angular 2 and right
now I've really no have no interest in
picking up react unless I go back on the
job market which I don't foresee
happening I'm very happy where I'm at
love the people I'm working with I'm
like at on a scale of 1 to 10 I'm like
probably a 9 maybe an 8.5 which
typically I'm like a 6 or a 7 so it's
pretty high
Sarris I'm I'm concerned about how happy
I am with my workplace so there's no
reason for me to learn react if your boy
starts learning react he's bored and
there's issues how old were you when you
learned your first language oh this is
an interesting question because I don't
feel like when I started to code I
learned anything I the first time I ever
wrote a line of code not the first time
first time I took one coding course and
I forgot about it till like four years
later I won't say I was like 25 when I
started doing Java that was that was
what I I did Java
I don't do Java anymore but I guess we
could count Java is the first language
that I you know quote unquote learned so
one thing
I guess yeah I guess it has to be Java
just cuz I had five or six courses in it
that I took in pass so I guess about 25
26
do I still solve problems and algorithms
on occasion when I get bored I'll go on
code fights and do like one or two but
not like I was I wasn't doing a hundred
a month anymore I would I was actually
hoping that free code camps I will get
to this in a second about free code
camps new content I'm good I'm going to
actually I'm going to actually do a
video about this talking about this a
little bit more detail and reviewing
what content they have my
recommendations about what is good what
to avoid how you can expand upon the
curriculum and just sort of review it
and talk about a little bit but I was
hoping that they would add more
algorithms than problems could I enjoy
that stuff
what is vanilla JavaScript vanilla
JavaScript just really refers to Dom
manipulation before you would move on to
like a framework such as angular reactor
jQuery and it's stuff like document dot
get element by ID instead of using like
ng model and angular it's the kind of if
you've ever played World of Warcraft you
may have heard the term vanilla Wow and
that's essentially the original version
of world over or crap before all the
expansions and in this case the
expansions are frameworks and that's
kind of that's how that's how I would
explain vanilla JavaScript is it's
JavaScript before we have added
frameworks and so it's using query
selectors and it's using events that are
you know that you're triggering and
through a classic vanilla JavaScript
what are the steps should have beginner
followed to learn web do that really
depends on the individual and how you
plan to learn but the basic ones are
code every day start projects build
projects don't just follow tutorials do
tutorials don't waste your time on books
in my opinion some people may find that
controversial so you know do what works
best for you is what I would say but
definitely code daily and build your own
projects code every day until you get a
 job follow that advice you'll do
just fine
like that's that's what what more and I
I the way I do mean every day code every
day until you get a job and then you can
relax a little bit I want to knock out
code fights to prep for interviews but
it gets in touch me I definitely gets
intense I would encourage you to all to
have projects as well so like when when
I got do code fights it does like after
I pound my head on a wall for an hour on
some of these I like alright I got to
take a break I'll go do a project or
anything else like that does it matter
which language you start first to learn
like reactor angular any other in your
opinion I personally think angular is
it's a lot more in the beginning but I
think it's a lot cleaner a lot better
organization I think it does a much
better job teaching you how to work with
model-view-controller sort of
architecture and I think that it might
be the the better version for a
entry-level developer but there's a lot
less in react but because of that you
have to go and find these other 20
pieces a lot of times while angular is
all sort of one giant package that has
all this all these mini libraries if you
don't think of it my way that are all
maintained by one central location so
that that's my opinion now you may get a
little stuck when you get started with
angular but I just released a video on
Friday
doing an entry-level bill with random
quote machine and angular to kind of
teach you we go over a little bit a few
things and of course I have my course
that's a one step up from that and I'm
working on another course that's gonna
be a step up from that as well
how do you balance the full stack web
dev learning I see I'm guessing you're
saying front-end heavy positions and
full stack ones it really as a junior as
long as you understand what it is that
you're doing how to how databases work
how you're gonna be storing data and so
on and so forth it's just a just like
anything else how's April is a project
management certification going so she's
finished to project management courses
that I've given her certifications than
that but really those courses are to
prepare you for like the the PMP I want
to say it which is a official project
management certification and she'll be
taking that sometime this next week it's
been paid for she just has to go and
take it she got a little bit of a flu
this week and it's kind of throwing her
off but um should be good to go how do
you set up a local dev environment on
Windows what do you mean I've never had
to set it up it just works
it also depends on what Trott like what
is it that you're setting up are you
sample a lamp stack are you sampling
mean stack are you setting up for a
front-end project what is it that you're
trying to accomplish
that's a too broad of a question to to
answer what are your views on cold steel
you dummies bootcamp course uh well I
have scanned it I'm not an expert on it
I know that program with Eric or Eric he
has a review of it and Colt skills
latest I believe that's the advanced
bootcamp course I think it's I think no
matter what if you go through a course
that long and the topics I touch this on
you're gonna learn a lot but I don't
know I couldn't tell you without going
through it myself for reviewing it in
detail but some of it if I remember
correctly the udemy bootcamp course the
original one had a lot of jQuery in it
and if that's the case I'm not really
down with the jquery's I don't think
they're great for you as someone trying
to learn web dev
okay so let's talk about the topic real
quick of the day so free code camp
recently released a blog saying that
when they're hoping to launch their
content and hopefully it's it's supposed
to come out on Christmas which is super
exciting because that would give me like
a week to knock out a lot of the content
and I'm playing - ah a week and if they
if it actually launches on Christmas
this nice little Christmas present so
hopefully the new content on free code
camp comes out on Christmas that's the
estimated launch date right I imagine
it'll get pushed back a couple weeks so
that's how the world works in my opinion
if your manager slash team sucks and
nuts and are not supportive you should
bail right definitely oh so you don't
want to stay with a bad work environment
and you don't want to stay in a place
that that is one of those things where
look 70% of people hate their job and as
a software developer you have so many
career opportunities that you should
just take one other one and see if it
works out better and maybe when you
during your interview process as your
SEO they're still getting a check while
you're working with people that you
despise you can go and try and see if
they have some of the same
characteristics of the people that you
worked with one of the things that
attracted me this the role I took in
mind you I had a I had an offer that was
fifteen thousand dollars higher I had
another company but I turned that down
because I liked the people that I was
working with or I would be working with
I loved everyone that I interviewed with
here and the my boss's boss who was
interviewing me in the process said how
do you know you like the developers we
have 20-plus developers how I met I was
like three and you guys are bad in three
out of three meanwhile I'm
to a very large financial institution
and I liked one out of four and the
other three looked like they're ready to
just take and take an exit
what's wrong with jQuery jQuery is not
gonna get you a job reactor angular will
that's really it so that's that's the
gist of it but yet jQuery is for web
designers not web developers at this
point in time is how I would put it I
think and web designers are gonna have a
very hard time when it comes to things
like Squarespace Wix WordPress those are
the people that are kind of getting
kicked out are you doing your new year
resolution thing anytime soon
are you talking about my video talking
about my new year's resolutions yeah I
was thinking about it I don't know if
people actually care oh I don't know I
know the basics of HTML CSS JavaScript
node express a MongoDB but I still feel
like I don't know anything how do I
overcome that well are you building
things do you have full stack projects
that you have built not following a
tutorial that would be my first question
should I go for treehouse are you Demi a
cult still boot camp I am confused just
do both do the more the better
yeah I mean I recently did a video
talking about the top skills that you
need as a front-end developer and I had
the you must have skills which are about
seven or eight these are the things that
you absolutely have to have in the
supplemental skills that will help you
and I through jQuery and supplemental of
skills for that exact reason
yes oh my my computer has been breaking
for a while and I am buying a new one as
a Christmas present to myself
they're always won at Costco that I like
that was about $1,200 but am I going
like cyber power and I buy power and see
if I can build a custom one that is
going to be as good if not better for
cheaper I doubt it will be but I that's
something that I'll be doing today as
well and I guess see the new Star Wars
yes
later today actually I am taking April
out on a date and we are gonna go see
Star Wars how's your JavaScript course
for you then we coming along I am it so
it's five hours long but I need to do
projects for it I wasn't planning on it
but I know I should so that's really
where the holdup is I have five hours of
content going over it you know going
over things so it's just one those
things right to kind of Tito do what are
you doing buddy it's just one of the
things where I have to go in and get
better at it and just I have to make it
the quality that I want I guess that's
what I'm trying to say and to do that
takes time so originally I was thinking
about maybe throwing it out for free dad
talked about the new PC well I am I am
building one the one I was looking at
that was $1,200 it was a Dell
it had a 256 SD Drive with a 2 terabyte
hard drive it also had a I seven quad
core like 3.7 processor it came with a
gtx 1060 TI i'm not worried about the
graphics card because I meant throw my
1080 TI in there also it's also going to
allow me to get two extra monitors so
I've six monitors on there and then it
had 24 gigs of RAM
I think what else so that that's the
gist of what I'm looking for I'll
probably if I build a custom I will be
going to 32 gigs of ram just because
yeah and then I'm not sure about the
quad core aspect that was kind of the
one thing I didn't like because I
currently have an 8 core processor and
it's great it's four point four eight
teto 4.4 gigahertz eight core processor
but unfortunately I've had it for like
three four years and it's it's
essentially burnt out why don't you
build it from parts cheaper and fun it's
fun uh I don't have the time part of it
is I just want someone to build what I
want and I need to have it done in the
next week or so that's really it
hey no problem mr. e do it druid yeah I
mean III know if everyone's gonna talk
 I'm buying Adele but honestly I
don't have a problem with buying
mainstream computers if it does what I
needed to do
it's really the quad-core aspect that
concerns me
I would prefer an 8 core processor so
we'll see I I did some contracting work
for my old work we I'm so here's the
deal I'm currently saving to buy a house
and I have the money to buy it I'm
waiting for April to get a job but I'm
also going back to school so I'm kind of
like figuring out where I need to I'm
hesitant to spend money but on a
computer on my setup like this is where
this makes me money so like in terms of
I can do contract work I can do YouTube
I can do courses build courses all this
sort of stuff like if there's anywhere
that I do spend money it's on the setup
right so I got like the for 4k monitors
I'm gonna go get to 2 more 4k monitors
they're actually on sale right now did I
drop out of school yes I did bat back in
whoo
about a year and a half no no no two
years ago two years ago was when I did
that
and my life has never been better just
that big courage fuel dropout I actually
told my tech leave that I'm going back
to school and he told me that was a bad
idea he said you can do better and make
more money not doing it what's your
major I'm going back for software
engineering yeah well we'll see I may
settle for a quad-core but I mean you
have to understand I'm often time
streaming coding got some browsers up I
have a video encoding it's just one of
those things how long will it take you
to complete the degree depends on how
many hours I put in the degree is Pro is
in such a fact that you can take
competency its competencies
competency-based without so like you can
take tests at any point for almost any
of the courses to test out of the
content if you know it you got your
first job as a developer without degree
yes I got all my jobs as a developer
without a degree I don't have a degree
and also so like I've had this computer
for like four or five years I don't want
to have to get another computer two
years from now because I was like oh man
I should got the eight core so that's
just one of the things is which language
do I like most JavaScript cuz that's
pretty much all i coded although i if we
want to make a distinction I will say I
love typescript are you going to school
so it looks good on paper mostly it's
combination of that it's combination of
it'll make me more confident if I want
to it might be one of those things where
where
my confidence will lead me to more money
and also uh you know just I think it
will pay for itself I'll be done within
a year at the latest and to essentially
make it easier for me to make more money
as a in a management role I I have no
problem getting junior level roles a
senior level or else in that's not gonna
do anything for me I'm just gonna keep
doing that but if I wanna go to
management and I want to get those fat
checks might be might be one of those
things that would help there's you know
that's kind of how I look at it and also
to teach later on when I'm retired so
might as well do it earlier than later I
have the money to do it now I have the
time to do it now I don't have any kids
you know so it's just one of those
things that in time wise now's a good
time to do it if I'm gonna do it
yeah Matt's gonna give me about the
still dreaming of Cote not this last
week because I haven't been coding as
much am I already looking into
management just preparing for the future
man no one's gonna give me a management
role right now but there's no reason you
shouldn't prepare for the future
the guys who prepared so when I think I
am deserving I'll be prepared to take
such roles what's the best way to learn
JavaScript build things god it is like a
million degrees and I have this cat who
is just throwing his body into me
is HTML CSS and JavaScript feels really
enough for an entry-level friend job no
that's why I have seven skills that are
on the top skills you need for a
front-end developer role and then
supplemental skills as well I mean
that's the core that's the core cuz
that's web front-end web development but
there are other things frameworks get so
I'd encourage you to watch that video
and go from there is there any way to
get into a management position without
being developer first at defense there's
a lot of management positions out there
you could do project management you
could do business analysts and just have
be it it depends but if you're trying to
be like a manager of a developers I'd
imagine no I imagine that's gonna be
hard but nothing's impossible but I
imagine it is gonna be hard Oh anybody
where do you stand on net neutrality I
stand that we got screwed over by the
FCC and that it's gonna hurt startups
and it's gonna hurt consumers what's a
day at my current job I am gathering
requirements I am building things I'm
updating things I do a lot of greenfield
development right now where I'm just
starting new projects from the get-go
you didn't get my answer about a tree
house or cold steel I said do both have
I done any projects for college and how
much you don't do projects in college
what you do is algorithms you solve how
rhythms you'll spend two years console
logging out you might get one
or two if you ever get to a web dev Java
course or c-sharp course you might build
something there
yeah ROG it's hard to compete you're
comparing two things they're comparing
apples oranges they're both fruit but
they're not the same type of fruit right
you're talking about a course that
you're buying one time for $15 that is
limited content versus an entire
platform that has interactive tutorials
and videos and they're constantly
updating it so you can't really compare
the two but it's it would be fine to do
both what you
I'm good man I'm a little tired cuz I
was up late at all at a Christmas
holiday party beautiful building man we
have this top floor at work and there's
a fireplace and like a patio fireplace
and then there's a fountain around it
and then there's like it's it's gorgeous
it's right on the port I have a question
for you I have a degree in mathematics
do I still need a CS degree no I mean
honestly degree mathematics is fine you
just need to learn to code at this point
how do you render local images in react
or angular and angular you have to throw
it into a disc you have to fold it you
have to throw it into a certain folder
and they have to import that file into
your application get to throw it into so
what happens is what happens is this
angular what happens is webpack takes
angular you have a folder called assets
that you then you can put your your
content in there whatever and then you
need to import that file into your
component where you're using the image
based off its correct path and then when
you actually call it to use it would be
assets slash that image name and it's
gonna dynamically render this could be
different because I don't I haven't done
it with the angular CLI use custom build
tools but it's going to dynamically
render a UUID for that in place of that
which in reality what you may want is
it's its actual path history count crap
worth the time I believe so
so one of the reasons I got to learn
JavaScript can I prefer a book to you
for JavaScript no not really
say for you fat cat so for you oh my god
I think angular is easier long-term than
for then react although I think both are
great I really do what happened to the
series where you look at people's
portfolio I did that the other day I
don't know if I ever made a series out
of it I think I just answered no do I
enjoy my work I love my work man it's
it's challenging it's fun
I'm compensated well Carolee asked for
more than that I worked with great
people I loved being a software
developer I really do with react you do
more vanilla is that true yes react is
kind of structured in a way in which it
wants you instead of doing like a for
loop you'll map things out like it tries
to have you use more JavaScript within
it Christmas trees everywhere what do
you do on Christmas uh April and I will
we have our presents for ourselves that
we bought under the tree any president
sent to us we already opened because we
have no self-control and then we will
open the presents and set it up around
the house and we will watch home alone -
which is a tradition in the house
fat cat fat cat what am i buying you
some Bitcoin amen
your boys trying to buy a house he ain't
got time to give away money
I'm look at this cat do you know many
cans of food three cats eat today
damn near bankrupt off these little job
jobs
yeah we have dry food down all the time
- you don't want any of that yeah what
back-end technology do you recommend I
recommend you figuring out which one is
most in demand I like using node because
it's just straight up JavaScript I can
get up and going but it's probably not
the best to find jobs I'm juiced a lot
of c-sharp back-end rules but uh then
there's PHP which I hate and I but
there's a lot of jobs for it I have to
admit that there's a lot jaws for PHP
but I hate it it's so
but I recommend c-sharp
have a good one Christ under death all
right guys let's uh let's wrap up this
is a male I should normally go for a
little bit of an hour but um I'm tired I
got order PC got life to live right so I
want to thank everybody for showing up
for the Saturday weekend live streams
I'll do my best to try and keep out
puttin out videos if you want to support
me you can by joining patreon patreon
comm slash coding tutorials 360 you of
course can watch the videos like
subscribe to share them it's one of the
best things that you can do is share
video it helps me out a ton and exposes
new people to the channel and of course
you can buy the courses that I have
there's descriptions and links for all
that I appreciate you all I hope that
you all are having a wonderful weekend I
am going to get back to my grind and
just try and keep on keeping on I look
forward to hopefully doing some free
