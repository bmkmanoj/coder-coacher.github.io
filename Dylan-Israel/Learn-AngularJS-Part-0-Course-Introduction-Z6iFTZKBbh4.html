first attempt at a course it's
completely free I have no plans on ever
charging for this I'm simply calling it
a course because I want feedback if in
case I ever do make a real course on
udemy or something like that what we'll
be learning in this is angularjs version
1 if you're not familiar with angular
it's a very popular web development
framework that people use all the time I
use it I'm angularjs developer at work
and I use on daily basis I love it I'm a
huge fan of it and it's there's really
only other one other thing competing
with it which is reaction which it's
also great but I find react to be a
little bit more complicated than it
needs to be but my understanding is
limited but back to the course so what
we'll be doing is about six to eight
videos that will cover about six
projects that are going to be duplicates
of free code camps project so be able to
kill two birds with one stone you get
your front-end developer certificate
from them as well as finish up as well
as learn English a yes now I recommend
you have a basic understanding of HTML
and CSS and JavaScript I'm going to do
the projects and everyone's going to be
slightly different so that we cover
multiple topics they're designed to be
done in order at the end you should have
about six projects that you can put in
your portfolio to showcase your
angularjs knowledge and hopefully get
you yourself an internship or a junior
level dev roll along with you know your
additional portfolio your additional
skills now I hope you guys enjoy this
will be using additional frameworks that
I think are important bootstrap being
one of them and angular material being
another one of them so as always guys
thanks for watching this is just
basically part 0 introduction so you
know what the course is about and what
to expect I hope you enjoy it I worked
hard on it and I think it will provide a
lot of value for those of you looking to
learn angularjs and in a simplified
manner but as always thanks for watching
