talk to you about site 1-2-3 site 1-2-3
is probably the easiest and most unique
website builder I've ever come across
I've looked at quite a few over the
years and I've done web content
management and I really like it but I
think the best way to really see how
great it is if you want to maybe create
a portfolio start your own brand have a
small business is that even if you're
bad at web design and web development
they make it so easy that you can't
really delete your whole site as the
first movie so web development I've had
to fix so many people's sites that
they've accidentally deleted that's
pretty hysterical all you have to do to
create an account is you can link it up
with your Google I already have one made
but we're going to go ahead and create
something from scratch so you can see I
have some of these test sites let me
show you how easy it is to actually
create a brand new web site and how
great it looks just from the get-go so
you're going to click this I'm going to
go technology because uh and you see
right here they have a portfolio
creative arts blog and uh latina
league's other as well and all these are
customizable but if you really just want
to hit the ground running site one two
three it's great about that I'm gonna go
for technology because I think it's the
most coding related one so let's say I
wanted to create I've had I've talked
about those sort of starting up ideas
I've had about creating video
documentation so I thought I'd create a
video video Doc's j/s will call that
video docs j/s slogan why do Docs when
you can do video and I'm going to skip
my address for the time being and my
contact and videos are better than Docs
and make more sense video Doc's j/s calm
baby and then of course you can use
English this is kind of cool as well
because half my audience is or half my
audience the lowness is a non American
not United States but the whole world
like 99% of population is in English but
doesn't speak German France whatever it
is they got your language that's the
point so you can do any language you
want tons and tons of languages right
I know Irish was a language that's
reading interesting all right so let's
so let's start building our site and
you'll see how easy is we always did was
put in some basic information chose the
language that we want and it will build
us an entire site that we can then
customize from there and one of the one
of the main questions I get when
building sites for clients and and
things like that is is it responsive
because that seems to be the number one
concern because Google puts your site
higher if it's responsive in the search
algorithm and you'll see we can walk
through the tour real quick this will
take us to the home page this will take
us to the individual pages this will be
more design and keep in mind this
there's no coding or like design skills
needed to have it all fleshed out for
you various templates very things where
you just click and see it instantly see
how the device looks at different
resolutions so and then of course
publish let's end our tour but let's
check out real quick let's see what it
looks like on it on a tablet right so
you do a mobile and you'll see you'll
see this is what it's going to look like
on the phone you just scroll on through
right scroll on through see every little
piece and this is our site instantly we
made the site in like two minutes pretty
great and you want to go okay let's
change the homepage without image you
can kind of jump around play with it you
go okay that's no image you have YouTube
a video let's go back to the fullscreen
you can go down to tablet as well so
various sites and it works in all sizes
right we're going to go back to desktop
now we'll go back to design and you can
start seeing we can start playing around
with this however we want so there's
various layouts maybe we just want this
layout right maybe we like maybe this is
a solid we like we just want to play
with the menu or we like this layout
we can play with the menu like this
there's so many there's nine that's just
the layout right
then you have the style so we can now
change the color schemes
I'm really bad with color so this is you
can see right here we change
blue so now things are blue if you like
rounded corners slightly rounded you
know what type of header do you like
clean with solid color if all these
options might Mike one of my more
favorite ones is Wingo the home page is
if you're youtuber you have your YouTube
or Vimeo link right so you just embed a
YouTube video directly into the page of
your home page so you have this cool
kind of background running video here
with you and you can change the title
the slogan SiC same thing going on here
right where we have the video going or
we going to go for a different theme
like so where we have a video right here
going over our video which is kind of
interesting but let's let's do with just
one image right you're changing images
so you have your product marketing that
you're doing I
I love it and say we want to change the
name it's as easy as just putting it in
um and will you know let's say I want to
want you to make a new website for my
channel I could do coding tutorials 360
if you want to upload your logo you can
just show you how easy it is go find my
logo take one second here
you see our logo is right here we've
changed the name so great I I really do
like it and you can go ahead and change
the the pages this easy just by editing
and swapping it out now I hope you guys
check them out I really like them I plan
on using it for my next big side project
which I'll announced shortly an upcoming
video and I'll actually show you that
site I make with site one two three
