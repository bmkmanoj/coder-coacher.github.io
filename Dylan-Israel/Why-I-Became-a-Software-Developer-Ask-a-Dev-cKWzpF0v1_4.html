when I was a CS grad i chose computer
science for one and why i wanted to be a
software developer what attracted me to
the field and what were the the relevant
in what was the relevant information
that led me in that direction
I want to thank Deb Mountain for
sponsoring this video if you're
interested in web development iOS
development user experience design
software QA or the new hotness known as
sale force development that's actually a
really good thing to look into guys do a
little bit of research you'll find how
awesome it is that they're actually
offering a sales sales force development
role or if you check that out but a cool
thing about that mountain they include
housing in their tuition so you can get
up and go at anyone there are four
locations and you get to live in a house
full of other bootcamp attendees so it's
really just I think will help your
learning process so much so go ahead and
check them out Deb Mountain comm if
you're interested in that so there's two
things I want this video to kind of get
across at the end of it one that not
everyone is like there's this sort of
common misconception that developers
people who are working towards me and
developers think they're at disadvantage
because they're going against people who
have been you know building websites or
applications since they were like 10 and
it's just not the case and then to sort
of evaluate what it is that you're
looking for in your life and what how I
came to the decision that software was
right for me so the first part of that
is I as a child didn't really build
websites I've built maybe one growing up
two tops and I didn't touch it for about
a decade right so that he'll be good to
died and it wasn't until I was about 20
I started going to school and kind of
seeing things and I wouldn't actually
built
I went code anything till about my
fourth year in college and I mind you
I'm going back and forth a little bit
and changing my major a ton and I
finally had to make the decision of
actually choosing a major I couldn't
jump around and and I ended up deciding
that computer science was the best best
route for me and part of the reason for
that is and I by the way I had this same
misconception too because I was in the
class with at this point I'm like 25 26
I'm in class with you know 20 year-olds
who are getting probably better grades
than I am and seem to know a lot more
than I do and I'm looking at their code
it's beautiful mine's this bootleg
busted code that is embarrassing to show
off but it works I think it works that's
that that was really what I was going
for it works and I had this
misconception that you know these these
younger gentlemen and ladies were the
old man they they just must have been
coding for it forever it's not the case
right it just isn't sometimes it's just
something we tell ourselves that you
know I have people who think I've been
coding for years like years upon years I
I have been writing code for about four
years tops maybe five tops and I've been
doing it professionally for a year and a
half so take that with a grain of salt
so what but one of the reasons I chose
computer science when I was in school
was after having bounced around between
journalism business accounting
firefighting you know fire fire tech I
really was a specific name and even
going and getting like my EMT
certification and my my um dealers
license uh my drugs but like casino
tillich poker your license so I was kind
of all over the place you know my family
was like hey you need to kind of choose
on something and so I did what I thought
was an educated decision I kind of
looked at the market I said what where
all the jobs and but by the way this is
before I started CS degree and
everything like that
I have no I haven't coded anything a day
in my life at this point other than a
HTML CSS page when I was 10 and I just
looked at the market I said well what's
the best degree and every stat I would
say was computer science science so I
said okay why did they say that well the
three main factors that I could see was
one that they get paid a lot right so
we're always looking for the money right
and but you have to be careful
because just because it pays a lot
doesn't mean it's the best job now it's
one of the factors the the kind of thing
the the sort of example I throw out is
that there are nuclear engineers that
make a ton but how many nuclear engineer
jobs are there right and so I'm sure I'm
sure the ones that are working are
making a ton of money but it's kind of
probably pretty hard to get that so you
have to kind of weigh the options so you
have to say okay well what makes a lot
of money
what what has a lot of jobs and what is
going to continue to grow just cuz today
there's a lot of jobs what about four
years from now when I graduate and I
have to be a you know an entry-level
scrub and I'm I'm just trying to break
into the field and get that get that
experience so yeah those were the things
you said I looked at and everything
pointed to computer science and
technology and and software and that was
what led me down to the computer science
route and I I bring this up not to just
talk about my past or anything but
because there is this misconception that
developers are out there who have
decades of experience and just happened
to fall into the role and it's it's not
really realistic and I encourage you to
do the same sort of research about what
it is that you're trying to accomplish
in software and development and and go
from there and it wasn't a something I
even knew that I was going to like I'm a
very practical person and I like the
practical aspects of how I made my
decision about what to study it turns
out that I actually really hated
studying computer science but I like the
programming aspect of it the little bit
that you do in school and when I finally
decided to be a developer and study web
development on my own that was when I
fell in love with there right that was
when I was just like oh man I'm digging
this I'm working on this stuff I'm
building something when I first saw a
project being built that was when I fell
in love with it it was never in school
it was never when I was doing courses
none of that it was when I was building
my own stuff and having fun doing it
that I fell in love with day and that
was kind of what made me know that this
career was for me I wasn't certain I
wasn't really even thinking about it all
day enough I think perhaps oftentimes
when you're in school you're just so
stressed out so
tired in my case very hungry like
literally about that you are you just
not even thinking about oh man what am I
gonna enjoy this job just like yo am I
gonna keep these lights on we got to get
done with this stuff so but I digress
what I'm trying to say is that when you
are looking for roles I think that that
that's how I decided on what was a good
fit for me and oftentimes we're so
worried about oh my god am I gonna have
is this gonna be is am I gonna love this
am I gonna hate this and you really
won't know until you do it I wish I
could tell you that you'll love being a
developer I could tell you that I love
being a developer and I love it because
I can it's something I can do outside of
work is something I do at work and today
it's like today on the weekend I I have
a rule on the weekends that I don't code
more than eight hours anymore on the
weekend so per day by the way that's
sixteen hours on the weekend so I I have
to I have to have that rule that's how
much I love to do it otherwise I kind of
burn myself out and I need to relax a
little bit before I go back into the
office on Monday and I'm not maybe as
rejuvenated and refreshed as I as I want
to be so no but everyone everyone is
different but I didn't really know that
I was going to like it I encourage you
to not fear the unknown sort of just
accept the fact that it's unknown and
and be willing to with your degree with
your with your skillset whatever it is
just go and give it a shot if you don't
like it after a year there's always
plenty of other careers that you can go
and try it out but at least when you
decide to not like it and you say you
know what man I understand that there's
high job growth and the money's good and
there's lots of jobs but I after after
putting some time into it I thought I
was gonna like it I just don't that's
completely understandable and I
encourage you to take the same process
of thought when you go to look for what
may be your next opportunity is going to
be for you where you say how much time
is it going to take to invest how much
energy is it going to take what is how
many jobs are there what's it pay
because these are all these are all
things that are important and sometimes
people when you talk about money
they they they always say money you know
money isn't everything and no one's
saying it is everything but it is
something to consider right I'm much
happier now that I have food in the
fridge than when I didn't when I don't
have to stress about rent and when I was
stressing about Brent and I had a
paycheck that was the rent check you and
me we're like that was the check that
95% of its going to rent so there these
are things to consider right um the the
joke I say every now and again is money
doesn't make you happy but poverty
definitely makes you sad and so that I
say this because I want you guys to
consider this in your life the the
number one and two things that marriages
and relationships break up for is one
adultery keep yourself to yourself in
your significant other and to money so
those are the number one and number two
and that I'm not sure they might even be
in the reverse order I'd have to do a
little bit more research on it but so it
is something to keep in mind as you're
going out there but I didn't always want
to be a software developer we're going
in oh we're going in some directions
today I I didn't always want to be a
developer I simply chose it because I
thought it was a good hobby and I
thought or a good career and it turned
out to be my favorite hobby of all time
and it turned out to be something that I
love doing partially because of the
challenging nature of it partially
because you get to use it outside of
work which is something that you don't
get to use in a lot of fields you always
have to you know how many times do you
really get to have a skill set that you
can build projects in I I released a
course the other week and I'm building
another one I'm building projects show
people to educate people on this and I'm
always learning myself right there's so
much to learn and sort of the that was
really what what excites me about it now
you know all the all the practical stuff
is I always have a job or they're you
know or I most likely will always have a
job and the money will most likely
always be you know decent those are all
great things and what I'm excited about
is that I enjoy doing it I enjoy loving
it so I wasn't one of those people that
fell into
you know I started at 12 because my
father was a developer or my mother was
a developer my mom's a nurse and my my
dad's retired and he was a writer and a
teacher and I had nothing to do with
development and I don't have any anybody
in the family who ever introduced me to
computers or anything like that the
closest I got to computers was playing
Starcraft and Warcraft and World of
Warcraft as a kid right and I just chose
software development because it seemed
like a good field and I fell in love
with it when I went to web development
and I enjoy building things so when
you're looking for your career keep that
in mind and also don't be afraid that
you don't know if you're gonna love it
or not because even if you don't you're
gonna you know it's about the journey
most of the time when it comes to this
stuff but make make educated decisions
be willing to take a leap of faith in
whatever you do and work hard at it and
you'll be successful so that's that's
today's video thank you so much for
