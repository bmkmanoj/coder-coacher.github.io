do a quick shout out to our boy Paul
before our video starts who sent me this
wonderful program red shirt ever your
huge nerds like me and you love
like this you can get it like you can
buy your own in description down below
so thanks to Paul so yes I am a
programmer no I don't care about your
app ideas because I know we've all been
there and on the back in case it's not
familiar is enough it says not even for
equity God knows we've all been there
but thank you to fall for sending me the
shirt I love it man I appreciate it if
you want to get your own you can do in
the description I hope you enjoy this
very unique interview April I did
alright guys so I've been a little busy
I haven't had a chance to interview a
developer in the one I did we're waiting
on some things to finish it up so in
this week behind the code we decide you
to a little different so April my
girlfriend is actually going to
interview me and ask questions relating
the code and maybe some personal stuff
for we actually haven't discussed what
it is I hit her with this this idea on
our way to go pick up dessert like 10
minutes ago alright so we got baby okay
so um try and give us why you code um
why factors before on my livestreams
usually I riginal II got into the
software when I drink coding in college
and I was learning java I really
actually hated it and I really kind of
killed coating for me but I knew that it
was a great career choice and I was I
kept on trying to code things I started
my channel is a way to learn and help me
get a developer job but I really fell in
love with web development and that's why
I ml web developer and I started to
focus a min on JavaScript specifically
through sites like free code camp but
why I really code because I don't like
being poor hey
can we get some money size of the visit
oh yeah I uh I was sick of being broke
and I've talked about a couple times
where you know we my mom had bought us
groceries there's one very specific time
in April eyes lives where we we spent
our last like five dollars on a burrito
that we ate and with spicy remember that
you're crying I didn't la good nice
day is bought hey big here at PG all
right it was very spicy and I we've
suffered through it together to eat it
another time was when we're at costco
and i couldn't afford to buy any
underwear and like we were spending last
few bucks on food and that was kind of
time where it was enough is enough and i
decided to stop going to school and take
a job and work myself up from there and
that was a year year and half ago yep
year and a half ago ok so my next
question is to follow up to that
question for those who struggle to
capture any type of clothing or
developing like we understand that you
know a portion of pay is a good
motivator for you but what about for
those who wear pay isn't really it how
do they find their dream jobs and coding
i define their dream job in coding I
think it takes a little bit of research
and a little bit of diving in so I
always say that there's three different
paths there's the self-taught tat
there's the college pass and there's a
boot camp at now depending on what you
do self-taught you can be learning
multiples of languages doing whatever
you kind of do like a buffet sampler
languages you do enterprise applications
with Java that would be similar to the
College path you're really especially
Cal State I believe Java and Python yeah
but what can you do with those me it's
like give us a bigger picture
what those coatings can do because let's
say that someone has a really great app
idea I want to see it you know come to
life or less dating how it was really
great web or like where are those types
of substantial things that they can
create using coding okay so the first
and foremost is web applications what I
do for for a living if you have an idea
for a website or a web application and
that could be something like like
twitter twitter is a web application you
have a social media that you think
you're like look I want to you know Matt
and I have joked about making a twitch
twitch live streaming where it we call
it twitch titty streamers and it's
nothing but like webcam chicks with
their boobs out like playing games up
that is literally so let me joked about
but if we want to say we were serious
about that if we wanted to go that we
have to have web applications now if we
have a mobile app and we want to build
mobile applications we would have to
learn the languages that that is well
that would be Android or java android
works off java and then there's iOS
which i believe that c sharp or c++ i'm
niall developer or the language Swift so
these would be the languages you just
have to kind of think it through what is
that I'm trying to make and it could be
both right so there's a lot of free
resources for web development because
it's on the internet it's much income
versus is all so it's a lot to be here
to do and what development is really
really hot right now so you really have
to think it through what is it you want
to make and what is it you want to do
with it right and how if that's the case
let's say that if someone who wanted to
use some type of programming to aid
something in like a space program or
something on Mars or anything like that
how would they go about researching
something that expensive what do you
mean by expensive well what expensive
like how does someone go about
researching what needs what in what
particular job let's say that someone
wants to be an astronaut but doesn't
want to be national into the point where
they don't want to have to
a thorough physical clouds but they want
to be part of that so here how do they
find a path and a career that they want
your conscience gotcha so the great
thing about software is every company
needs someone that almost every large
company is going to have a developer of
some type whether it's a web developer
whether it's someone managing the
database and analytics whether it's
somebody building an app for that
company so it really depends but they
say you want to get into a set industry
me I'm the type of guy I'm very open to
almost any company because I'm there to
code there are more companies I'd be
attract you I'd love to work with the
social media company because of my
interest in YouTube sorry thrown down
but if you're interested in space you
need to start applying for internships
at you know with these companies just
like northrop grumman would be an
example of an engineering company that
hires developers that works with you
know large government contract companies
so applying for internships is great
maybe turning and there's the other ways
right where you could like start an
engineering channel or start a software
channel you do it start a blog you
something do something a little outside
the box where you're showing your
passion for this field start
volunteering in that field I've
volunteered through code.org in the past
just two months ago to forget that on
the resume trying to getting these
little baby steps there while still
learning software to show your interest
in it when you show interest as a
candidate to be selected and it makes
you stand out a little bit that's that's
really what your job is as someone who's
trying to be a junior in phila junior
level role with no resume experience
it's what can I get on my resume in the
meantime so that when i'm applying with
everybody else they go oh but this guy
did this also so i really think he would
really like the role be perfect court
okay so i think you hit on a key point
about talking about the passion that you
were expressing right there what happens
when someone doesn't have or is just
like I wouldn't say in the beginning but
let's say
maybe like a mediocre start we're okay
as they've listened to you talk they're
starting a blog or they starting
something and then they want to apply
for an internship now on that internship
I've looked through many of them and
which say that the requirement is that
they're either a junior or sophomore in
some type of science-based career and
that they don't want anyone you know how
do you approach something where you're
not qualified according to what they
want so this basically sounds like not
meeting job requirements or internship
requirements now there are employers who
absolutely will not bend their their
rules but for the most part when it
comes to job requirements especially in
software because it's in such a high
demand is there more willing to be
lenient so that the excuse that hey
we're only looking for juniors or
sophomores or people who wish degrees
it's not a valid excuse I have just
finished my degree and i'm looking to
going back recently and I'm a fully
employed salaried web developer making
decent money now this can apply to
internships as well there are those
companies that look we only hire this
type of person but that's why it's so
important that your LinkedIn and your
resume showcase your projects and your
skills and how you're standing off
because when they look at this guy say
look you know he's got 12 projects in
the technologies we're looking for
meanwhile all these other guys who
worked in maybe Java or C++ or Python
that isn't even the technologies they're
working with but they do have their
degrees or they may you're more likely
to be pictures at the end of days I want
someone who can hit the ground running
and thing goes for internships there's
no harm in applying it's just a little
bit of time so if you if you can get
your resume to look as perfect as
possible go ahead and apply I apply to
jobs or I would apply to jobs and I
encourage people apply jobs where you
mean about sixty to seventy percent of
the requirement if you if you're doing
that you're probably in the top 10% of
candidate
remember it um kind of coming away from
jobs and other things that we've been
discussing what do you think the most
important thing is like rule number one
for learning code rule number one is
well there's a couple girls let's go
over the roof well number one rule
number one is code every day that's rule
number one hands down coat every day be
involved in the community is rule number
two and what I mean by that is you guys
not necessarily start a blog or a
youtube channel or anything like that
but in be part go to meet up to go to
hackathons be part of Facebook groups
like the wonderful code tech and
caffeine our official facebook group
okay ah so oh but the idea being that we
need to round yourself by people who
like the code not only do you find
people to help you learn and resources
but you also keep yourself on track
right so it's like um it's like when
you're in school if you're hanging
around the kids always smoking pot
versus the kids who are studying you're
more likely to smoke pot and stop study
less and it kind of goes the same for
life right if all your friends are the
guys who work out all the time or fit
you're more likely to say you know what
maybe I should work out today and send
those Cody if you're surrounding
yourself with reminders of how you need
to code daily and how you need to get
better and what your goal is right so
set its goal and then put your
surroundings around it so that you have
things supporting you and it's always on
your mind I think some good ways of
reminding yourself to code are putting
notes in the refrigerator thank you that
as a but
all right like always remind yourself
boys put it a reminder where you look
them up it's like a weight yeah yeah but
it'll make an outfit yeah you don't be
like this I like put pictures of you
know things like a story yeah okay and
what are there were some things that we
were talking about I'm pretty sure like
a couple of days ago where I would you
were trying to decide or what you were
telling me was that you should always
learn the new wigs type of compass out
like the newest version why is that and
what if a company doesn't use the newest
pipe and you know the name is type like
how you have that conversation yeah
definitely so um what it labels
referring to is learning new frameworks
a new library so instead of learning
Jake court spend your time learning
jquery or something a little outdated
you spend your time like filling angular
1 you learn angular 2 and instead of
learning Jake for you maybe you learn to
react and so what I what I meant by that
is that when you are learning the things
that are fresh and new not only does it
typically pay very well because less
people have taken the time to learn it
because there's but it's been out a lot
less time it's newer the people who are
employed developers have been working in
the same technologies for years so
you're going to have a little bit less
competition you're not compete but if
you go into an older technology lets a
PHP for instance where you have
developers who have been working in PHP
for 15 years you know 15 years or resume
experience in PHP or five let's just say
five plus you're good you're going
against a lot more competition but if
you learn the newer stuff not only is it
going to be great for you because you're
you know angular 2 for instance came out
four or five months ago if you started
four or five months ago when the beta
ended you're probably in the top 10% of
can you're doing you're looking
really good and you're not going against
too many people so you put yourself in a
position where you know the newer stuff
and that's when companies are looking at
start and they're looking for those
skills they're having to choose from a
less of a pool of canvas what happens if
you meet an employer who says oh well we
don't use that version you know our
version how do you convince the employer
that your new version is better so you
don't necessarily you're not necessarily
going to convince them but the employer
may say look we used version to you know
version 1 and depending on the library
or framework typically it's not a
massive upgrade now that's different in
angular 2 which the two main web web
language what's libraries are angular
and react so in terms of angular angular
1 from angular 2 is completely different
so it's like learning something
brand-new for about 75% of it so that's
a little bit unique but usually when you
go from one version of a library to a
new version it's not as dramatic as a
change so it's mainly a syntactic thing
certain functions of broken and you need
to change that certain things have been
added and you need to know that it
formats slightly different it's the
parameters are different it got more
complex but it's going to send the
foundation it's usually all right
angular 1 for singular to it slightly
different do you think answer my
questions explain to me your question
let's say you're having a conversation
with your employer and he's going over
the list of things that you know you're
saying that because you know the new
stuff is going to sell itself okay yeah
so you're not necessarily going to
convince a company that has already
started a massive project hey you know
that code you wrote that let's
rewrite it no that may not happen but if
you're new on a project for instance of
starting a new application you may say I
know we just worked in angular 1 all
this time but let me tell you about the
benefits of angular to your
premature architecture senior dads or
the people in management to make these
decisions and say angular 2 they're like
well all are definitely Mueller one
grannies are senior people so they can
learn things but do we want to go down
this route this is the benefits of
angular 2 or this is the benefits of
react this is what it can do for you
just way better like let yesterday
learning curves like me killer 2 allows
you to do SEO better SEO because it does
server-side rendering first client side
as angular 1 does it also allows for
better route so there's our sinks in
these when they do these upgrades they
just don't do it because they're bored
there's usually benefits but the
downside is there's a learning curve and
so you have to weigh the pros and the
cons for future employers now as a
junior def should you show up and be
like yo man use my probably not you
should be dynamic enough as a developer
that you need you can say hey you know
what I don't know that version but I'm
willing to learn it at work and awkward
