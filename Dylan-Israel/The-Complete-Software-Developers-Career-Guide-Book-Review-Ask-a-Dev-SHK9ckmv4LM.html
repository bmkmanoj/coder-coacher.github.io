reading the complete software developers
career guide by John Sloan Meza and I
highly recommend you read it there'll be
a link in the description where you can
get it and help me out and presumably
John in the process but I'm gonna talk a
little bit about I'm going to review the
book in this video as well let's talk
about why I think this is a must read
for anyone interested in software
development or that works in the
industry currently
guys just want to do a quick shout out
to my JavaScript 360 part 1 course it's
got almost a five-star on it and seven
hours of content I still go over a
little bit of get and mark down
basically introduces you to everything
JavaScript when it comes to the logic
and the overview of it and so in seven
half hours of content I've been having a
couple videos to it here or there but if
you're interested in it there is a link
in the description below where you can
get it for real cheap
so before you kind of review a book you
have to really talk about who that book
is for right especially a book like this
where it's a soft skills technical book
is how I would define it and so you have
something like the complete you see this
complete this book is written in such a
way that in mind you it's 800 pages with
five main sections so you're talking
about about 150 200 and about 180 pages
math is hard of content for each section
so depending on where you are in your
career it may have some relevant content
for you and having read through this I
would definitely agree that that's the
case so that the five sections are
getting started as a software developer
giving a job as a software developers
number two what you need to know about
software developments number three
working as a software developer in
advancing your career and I will say as
somebody who already works as a software
developer I'm coming up on about two
years of experience I have found this
book I wish I found this much sooner in
my career and actually spent the 20
bucks or so to go and read it and and
learn a few things so who is just
looking not for the the person on the
Amazon review who complained that it was
800 pages this book is not for you the
reason for it is a lot of what's in here
is knowledge insight but the suggestions
on how to get a job how to get started
those first two sections although the
advice is amazing and immaculately
descriptive on how to succeed is hard
work and so if you're complaining about
having to read an 800-page book in your
career path
where
you want you say you want to be a
software developer but 800 pages is too
much for you to read I understand not
wanting a book but having the the the
more the better right it's it's like
saying that you like a YouTube channel
but you don't like that they have 900
videos right
do you like the content then why don't
you like the video so it's not so they
can't be complaining but this if the
hardest thing for you to do in your
career will not be reading this book
this book is written in such a way that
it is a very very easy read I found
myself reading a hundred pages at a time
sometimes whereas just sitting there
fully enjoying it you can almost it is
written in a way where you can almost
hear John talking is a very personal
book as personalized I think a book like
this can get where the stories are
shared moments you know he's giving you
know excellent examples from his
professional career as to why he
believes these things you know it's
written as a infotainment book really
and it is very entertaining for you
interested in software like when my
mother who is a nurse and barely used as
a computer find entertain you know but
should you as a software developer who
are aspiring software developer find it
very entertaining absolutely and the
examples that he gets on a more specific
topic of how to get a job are some of
the best the best examples I have ever
heard and unique are they hard work
absolutely will it take time energy and
effort yes but will they succeed I have
no doubt and he reminded me of the
conversation I had with John where I
interviewed him like two years ago on
the channel right when I was getting
started right and I is asking about
having a job you know and his advice was
you know the summarize to go in the back
door so many people are going in the
front door you go in the back door and
we talked a little about what that means
in here he goes into a lot of detail
about not only what that means but what
are the ways to the back door right and
I found a very very enlightening even
how are you having a job because I could
see myself say I wanted to jump in
blockchain right I've talked about that
a couple times how I might you
use those same techniques to make that
jump now the third section which is what
you need to know about being a software
developer are about software development
is a wonderful example of trying to
answer black great questions in black
and white while still acknowledging that
they are great questions so what I mean
by that well there's a lot of subjects
that are universal when it comes to
software development and getting started
and you know talking about pull requests
talking about version control talking
about programming language the front end
the back end the you know version
control UI UX talking about all the
various categories and sub-categories to
let you know what exists what's working
and what you know John's recommendations
are four there and he does a lot of same
things that I do in in videos where I'm
like look I'm gonna try to answer this
question that has no real answer you
know how many hours a day should you
code what's the number right people
always want black and white answers in a
in in life there are very few black and
white answers to very great questions
right how many hours a day should you
code could be a different you know what
define coding right yeah so John takes
on this task in this third section of
defining what is the right programming
language for you how are you going to
accomplish that and you know what is
going to be the path laid in front of
you as well let's just introduce you to
a ton of stuff one of the hardest things
about getting started as a developer is
not knowing want to know right not
knowing about code reviews right I you
know code reviews were like a real big
thing and tell us the developer and you
know a lot of not knowing the
communication and interpersonal skills
and how that's gonna help affect you in
the workplace and things like that so
this third section is about all those
things that you may or may not know it's
some of it will be a refresher some of
it will be be new but it's what what its
real goal here is to introduce you to a
ton of topics that maybe some you've
learned maybe some of you have it and
and while trying to give
the best black and white answers about
some of these as as you can but
unfortunately you know John even in the
book will say look this is just my
opinion you know technology is changing
all the time
and but as of Cork the the book as at
its core it's designed to be written in
such a way that we're not going to say
look you gotta learn JavaScript what
we're gonna say is that you need to keep
your ear to the ground these are the you
know the core object oriented languages
and you'll be able to transition between
it and sort of make this book a timeless
book where you know 20 years from now
it's still gonna be relevant because of
the way that is written I think he did a
very good job in this section to answer
those great questions in as
black-and-white as he could so the final
two sections of the book are really what
spoke to me the most right the working
as a software developer and advancing
your career because that's where I'm at
I'm a developer I'm working as a
developer so they tell me
no uh they sent as long as I keep
cutting the checks and call me whatever
they want no uh-uh oh yeah so I'm
working as a developer and I'm trying to
advance my career right I I think this
these are things that I am motivated by
right I want to make sure I'm a better
developer every year and I want to make
sure that I'm compensated fairly and
that I can have a nice life right and so
these were the sections that really
spoke to me and I found it very
enlightening so working as software
developer covered a lot it covered not
only what you'd actually be doing but
how to play the game right it's kind of
sad it's sad where we I find it sad but
I understand the reality of the world
where you know what to do when one of
your co-workers isn't pulling their
weight what to do when you know you have
a boss who is you know abusive or or you
know that you don't mesh well with and
how that can be handled and so there's a
lot of that as well as the more like
okay well you know how should you answer
pull requests how should you
you know coat do code reviews how should
you pair a program and all these sort of
topic Orion things and guides on how to
you know - page guides on how to handle
the
specific subject matter so I found that
very enlightening so one of the things
I've recently used I mind you one thing
when it comes to reading books like
these it's not just to read and forget
it
really what I try and do whenever I
finish like a book this size was just
very rarely like I might do a book a
year but this year I have 5 to 10 books
lined up and I finished this book in a
month exactly a month yesterday so that
was my goal
finish it in a month and I have another
book lined up and I'll do a book review
for that later on but but my goal when I
read something like this is to take five
things away and implement them in my
career you know sometimes it's only one
you can't help that right as you can
read more and more soft skill books but
for this very first book is five things
so one of the things that I taken away
from it is how to handle unprofessional
people and there's a section about that
and I found it very helpful as it's
something that I've had to deal with in
recent times with certain individuals
and in the past I had to deal with it
and I didn't really handle it the way
that in the better way so in the past
set of other workplaces so I found that
very helpful I also found you know it
even goes in detail about when it comes
to advance your career at the proper way
to address you know Dress for Success
right it's kind of a silly saying but it
is very helpful personal branding how
important that is how to get started and
how not only to just be a developer but
how to become a developer with authority
right that authority is really where
it's it's at you makes a very good
analogy too because a lot of times
personal branding can be considered you
know marketing and it seems a little bit
a right a little bit some people
especially older developers may not like
that but he really makes the argument of
how when you're advancing your career
that your personal brand it's not really
so much it's you it's a multiplier right
it's a multiplier of your success is
very helpful in that aspect so I found
this book completely eye-opening at
times I found just
reviewing the sections even though I was
in that part of my career has already
had a job I found I learned something in
every one of these sections of this book
I would recommend that if you are
getting started you definitely read it
if you're in your career and if you've
already you know you're already a senior
dev I think I think this is a book that
you should just read through at least
one time in your career and try to try
to take it with all with a with the open
open mind right where you know what let
me see if some of this stuff works and
stick to it right really what you need
to do whenever you read a self-help or a
soft skills book is you need to apply it
you know don't just don't read it and
forget it right that's just words right
actions are what will help you in your
career and in your life and so I'm
taking a few of the things in here and
I'm I'm acting on them and I have no
doubt that they will help me in my
career so that's my book review of the
complete software developers career
guide by John Shawne mess aka simple
programmer but not it any more I don't
