in code fight to the intro sort by
height this is a an interesting one
essentially what we are our task to do
is we have these negative 1 values and
then we have other values and the other
values need to be sorted numerically
while not moving the negative 1 values
in that index spot the way that I did it
was I created a second array I then
filtered out the negative 1 values and
then I sorted the remaining values of
150 190 160 180 I sorted it and then I
did a for loop which I kept track of
what index we were on and I would inject
that number into that spot and then
you'd be good to go so then let's get
started by creating our duplicate array
and just call our a - I started equal to
a we're then going to filter out the
negative ones over a two and disorients
I'm just sorry to filter and in here we
are going to have what if we can do
typescript in here can we do tests for
it oh yeah right - element so here is
our filter and then we're just going to
have if X is not equal to negative 1
excuse me elements element is not equal
negative well I really called it X but
typically you would use element in here
me so if it's not equal to negative what
we just want to return that element and
before we sort it we can go ahead and
piece by piece as I normally would just
make sure it's doing what we want it to
do so it's go ahead and run my test
you'll see our output is 150 190 okay
cool so we ignore the negative ones now
all we have to do is sort it numerically
you use the array function sort
and in here we are going to take in a
comma B and this standard convention and
then in our source we just want to
return a minus B and I will sort it
numerically and we'll run our code and
you'll see 150 160 170 180 and 190 cool
so what do we do next well what I did
was I created an index valve that kind
of kept track of what index we are on in
array 2 to inject into our original a
and then we just override it those
values we check to say hey is it a
negative 1 value no cool go ahead and
take one out of a ray too so let's go
ahead and create our index l RRA
this is VAR index I'll set it equal here
and then we will have a thing about a
different way of doing this like I
always do this lending videos thinking
of a different way of solving the
problem in animes video try to execute
it and then have to record the video
game we're not doing it this summer this
isn't a bucket we're doing it live not
bucket we're doing it recorded the right
way so if a li is not equal to now a
again is our original array if a F is
not equal to negative one meaning it's a
value that we can replace go ahead and
set that index value to the original
value and to the sorted value choose me
in our sorted filter array to index L
and then go ahead and increase index L
by one because next time we do it we
want it to be the most current value so
we're and then here I'll just do a tune
just return a and we are done let's go
to submit make sure cool so let's go
over the logic one more time we get an
array of all the values that are not
negative one and we sort it we keep
track of what value we're on with this
index of variable and then we iterate
through the entire array that hasn't
been sorted and if it's not a negative
one we can replace the value so we go
ahead and we replace it with whatever
the sorted value is here we increment by
ones that we continue sorting by the
correct value then we return the array a
pretty fun one there's probably a couple
different ways you can go about this as
with most of these this is just the way
that I solve it in the most clip in the
clearest way that I usually solve things
in whatever comes up first but that's
always guys thank you so much for
watching the video I look forward to you
sharing your solutions in the comments
below four people are trying to learn
like myself as well as others and don't
forget to support me on patreon comm /

group code tech and caffeine all those
links are in the description below I'll
see you guys in the next video
thank you so much for watching hey guys
thanks for watching the video special
thanks to our sponsors dev Mountain if
you look for a coding boot camp where
tuition and housing is included
definitely check them out
appreciate it and I'll see you guys in
the next video
