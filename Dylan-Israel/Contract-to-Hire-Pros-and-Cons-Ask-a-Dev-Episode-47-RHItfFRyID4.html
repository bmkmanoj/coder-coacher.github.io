talking about the pros and the cons of
contract to hire if you're not familiar
with what that is it's essentially you
get hired on for a contract let's say
six months at the end of it that I renew
your contract depending how it works for
a year or another six months or they
hire you on as a full-time salary
developer so someone asked me about this
in our amn I wanted to do a video going
over this because I think it's really
important especially when you're just
eight sorry and I've recently had some
sort of experience to a degree I'm
talking with recruiters and things like
that having as you saw I take all calls
from recruiters because you never know
what's going to happen and I'll talk
about some of the pros and cons of it
right now so the first one is the major
con is you may not have a job that's
that's a major con like and you're not
going to collect unemployment you don't
have a job if you're a full-time
developer a salary developer at a
company and you leave for a contractor
if that contracts up in six months and
it doesn't get renewed there's no
there's no developer there's no
unemployment so you are just burning
whatever money you decide to save up the
other the other hazard of it is and I'm
going to talk about some pros but for in
my eyes there's a lot of cons uh in in
my eyes it's you get you don't get as
much value but but it depends what
you're looking for
the other con for it is that you it's
there's a certain uncertainty with you
knowing and stressful that goes with it
knowing that hey in six months I mean I
have a job and from what I've seen in
the workplace with contract hire is they
may not know till that day like the last
day of their contract so it's not like
you're going to know thirty days
beforehand and you can start filling out
apps and get you hit the ground running
you may not find out till that day and
be pretty unavoidable now
what are some of the and I'm going to
jump back and forth between pros and
cons that's how my brain works
so what let's dive in a little bit about
pros the pros are you get a lot of
interesting positions that maybe if it
was a salaried position that they
wouldn't even look at you for because
the contract to hire are a little less
desirable because of the the risk factor
with it and you know a lot of developers
you know myself included as someone who
has a job contract hire isn't all that
appealing on a straight face up value
and because there's there's risk and
involving me being unemployed while as a
salary developer I don't have that risk
other than if they just decide to fire
me or close the project right but at
least you have the unemployment to fall
back on to now in terms of pros
interesting role so what I mean by that
is you may be you may be more eligible
for roles especially I won't say this in
a way that doesn't come off as a in the
bigoted manner you a lot of contract to
hire at least in the US and this isn't
always the case but some of it is to
hire they can't necessarily find the
developers locally so they essentially
import developers and give them green
cards and things like that and a lot of
times on these contract to hire
applications they'll say you know
English first language or they'll say
must be US citizen so some of those you
kind of when I see that to me that says
that they're having trouble finding a
position that fills that and you may
actually have an edge and getting hired
in that fashion if you're okay going the
contract to hire a route now I I am okay
with it which but under the right
circumstances so in my case I as I said
I talked with recruiters or her to reach
out to me and I have a conversation and
they're saying yeah you know there's
just a role for Disney
I said Disney that's a that's a big name
right so like I didn't think I'd be
working for Disney or any sort of name
that I would actually recognize anytime
soon
and I said your little in the junior end
but um you know you fit the role and
we'd love to we'd be a nurse if you want
if you'd let us submit your limit your
application and I said okay you know I
said you know it's there's we talk some
details this is that I said go for it
why not
and the reason for it is because of that
contract to hire they may actually be
willing to hire someone that as that's
more of a junior end for a mid-level
role because they are having difficulty
filling in and you could go and work in
a really good company as long as you're
willing to contract higher now the
another pro to it is you may have an
easier time getting contract to hire
when you get started and the reason for
that is because most people want the
salary jobs most people have families
and they have houses and have mortgages
and and they you know their kids in the
area that they're they're living in and
they don't want to move them across
country they don't want to they don't
want to put them in a position where you
know they can't put food on the table so
those things are a little more heavy
risk but so you may you may have someone
who's just has one year experience or
getting started be able to grab a
contract to hire a role a little bit
easier than a salaried role and in my
experience the the tests for contract
hire are a little bit easier depending
on the company that you're going for but
I wouldn't necessarily throw that in
there because because it's kind of for
this because every every company is
different and so I think that's one of a
company basis but let's talk about some
of the more realistic financial issues
with contract to hire and there's some
pros and some cons so a lot of times
when you're dealing with an external
recruiter so there's in-house recruiters
which are like you know a recruiter that
actually works at Disney would be an
in-house recruiter while let's say
there's some company called tech systems
that is a recruiting company and they
get hired by Disney to find the role for
it which is pretty common and that's a
lot of the recruiters that you get
reaching out to you over LinkedIn or
reaching out to over email and stuff
like that it's it's the local recruiters
in the area they see oh there's a
developer in you know Tampa or wherever
you're at and I want to connect with
this guy and see if I could maybe swing
him over right that's a lot of what I
get it's probably pretty common you say
okay cool whatever
so that as an external recruiter
forgot to mute that sorry guys a lot of
times what happens is you actually don't
get hired by Disney for instance in my
case I would got hired by the tech
recruiter company and what happens is I
am a I'm under contract under them and
so the the big Disney job you can put
that you work for Disney on your resume
all that sort stuff that's fine that'll
look great but you're actually hired
through it it depends this is a
generally speaking you actually hired
through the company and they're kind of
lending you to Disney in that instance
and so a lot of what happens is one-year
contract employees so let's talk about
money because as we all know we work a
job for money and to provide a life and
and get and pay for rent and all that
stuff so money should be at top of your
mind and sometimes people feel
uncomfortable talking about money um and
I understand that but I promise you
talking openly about money is better for
you than not less so if you're
uncomfortable about that yeah get
comfortable because no one's going to no
one's going to pay you more money unless
you demand more money or you're worth
more money they're just going to let you
be underpaid your entire life and it's
it's important for you does not
shortchange yourself and we're going to
talk about how you could do that if you
don't do the basic numbers so in my case
when I was talking with this recruiter
and she said well what would you need to
get paid as a contract employee and or
what would what's your what's your rate
now and what would you for this role
what would you need to be paid and so I
told her what my rate was and I asked
her what their benefit package was which
may surprise you so why do you care
about benefits
we're talking about pay well for one off
the top as a contract employee you're
paying twice the amount of taxes roughly
and why that is is when you're a
salaried employee how taxes work is you
pay for this is a real rough
understanding I'm not a tax master or
anything so uh your employer pays a part
you'll pay a part but if you're a
contract employee you pay both parts so
you're paid twice as much in taxes so
let's say an average year I pay seven
thousand dollars in taxes it's a little
more than that but what's a seven so now
I'm paying fourteen thousand dollars in
taxes so automatically I need a seven
thousand dollar increase in pay just to
break even on that and I say okay well
what are you know miss mr. or mrs.
recruiter what uh what are your paid
vacation and holidays they have in
depending on the the agency they'll have
some where they won't in this instance
they had less or zero and so we'll say
zero and so I say okay so I go from in
my case fourteen PTO days to two and ten
paid holidays and we'll run that up to
twenty five for easy math where you
combine them so I 25 days which is five
full weeks of work that I'm basically
now working for free unless I'm
compensated for okay so I'd say let's
say my my average pay is three hundred
dollars pre-tax per day I need to charge
was at six thousand for 2015 seventy
five hundred dollars more so so far I
need fourteen thousand five hundred
dollars to make up the difference in pay
and so let's say you're making seventy
just for you to be even on a contract
level you have to go to eighty five and
they say okay well what about the
benefit packages I'm currently paying
nothing for the for the lowest model of
my of my health insurance and medical
and dental office or so it's going to
cost me two hundred dollars a month to
go with them one hundred dollars
paycheck which isn't unreasonable but uh
maybe it's a little bit better coverage
but now I'm paying extra 2500 2500
roughly or 2400 so I need $17,000 five
hundred raise to break-even to live the
same lifestyle save the same amount
money so I go from say seventy to eighty
seven thousand five hundred dollars and
on top of that I am taking more risks
down because let's say the average
contract is six months I may not have a
job in six months so for me to feel
comfortable to take that I needed
$10,000 raised on top of that an actual
$10,000 raise usually well you're here
$17,000 more not really because you have
to you have to factor in what you're
losing in terms of that as well just
real numbers basically we have to factor
out the real return and so okay so I go
from seventy to um you know eighty seven
to ninety seven so maybe you say 95
here's our we kind of hashed a number so
I need I need $25,000 raised to be
comfortable with that contract to higher
position and they're more flexible with
you to be like okay now let me say no
they may say yes but you're you
typically likely get paid more as a
contract to higher position than you are
as a salary developer and that's part of
the reason is you're paying more in
taxes year sometimes your benefits are
worse and you know you don't have 401 K
whatever it may be and so that's one of
the reasons that you may get a higher
salary now what is so you're saying that
sounds like a lot of cons but let's talk
about the pro of that if they if you do
get that role and you go from seventy to
ninety five thousand you can roughly
command a ninety five thousand dollar
salary at your next job and it may not
be perfect you may drop down to eighty
five thousand for instance for a
salaried role or whatever you make
whatever it is but someone paid you that
now you're worth that right and so
that's a little simplistic and obviously
you have to prove your worth with your
skill set and the goal is to get hired
on and sometimes in those contract to
higher positions
you don't actually they're not in any
obligation to hire you like Disney and
that instance not any obligation to hire
hire you and what may happen is Disney
just renews your contract with that
company and a lot of times it'll happen
is he'll try and lure you and say you
know dis you might hire you at the end
of this and Disney will the whole time
just like
renew your contract with the the
recruiting agency with the employment
agency and so you'll just work for this
company this whole time which is fine
there's nothing wrong with it but you
just have to know your options right I
don't want to when I talk about these
things I want people to know that the
that I don't try and give you like I
tend to stay away for contract to hire
because I want to do what I want to do
and it's not beneficial to what I what
my game plan is for the next five years
of my life but I want to give you I want
you guys to be educated about the facts
of how a lot of this stuff works and
we're talking in generalities with these
tech recruiting companies and employment
agencies but these are the things that
you need to ask because typically the
benefits will be worse typically the PTO
and the paid holidays will be
non-existent or worse and so and I after
talking with these it depends I've had
one three get zero PTO I've had ones
where you've had five days of PTO I've
had once we've got 10 days of PTL but
typically they're worse and you need to
factor that into your salary because if
you in that instance say hey I'm going
for sixty five thousand to seventy
thousand five thousand dollar raise and
you're like okay cool I didn't really
like where I'm working I'm okay taking a
little bit of risk for a good
opportunity and before you know it
you're like man things are rough man
white why is it going by because the
actual amount of money that you're
making with just that five thousand
dollar rate is you actually lost $5,000
in actual money income money into your
pockets by taking that contract a higher
position from that salary position so
you need to know these things because a
recruiter is not going to tell you it
you just say yeah man $5,000 raise good
for you bro
you know whatever it is um but because
it I mean because of the salary increase
as I was saying you may be able to
command a higher salary because a lot of
times places last year well what are you
making now and you know try and justify
it off that and it's not a good practice
but it is what it is so you have that to
think about as well but that's really my
two cents about a contract to hire one
they can open up some doors for you that
maybe wouldn't normally be open because
less people want the rolls let's say
that nobody wants to roll so it's plenty
of people that do contract to hire and
they're happy about it and another
benefit is that they're if you're if
you're local if you're a native English
speaker into my case right in America
you might be a better candidate than if
they have to get somebody out of the
country because they have to go through
a whole bunch of processes get in the
visa they have to typically pay a
relocation fee which is normally
something that doesn't happen as well
when you uh when you deal with contract
to hire but that's more of a
case-by-case basis on a salary developer
when they want to hire you on for the
company usually it will offer you
relocation money into your contract and
there's some contingencies with that but
usually it's somewhere around five
thousand dollars to say hey we want you
you're going to work in a house so
wherever you're living you're in
Minnesota this is in Florida or
California here's five thousand dollars
that you know we expect you to be with
the company for a year and we'll knock
five hundred dollars off of it it's
basically like at least in my experience
it's been like kind of like a loan where
uh let's say okay well we're expecting
you state we're going to give you $5,000
cash upfront and every month that you're
working with us we want you to if you're
here for a year five thousands gone it's
all yours enjoy it after that but if you
leave at six months you always $2,500
right and so it depends on the company
that's different but that bet money to
relocate you it's harder to get that
when your contract to hire so you you
might have to deal like cost
another cost out of pocket and it's
expensive to move right maybe you have
to break a lease maybe you need to rent
a truck and move all your you might
spend $5,000 to yourself to get there
which slow which is why that's a very
reasonable amount but the pros and cons
you got just be aware of the the money
implications as well as the
opportunities that it can open up with
contract to hire so for me it's a little
too risky right now so early on in my
career and I it would take it would take
something pretty phenomenal and I would
be more open to contract to hire um if I
was looking for work with
one-year contracts but that usually
doesn't happen a lot of times what
happens is you'll get hired for six
months or like they do a contract a
higher period where you know and then
let's say they hire you in June but in
every January there were new contracts
for a year so you might work from June
to January and then you'll find out if
you have a job after that sometime in
January for another year so yeah for me
it'd just be a little too stressful and
I encourage people to jump around and
check out their options and see what
their market value is worth which is why
I say take those recruiter calls and see
what it's worth because the salary
developers see what's worth contract to
hire and just know all your options on
what they really do for you that's my
very long I don't call it a rant but my
very long section on contract to hire
pros and cons I hope that when you're
looking for roles and if you're just
getting started country tire is great
but a lot of times they want you it's
more of a senior to mid-level role
contract hire because they're trying
they're an agency hiring for a company
they're not a company that's willing to
groom you a lot of the time so which is
one thing it's like all that sounds
great sounds like easier way not really

little caveat there but thanks for
