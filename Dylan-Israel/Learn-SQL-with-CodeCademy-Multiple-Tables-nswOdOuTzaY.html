tables multiple tables so you can see
that right now I'm holding off on
finishing up these labs because I've
contacted code CAD me I've sent a
message in an air and I've tweeted them
about how to fix their save slash run
here so right now we're gonna wait up on
that hopefully I'll be able to upload a
video in the future but anyhow let's get
started so we're a multi table it looks
like we're gonna be messing with
multiple tables here so we need to
create table
artists and then we we're gonna have ID
with the integer and we're gonna use
what the primary key meaning that
everyone has to have one of these and
that's kind of how its unique also so
that's kind of what a primary key is so
for instance like your ID or your social
security number would be a great example
of a primary key so now we're gonna use
multiple tables so we're gonna select
all from the albums table and we're also
gonna select all from the artist let's
see what happens here so run so we end
up getting two queries here so our our
query results this is our database
schema and then this is our query
results so next we need to remove the
previous query then we're going to find
out select from artists up select all
select all from artists where the ID is
equal to three and if the idea is a
primary key we should only get one
result select from and make sure you
spell right
it's artists' so and cool so you can see
right there our primary key ID there's
only one and it's Michael Jackson Oh
on the next line out of the other so now
we want to select all from albums where
artists underscore ID equals three so
now we're gonna get all of Michael
Jackson's albums so we have bad and then
we have thriller at least I think ants
more I'm positive he has more than two
but in this example there is only two so
now that we understand how SQL links
data between tables it's write single
queries so we are going to select albums
dot name so that's probably the table in
the column and albums dot year an
artists dot so what's going on right now
if I had to guess so a couple of these
parameters we're selecting from multiple
multiple tables so we need to specify
which one we need the name parameter in
the year parameter C albums that name
hardest out year so just getting just
think of is an object it should come
make a lot of sense and here we go we
have our album artist I would name etc
so now we want to select and we'll type
in how they are doing it from albums so
we're going to select all from albums
and join artists on albums dot artist
honors for ID equal to art yeah artist
underscore ID is equal to artists dot ID
so let's see what's going on here
so you can see right here it's we're
studying all these to be one big query
in this you can see that the artist ID
is telling you this is the album ID
and this is the artist ID so you can see
who did what all right so now we're
gonna select all from albums and then
left join artists on album dot artists
underscore ID equals artist that ID so
so I a lot of the good things about SQL
so it's kind of intuitive this I'm a
little bit confused on so let's see
what's going on
not every artist has produced an album
but let's write a joint statement to
include these artists okay so I'm not
sure what the left joint is so let's see
select all from albums left joint
artists on album
oh here albums there we go
so now we have 1989 this is name of the
album but it doesn't have an artist ID
for whatever reason the same thing with
unorthodox jukebox so that therefore
we're including it now so it can't be
confusing when two tables have calling
the same name in the comb editor alright
so we are going to select albums dot
name as album and albums that year so
we're just finding which ones we want
and we want artists dot name as artists
from albums and then we want to join our
table artists on album dot artists on
your score ID equal to artists dot ID
where the album's alright now we
remember what we're does so we're albums
that year so we're going to specify a
parameter in nineteen eighty are a
prerequisite and so let's see where I
made a mistake so start from time to
select albums done select albums dot
name as album let's see if that's it I
hope so that looked like that was it so
it changed the artists and album so it
basically just changed the results here
so you can see if we look up here we
have name and this has been changed to
artist or album rather and then in the
name for the artist for the artist table
we changed name to artist when I just
so it looks like we've kind of finished
looks like we're about to finish the SQL
so BAM
pretty cool stuff it's really as far as
I see it there's the front end which is
like design there's the back end and
databases and databases kind of go into
the back end and so SQL is a really cool
and important tool to have and I'm not
sure what course I'll do next but uh you
know just kind of it's kind of hard to
practice SQL but I'm sure there are
resources at least this gives a brief
introductory course of what you'll
actually be doing with SQL and maybe
you'll be prepared for a class or a job
than where they just want you to kind of
be familiar with it so thank you for
watching the SQL course and don't forget
