love oh I got yours here
alright so what we did yesterday was we
covered started havin you work through
your algorithms and I know it's
frustrating I know it was it was
difficult well they gave you some
homework
we should not focus on oh my goodness
what happens baby when you don't get
your homework you fail the class
well usually class isn't right after
each other and on top of that when
something is given us homework it's not
due the next day look very here a lot of
excuses and on top of it it's my
birthday
yes it is and I've been with you all day
so even did you think that I worked on
it while I was at the gym yeah in it
it's not my homework
no it's it's your homework I'll let
everybody know that it's your birthday
so I can come in here and wish your
happy birthday
I was all fired and I was May 19 day 20
today I don't but I was off my feet even
killing me all day responding back to me
my real quick for a mentoring session
then we'll get started here Michael Neil
welcome alright so I'll lower this so we
can set if you'd like but we're going to
continue on reviewing topics and subject
matters and so
all right so happy birthday baby
and now as your present we're doing some
review there we go so you're not as
orange so um let's start with what we
did yesterday um what does a variable do
stores of value how do we define a
variable with a name so say it out loud
how the what would use a key word bow
fan our far yes all right
we have what's next the name alright and
what's next well you draw it up waiting
draw up create a variable what the
ending value won't right now sorry we're
going to review
know what you're good on the camel case
but remember we're assigning a value
with a variable so we have to use the
assignment operator no that's fine right
there this is where you're up
wait
yeah good and what is how do we end that
well
perfect so you've created a variability
setting equal zero what type is it what
what is the type of this variable happy
birthday the variable type all right
name the other types string
okay what's the string
speak up a little
this is sentence okay and bullion which
is what typically sure false all right
the list 1 what do we call that alright
and then you have what is the other one
that you're struggling with still sorry
low good alright so we reviewed that now
draw an if statement an example if
statement what's that
draw an example if statement
use your variable as well
No all right so you still
misunderstanding what if statements are
so let's break it down one more time so
we are comparing things in here we're
not assigning things yeah I know I was
going to compare it I was gonna say you
can't create a new variable to compare
it in there I wasn't trying to I just
don't know how to write it still good I
was going to say is zero is less than
five okay what thing you say use very
fun use your variable you created
straight
so then use it I remember that looks
like it's just putting happy birthday is
less than five that's what I was gonna
do now you put var yeah that was gonna
play back neck that creates a new
variable okay well I forgot okay Orlando
she's learning JavaScript we're T I'm
trying to teach her web development and
we're in the JavaScript section now okay
cool and finish it all right what else
No oh yeah okay
all right so what does this statement of
the if statement evaluate to is zero is
less than five good um someone what to
do
so something attention check I wanted to
see your birthday yeah everyone's
wishing Happy Birthday they're very
happy for you um your green screen was
dope yet I'll get better at it once we
move I'm going to paint the wall of the
office I'm going to paint the wall the
office
someone's painting the wall of the
office and then I'll have my lighting
situation set up right now I just have a
sheet over the sink over the the window
which is the lighting is pretty crucial
with the green screen video ok so what
what is this evaluate to remember if
statements returning if it's true or
false surprise so what is that statement
return saying true ok because 0 is less
than fun yeah okay now let how would we
add an else if statement what is it else
if let's start there else if is if the
if statement is false you the else if
only runs if the if statement is false
correct it's alright else if statement
you want to start a coding channel for
your coding career journey all right so
I have a policy I've enacted that once
you hit a thousand subscribers I will
interview you and put you on the channel
if you're interested the reason is a
thousand and not anything else is I
think you have to kind of respect the
grind a little bit to get there so if
you do start a James to get your first
thousand subscribers I'd be happy to
interview you and hopefully you'll gain
some subs that way as well so what do
you want to put in the house a statement
of some sort so why don't you write a
statement using happy birthday that
evaluates so false
so use your variable and no no no we can
don't change that reassign the value of
happy birthday no don't touch this line
reassign the value in a different line
all right good
yes so in this case for happy birthday
to fail what is the lowest value the
happy birthday could be fine good
so make happy birthday 5 don't look at
me just I'm gonna tell you if you're
right or wrong
okay so just write what you think done
out today for wrong I'll tell you how to
do right
don't say I forget write it up I don't
think that you're the only one that gets
embarrassed during this I just had 20 30
people watching me struggle with an
algorithm I should have solved and once
I got off the channel and I looked at
the picture that went with it I was able
to break it down mathematically because
I started drawing it out so it everyone
struggles so how do we reassert the
value of a variable that we've already
created okay
so shame shame shame teacher gets the
red marker as it's the face all right so
when we want to you're on you're on the
right way so this when we have the VAR
keyword it creates a variable it creates
a variable we create the variable happy
birthday and we assign the value 0 so
the only thing that we have to do to
reassign the value after the fact is get
rid of the VAR keyword this creates it
this creates a new variable called happy
birthday happy birthday already exist so
we don't need var but we don't want it
to be 0 but I don't want you to change
this line of code so assign the value 5
remember this is the assignment operator
happy birthday
equals 5 I had to call it you're
thinking of functions all right so don't
forget your semicolon
all right so happy birthday and we're
going to just for sake of simplicity it
goes between these two lines okay so
line 1 line 2 line 3 and I'll have a
line of for alignment of 5 and alignment
6 we'll say this is line 7 okay
our code runs in order top to bottom so
what's going on here is happy birthday
charts F at 0 the next line of code runs
what happens so this goes line 1 what
happens
happy birthday equal 0 ok cool
line 2 happy birthday now equals 5 all
right line 3 if happy birthday is less
than 5 run the goodness what is happy
birthday evaluate to false because 5 is
5
good so what happens next in our
else--if here we have to write a
statement now write a statement we're
happy birthday is false we're using
happy birthday write a statement to
evaluate to false okay yeah in our
else--if this time we're reviewing we're
trying get you back to where you were
yesterday it's going to tell these
things start to stick
by the way I can't believe it's fun 7
o'clock get a mentor anything at seven
okay so this says you're mentoring at
seven excuse me 30 do say at 7 eat
okay so else else--if happy birthday is
less than five
what does this evaluate to false because
happy birthday is now five and five is
in creative in five good now write an
else statement
Michael Oh bang Walt film my friend my
friend
nope what is it else statement do
No
what does an else statement do if
evaluates a statement
also if evaluates a statement if it's
associated if it fails else is no else
doesn't even have a statement else runs
if everything fails else is what runs
when every all the if and else is fit
because it always runs there is no
statement all there is is the brackets
makes sense
all right write a bracket so
we're going to do a test based off what
we have here in here we return one here
we return 2 and here we return 3
all right let's return to you again
absolute it's no it it stops the entire
function and it returns a value so this
isn't a function this is in a function
if it hits this if returned one and it
would stop it would return that value it
exit out the function all right cool so
I'm going to give you five cases here
one two three four five and in this case
I'm going to give you and
cool
so
look at our code here if happy birthday
is now three what does it return
one cool if happy birthday is now six
what does it return to good
if happy birthdays 11 what is it return
to good happy birthday is 5
what is it return 3 good don't think
confused about that are you doing
confused and not confident in your
answer
because I was going to say too but then
I have to remind myself good
happy birthday is zero what does it
return good all right so we reviewed
variables for loops if statement elsif
and now we are going to review for loops
one more time any questions
all right
Charlie
how do we create variables
we just did it you have a keyword you
have a name give an assignment but not
in here you're creating a variable there
and didn't do it correctly
try again keyword name assignment value
and if keep int end it was semicolon
how do we create a very
we're creating and what are we creating
we have three parts right first part
we're creating the value of our iterator
Judith pine will use it a variable yes
what's far second part we're creating
statement in which we say how many times
what's a for loop do for a single parent
s four times four times all right it's
definitely pending it runs how many ever
times it needs to run oh base off of the
step I just know it doesn't run four
times
Isaac Omalu its fo are it's not
fo you are okay so incredibly gay a say
unrelated question but this will be
funny so answer it what's the best
username you've ever seen it was my
username I'll tell you right now my old
back when people actually use AOL
Instant Messenger or aim as the kids
would call it uh my username and this is
also my gaming tag for a while was
rancid ass gasses that was what at like
nine years olds like probably fifteen or
panty pirate
Ned Flanders
if you hang around for about 20 more
minutes man I'll answer questions out
then that that's a long answer I'd love
to give you some great advice instead of
shortchanging with a 20 second answer
get back to this all right so create a
variable so var doesn't go in here no it
does
you just keyboard named Simon operator
value have I used too far eh books
online my co-workers used to use them I
am NOT
now
I'm going to ask you a simple question
here baby how it is hi keep track of how
many times we've done this loop so you
can only do some numbers if I say hi and
I ask you how many that is I'd say two
and you'd be wrong because it's
high that's all of it
so yes I know so in this case typically
you'll initialize it to zero so go ahead
and start off with zero one
1 part 2 part 3 part of the for-loop
what is this first part this there's two
more parts in here
what are you forgetting alright
um
cool how many times do we want to run
our for loop we don't know
in this case we do you can't can't just
tell me forget the hard code are my
array equals an array was
one two three four
I want you to run it for the length of
that array so set up the statement for
that
and the spirit of happy birthday I take
it back
spirit you know this one you don't want
us to put your agent thing for the
length of your age
we're going over JavaScript trying to
get here trying to get this to click ok
so that's good so was that gives us back
the the length of the erase but we have
to turn that into a sting that evaluates
the true or false you can use a less
than greater than not double equals
triple equals comparison operators what
are they greater than less than equal
greater than less than so that what
you're saying cÃ­mon operator equal
equal greater equal and less or equal
then
triple equals chuckling well not equals
not equal equals and then there's a
ternary operator but I won't get into
that yet
oh did she go through codecademy intro
to join us have you done that yet no
just on the JavaScript section on free
code camp I've gone through that with
her you should do that because you're
not getting this in our tutoring
sessions so I'm gonna start back into my
genius okay um do coke at me it's easier
you need to ease here
counted woman taken all right so let's
let me show you an example before you
it's Chloe clearly you don't remember
this even though we did it yesterday and
day before so we're signing our iterator
here typically what
happy birthday is way too long of a name
because we're going to use that as our
index to get our indexes so what we
would do normally is call it I does it
have to be called I but eyes iterator
that's what is but you could even call
it X if you wanted whatever you want to
call it but usually it'll be one letter
to represent the index for this array in
this case so we're going to varrock
variable i because we want all the
values the reason we're starting i here
is because the first index is zero so we
can't iterate through everything if we
start off at two right what's the index
of one
what's the index of four
good so here where I is equal to zero
okay
the next thing that we want to do is we
said that we want to at some point we
don't know what we're doing but we want
to let's say add all the values together
to do that we have to run through the
array so one we're once a boy goes to
our door so one of the one simple way is
to say hey I is less than now what do we
know about a race how can we get the
length of the array darling good so
we're using the function that's built in
why would you use the last so because
we're creating a statement
remember our if statements what what
happens is we are saying hey well this
is true this is like in our if statement
as if it was like this okay just that
part and what we're saying is while this
is true continue running the code that's
in our for loop once it is false exit
out of the for loop and move on okay so
we set up our iterator in part one we
define the statement for when the loop
runs and what it breaks and then we set
in our third part here
we said every time the loop runs how do
we increment our Gatorade now what is I
plus plus - hey
that's one - ah good so i plus plus as
one and now we've set up our for loop so
if I want to if I want to add all these
numbers together how do I access them
and add them together did this yesterday
yes we did
uh this one actually no I did a function
let's all solve this for you just to
show you you're right
so we would create a variable outside of
the for loop called total in this case
we can set it to zero the reason we the
reason we created out of the for loop is
because we are going to in the for loop
say total plus equals my array now mind
you remember we're starting this is
basically the iteration of the loop run
which also corresponds with the amount
of elements in that that the start of
the index if we increase by one we will
hit every element in the array so this I
is less than my radon is a typical way
of setting up for loop doesn't have to
be that way though all we're doing is
setting a statement here to evaluate now
here in this rumor I saying your happy
birthday was too long all we need to do
here my right
cool and then outside of here we return
total now what I'm going to ask you to
do is I want you to just write below
here write down the value of total and
each iteration so we'll have the first
second third fourth so on the first four
loop what is I and what in debt and what
is the value of total at that point
so that's I so are you saying so here
we'll have lie here we'll have total
what's the value of total after it gets
past this line here
let's go what's well what's plus equals
to do you remember it adds
okay that's fine so
total is equal to total plus one oh
shoot me X is in plus plus this value
here my ring so that plus equals all
that's doing is assuming that you're
adding to total otherwise it would reset
the value every time yes so what happens
but I want you to write down in order
how it's going so on the firm or index 0
first iteration what is I 0 now we're
adding the value of total plus whatever
the index that we're on so when I say my
array is 0 what's the value what's total
what's total plus index 0 okay
next iteration
so that's indexed one right because we
now added one with our I plus plus now
we're on index one so we're saying total
is equal plus equals two my array enters
into two and so what's total so two plus
one Hey
five plus four
that's a four
where you get the five plus four
let's let's try this you're almost there
what's a--what's the on the final
iteration which is three right because
that's last one that's our last I plus
plus what's the length of my array
what's the length of it okay
so 3 is less than 4 cetera okay so what
is the value of I on that third
iteration value of I okay
let's write again now what is my array 3
and what is total plus equals my array
index 3 what is total 0
no what is sorry toll has changed total
on zero iteration as one if we added one
start it off zero total on the first
second or the second run our index one
is now three because so when we have
what is toll on our on our so total a
debate so total what's plus equals do
what does plus equals do this is the
question I don't remember
total this same so this is equivalent to
want to move out to right right now okay
so total is equal to total let's get X
plus my array I
so when we say plus equals what we do is
we eliminate this extra bit of code here
it's just the same small C
good
I so what we're going to have you do is
we are going to all right
do you read a function I'm sorry I'm
uncomfortable
it's okay all right um so those are view
what we've talked about already
how do we create a variable and what
does the very we'll do a dry run start
Rhonda right now
um number one
okay cool so we create a variable now
what types of variables are they
ah it's Bo all our to be o el elyon
these schools are out here on the
from the top
like Daddy we got a couch back again
all right so those are the main ones
good right in his statement what is an
if statement do was it evaluate
statement sure feels good so give us an
example
no-no-no so my phone there you don't
have semicolons in statements like that
there's no need to so what we're doing
is we're nesting this in here we're
saying hey this is kind of like a
container you'll need to put so much
colon if everything the reason for
something colon here is because there's
an if statement or there's something
below it there's already it it's not
contained carrots contained no similar
all right what else do we have
and so why do we put those curly braces
they provide gyroscope they provide
scope for what's supposed to run only
when this evaluates the true okay good
so what is a lot of you're right that so
but what is it else if two runs is false
okay now what's an else - it runs of
everything else is false good all right
now so before them
sorry don't want to
we just did this I don't know one that's
fine sorry babies you see your wrists
I just want you to
no pressure you just going to do your
best so you know that you start with
what
all right every time you mess up this is
what happens you know if I could go back
and look at pictures or notes or
whatever then it's alright so here I
hope you don't use curly braces you use
parenthesis so we do next
why don't we give it a variable
we give it a variable to keep track of
the iterations and we also use in the
statement we can we don't have to but we
do so create that variable
now what do we
all right so if I want my loop to run
five times and I'm going to increase
num1 every by one every time how would I
do that
all right so
good and then we would what we closed it
up right
and what else would we have
good so you're retaining it only shave
once just have some fun baby the reason
that I'm being hard with you is because
the only way that you'll ever be able to
actually use this stuff is if you retain
it and so this is the stuff you have to
retain a lot of stuff you don't so we
got to make a second nature which is
life is no cheat sheets which is why we
are doing this even though we did today
before in the day before not big deal
all right all right so let's review
functions before we move on and answer
questions do it
I'm birthday baby okay so what if what
if functions do hey what
there I continues
right usually go
so five Hamasaki so function runs a set
amount of code once we call it alright
so we define a function with the keyword
function and then we name the function
where you want the name to be happy
b-day how about that
and then we within within our curly
braces this is our scope where the code
runs in here we have we have parameters
sometimes it doesn't have to happen so
what we do parameter what's in it
bonus we'll say date ah a type all right
so the way that we call functions is
simply by calling the name
and then if we have a date
so we define our function kind of like a
variable to a degree is we define
something and in here we have all our
code are for loops or if statements our
variables all that sort of stuff right
just like when we created the add to
number function the other day and what
happens is taking our argument which
connects to this parameter right and we
call it and then let's say it returns in
this case happy birthday and the return
statement the return statement breaks us
out of the out of the scope of here now
we can actually you know always have to
have a return but it will just run for
the whole function and then move on
can you put breaks in here yes so say we
have a for loop we could use the break
to break out the for loop or to break
out of the function I guess probably
could so moving forward does you need
more practice still you need to I'll let
you bring your cheat sheet tomorrow and
I'd like for you to I guess my TC make a
cheat you would you like me to get you
yeah there's resources online and I have
like two shades cheat ography is a great
website but we're going to have you jump
into code Academy and I'll show you this
section I want you two to review
is in here and code could cook Adam II
there's learn JavaScript I think there's
a basic one that is the basic one all
right so don't there's JavaScript ignore
that one what you want to do is learn
JavaScript on coke at me okay so this
course is to give an estimated of time
if everything is so I don't think they
do know then I'll show it to once you
start it okay uh you can probably get
get through things like ten hours yeah
you probably do that tomorrow do half of
it tomorrow because we've gone over some
of this stuff all right uh let's answer
some questions and ignore the trolls
what about that first question you got
about work oh let's jump so it's okay
let me move this down so I can sit
so we're tired all right so uh
codecademy okay I'll throw it up there
is this astrophysicist
feels like it Jesus
it's all new don't sweat it all right so
somebody asked a question way back I
don't remember what it was but it was a
good question so if you're still here if
you wouldn't mind re asking the question
yeah I'm looking forward to laughing
here this is it
all right I'm working my way down 20
days of coding the grass is not breaking
up yet it it's they're going to be
rough parts of coding and they're going
to be easy parts of coding and the
hardest part is consistency and it will
click one day so Jay Scott says long
time watch are starting my unpaid
internship today nervous as hell as I've
never worked in office environment any
idea what they might have me do
could you tell me more about the role
and I could tell you what type of
company is I could give you a better
idea
second I got banned this guy he's being
rude but yeah Jase give me give me a
little bit more detail and I'd love to
answer
happy Mother's Day are you confident
face it
I have like a hackathon challenge it's
not a bad idea
um it just depends
once I get it get it going
yeah nerd Flanders is gone huh
that yeah Dexter's lavatory these
actually are the less Dexter lavatory
ones he's had ons that are full-on like
square no guys I need to talk about guy
baby hi guys
trashcan of the person the eyes also
Bend so uh let's go ahead and mod some
people and twitch we're gonna have a
slash mud
Joshua hey guys josh you know Mon
anybody else want a mod while we're at
it on Twitch uh explain why no it's the
essential oil diffuser on um okay baby
so I think I think what we can do right
now is let's put Chad away for a second
let's talk ah
about so let's talk about frustration
because today was a frustrating day for
you what was what was frustrating about
it for you
I can't
they can't recall things too well okay
understandable now why do you think that
is because I don't remember that okay
yeah is it is it because it's new is it
because we haven't been doing it enough
is it because you have a chance to study
beforehand
um
I know okay fair enough fair enough so
what can we do to make it less
frustrating moving forward
sigh I told you we kick it up a notch
right which we we're no longer known
tutorials we're actually applying stuff
and we're using stuff and you know I
worked through it before to kind of give
you an idea of what to expect so do you
want to in the future what we can do is
you can do code Khadem e and work
through it and ask me questions and I'll
be here for support no I like I like
what we're doing it's just hard because
I don't know what we're going over so I
don't have anything to review off of and
if we're not gonna go off of something
that's already pre-planned out like if
we went over our javis you know free
code camp and then you asked me to go do
it and then come back and explain it at
least I'd have something to work off of
we did go over the JavaScript so a free
code camp and everything we we touched
what was it there yeah but I mean we
didn't touch on it then go to the
whiteboard and apply it we went over
everything and now we're playing it all
and I don't okay so this this is what I
think we should change in the in our in
our process is I think that we should no
longer wait for you to study after other
things and you should make a conscious
effort to to do the code kata me section
yeah and we'll say we'll say two
sections a day for Coke ad me okay so on
coke atom II what I want you to do is I
want you to by 6 p.m. by the time I get
home from work okay you need to finish
introduction JavaScript variables
control flow this is what you need to
get done three sections
okay and then what we'll do tomorrow
we'll review that and that's going to be
similar to what we talked about today
take whatever notes you want I'll I will
print you out a couple cheat sheets at
work did a little research bring out
some so you can look at them sure to
refer to refresh your memory and then we
will continue on from there alright tell
you it's gonna be hard baby I'm not
saying it's not I know I just not and I
said giving up because it's hard I'm
allowed to be flustered yeah no no I get
it
I'm flustered every day um take some
getting used to
I'm not it's not what what is getting
used to
no it's just I gotta learn it that's it
I think I think I think the main
difference here is is this could be
semantics is you don't necessarily have
to learning if to understand it because
that's the and that sound that sounds
like some you're your parents
would say it's like I've disappointed a
new sort of thing like it's kind of the
same sort of stuff but there is a
differences you learn I understand what
how to set up a variable but I don't
recall how to set up a function or I
don't recall what symbols are what
symbols because they simply don't know
the
fabula I know how to apply the
vocabulary at least four more I'm
standing and my head I understand what
you're saying to me when you're
explaining the logic out to me okay but
I can't write it because I don't
remember what I need to use to write it
okay I don't remember my words basically
okay so I will have cheat sheets for you
tomorrow and you can use those cheat
sheets why we do this stuff well then
you just look like you don't believe me
I I believe that you believe what you're
saying is true but I I know that you're
hearing correct though because you know
yes from the last hour I spent with you
I know that you believe I believe you
believe what you're saying is hunter but
having watched you even as I every time
when I gotta go I break it up in parts
because you're saying you understand
okay one you but we start out you
understand that variables are thing yeah
okay you can recognize that we've said
far at this point and that's not good
that's not nice uh yeah I wouldn't know
how to apply a functional to work if you
asked me to do something no but how the
function works within itself I get that
okay well we're gonna continue hammering
away but we'll try to just don't hammer
away to a point where here so you don't
think I should touch chat with me I'm
not sure I are frustrated with me
because you keep telling me it's okay
you're not gonna be good at it you're
not gonna get it where am I supposed to
be at twenty days I don't know that's uh
some of your expectations are what to
high to low higher how we're going with
this
do you feel better now
[Laughter]
alright baby I am I think you're doing
great
I think I think the hardest part as I've
said from day one is showing up every
day and doing it all right we've been
showing up we've been going through it
whether you want to or not whether I
want to or not we're 1/5 the way there
imagine four times this 2180 more days
of this imagine where you'll be okay so
all right so I'll know how to
write a bar so what are we doing what
are you what is your task by the time I
get home tomorrow
good all right
so let's see check I'm full crazy Oh
see if I can pull it chat real quick see
what everybody has to say if there's any
questions if not you will
yeah thanks guys
yeah so it's
it's it's going to be this is this is
something baby is I'm always going to
push you farther than you're capable of
I'm just gonna cry a lot that's okay I
cried all the time in college but the
reason for that is the reason for it is
not because I'm a big meaning it's
because you have to the way that I'm a
true believer of the way that you learn
code is like the way that you've been
taught to learn so far is like say this
is the line and you push and you push
and you push and you push and a steady
gradual thing the way that I believe
most people learn code is you make this
jump and you skip a whole bunch of
and what happens is is that you make
that jump and you learn the overarching
concept and then you jump backwards
because you're like five steps out and
you jump backwards so you like working
backwards no no no I I think make this
this is the thing is is
you're right James yeah it takes a new
dress you want scream we get scream
together no I scream I'm just gonna cry
no no cry this is so I'm always going to
be pushing you for it as well as myself
and thing is is James I don't get angry
anymore I beg to differ I try not to
gang hanging no we all get in here we're
frustrated I get frustrated more than I
get angry I just come from a Tangra
family and I don't want to perpetuate
that in my life
Giga baby
all right guys um this was one of the
one of those days where we push the
envelope a little bit and we did some
review trying to make it stick we're
gonna change up our pattern and uh I
want oh I'm sorry I
need to push you too far so so when
learning to code guys there are going to
be those frustrating moments where it's
overwhelming and the and this goes for
life in general where where you're gonna
have those days where you don't want to
keep going and you don't want to push
through it which is why we do an hour a
day and even though today was a rough
day we'll be back tomorrow right ok so
don't take plan so ah so sorry so we're
gonna continue pushing forward
it's I'll try to trip we're going to try
a different process maybe perhaps we're
not ready to jump out as the online
tutorials it's been a long time since I
learned my very first programming
language so I may be a little attitude
about what is capable in 20 days split
yourself in the data science of the
marathon or a hackathon that's what it
feels like
I know I know exactly what it feels like
I know what you're feeling right now
which is why we're gonna we're gonna
continue and you'll act I'm still here
yeah we'll be there
you did good baby you did good just me
every developer in here will tell you
that there's frustration as part of the
job sometimes thank you so fake oh how I
feel every time I would take a technical
interview it's exactly how I feel I
would die on the inside and I would I
would look at myself and and just say am
I really this dumb am I really this bad
am I good enough to do this and I take
the test I'd fail it or I do good and I
I pass it but I kept trying kept working
here we are living a better life because
of it so there are those days I mean
you've been there with me then what's
six years now those good days in those
bad days so so when I played that shame
if that was supposed to be funny and I
don't think you found it funny okay so
just for the record that's trying to
make a joke yeah I get his humor
every one night it his humor he's
whatever Sona
you can tell when it bothers me because
I'll start snapping at him and when I
start snapping it means I've hit my
limit of his humor by one I don't say
anything it's not bothering me um but
that didn't bother me it's it my own
it's overwhelming I get it that's all um
but
but I'll say again the hardest part is
to continue going as long as we do that
we'll get to our destination one step
forward so like you may think that like
hey I didn't retain anything but you
retained more today than you did
yesterday I know I felt it good all
right baby um thanks funny because I
have like single I um I have a mentoring
session that I have to do is a quick 30
minute when I normally only do an hour
but like I said I'd do 30 minutes and
then I'm going to go buy a birthday cake
or something like that um I bought my
own birthday yeah I was doing a surprise
her with the birthday cake today and it
got so late and she bought her own
birthday cake and here we are all of a
sudden they went from birthday cake -
I'm making you cry oh no it's not house
was to go in person yes
it is April's birthday today what did I
major in college so Michael Oh bang I
was majoring in computer science and I
dropped out towards the end of my junior
year so I majored in CS I dropped out
about a year and a half ago I took a job
at a student formation systems company
where I did technical documentation
videos and I was there for about nine
months and the whole time I was there I
was learning web development and after
that I went and I got my my salary
developer position and I've been there
about eight months and I've just been
improving my skill set as a self-taught
developer ever since um so thank you
guys for all the birthday wishes and
humor oh why did I drop out
the short answer was because I felt like
I had to I was sick of being poor all
the time I was sick of not being able to
buy food and little things like socks
and underwear and the same way that that
April is feeling right now was how I was
feeling on a daily basis with school I
didn't feel like I was learning a lot of
practical skills he was school was
pretty torturous for him and to be
honest just watching him he's so much
better at self teaching then you know
him going to school so I really do
support his decision and what he wanted
to do but yeah so I mean I I just tried
to teach myself and I made the decision
to take a job at the software company
I'd been applying I said look if I get a
job where I think I can work myself into
a developer position I'll drop out I did
that
and now here we are doing very well for
myself I'm in a great company and
getting getting recruiters reaching out
frequently and continue myself skill set
so that was a year and half ago about
that yeah I'd have to look it up exactly
I think we might be a year in nine
months
Oh what when I dropped out and started
working really year and a half ago I
think it was a year 9 months ago was
that long ago
really yeah cuz I've been in my current
job maybe eight months know October will
be so seven months and then I worked ten
months of the old job so about a year
and half yeah uh so yeah
why is there so much smoke is the
essential oil diffuser says right above
it um miss a couple good questions
so what is one thing you would tell
yourself when you're starting out well
um I mean how far back in time are we
going I would tell myself that if we if
we're saying hey right when I start
school I tell myself never to go um I've
done so much more on my own than I've
ever met school has ever given me and
I'm lucky enough to have had somebody
pay for school and between that and not
I didn't have to take out any loans
um so I'm lucky in that fashion if I had
twenty thirty thousand dollars in loans
I probably would have had to finish and
I I don't know where I'd be man I
probably would have fallen apart be
honest with you so I was already
starting a fall apart and so uh if I
could tell myself one thing it would be
that I could be a better developer than
college could ever make me just by doing
my own thing
if I had those like four years of school
back that I was in I could definitely do
so much more
I'd probably join into a boot camp and
try to start working and do and do
exactly what I did which I got an
internship I got a job and then I
transferred into a full-stack salaried
role and continue my education like I am
now in various ways that would be what I
would tell myself when I was starting
out now let's say avoiding all that what
would I do I would just tell myself to
look for more internships that'd be it I
think I really think that the hardest
thing to get is resume experience um and
I think that the hardest thing for you
to get especially as a developer without
a degree right so I I'm in the category
where I don't have a degree I I just
have a job because I'm good at my job so
that that's it right I've proven that I
have the skills and to get there I had
to take you know an internship that is
two hours away for $12 an hour then I
freelance then I had to drop out of
school
then I had to I had to a mind you the
whole time I'm self teaching as well my
youtube channel started almost two years
ago exactly I I know that because in ten
days I'm supposed to film my two year
analytics video but two years ago I
started my learning path of which I said
hey I need to become a better developer
and I was still in school for about the
last five or six months of that and I
started my youtube channel and so that
would my channel started with the goal
of getting me a job I said to myself I
was going to get a relevant job and once
I did I was going to drop out and until
I got a relevant job I wasn't going to
drop out once I did it was about five
six months after I started my channel I
was freelancing and I I I accepted the
role where it's doing technical
documentation and I I was in getting
paid best of money but I was thinking
paid the worst of money and I started
doing wire framing at work I started
learning as much as I could and I
accepted the roles that I have now and I
continued I continued my education for
all of two years when I was working at
that software company I studied about
four hours every day and then on the
weekends about twelve how long kind of
April and I known each other pretty much
the entire time we've been dating which
is over six years she's gonna help
herself she needed this hotness in her
life just is get Loretta you DMV isolate
a minute I slipped I slid into the DMS
uh do I make money off youtube with
nineteen thousand subs I do indeed in a
good month I will make twelve hundred
dollars with sponsorships sponsored
videos mentoring tutoring in a bad month
I will make around six hundred
or in an average month I should say an
average month I make around 600 between
the sponsorships and the mentorian my
YouTube revenue is roughly 350 a month I
will be going into all my analytics in
my to year-to-year
video I did it a year once so I can look
I'll show you some some highlights from
that video that's still on my channel if
you want to see what a YouTube channel
one year inmate's a kodi channel the
biggest asset that my channel has given
me is the means to become a developer
I've learned a lot it's made me an
interesting candidate and it made me it
made me a better developer so one of the
one of the things I preach for the for
those of you who are having trouble
getting resume experiences good
communication being an interesting can
it be somebody that they want to work
with don't just have to have the skills
everyone there's going out of the skills
you need to be different you need to be
you need to be something else so how do
you get your sponsorships if they reach
out to you then you to them or them to
you both
it just depends there are sites such as
famebit where I've gone sponsorships and
there are companies I've reached out to
in the past that I have asked saying hey
would you be interested in this this is
what I'm offering this is what I'm
trying to get for a monthly sponsorship
or for a banner ad or for a channel page
ad and there's also the YouTube patreon
page which I helps to pay for basically
my channel cost I'd be the the website
that would be for the Adobe subscription
and that's really appreciated so yeah
that's a little bit about it what did
you do during your
free code camp tutorials online
tutorials code Academy I was built
projects everything I could that I knew
how to and that was hard as far as not
knowing what to do but um I appreciate
everybody showing up I actually have to
go I'll answer one last question because
it's a good one have you tried again to
get that sponsorship with lariato again
I was sponsored by ferry on tow I don't
think it'd be appropriate for me to ask
for a sponsorship when I plan on
starting my own coding coding coding
coding developer store so that's all
I'll say about that I think it'd be
inappropriate but thank you guys for
watching you got to see a little bit of
just real-life frustration and coding
and there's nothing wrong with that I
think it's a good experience because
it's probably building up more than
anything else sometimes you gotta let it
out so don't forget to join our Facebook
page code Tech and caffeine to stay up
to date uh I think I think being part of
meetups and being part of the coding
community is great of course happy
birthday to my wonderful girlfriend and
we will see you guys tomorrow we're only
in day 20 we got 80 more days of this uh
it has been a pleasure thank you to all
of our twitch members and I didn't know
that Ethan and Gila had their own icon
very cool h3h3 icon um anyhow guys I
appreciate you all would you like to let
us out with your wonderful exiting
comment chi long and prosper good stuff
baby bye guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
