console output the strings in console
output section as you can see I already
did this it got about through 40% of the
course probably about four or five
months back so we're just gonna rework
it as I make a video about it and I'll
be resetting it as we go here so we're
gonna create a variable called Brian and
set it equal to hello life and the
quotes are going to let it know that
it's a string all right and now below we
want do the same thing where we have one
first Caesar is equal to Graham and then
we also have pray line or prolene is
equal to John and we also have Viking is
equal to Teresa and when we submit it
you can see Graham John Teresa for our
Caesar prolene and Viking variables all
right so fix the string in the editor
the string below is broken fix it using
the xscape slash so
apparently we need this isn't fighting
this is falling we need this the quote
marks look like they're there you can
escape the dash by just adding the slash
before it okay so apparently there's a
snake in my boot so the apostrophe is
seen as a like quotation type thing
so instead you need to put a I said a /a
/li so it's asking us on line 13 to
assign the variable v letter equal to
the fifth letter which is the fourth
index value which is going to be 0
all right so 0 oh oh oops oh and we'll
do that in quotes so it's asking nope
okay so I see what they're asking so you
can we can declare a string the Monti
string and then if we only want or want
the fifth letter it'd be the fourth
index value so Monti the fourth one
shoot and why should come up so good to
go so on line one we're gonna create a
variable called parrot and we're going
to set this equal to nor are we gen Bleu
on line - we're gonna get the length of
our parrot object and this looks like a
built in function and then on line three
we're going to print the lengths of
parrot Oh take that out so print length
of parrot the output will be the number
of letters in Norwegian blue which is
four six eight space ten so it's either
gonna be 10 or 11 it probably counts the
empty space so it's probably gonna be 11
or I can add 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 plus 4 is
13 14 yeah so it counts the empty space
as well
so call lower ohnparrot after print
online through so we're in call our
parrot variable and called the dot lower
and this should lower case everything
when it prints out now cool all right
and same thing for upper so parrot dot
upper and this is going to make it
uppercase alright so we are now gonna
create a variable called pie and this is
just create a float floating variable of
3.14 and we are going to call it str pi
and this is going to print pi because pi
is a floating number in order for us to
print it as a string it's gonna take
that we could call pi and print pi just
sign but if we want to declare it as a
string we need to change it and there
you go 3.14 we're good to go man
all right so
on line three we want to call we want it
to print the length of ministry and then
on line four we want to take ministries
ministry dot upper so let's get back in
on BAM
so 27 and the Ministry of Silly Walks
alright so we just want to print and
monty python to the console so print
monty python and that should be it cool
all right so here we are going to
declare a variable the underscore
machine underscore goes inside to a
string value of pain so this is gonna be
equal to pain exclamation point and then
go ahead and print the letters for our
machine this part goes BAM Bing Bing I
so prints a concatenated string spam and
eggs only three just make sure includes
faces after spamming and all right so
print first word is spam space plus and
space plus eggs and there's no period
and this should concatenate it together
so we have spam and eggs so we want to
turn 3.14 into a string then run the
code again so STR this is gonna say turn
this into a string and then when we run
it it's in it's part of our string so
we're gonna take a look at this let's
see we have string 1 Kamelot string 2
place let's not go into place modulus
and string with string go that comes
after it okay so this is saying if we
modulo this string it's going to take
the first string put it in there the
second string put it in there so let's
not go to Camelot
tis a silly place is what its gonna come
out that's kind of cool I like that it
makes it's a different way of
concatenating the strings and it's it's
a little bit faster I think than having
to put plus than space plus in the space
so you it might be a little more
intuitive alright so now it's your turn
we have we have
we refresh this page I don't think it
loaded properly there we go
so now it's your turn we have the
underscoring the code to show you we've
got Nietzsche inside the string replace
to 3% etc Ximena alright so first thing
first we need to let it know that we
want this to take oops the strings
and then we also need to replace this
with that so it knows what to do let's
see what's going on what is your name
so Ryan put looks like it's gonna be a
prompt so we'll go with my my youtube
name Pizza poker guy 87 was your quest
Python and what is your favorite color
oh no I really like red so your name is
cute super great assembly request is 5
thought your favorite color is red so
it's able can catenate it all together
and looks like we're gonna do a little
bit of a quick review right here so
online 3 creates a variable my strengths
when I set my string equal to Python and
then we will do online for print the
length of my string so we will set my
string print the lamps with my string
how do we do this so we have print Len
my under sir you had a brain fart there
for a second
and then we are going to print my string
my underscore string dot upper and so we
are going to have here it's going to
print the length of my string followed
by Python in all caps good to go so we
messed around with a little bit strings
there some built-in functions that we
can call on strings and up next in the
next video it looks like we're gonna be
messing with the date/time library so
we're gonna be importing a library and
then using the library in this case
regards to date and time so I'll see you
in the next high thawne video and as
always constructive criticism criticism
is appreciated and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
