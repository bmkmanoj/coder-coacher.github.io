backing man packages with NPM we are now
in package niceties so let's go ahead
and open up that section how to NPM and
then we'll jump on down to package
niceties all right tonight I think I
opened the wrong one yeah sorry so how
do it yeah
so what I've noticed is that when I'm
zoomed in a lot for the video this menu
gets a little weird so don't don't be
you see right here I just kind of store
it a bit so it's just the zooming in to
help everyone see it more easily all
right so we've created a package.json
file but it's missing a few a few things
that you'd normally expect if you type
in NPM install you'll see no description
no repository field no readme data
before we can share this work of art
with the world we need to make a little
more polished okay so basically what
it's saying is that there's three things
that every package needs to have a
description a repository field and then
the readme data for you sure this work
our first let's create a readme day to
read me dot MD file with a bit of words
in it so we know how to create a file we
do touch and then we'll do read touch
we'll do it exactly like let's say
readme MD so there's we created that
file let's go ahead and open that up and
when you put a check out my channel
youtube.com slash coding tutorials 360
okay cool so I readme files good to go
next we need to add a repository filled
with the URL so let's see what how we
can go about that we have package dot
JSON and I believe all we have to do is
add repository and let me see here
repository filled and JSON the files the
URL and a description so I think we have
to
and a description you can edit the
package.json by hand or use MPN knit
again okay so I'm gonna do it by hand so
we have this description and we'll put
let's do this searcher for learning
actually will do uh will do this free
free code camp manage packages with NPM
save that and then we're also going to
add a repository so we'll do it right
here just because this is how actually I
did after scripts in the previous when I
did this live so we're gonna have
repository and a repository is actually
an object it has a couple different
parameters the first one is type so
we'll go ahead and put type in here oops
and excuse me and the second what the
type we will just put get and then we're
gonna do the URL so the URL we go ahead
and put something in like I don't just
make it up right so HTTP colon slash
slash W like coding tutorials 360 comm
slash NPM something like that save that
and I believe we are good to go so we've
added our description we created the
readme data with some data in it we
added a repository field and let's go
ahead and see if we did everything
correctly so we're gonna do how to - and
p.m. or let's do I think we have to do
NPM install first some craziness
happened here
so what did we what did we miss right
expected token author let's jump back in
to author
so we'll put coding tutorials 360 let's
save that so it looks like we're missing
something so we have NPM install
unexpected token a at thirteen four oh
so you see right here I don't we forgot
to put a comma so that's probably what
broke it there so NPM install there we
go and it says no repository field did I
spell repository incorrectly yes I did
so as you've probably learned by now
that all the back end stuff is very very
specific
just like coding in general a little
less visual so when something breaks you
just have to read the error message and
it kind of slow down and some somebody
like me who kind of just scans things
it's a little bit a little bit rough for
me so you'll see okay we got a warning
now let's go ahead and verify so how to
- NPM verify so it looks like we're good
to go
so things take away from this are that
we you know obviously work through your
error messages as we have here expect
that you are going to get a few errors
as you're learning this but also the
main things is that there are certain
things that are required when creating a
package installing them make sure you
have that moving forward to read me file
the description the repository and I
obviously you want to send this to a
correct repository but as always guys
don't forget to Like subscribe and share
and support me on patreon a special
thanks to you who do I will see you guys
in the next video so thanks for watching
hey guys thanks for watching the video
special thanks to our sponsor dev
Mountain go dev Mountain comm if you're

housing is included in the tuition so
you can get up and go and not have to
worry about where you're gonna live you
just go and immerse yourself fully in
the experience
and check them out and special thanks to
you who support me on patreon if you
