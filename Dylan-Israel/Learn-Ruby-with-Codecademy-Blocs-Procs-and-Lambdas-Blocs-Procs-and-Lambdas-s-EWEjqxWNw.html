on blocks procs and lambdas so let's get
started here
we're going to just be reviewing the
times block and if you don't remember
with blocks are there kind of like
built-in methods so in this case it
wants us to print five times there's a
couple different way we could do this
this is probably the most efficient way
Bam Bam Bam I'm a block five times nice
so just click them all
what are you clicking we've created an
array called fibs and place the first 10
through Bonacci numbers and I create a
new variable double fist instead of
equal the result of calling fibs click
the block you pass to click should
double each Fibonacci Fibonacci number
similar the example above so let's see
here okay so I create a block called
double fibs and then we're gonna say
numbers nums say
oh actually it's just I'm so stupid
I didn't create double flips today
doubled there's four ships equals and
we'll just set that let's see good - but
doesn't
all right let's see if that will work
all right so went a little bit of a
brain fart here
let's reset this code real quick we're
going to initialize double bar fibs
equals Ugra oh oh we want to set it
equal to a equal to v Lex
all right so then we see
two four six and sixty 26:46 a Luger
that looks like it should work does
indeed include two so what is the issue
that we're having here we're gonna work
through our code right now so this is
the original we're setting double fibs
equals two-fifths collect which runs
through this we're saying each number
each iteration we times by two for our
double fibs
let's see if it wants us to change what
we're doing here
all right so we're at a little bit of
crossroads we try worked our way through
it
let's see what's going on and collect
them all let's see this guy's
oh my god we do the same thing okay so
this was a naming naming there so here
we go there we go okay so we're getting
the correct output so it could have been
that too far the extension yearning to
yield check out the code in the editor
we've set up seriously put statements so
you see we're in a block under support
estimates then we're in the block passed
to us let's see here and uh it's gonna
print we're in the method it's going to
print puts yulian block and then yield
let's see we can build this in the
message I mean why do some messes accept
blocks and others don't
it's because message I accept blocks
have a way of transferring control from
calling method block so yield puts
alright so block test puts around block
all right
all right so we want to call it asked us
to call yield name but right now because
of the string we're going to do it like
that
all right yes here oh we didn't give a
block okay so it wanted us to click the
block remember correctly we then need to
do a little something a little block
here name actually I might be convention
actually no that works your son name and
then they want to put my name is Kid
Rock okay so my name my name is too good
of a job to pass up I ask you the source
huh imesh nice constant
there we go okay see my name is Kiera I
forgot I had to use this connection so
cool
so we supplied it then we did it find
your own method double so def double
that takes a single parameter gram one
and yields to a block so in this case
then call it was a block that most place
a number parameter by to anything
double any number you like so
Isis is our parameter only want to see
too much yield okay so I look just
we called it last time here we need to
yield around 1 this means it will still
work when we call it this way but double
then our argument we it's just stupid
the same for argument in this case we'll
get to double - and I'll say the block
is X it puts out go so there it is a
little bit confusing but you get the
hang of it once you get into it it looks
like keeping your code dry don't repeat
yourself d ry dry check out the code
multiples of 3 proc dot new do and
modulo 3 is equal to 0 so let's see what
it's just so 100 to select BAM
all right proxy in text procs are easy
to find you must call proc dot new pass
it like to say create a proc that cubes
a number because i'll cubed of proc new
ok then pass the project method
hi guys sorry about the interruption
there now let's get back to it
all right so the Doppler method rounds a
float which is a number with a decimal
to the nearest integer right a proc
called a round down that will do this
rounding we've added the code to past -
don't stop collect a little bit confused
about this to be honest so we're gonna
need to use dot floors so prop color
round down alright so down so we're
actually creating a method we're
creating a proc alright so rock dot new
C and then here we need to create the
block where X so we take X
and then we want to round it down excuse
me
ex off war yeah okay yeah so this is a
proc we are it looks like we are taking
this changing running up I'm basically
I'm method on it and then we're going to
create something for it and then we can
just reuse this whenever we need it by
the looks of it alright it's kinda like
a mini method using other methods called
procs procs are full-fledged objects so
they have all the powers in ability as
objects blocks do not check out the code
editor we had to rewrite that block a
bunch of times remove blocks replace
them with a prop called over 4 feet so
here you're in a music car door
completely this is a new proc over for
sheet all right this'll do
oh yeah proton you rock that new
okay so we can do two statements also
mmm-hmm all right so if X is greater
than or equal to four
oh we need to do okay so we do the if
statement below okay so do X if X
greater than or equal to four X is equal
to are we replacing it so what it once
is asking us to do x equals four
oops so we can just probably ignore it
and then cool wait wait wait
oh we didn't call it on it but I this
worked okay so we then want to call this
at
and over 400 4 feet over ok so that
didn't work
ok we need to change these because these
are no longer blocks kind of like a
weird input method I don't know why it's
giving us errors we're still saying they
passed just ignore that for now so we
know we didn't have it right so say ok
so issue here is
it's not changing it's like alright so I
won't look this up but since we're doing
it right but I'm not convinced that was
exercise eight
all right what's the name of this wipe
rocks okay
absolutely free
okay so maybe our proc was wrong but I
still believe this should work see what
happens when you les sundry go for okay
so it only prints out okay I thought it
was supposed to change
or missing you know if this will work
without any code in there okay so this
works we're just checking for the ones
that are over all right my mistake I
thought we were changing the values you
can see there's other ways to do it I
probably did a harder way well that's
just goes we're new at it we're still
figuring it out
create your own time you take off the
training wheels
alright so most def greeter that takes
no arguments and yields figure we have
to put after you yield if we have to put
anything all right
we don't have to put anything good all
right now create a prop called phrase
we're gonna rock dot new then we're
gonna do and then we want it to print
outputs pull over there pass this
greeting instead of wha
now we need to call it right suppose I
do all right and then we're gonna call
creator yeah cool
wait
all right mean so he did pass at phrase
all right so we're still struggling with
proxy by word I mean I am so we're going
to go back to the little forums we are
on create your own
I put a comma so there we go
yet again simple simple mistakes we're
slowly figuring out that commas are
killing us in programming yes they
always happen all right now we can
actually call props so high and then do
you want to put hello exclamation point
and then end it we want to call it oops
there we go so you can just use a duck
call we don't need to do what we're
doing beforehand which it looks like
we're just kind of circumnavigating that
with a method it's just a filler method
almost all right next symbols meet procs
so in this case strings dot map and all
right so string sorry using the example
instructions as a guide you collect or
map to create a strings array from the
number three so we're going to set this
equal to string star map and we're gonna
do at and then I act calling because
that's the symbol and I forget forget
what the I it's 200 for s
all right
Oh oops numbers all right there we go
and you see how now it's just a string
that's all doesn't look too much too
much crazier but that's basically it
all right now we're moving on to the
lambda like procs lambdas are objects so
lambda let's see
see the demo Emma puts so lambda is
basically proct on you
so let's say I'm a method
I'm a lambda all right it looks like
it's just takes out a few things so
lambda parameter block it's on life or
create a new variable called symbolize
store a lambda so symbolize equals
lambda that takes one parameter
3:01 and then gram 1.2 all right it's
not worked out lambdas first procs let's
see here
so lambdas returned basically and procs
do not meaning that I mean that this
will run and change this Hey it's like
it's hard to explain but basically
alright so let's see how the proxies
Batmen will win so this returns Batman
will win so the reason that it prints it
out is because it returns it immediately
in the proc so this gets returned right
away
meaning that you never get to this so
when it then when we then run def Batman
Island right here for lambda the reason
it says Iron Man will win is because it
doesn't return this right away it
evaluates the rest of the code and at
the end of it this is what it's going to
print out so basically procs don't
evaluate the rest of the code right here
for the situation but land this do I
guess it's the best way I can explain it
create a lambda symbol filter all right
that takes one cram
checks to see if
see if that works
create a new variable called symbols
symbols
oh my underscore array dot select filter
all right do you define a lambda cult
symbol filter all right the first thing
first it looks like
you
all right uh it looks like we may be
calling our our simple filter all right
so at some filter
you
all right so we have Prime one that is
we're gonna need that symbol
I forgot lambda whoops all right that
should work now there we go
a little bit of a syntax error I knew we
were close so quick review a block is
just a bit of code praça save block we
can use over and over and a lambda is
just like a proc the only good about
number of arguments it gets and returns
its calling method rather than returning
immediately little bit next review odds
and ends arrays full sorts of objects we
only want the integers numbers decimal
points create a new variable called it's
alright so it's and store the result of
odds and and select make sure ends dot
select with a block that checks if the
element is block it checks if it will
that work now
not select and then this will leave it
will huh we actually actually so let's
look at the hint
so we have our intz it's equal to odds
let's select and then our block should
be checking if it is a integer
odds and it
all right--so odds and thunders for
hands so what are we doing around here
we're checking to see if it's an integer
our name is right now
all right let's check the glossary and
see what section we were on here on 17
to 21
oh did we need to create our own that
would make sense
let's see
we forgot the actual parameter so that
makes sense simple air here so we're not
actually comparing anything here we're
just kind of having code there so we
need to call this line of code on a
parameter a index value rather up here
now it should work so then we get our 42
or 3 and our neck pain that makes sense
create a prop called under 100 new
X parameter or access
now we need a pass or prop to a method
we want to create a variable called
youngsters and set it equal to calling
dot select on ages
it just got select so it's gonna take
all the values and then we want to call
our take the proc and convert it to a
block and then we get our youngsters dem
youngsters that 94.7 aerial dancer
all right now we want to create a lambda
called first half so first underscore up
equals lambda and the chicks of the hash
value is less just all right that checks
if a hash value is less than that is
early an alphabet than it none do you do
anything with the crew hash it make sure
cheese capital in you should include a
key value so ever he ever value
all right and let's see passing and
lambda2 a method to finish up let's go
ahead and create a variable called a I'm
store to understand their good old ass
to mouth
and the ATM I set it equal to equal to
crew dot select all the values
that's your first half half the filter
on these and that should work just fine
so perfect little bit tricky but uh you
saw towards the end I got a little bit
easier we ended up being able to create
our own lambdas and our own procs a
little bit quick quicker so we're
finally getting to the meat and potatoes
and guys object-oriented programming
last four sections so we're going to be
using classes so yeah nice little thing
here telling us to for more advanced
Ruby and our new Ruby's for rails 4 so
what we of course will be doing that but
yeah so look forward to the next section
object-oriented programming where it
looks like we're gonna be working with
classes all right
