responsive design with bootstrap
normally I try to do 10 I'm in mistake i
only did nine the last time so we're
going to go 10 to 20 this time so ditch
custom CSS for bootstrap my cats are
very hyped right now so here any any
noise going on it's my little kitten
alright so h2 element should no longer
have the class read text text primary
alright so find out right we want to
change this to the class that's in
bootstrap called text primary so now
that's blue so there's that to paragraph
Owlman should no longer use mah no space
they should use so actually gear this
entirely if you run it you'll see that
we got right amount of space so i'm
going to remove the smaller image add
the image responsive alright so in size
smaller image we're going to say IMG ash
responsive and see right there to just
the size of the screen and that's our
first one excuse me so your span element
should be inside your p element alright
so here's how you do this jostling its
top three things cats hate
so let's say they want us to put this in
there so top take things cats and then
our span effect just 88 so and then you
see it's right there red so that's text
ash danger and we'll just change this to
love cool so um just talking more about
bootstrap and whatnot and if you're not
familiar is 12th grade system so
anything that adds up to 12 you can do
it doesn't have to but it's kind of a
whole point of responsive thing is you
want everything to work together so yeah
so take a look at that I'll kind of give
you an idea what's going on it's pretty
self intuitive so you know so you're a
gentleman and topmost image element
should be nest together within a class
element called different so we have h2
where's our h2 and our image right here
should all be in a div so we'll say div
class equals Rho and then we want to
close the div Oh
hmm
we have two images put it here
maybe they want both images and I just
misunderstanding it huh
alright let's try this one more time
let's just work our way through so div
class equals Rho so that's our first
thing we then want to close it out right
here and then we want to have another
div for the photo this is going to say
div class equals and then we want to
call them that's extra small and takes
up four spots and then we close that
give their yeah so that fixed that and
then your h2 element should be nested to
calm extra small dash 8 all right so I
fine I thought it might just be
something built into here I was right
that's good so div column div class is
we want to have another column for our
row that is using column checks or small
dash 8
sorry I got distracted by the fact that
looks so weird alright so now you can
see right here that's kind of going to
the top so it cats photo 8 is taking up
like eight out of the 12 spaces and the
image is taken up about four so blue has
our third one alright add an eye element
to the classes fought and fought thumbs
up what next your I element within your
button element
so what's your thing to do no way that's
right all right let's get some you know
this is the first time I've had to get
some help on this site so let's see
what's going on here help was just like
a chat log it's not good iphone awesome
let's let's actually read the
instructions these icons are these icons
are trading phones
there we go what we added an iso Adonai
element so all right so something's
working here mr. I am oh all right and I
element
with the classes
then we have to nest it properly so i
don't i don't actually know if I've ever
used the I element so there we go took
me a second but we're all caught up we
have our thumbs up go you should add a I
def class within your delete button so
where is our delete they're all up here
so like delete and we want to add I
class equals ah ha da trash except they
wanted us to nest it so let's go ahead
and do that
see that one changed ever so slightly oh
that looks like the fonts going off the
end and we're just going to in the
interest of time we're going to just go
ahead and copy this info are for our
info button
here's our info and you can run it to
make sure Oh
make sure all your cells contain items
up for
already did it for like okay cool I
don't remember doing it for like but
related there it is I think that's five
necessarily radio buttons inside one div
with class row alright so now we're
going to be doing our radio buttons if
you figure out what those are the site
indoor/outdoor loving and so where are
we so we're going to div class equals
Rho cool and we want to close it after
the radio buttons slosh around and then
we're probably going to give it a column
was it column extra small so let's see
here I'll call our exciting day of class
equals cosh X ss6 and then when it
closed the day of oh and I get wrong so
each one this is going to get its own
column so we have to create one more dif
equals call excise s6 and now we get to
close this div and now we should just
take up the two spots see they're taking
about equal amount make sure you to the
gym elements is exposing today just
closed room
Oh question so and make sure you close a
div and not a row you can't close rose
all right cool I think that was six
necessarily your checks blocks inside
one div alright so we have three check
boxes 12 2 by 3 is 4 um from there we
should be able to figure it out so again
we start with a row because they're all
lined up in a row and first thing we
probably want to do is just close this
after that we want to have a div class
equal to home excess cash for and then
we're actually just for sixth i'm going
to copy that oops and then each one of
these will get a space of four out of 12
for their spacing for each one of these
levels facing so subjective
and then we have a /div and now when we
look at it here you should see that
they're all evenly spaced and we're to
get good to go again I apologize I'm
coming off of a pretty bad flu and cold
so um if I stand alone to the weather I
apologize I'm very dumped up on cough
medicine right now so give the submit
button in the formula classes button and
button primary alright so we want to
we're using bootstrap and we have has
all this great stuff but we're not
taking advantage of it everywhere we're
going to fix that so we're going to
class equals BTN btn-primary so there it
is that does that and now we want to add
some other stuffings I class equals fafa
dash paper dash plane so that's their
submit
and we have to close our I of course /i
let's go ahead and just bring this down
a little bit so there's our cool paper
plane to submit it and give your text
input from your class form control sub
text input plus form control
I think it's this line is what their I
will sick think that's what they want us
to go let me just check real quick where
we're at sorry guys so we have three
more to go alright so this your for
submission button and text input and div
called Gloucester oh so form submission
button is down here and text input okay
so we want to put those on the same line
so how do we do that we do a div class
equals Rho we put them both inside this
div and then we probably where we get
extra still seven for the input div so
we want our we want the text input to be
bigger because all we need is button
submit for the rest of it so that makes
sense to me so x x 107 and then we want
to close that div and then we have a div
class equals column extra small five
very good very good and we are going to
close that div
right here /div and let's save and
submit very good let's check our work
real quick though so there you can see
there's a little bits facing but this
one is bigger than this one that's all
we need to know all right create a
bootstrap headline all right so at age
three element here page so change three
and we're going to say Klaus is equal to
text dash primary and say bootstrapping
it bootstrapping it all right and good
well so we need to do and then we will
apply the class text / center very good
and then we won't show the text out J
query query playground very nice
dip out of class alright so now
we're going to get creative let's just
have the class equal to container dash
fluid / ative and i think that's going
to be it for today so you saw that we're
we're messing a lot more with the grid
system this is something that I actually
using some of my classes so bootstrap is
a really widely used i really suggest
getting familiar with it responsive
design is the only design you're going
to be doing if that's what you're
interested in as well and web
development because everything needs to
be responsive nowadays people around
their phones more than anything else
