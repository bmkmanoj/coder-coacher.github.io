free code camp we are on forest fires
dancing we'll be doing a lot of the same
stuff we now have flags so it's going to
equip that so this is gonna give us a
spine flag which we're gonna be able to
specify what flag to find by using a
string and pick up flag in the same way
so the goal here is to avoid the
fireballs so avoid the fireballs you can
nest in a statement inside another
statement to make more complex choices
so we've been doing that if the evil
stone is on the left go to the right
side I guess this is an evil stone so if
position
so this is evil son right here so if
evil stone is on the left go the right
side so we'll say we want to move XY 246
I guess for you 622 Ellis go left side
basically we're moving side to side so
this is 34 22 else go to the middle
which is 40 22 so if it's a left go all
right if it's on the right left if it's
not there at all good the middle let's
see if we did this right
so we're dodging the flames and we're
dodging the
the evil stone we're gonna stay away
from the evil stone very generic name
like it's the point across I like it
alright I think we're probably good here
you also notice that we have these green
flag so see I dropped a flag there those
will be more important upcoming levels
cool
next up stillness in motion when we do
using more nested if statements please
stay in the center to avoid the
headhunters kill 15 incoming emotions so
we want to stay where we're at so
imagine each if/else has a container so
if they pass this line attack
so if it's a munchkin we want to attack
it we don't want to take anything so
creative
oh they break it up for us is very nice
so if our enemy so fine if there's a
nearest enemy if there is an enemy find
the distance to the enemy so we'll save
our distance it is equal to distance to
the enemy that we're looking for and
then we'll create an if statement here
so if distance it is less than five go
ahead and attack attack that enemy else
the enemy is far away then shield do we
have shield
oh we do here at shield so this is
probably some sort of defensive thing
that might be our block else they move
back to X which we do oh cool let's go
and submit to see if it works
you know what I think we didn't put
specifically munchkin in there
hey nice eye pretty straightforward here
alright last the Agrippa defense we're
gonna be using a lot of what we've been
using before now we want to rid the
meadow of the ogres
don't waste your cleave only on a few
enemies we start with the distance to to
catch as many as possible find the
distance so if there's an enemy so wall
true
so basically run this while it's true if
there isn't and check to see if there's
any finding there something if they are
there find the distance of our distance
of that enemy and then again if distance
is less than five and we'll combine this
in one and hero dot is ready cleave
what we want to do is we want to then
have the hero cleave oh you forgot one
of these bad boys else just attack you
good so basically only cleave when
there's a budget and when enemies get
within five I don't think we are gonna
survive this oh my god we barely
survived it I thought we're gonna have
to upgrade our armor there Michael so
