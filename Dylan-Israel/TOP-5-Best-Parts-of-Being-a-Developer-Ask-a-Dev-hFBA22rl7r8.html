the top 5 things that developers
specifically web developers in that
video hate about being a developer or
really kind of set them off
and today's video is going to be the 5
things that I personally love about
being a developer this isn't necessarily
going to be specific to web development
so much as the things that I think
really stand out about programming that
makes it such a great career as well as
the things that are just really awesome
about it in general I guess I just want
to do a quick shout out to traversée
media who recently did a video titled
self-doubt in programming and web
development I thought it's really cool
that he made this video it essentially
talks about some some issues that he had
when he was a younger gentleman and and
how he overcame them and if he can
overcome these these issues in his past
that you can all and become a great
developer and so can you I thought that
was really cool I just want to share
that with with it you guys in case you
haven't seen it yet
so before we go over these five items
and why I think they're they're my
personal favorite things about being a
developer it's like I actually tried to
make them as broad as possible because I
want you to take what's on this list and
see if whatever job maybe maybe being
the developers not for you but see if
when you look at the job you're going
for if you can at least check off a few
of these because I think everything on
this list is going to make you happy in
your career choice it's not necessarily
going to be specific to being a
developer these are five great things as
to why I love being a developer but
they're general enough that you can
apply it to whatever role that you are
interested in and I would say if you
don't have three out of five of these on
your list chances are it's it's probably
not going to be a good long term fit for
your happiness because we work a lot and
not not as developers just in our
lifetime we will spend a lot of time at
work and if you don't enjoy your work
you're going to be very unhappy
individuals so think on a very high
level about what it is that job tie
provides and these are some of the
things I think you maybe you can grade a
job on to sort of just preface this list
now the first thing a first and most
important thing that is you're
constantly learning that's sort of my
number one thing is that you're
constantly learning and if that sounds
bad to you you are not gonna make it as
a developer I'm sorry my friends I and I
say that not to discourage you but to
warn you right I did a video on engineer
truce channel where it was reality's
first expectations of a full-stack
developer and one of the comments on
there was like who wants to learn every
day that sounds awful it's like no man
that actually is probably one of the
better parts of being a developer
because I and you know most people hate
their jobs I think it's something like
70% and I equate that to a couple things
one most people get paid and two
you're doing the same task again and
again and again after about a month or
two at your job maybe three at most
you're usually doing the same thing and
if you're not having to think and you're
doing the same repetitive task you're
really just coming in for a paycheck and
you're not really going to enjoy your
time while you're at work and we spend a
majority of our life working it's
important that we enjoy what we do and
if you don't it's really gonna affect
you in a very negative way so learning
constantly and being challenged and and
evolving getting better it's one of the
best parts of being a developer because
you know that every day something new
right every day is a new problem a new
procedure a new I knew whatever and it's
exciting and you don't have to say oh
man I gotta do the same old same old and
that will happen as a developer but it
is one of the fields where you are
constantly doing new stuff and you're
using your brain right here a lot of
times it's just the same old these are
the steps to do these things you know
the 10 steps now for the rest of your
life do 10 sometimes do 8 right and so
learning constantly is one of the major
benefits of being a developer
number two is you can do any in the
world anywhere in the world
theoretically this is a great profession
because I can take a laptop go to
Ireland see see my roots see that 60%
Irish and see hey I did a roots DNA
you're actually my great-aunt how's it
going great auntie or whatever goodnight
I I thought I'd just roll up I heard you
have decent internet and I'm gonna live
in Ireland for a bit right uh it was
just a to unpractical but what I'm
really trying to say is we've we have
developers for instance one of my
co-workers is in Croatia and he's
travelling to a new country every month
or so and you know he's working on his
stuff and everything's great so it's not
a unrealistic thing is if you want to
get up and go you can you know work from
home sometimes all right well the great
things about being developers you can
just work remote you don't have to be
going all the way to Croatia you can go
all the way to your apartment put on
your PJs and just go to work and it's
it's an amazing thing and a lot of
people you know when they buy their
houses or they live they don't live too
close to work especially if you live in
a more metropolitan area or downtown
area where you have to drive an hour
plus each way that's a very common thing
and it's really you know you get back a
lot of your day being able to have that
ability for some point in your career to
maybe work remote if that's what you're
interested in so from a very practical
standpoint number three is that the job
itself is amazing and I said I base that
off a couple things and we've gone over
in other videos with stats and saying
where it's gone but in terms of being a
developer in this this period of time
not only are there a lot of jobs there's
a lot of growth and the salary is very
good these are the three main things
that you really need to look at when
deciding what type of career to go into
how many jobs are there how many new
jobs are being created and how much
money are we gonna be making right
because we ain't doing any of this
for free so what I what I'm trying to
say is that as a from a from a very high
level it is a great field to get into
and it's one of the things that
originally attracted me to it right I
wanted when I was in school still in
school I decided to computer science
because I you know I noticed a job
market and the last thing I wanted to do
was to spend four plus years in school
and then have to spend four plus years
trying to find a job right and maybe I
get a job and lose a job and all my god
I have to go back into the workforce
it's not really that big of a deal as a
developer it's a great industry to be in
from a very pragmatic standpoint and
it's also one of the the best jobs you
can have to transition to two other jobs
within the industry right so what I'm
trying to say is let's say I'm a I'm a
software developer for whatever reason
I've lost my passion it's not for me
anymore you can pretty easily transition
to being a project manager to being a
business analyst a lot of times they
really are looking for technical people
who can take on these these less
technical roles because not to mean
developers do it or you know so but it's
a great job to have in that aspect
because it gives you slightly different
career paths as well um number four is
you can use the outside of work and what
I mean by that is this is one of those
skills that can scale in your personal
life if you let it right not every job
you take in the world not every skillset
you've learned applies I'll give you a
good example my mother is a nurse she
has an excellent career she checks off
the growth she checks off the salary she
checks off the amount of jobs she checks
off the learning constantly because
you're constantly doing different things
in a medical field and you deal with
people so it kind of breaks it up a
little bit in that way maybe you can do
it anywhere in the world but not remote
so maybe not there but in terms of using
outside of work it's really not super
practical I mean maybe if as a child I
cracked my head open she could patch it
up but in terms of her personal
well-being it's not the best skill set
to have while being a developer these
are skills that you can apply really in
any direction or
you can freelance for work you can if
you have any projects say you have a
project that has nothing to do with
software you're still probably gonna
need an app you're still probably gonna
need a website you know you're still
probably going to need to be familiar
with you know ecommerce and just all
this sort of stuff that you just
naturally become more and more familiar
with as a developer because you know the
tech and software and all sort of you
start becoming more technical a tech
savvy and these are things that are very
crucial to to you and as a developer you
gain a lot of skills that if you choose
to and a lot of people don't but you do
have a skill set that can be taken to
the to a level that a lot of a lot of
skill sets can't right maybe I was an
accountant you can do your own
accounting so there's another example
but as a developer I think you get a lot
more leeway in that than many other
professions and the fifth and final one
that I really consider one of the
rarities in this world is your hard work
does do pay off and it does pay off and
what I mean by that is being a developer
is one of those things that you can
carry yourself to the finish line if you
work hard enough and you are good enough
there's a lot of amazing developers who
never you know who have got gd's or
never got a GED or or they are
self-taught and you know just the fact
that you can be a self-taught individual
make six figures provide a great life
for you travel the world do all these
amazing things it's it's really one of
the few fields where you can pull
yourself up by the bootstraps and go
that next level if you want to make more
money you have the ability to become a
better developer on your own time to to
take that and learn the more in-demand
languages in-demand frameworks in demand
whatever right and jump into that field
get a pay bump and go right it's you're
really the cap of your income although
you know there is some market demand and
whatnot but if you can prove that you
have
there's more money out there for you to
get that if you can prove that you're a
good developer you can get started in
the industry these are all things that
you really could just your hard work
will pay off in this industry it's not
true for everything else and um I'm not
saying that it should be for everything
right like the standard example is
medical right so you want your nurse you
want your doctor you want your brain
surgeon to have to you know we don't
want that we don't want the YouTube
brain surgeon you I mean where they look
I watch ten brain surgeries and I
practice on that nerf football right
there you see that football right there
it is in ten pieces perfect right so the
fluid I'm trying to make is it's not
practical for everything but in a
software development you know cell being
self-taught is something you're gonna
have to learn anyhow and the best
developers I've ever met have been
self-taught and 90% of developers
consider themselves taught because you
really don't learn anything about
development in school for the most part
some people will disagree about that but
that's my my general opinion but your
hard work does pay off is is the moral
story so the harder you work and the
smarter you work in terms of that and if
you're hungry and driven you can
accomplish what it is that you want so
those are my five reasons I love being a
developer I'd love to know what your
guys's reasons are because these I these
are really it and it and it was hard to
articulate this because I never actually
sat down and I knew like you never
actually sometimes you're just so happy
that you don't really think about why
you're happy and I actually found out a
really hard time thinking about the
things that I loved about the profession
not that it was hard because they're
untrue but being able to articulate
clearly what drew me into the profession
that wasn't a very practical sense the
practical one was very easy because
we've done a lot of videos about that
but sort of the the overarching if I had
to describe the five basic things as we
did well with what we track I mean what
what attracted me to this field and kept
me in this field and its continuing to
grow my love for this field this would
be the
five so I'd love to know what your
guys's five are and if you think
anything I've on my list is wrong well
you're wrong and we don't need to listen
to your comments no please simply share
with me I appreciate it guys don't
forget to comment like subscribe share
support me on patreon all that good
stuff see you next time bye hey baby
what is one thing that you like about me
being developer quick shout out to
device plus comm if you're interested in
the latest IO tease hacks do-it-yourself
projects revolving around Arduino and
Raspberry Pi there's some great how-to
guides I highly encourage you to check
