design basic HTML in html5 let's go
ahead and jump right in HTML stands for
hypertext markup language is basically
the bones of the internet at the end of
the day let's go ahead and jump right in
so you'll see here we have this h1 tag
when we run our code it's going to say
hello let's actually zoom in a little
bit
so this h1 is called a heading tag that
goes from h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 all the way to
h6 h1 being the largest h6 being the
smallest and we're going to go ahead and
change this content and you'll see that
it will now say hello world when we run
our code again let's go ahead and run
this real quick
looks like we got a so we want to have a
change our we're going to create a
second one I just said as I was saying a
second ago we have our H - H - you'll
see this is going to be slightly smaller
and in this one we're going to call put
cat photo app it's going to run that and
you'll see we have a slightly smaller h2
tag now a lot of times you'll use these
four headings and subheadings and things
like that and you'll see now we have
this paragraph tag paragraphs a great
worth way to separate text looks like it
already had it in there for us cool
Oh some reason is shown in here this is
still the beta so some of this may be
going a little little crazy but you'll
also see from here we're going to pass
them in this massive paragraph it's
actually going to rap down around once
it hits the end of the page there's our
sort of filler text if you will oh looks
like it's doing the same thing when we
go ahead and reset this real quick and
clear my code make sure we don't have
any issues we run this all right so
there's comments in HTML you can comment
things out by using this caret
exclamation - - so let's say we just
wanted to comment out this first h1 like
so and we run this you'll see that our
first hello world is commented out a
quick way to uncomment and and to
comment is a control shift if you hold
ctrl shift may hit the slash key it will
comment and uncomment what you want it
to so let's go ahead and comment you'll
see everything is back now I'll clear
the code one more time make sure we're
not having issues here
alright so leave the h2 on common eight
so that is visible on your page so let's
go ahead and again it's a dot dot slash
there we'll move this one and comment
out your paragraph element so it's not
visible again we can go ahead and select
this and control slash and you'll do it
all sick so now we only have the cat
photo app going and we want it's asking
us to delete our h1 so let's go ahead
and remove that and we'll move this h2
to the top of our editor very nice again
let's go to reset our code here so we're
going to create a second paragraph
element and you'll notice that when we
create the second paragraph element that
because it's a new paragraph is going to
drop down a line it's not going to be
associated with the other paragraph
exactly as you would expect a paragraph
work go ahead and throw that in here
you'll see it drops sound like that and
what else do they want so they in html5
they've introduced a lot more tags to
kind of that go along with your sections
for instance the header tag usually goes
for like the main header page you have
the footer which is kind of your footer
at the bottom you have your nav tag
video tag article and sections so the
main tag here is going to basically say
hey this is our main content on the page
and where do they want to serve a pit do
they want us to wrap it around the h2
tag all right so we're going to go ahead
and put a main tag in like so let's go
hit down select main I believe that's it
so these paragraphs right now are the
main content we have on here and next
we're going to be working with images so
you can put images in your HTML as we've
seen on a bunch of webpages right the
way that you do it is you have this
image tag and so far we've got a closing
tag and an opening tag like in this
paragraph and this h2 the image tag is
just there's no closing tag it's just
kind of like an insert your image insert
and you have this source the source is
the location of your where your photo is
in this case HTTP your image source comm
slash your image so JPEG if we were to
actually throw this in the browser this
would go to a location where the images
and we'll pull up whatever image this is
supposed to be oh that's an example so
let me actually pull up a real a real
picture here sorry that was just
something they made up I don't think
that actually exists out there I like
here so this bit ly will take us to
where this images there we go
and let's go ahead and insert this image
and the alt tag in here is let me give
you that so it's basically the alt tag
is it there
a screen reader or the image doesn't
display or fails to load it will display
that so let's say that the cat picture
doesn't load we just want to put cat
picture or something so the text
displays and so on and so forth so let's
go ahead and copy this and we are going
to add the image right below the
paragraph here and we're going to just
remember it's just the one tag I set a
source or is it equal to this so we have
alt equal to cat it's going to close
that and run our code and there's our
cat picture looking all happy and dandy
the next thing we're going to talk about
is a anchor tag so an anchor tag besides
if they add this little image here I
wish they added more images kind of
breaking this down so this is pretty
good for you so the anchor tag starts
with an A this href is where you want
your page go to so let's say you want to
open a new page or you want to jump to a
different page you'd use an anchor tag
and you can wrap that around pretty much
anything so you can wrap it around a
photo you can wrap it around text
whatever you want so in their example I
have a paragraph and then they have a
part of it that just wraps around linked
to free code camp in our example we're
actually going to wrap an element let's
see they want us to create a element
that links to this location here free
cat photo app calm and cat photos of
this anchor tag so oh it looks like we
are ok it looks like we're just creating
an anchor tag you can do this as well so
we're out a href and in here we're in
passing that URL and then we're going to
have a closing tag and then whatever we
want to click on to go to that location
so in this in this example we're going
to put cat photos as the text
let's run this and now we'll have this
cap notice I notice that it is blue and
when we hover over at the hand becomes a
little clicker so that's one of the ways
you can tell that the anger tag although
that is a CSS property and can be turned
on or off but by default this will
display cool so we set this one more
time all right I think we maybe have
where we need to go so now we're going
to link internal sections of a page with
anchor elements so I'm glad they're
adding this because a lot of people
don't know that this is a thing so let's
say you want to make something where I
click the link at top but I don't
actually want to go to a different page
I just want to jump to a section on the
page and what you're going to do is
you're going to assign an ID to
something and it's going to jump to
where that idea is on your page which is
pretty useful let's see
you should only have two anchors on your
page first a tech anchor tag should have
an href attribute set to bottom all
right
so we're going to create a a anchor tag
here and we're going to set this equal
to hash tag bottom at that hash tag
stands for ID and the second anchor tag
should have name attributes at the
bottom so look at the example here you
have a name oops
we're going to set this to name is equal
to bottom and then up we'll see and then
up here we'll have a href is equal to
and I'll put that hashtag bottom what's
going to happen is when we click on
let's say jump just put jump or
something in here I don't think it gave
us any
Oh
I think it maybe wants us to just let me
read the instructions one more time jump
higher the attacks should have a name
attribute so it's a bottom okay
and the first a section of HS okay so
let's go ahead and actually delete this
a hf and instead we just want to go
hashtag bottom when we run it there we
go what should happen is when we click
this is going to jump to it should jump
to the bottom although you'll see right
here that it actually did kind of but
because we're in an editor it's causing
a little bit of issues so we can't
really showcase it too well but
definitely keep that in mind cuz when
you're creating like a single page
portfolio or something you want people
to jump around and you can assign
animations once you get better so that
it's not just it doesn't instantly jump
you to there all right so we have the
anchor tag again that's an anchor
element with the paragraph let's go
ahead and run this so we have this next
your existing anchor with a new
paragraph just after main says view more
cat photos we're only cat pose is the
link alright so what we want to do is we
want to have a paragraph here we're just
going to create a P tag and we're going
to say view more more this is view more
cat photos right and we're going to take
this first a tag and around cat we're
going to throw this anchor and we're
going to get rid of this second text
that we had a second ago we're going to
take this closing anchor tag and we're
going to nest it right here so what's
going to happen is when we run our code
the only part of it that's going to be
an anchor tag is the cat photo section
not the whole paragraph but just where
we've nested the anchor within
all right make dead links using the hash
symbol
so sometimes you don't want a link to go
anywhere quite yet but you just want to
set it to something so if you want to
set it to something come back to it you
can do what's called a dead link and you
can just set it to a hash tag so
nothing's going to happen when they
click it that's all so you can also turn
your image into a link as well so far
we've only done with text so we have our
imp remember our image here and what we
want to do is we want to just put a a
anchor tag around it wrap it with our
egg and in this instance we're just
going to set the href equal to a dead
link for the time being but when we when
we hover over it now you'll see that
it's working and if you go in the bottom
right corner you'll see it's a you'll
see the hashtag on there as well and
that the hand is there not a point
there's also unordered lists so you can
create lists in here sometimes you use
this for navigation or just to have a
dotted list or a ordered list in this
case we're going to be talking about a
ul which is an unordered list which are
basically just going to be bullet points
each unordered list this is going to be
slightly different is where they want
this you're going to have sort of this
container we haven't actually talked
about containers yet but you're going to
have this unordered list container and
in here for each one you're going to
have a certain amount of list items so
let's say that our list here is my my
name right my full name first first list
item is Dylan the second list item is
Christopher
and the third list item is Israel and so
let's look let's see what that looks
like you'll see we have these three list
items right here and you can style the
use with CSS and different ways but
right now this is just again just the
sort of the bones of it the setup if you
will is kind of how I think of HTML so
that was an unordered list it's also
ordered lists which you basically the
the gist of that is you just you just
have a oh L instead a ul and it will
actually number them for you so I'll go
one two three so let's see you should
have an ordered list for top three
things cats love you see right here we
have our UL right here and now we're
going to have a cat top things cats ate
okay maybe cuz I'm a cat lover I miss I
misread that so within our Oh L we're
going to have several allies and the
save some time we're just going to copy
pasta this and let's see oh they give us
so what are cat things cat eight dogs
water and being awake because they sleep
all day right so you'll see now when we
run this let's look down we have three
instead of being the bullet points it is
now the number ordered list that's the
only difference between ordered lists
and unordered lists you also have input
so we've all filled out online for so
for what you might there those are you
called inputs and depending on what type
of input you create they have types if
it's if it's a simple one-line text
input that type would be text and we're
going to do that right now so we're
going to have an input here and we're
going to set the type equal to text now
similar to the image tag for the input
there is no there is no ending tag is
just the one tag
and you'll see right here now we have
our input we put Dylan this doesn't
actually do anything it but we have our
input box our input text box
there's also placeholders so as you've
seen before sometimes they have they
have values in here already and we'll
put all you have to do here is add
placeholder instead it equal to play
will show a placeholder oh it actually
gave us a value so cat photo URL and
when we run this you'll see that I
already has the value in here one thing
to note about placeholders if it is it
just holds a place and tells like
something in there hence the name
placeholder right so if we put cat in
there and no longer has the cat photo
URL all right so let's continue on now
we've been talking about inputs and you
have to have a way to send your data
right so what we're doing in these
inputs are we creating therefore a form
and so far we we don't have a form
element so let's see where they want us
to put it make your text input typically
you'll have your form element here
wrapping around as a container around
your inputs so we would want our text
input here to go like so let's pass that
in and then we have this action input
now this is this may be a little a
little strange but basically the action
here you're going to have a button that
basically submits your form data all the
stuff that we're storing in our input
boxes our radio buttons are our check
boxes and stuff like that and the action
is going to do something with it so for
right now we're going to it's just going
to go to submit katfoe
but generating data or getting data in
web development is very as well as
generating data but getting data like
this is very crucial it's actually
something I do quite frequently so I
would say get very familiar with getting
form data and forms and kind of how it
all works and so I just mentioned me a
second ago you're going to have to
submit the data one way of doing that is
with a button
so let's look how to create a basic
button and by the way notice that
nothing on here shows the word form this
is purely a like a logic sort of thing
where you're you're kind of just
containing everything in a form that
you're going to do stuff with it's not
going to display on other than the
inputs and the button here so we're
going to have a button and what does
they want the text to be so we need to
type equal to submit this is how your
form knows when you're done basically
when you click this button it's going to
submit this action here it's basically
saying hey when you click button go
ahead and run the action for the form
that's what's going on right now and
then we want to have the text submit and
we of course need a closing tag for that
as well let's run that and you'll see we
have our submit button right below very
nice so there's also this required
keyword so some fields are optional some
are not if we want to fill the bead
required to actually show it we can
going to add this required keyword it
doesn't have a parameter or anything so
we click it we click out it's this is
basically just saying to write required
now what you may do is if we try and
submit you'll see that it's going to say
something here or it's going to be red
or because it's not going to submit it
because it's required that's that's the
gist of it
so we were talking about radio buttons
before if you're not familiar with what
they are we're going to show you right
now so we're going to add a pair of
radio buttons and labels so labels are
labels for each one of our inputs right
now we only have the one text input you
may want to have a label that goes with
it maybe it says you know it's your
first name so your placeholder could be
enter name and your your label
for the input would be first name would
be an example and we're going to do
something similar with radio buttons so
with radio buttons you can have an input
type there's still inputs and we're
gonna have an input and the type is
going to be equal to radio instead of
text right and then it looks like we are
going to give it a name of what name of
indoor-outdoor
all right and we're going to have a
label that wraps around it so in this
first one with a label close our label
and then what did we want the label to
be the first one was going to be outdoor
or indoor it's going to control see this
and the other one is going to be outdoor
let me run this real quick are kulish so
you'll see right now that we do it why I
say we have three oh no it's too sorry
it got nested down so we have our indoor
we have your outdoor answer reminder if
you're not familiar with radio buttons
away radio buttons work is when they're
in a group and these are in a group
because they have the same name right so
the name is indoor outdoor that's
they're in a group together there's
other ways of grouping it but this is a
basic way and you can see the values
through the label for this as well
all right so now let's talk about checks
boxes the main difference between check
boxes and and radio buttons radio
buttons you typically select no you
don't typically in a group you only
select one check boxes you select one or
more or none you can select as none none
one or more there you go
so we're going to three check boxes and
you'll see here that we just have an
input type checkbox' with the name to
show that the check boxes are kind of
for the same thing
personality as well we'll put this right
below here and so do one and once this a
some time we'll just throw a number on
here so this is loving one this is
loving two this is loving three let's go
ahead and run this and you'll see we
have all our check boxes and you'll
notice we can select as many as we want
let's continue on
so you can also for a radio button or
for a checkbox by default have one of
these checked already right so let's say
we want the first radio button to be
checked because we're just assuming your
indoor we can go ahead and add this
checked value and let's say the first
checkbox as well we want to be checked
we can just add checked in here I'd
actually know this is a thing that's
pretty cool but you'll see when our page
loads these are already checked doesn't
mean they can't be unchecked it just
means unload
they're already checked so we've been
talking about containers and we haven't
really used them yet so what a div is is
essentially a container and you'll use
it for a lot of different things the
move code to the left to move coach to
the right to put everything together but
you're going to be using divs all the
time so let's get our in this example we
want to get everything in the div next
year pay elements inside your div
element next your paragraph elements
inside your div element
that's your UL element aside all right
so we're going to this all our text
right here we're going to put into our
own Dib it looks like so kind of how the
main section is a container the div arge
you can only have one main while you can
have as many divs as you want cool oh
let's see where we are in this right now
see if I want to take a break oh we're
almost there we're almost done cool so
when you're starting your HTML week 5
document the way that you let it let
them know that it's an html5 document is
this doctype HTML tag
we haven't actually touched on like
setting up your your structure of your
document but the gist of it is is within
here you're right this is where your
HTML goes you have your doctype tag just
the one and then you have your HTML tags
and within here where you can have our
various content so remember how we at
the very first
action we had an h1 tag we and it's a
hello world this is exactly what was
around it that maybe you weren't seen
beforehand that just the the free code
camp editor was showing just the one
piece and then you have this thing
called the head element and the title
element so the title element is
essentially this right here in the top
left corner where it is the name of the
specific page that you're on which is
basic HTML SEO and you know it runs on
so the best page ever is the title in
here and it's which is a bad example
because you also have this h1 here so
maybe confusing if you're new but that
title goes in what's called a head a
head tag here this is basically a bunch
of like non-visual data that doesn't
actually show up in the page like right
here so you don't see that title unless
you go and look at the tab same thing
with the icon you would set the icon
here you would also link files your CSS
files and a bunch of other stuff here
and then this section would go what's
into the body tag so it doesn't look
like they actually have the body tag in
here but below the head you have your
body tag now your body basically wraps
around all of your main content so you'd
have your body tag like so alright guys
so that was the HTML in html5 section a
pretty good pretty good set up to move
into style sheets so I hope you had fun
