free code camp working on our 50 our
coursework here we have bonfiring
mutations that we're gonna be working
with so what we're trying to do in the
mutations is what's our goal for this
our goal is to check if all the letters
in the second string can are in the
first string so look at this example
this is kind of a good place to get
started is we basically have two inputs
and we're gonna compare them so in order
to make sure we're worried about letters
and not cases so what we're gonna do is
we're just gonna lower case both word so
you could vice-versa
do upper case so what we should start
there and say okay we're gonna say are
zero because there's only two inputs and
this is one array so and then dot to
lowercase so change that first word
hello to lowercase and then do the same
thing for a second word so before we
even get started let's just do what the
easy stuff alright so next what we want
to do is we're gonna do a we're
comparing we're gonna do a for loop but
for which word do we call the length on
word one or word to so when we read this
we are comparing in the second string or
present in the first so what we care
about the first string can be as long
and as big as it wants to be but we need
to know the size of the second string to
see if the letters are in it so however
long the second string is that's the one
we're gonna do for our for loop so we're
gonna do if RI is equal to zero well I
is less than word two dot length so in
this case it would be three four hey
then we increment by one okay
so now we are at the point where we need
to that if you hope
you looked at index of and so in this
case index of is we're going to be
checking the value using index of and if
it's not contained in there it will
return an it and negative one there's a
lot of things you can do with index one
index of but when it returns a negative
one it's not contained within what
you're comparing it to and so because of
that we are going that that's all we're
gonna need to know for index of right
now so it's a little bit of a confusing
one for me anyhow but the way I did this
is I just created a value and I I
compared it with an if statement so
we're gonna take the first word which is
hello and we're say so word one so it's
hello dot index of and then we're gonna
take our second word word two and we're
going to say is it contained in there so
value set it to the index of word to I
so in this case we're saying is this for
the word value is there this letter
let's say an H in E or Y because we're
iterating through it is it you know
that's what we're gonna pair so all we
have to do is it equal it if it's equal
to negative one return false else return
true take this out we do else statement
here this is more code than you probably
need to write else return true
let's let's count our brackets here Bam
Bam Bam
forget the else let's just do return
true and I should work there we go so
let's go over our code real quick and
put some comments in here just as a
quick review and for when we look back
lowercase both inputs both string inputs
inputs for comparison purposes and let
this length a second word is important
because we are iterating through its
letters to see if they are and word one
a little bit wordy so let's go ahead and
drop this down and you should probably
use a multi-line comment if I remember
correctly star slash two slash star
there we go
star slash slash tired to start slash
alright check
place value holder for character
um- one is the results meaning it's not
contained in word one so that's it so
iterate it it iterates through word one
checking each value of word two and
saying oh is it in there if it's not if
it sets this to negative one at least
one of those values is false so then we
return false in our string has solved so
this is probably just understanding
index of and negative one like I said
you can do a lot of stuff with index one
but this was just how I choose to solve
it I'm sure there's someone that has a
better solution but I hope I hope this
helped if you got stuck on bonfire
mutations I know this was one of the
harder ones for me I will see you guys
in the next video and as always
questions comments concerns all that
stuff is appreciated and don't forget to
subscribe and like the video it really
helps me out a ton and it's the it's the
what best way to help the channel I'll
see you guys next time thanks for
watching the video don't forget to Like
and subscribe that helps me out a ton
and I appreciate all the comments that I
get and all the questions I get in the
comments and I'm happy to answer them so
keep them coming and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
