in learning HTML and CSS part 1 in the
CSS box model content so let's go ahead
and jump right in let's skip this first
page just gonna go ahead alright what do
you mean by content okay so we're gonna
be learning about padding and margins
and things like that padding is
basically that box that we have kind of
that we don't necessarily see unless we
assign a border we actually apply
padding to to it on the top part the
left part the right part in the bottom
part or all around to give it more space
to make the box a little bit larger to
keep the content aspect a little bit
more it's gonna be in the center but we
want it to unless we do certain things
we want it to give it some padding and
margin is kind of the opposite where we
from that box from outside the box we
want to pad outside the box paintings
inside the box that's what we're gonna
be doing right now
so you'll see right here that some of
this is a little bit on the outside
we're gonna go ahead and jump in to our
styling here and go to the ID banner -
content remember it's an ID because
because it is a hash tag here and what
we're gonna do is we're gonna give a
padding padding of 30px
just see right here we give it some
padding you'll see now that this is kind
of fitting in there because we we Pat it
out every the left side the right side
the whole deal
now similar to how we did the border the
the we can also do patting of various
sizes as well so maybe we want to pad
only certain parts we can do that
set the padding on the top bottom of the
banner content selector paragraphs to 30
pixels all right so let's go ahead and
jump back to here where were we
so remember top is 30 and we want the it
goes top right bottom left so we want
10px for the right 30px for the bottom
and 10px for the left let's see it's
changed once more so we have a nice big
cutting on here and not so much padding
on the right
so you can also instead of doing all
four at once so you only want to add
padding to the top you can use padding -
top and the same thing with the right
bottom and left
so let's see here oh and the byline
let's go to find the byline class here
we are and we want to go ahead and set
only the top and bottom padding so we
can do padding - top and when we set
that to 20 px and we can do padding -
bottom and we gonna set that 20 px as
well this is on James Jase let's see if
we can find this guy alright so here we
are here now when you run this we're
gonna see now we only have padding on
the bottom in the top gives a little bit
more space for our content so we just
talked about padding now we're going to
talk about margin that's the outside
padding essentially so to think of it
padding itself is the inside we want to
put our content farther away from the
the border while the margin is we want
to take our border and all the other
elements push those away so let's go
ahead and set the margin of list items
so here's our li we're just going to set
a margin here of 5 pixels none of this
works exactly in the same fashion as
padding we're gonna have a top bottom
bottom right left all that sort of stuff
with the margin and we can input it as
so if we need to be specific like that
so you see there's a lot of bit of space
in here that what we want is to change
that up so we want top margin to be zero
right margin to be 20 bottom margin to
be zero and then left margin to be 20
let's go ahead and run that real quick
so now we have these dots I'm not sure
where they came from or if they were
always there but the margin these are
probably off the screen this what was
probably happening all right so we also
have this margin left margin top margin
right margin bottom that we can do so as
of right now we're still only studying
the top you can go ahead and change this
to margin left margin right if you'd
like but this will work as well which is
probably how I would do it if I was
gonna set it to 0px so I think this is
better long term because you may change
how you're styling things so then you
don't have to add anything you just have
to change this one section all right so
we're gonna target the banner so that
the element centers now to Center an
element you can go ahead and just set
March into Auto usually just go ahead
and jump down to here so we want this to
be centered as of right now it doesn't
look to me
so now our div here our content is now
centered within the div it's in
so in here we're gonna go ahead and
reset the default values of the style
sheet so this tells you about something
called the user agent which is the
technical term for our browser and
basically goes in that each user agent
stylesheets our browser style chutes
built in and what we're actually going
to do right now is to go ahead and reset
some of the things that are set by
default in there so like this margin
we're gonna reset and padding we're
gonna reset let's go ahead and run this
to see what it looks like
not much of a noticeable difference in
my opinion but hey
so we're gonna be talking about two
things we're going to talk about inline
elements at block elbert excuse me most
elements are block elements meaning they
kind of will take up a certain amount of
portion and they all can kind of have a
border around them and things like that
and then there's things like texts that
aren't really block elements but how do
I put this
so this well you know let's just look at
some examples that's probably the best
way so we have inline block which let's
read that causes block level elements
behave to behave like an inline element
but retains the features of a block
level element there's basically gonna be
times where you're gonna need to treat
things as blocks or as like a div would
be an example of a block and to do that
sometimes you're going to need to use
display:inline-block so we're gonna do
that for the property of list items here
we're gonna go ahead and to go display
and assign it inline - block that you'll
see right here now everything is lined
up so what happened here was we are
treating these now as elements we go
into here each one of these local
national these are all within one and
then this li class logo does something
and then what we're doing is we're
basically assigning them to the B
together we're saying look stop treating
them like a normal ul treat them as a
block element in this case block
elements fill up as much space as
possible the reason this they're not all
in one line or two lines is because this
is custom CSS but that's why these are
all lined up together like so it's all
those things said is will take you a
second to fully understand what's going
on here but display is something you're
gonna need to get very comfortable with
and what it does as you develop your CSS
so we can do a hidden and visible to
hide certain things so notice that the
loose donate has a class of donate all
right let's go ahead
yes so there's a li class here called
donate si
all right so they want us to define the
class here so what we'll do is we're
gonna add a selector class and because
this is a class we're gonna go ahead and
use the dot and then we want to set
visibility to hidden now when we run
this this should hide this and you'll
see right there it's no longer there now
you may be saying why would I even put
it in there well as you go on and you
make more what we're dealing with right
now it's called static content content
that's not really gonna change at all
now as you move forward in your
programming HTML you're gonna be dealing
with dynamic content content that's
gonna change based off what the user
does and certain and things like that
and that's why certain things are going
to be hidden and severe you're gonna be
changing those values with JavaScript
and things like that but uh all right so
what did we learn we learned about
padding padding is very important it's
gonna be used quite often your CSS to
make things look nice
same thing with margin we also learned
about display which don't really go over
too much in detail here I suggest going
on like w3 schools and really just
playing around with some of their
interactive demos to get very
comfortable with display in all honesty
to this day I'm still not super
comfortable with it but it is what it is
and I suggest you be better at it than I
am
and then visibility something I actually
haven't used too much in my in my coding
experience but a pretty straightforward
concept as well by default your
visibility is shown unless you set it to
hidden so I hope you guys found this
helpful
in going over content and how to kind of
position that using our CSS don't forget
to Like and subscribe and share the
video if you think you know somebody who
would find it helpful and the special
thanks to you supporting me on patreon I
couldn't do without you
I'll see you guys in the next video
thanks for watching alright guys so we
are back in late HTML and CSS part 1 the
CSS box model changing the box model
so it looks like we're gonna be doing a
review of what we learned let's go ahead
and jump into the next slide and see
what's going on here we have these nice
sort of this nice I have to give cook a
de mie credit they have very good
animations just not animations but
images here to kind of showcase what
you're supposed to be seeing
you've seen the border you're seeing the
padding here the content with the actual
rendered width once we add everything
together so just don't then to keep in
mind it really illustrates the box model
essentially the the whole element and
the space it takes up so you notice here
that it goes on to kind of showcase it
and it's showing the CSS here as well so
we have the width we have the padding we
have the height we have a border
box-sizing all that sort of stuff so
again it showcases everything going on
here so what we want to do here let's
actually implement it in the browser so
it looks like we're gonna be doing the
border dash box so what we want to do is
go ahead and apply it to everything and
remember the universal sort of selector
is the asterisk and then we'll do border
box
so I'm not quite sure what the point of
this was
I guess maybe just kind of a review but
uh I'll probably just tag this on the
end of another video thanks for watching
the video special thanks to our sponsor
