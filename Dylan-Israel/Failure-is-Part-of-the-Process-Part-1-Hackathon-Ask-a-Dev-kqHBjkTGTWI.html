importance of failure on your path to
success because a lot of people of this
weird consider can miss representation
of what it takes to be successful it's
like you either went and you were
successful or you went and you were a
failure and recently I had a
conversation with a subscriber and
they're saying Dylan you know I I kind
of look at you as a mentor very humbling
feeling a very strange feeling but
that's neither here nor there and I just
don't see how I could ever be successful
and it was a strange thing because you
know he was talking about how he failed
and failed and failed I was like so did
I so but let me tell you why you're on
the path to success which may sound kind
of counterintuitive because we all fail
at life God knows my barber failed when
he cut my hair recently so let's dive
into it guys I'm going to tell you about
what how I've been unsuccessful on my
path to become a developer how it's made
me a better developer in the process so
I wanted to kind of start off by
showcasing this picture and it's
something that I've I've really come to
believe it's true and in my personal
experience has been and the reason I
want to show it is I think a lot of
people who maybe haven't yet achieved
success kind of do think that you either
are successful or you fail my users you
you gave it a one shot anything you were
there and you're done but in reality to
be successful about this goes for
everything in life right this isn't just
money and jobs this is relationships
right let's say you gave up after the
first time you went on a date you did
you're gonna be lonely y'all and most of
us you are not going to be you know you
you didn't work out in your first
relationship chances are you know that's
99% of the time it's just gonna be you
you're gonna have to have a lot more
cats than I have if that's your dating
strategy right so but in reality what
happens is you you gain something from
your failures you gain something from
your your you know through the process
right it's a journey and I'm just gonna
show you one today but I actually have
five videos of just massive failures on
my part in the moment yeah it sucked
it's not like I say it's not gonna suck
but I did become a better person I
became a better developer and I think
that I gained a lot of value for from
that so I just wanted to kind of show
that so what are we going to be talking
about today well if you've seen some of
my reviews I've talked about some of the
projects I've had this project you're
tube which I thought was a really cool
project was the first hackathon I ever
went to in Los Angeles spin about I
think it was about like 38 or 40 hours
on the project and you know meeting
people that's the whole soul time period
and I got to meet a lot of interesting
people did I win the hackathon no and we
had a pretty good chance cuz there's
like 10 prizes and like 16 teams that we
didn't win a single thing but what but
there is something that I can gain at
this one I have a I have a portfolio
project you I've met some great people
three I've kind of thrown myself into an
environment that now I'm more accustomed
to so that maybe when I maybe when I go
to the next hackathon I feel a little
bit less let's show you guys this thing
I'm actually I thought this was a really
fun thing this was back when I only knew
jQuery just so a lot of people are like
intimidated to go to hackathons I don't
blame him I was extremely intimidated
and I really put myself out there and I
said look I'm probably going to fail I
really am I'm probably going to show up
embarrass myself and I've just accepted
that that was okay right and I'm gonna
learn in the process so you can see like
I we have a so the premise behind your
tube was that you were going to be able
to search for YouTube videos by your
geolocation right and then you would
eventually we would expand idea how and
we built this an HTML CSS JavaScript
jQuery
and some bootstrap so this is let's say
we wanted to type in pizza
oops did not want to print Pizza say we
search for pizza and within 25 miles it
would find it would find the the videos
who uploaded something about pizza
because YouTube when you upload a video
by default will store the geolocation
and you can see here these little icons
are actually the angel hack icon that's
why we threw it over there and the the
premise was that you could support your
local content creators and if you had
something similar like let's say you
wanted a very authentic Mexican dish and
you wanted you thought maybe it would
have a more authentic recipe if we you
know set the geolocation to maybe Mexico
then you can get more related like
enchilada recipes or whatever it may be
and then vice versa for anything else
that maybe the music scene in Austin
Texas you could set it there now we
didn't add that functionality but that's
where it was going so this was something
that I really enjoyed making I met a lot
of good people I got exposed to a lot of
good content but I failed hardcore right
I I had to go up there along with my
team and we presented it and I was tired
and I was nervous and it was something
where I put myself out there and you
know this is the first fail right but I
did learn in the process I learned how
much I could actually accomplish under
pressure I learned how I could work with
teammates I learned you know what what
sort of what actually goes on at a
hackathon and I overcame that experience
and then that way there is a lot of
success in your failures right maybe I
failed the event but now I'm less
nervous about going to hackathons I
understand what to expect I understand
how to participate in a much more
hands-on approach and I think it's
really valuable a lot of times people
they they do go and they just look at
the failure of the event it'd be very
easy right I put myself out there I wave
with teams I devoted an entire weekend
to this and what did I come back with a
free t-shirt right like nothing nothing
great and I was
I'm very proud of our project I
understand why we lost which is good
don't be all don't get like an ego and
say oh I should have one man's
this rig you know don't feel like that
but understand that even though you
failed there are things that you can
take away from it because if you don't
and you don't underst
you don't see the benefit in the process
you're gonna you're gonna lose out on a
lot of the value cuz those big wins
those big wins right
like the like for a lot of you who are
trying to break into software in tech
the big one for you might be landing
your first real salaried role there's
gonna be a lot of failures along the way
right and you need to be prepared for
that and you need to learn from that
right maybe you go through a four five
step interview process and and you by
the end of it you think you got the job
you don't get the job learn from that
process and then maybe next time that
happens you'll get there and when you
get that success right you get that
trophy for instance just know that
that's not the end of your failures
right you're gonna fail a lot of stuff
along the way because your goals are
going to get larger they're going to get
more grand and you're gonna put yourself
out there even more cuz the stakes are
higher and just try and learn from the
failures and you will be successful what
happens is a lot of people stop at this
first failure and I don't want I don't
want anybody here to do that they put
their selves out there that one time
right they they you know whether that's
in relationships you kind of throw your
heart out there and it gets decimated
right hope how many people here I've
just had their stopped on with as
if you did something very personal right
so like maybe maybe I'm like jumping
back to high school you know who you are
you know you're not just kidding but the
point is you uh that you you will put
yourself out there in various aspects of
life learn from it when it doesn't go
your way and don't stop throwing
yourself out there just learn from it
and continue on and sometimes when you
take on a very pessimistic and negative
attitude on life what happens is you you
say hold up last time I put myself out
there whether it be work
of finances whatever it may be I got
crushed I'm just not gonna do it anymore
I'm gonna I must play it safe down the
middle and never actually try and you
know we're talking about bite-sized
steps bite bite bite size and I would I
would encourage you not to take that
approach and I would encourage you to
actually continue having hopes and
having dreams and throwing yourself out
there and if one out of five of your
dreams lands after four failures I think
that's a pretty good success right now
in my eyes so to summarize guys here is
one of my five failures and just because
I'm doing five videos on failures does
not mean that I have failed only five
times I assure you with this week we
could we could start a second channel
with how many times I have failed and
the reason I want to show it is for this
individual who's you said hey you know I
can't look up to you which is so crazy
someone says that but if I if if the
person that this this person looks up to
has failed maybe they will feel better
about their own failures and understand
that you know what is just part of the
process and we are going to continue to
strive to get better and we're going to
need to accomplish our goals
and to kind of look at our failures in a
different way so that's today's message
look forward to in two days next you're
gonna see me I filmed the video of me
super salty about a failure trying to be
positive about it and I think I was
positive but I was pretty salty about
look forward to that next one so thank
you guys for watching the video I
appreciate it I hope you all are working
hard at whatever it is that you're doing
and if you did fail don't worry about it
just kind of take 20-30 minutes it's
okay for like 15-20 minutes to feel
sorry for yourself but don't but don't
be any longer than that and say all
right back to the grind back to back to
the next failure or success right and
that's really what it's all about so
keep going
work hard thank you for watching the
video don't forget to comment like
subscribe share support me on patreon
all that good stuff I'll see you guys
next time
bye
all right guys it's day two a lakh lon
um got about six hours you sleep
probably close to five
getting ready wait we got one major bug
left in our code and we can't seem to
fit figure out how to fix it so I have
about five hours to try and fix it me
and my team and hopefully that happens
but interesting experience so far
definitely the working together is
splitting up work is much different than
coding alone being part of a team gives
you some insight on to maybe the work
environment and how that would happen
setting milestones is kind of a cool
thing as well like this is our first
milestone like this our featureless in
our example in our case we needed to get
the local videos from YouTube so our to
support local content creators that's
our premise support local content
creators so like you would support a
local business so when I look for
JavaScript tutorials I can look for
JavaScript tutorials in Los Angeles to
support content creators there within a
certain distance now we did we got that
working that's actually working but now
we're trying to use one of the ER si API
apps for the competition to map it
correctly and getting and getting a bit
of a problem there so going in right now
not too optimistic I'm I'm really
actually tired I was there till about
midnight from like 8:00 a.m. 8:30 to
midnight coding and now I'm pretty
pretty exhausted but we're going back in
and we're gonna give it a shot because
they offer free redbull also baby you
know let's say in that free red bullet
carry us I see you guys soup hey guys
thanks for watching the video if you
happen to be looking for a boot camp I
couldn't recommend dev Mountain any
higher they also include housing with
their tuition so you can get up and go
and get started right away thanks again
for watching and I'll see you guys in
the next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
