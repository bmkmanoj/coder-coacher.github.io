hey guys so today we're gonna be doing
the JavaScript section of solo learn I
just got done doing their PHP section
and I really liked it I want to share it
with you guys
so we're ahead and jump into courses
here they have a ton of different things
on here it's also an Android and iOS
application so you can do this on your
phone if you prefer to do that I'm just
more of a computer guy and I'm trying to
make a video so I gotta do on the
computer but it would be very easy to do
it on there so you'll see they have C++
Java Python JavaScript PHP c-sharp swift
fundamentals Ruby CSS HTML and SQL so
lots of different things one of the cool
things about actually completing it you
can go ahead and add it to your this
will add it automatically to your
certification section of your LinkedIn
so if you're you're estimating a little
a little empty and you need just a
little bit of filler you know go ahead
and add that there as well we're gonna
go ahead and jump into the JavaScript
tutorial here it's gonna zoom in a bit
module 1 overview let's go this get
started so you'll see it has like a
short little career path that career
path but uh kind of a table here if I
get going we'll jump in so let's go
ahead and jump into introduction to
JavaScript so welcome to javascript
javascript is basically takes HTML CSS
and JavaScript and combines it all to
make web web applications or websites
javascript main function is the behavior
in interactivity okay so you'll see that
we get quizzes like this and somehow I
haven't done this before but I'm I'm
alright with JavaScript so I should be
able to answer most of these although
technical questions is somewhere
something that I extremely lack one
second let's get a little hot in here
had a close to the window or excuse me
of the blinds
alright so starts going off talking
about JavaScript you have the web page
web-browser I hear a few examples what
you can do with your off-screen display
information based on time of day detect
the visitor sprout valide form data
create cookies change page contents
dynamically excuse me all things that
we'll be doing in JavaScript here so
JavaScript runs in the browser doesn't
run in the cloud and doesn't use C++
it's considered a client-side language
so there's client-side and server-side
language PHP for instance is a
server-side language you have to have a
server running it while client-side runs
in the browser which JavaScript does on
a user's computer rather it runs locally
is the point I'm trying to make all
right so there are server-side stuff
such as nodejs which will run there's
other uses of applications in Acrobat
and fo-sho I didn't know that I know
Acrobat or Photoshop use JavaScript so
in this tutorial we're going to talk
about classic JavaScript a client-side
language that adds interactivity to
webpages which is what javascript is
right it's JavaScript use in general
purpose and server-side applications so
it can be used in both right although
it's primarily used on the client side
yeah so one of the great things about
javascript is that you can just get a
text editor set up and going unlike
other like server-side languages where
you may have to set up an environment
and all that sort of stuff you don't
really need to do that in this tutorial
it looks like they used notepad plus
plus which is a text editor nice so
creating your first JavaScript it's an
awkward way of saying that so javascript
lives in HTML document so last we were
saying HTML CSS are linked in JavaScript
you're gonna set up a standard text
document to do that you don't have to if
you
a console dot log or return the value
but it does live in an HTML file because
it it works in the Dom as a document
object model which works within the HTML
to do to insert tags so typically how
when you're getting started or just use
script tags like this which basically
means run our JavaScript right here
that's basically all that's going on
there so you have a script tag or run
JavaScript within here would be a better
way of putting it
so you'll see right here we have the
document dot write hello world this is
JavaScript that's just gonna output
hello world so please type in the
context
so we're document dot write hello world
very nice and those six comments on here
as well so there might be other people
who are gonna say stuff and contribute
you can check that out as well
just like in HTML we use HTML tags to
form on text and JavaScript for example
we can help with the Texas heading so
document dot write h1 h1 hello world so
you'll see that we can output the HTML
like so what choice can be added with
the text of use Floyd formatting tags
very nice so if you didn't know that you
could actually output HTML tags you can
so adding JavaScript to a web page so
again we're talking about the script tag
inside of the header this time where
we're gonna actually import a file
instead of putting it directly which is
the more common way of doing it so the
tip stripped the script tag is typically
placed in the head tag where you put a
lot of your resources maybe as fonts and
style sheets and things like that
alternately in JavaScript in the body
tag we can put a script tag as well
so it looks like you can improve page
loading because HTML display is not
blocked by scripts loading interesting I
never thought about that where else is
description in the body tag so
apparently you can also do that
typically you'll put it in the header
script and take two attributes it can
take the language because there may be
other languages that you're putting in
in this case it's JavaScript and then
you can put type as text slash
JavaScript so apparently this language
attribute is deprecated and should not
be used so ignore this you don't need to
put this which is what I was thinking
because I never do this I work with
JavaScript daily instead just go ahead
and use the type but if you see that
that's probably what's going on it's
probably some you would use in IE
since I should so outdated the type
attribute is also no longer required as
JavaScript is default HTML scripting
language ah I didn't know that so we can
get rid of this also you can just have a
script and we'll know that it's
JavaScript by the by the type of file it
is what attribute and value is used
along with that so in this case we're
gonna have type oops
make sure you type it out right so
you'll see now you can also type these
things out which is the google text and
javascript nice we're doing a hat trick
here as we're unlocking achievements you
also get a little bit of score as you go
up with this sort of stuff so let's see
here scripts can also be placed in
external files so you can also you know
kind of chain your scripts along and use
scripts in one area so what is the
extension use for a Joe store file SJS
external javascript from this as well as
RC so if you're using the external
script put the name of the script on the
SRC attribute so if you're linking to
something you need to go ahead and say
where that file is right before we are
just using script tags and putting the
the JavaScript directly in it now
actually a linking to stuff and you'll
say you see right here external scripts
cannot contain script tags okay that
makes sense apparently you can't you so
you can't link to a file that links to
another file you need to include all
that links perhaps on your index page
URL elsewhere
so what attribute of the script tag is
used for adding external that would be
our SRC or the source right so where's
your file locate it's located at the
source which you then pass in a URL for
what is the result examples like this is
an alert box you can play several script
references in the header body whichever
you prefer
the script will behave as is located
exactly where the script tag is located
placing a JavaScript external file has
advantages it separates HTML here
because that's why you do it right you
you could obviously put all your
JavaScript in one one thing most of the
time but it's gonna get so complicated
and so long that it makes more sense to
separate things out and that's how you
you know that's how you actually do it
in the real world so it's easier to read
and maintain and cache JavaScript files
can speed up page loads okay so uh
please add the corresponding where it's
the external sample dot J's file to the
web page so we are putting in our script
tag we're then putting in the type and
then we are putting in the source that's
where the file is located and then
comments in JavaScript so comments are a
crucial part of any coding language
you're gonna want to comment things and
so that you know usually above the code
always above the code so that when
another developer is looking at your
code or you're going back to your code
you can actually understand what the
hell is going on so in so in JavaScript
two slashes is a single line comment
meaning the comment will only spam for
that one line now if you need to use a
multi-line comment its start is slash
star and star slash
nice and so at the end of at the end of
each one of these modules you'll get a
little quiz what are three core
languages in webpages so you have HTML
CSS and JavaScript not to say that PHP
isn't used but I wouldn't say it's a
core language in JavaScript please fill
in the missing commands to add the file
code AS there so we have our type we
have the source and then we have our
closing script tag why is JavaScript
code being placed just before the
closing body tag so this is kind of live
the webpage are fully loaded with the
browser window cool so up next we'll do
basic concepts and then we'll continue
on and we'll get our little certificate
eventually to add to our LinkedIn and
eventually we'll knock out all these
show that we're very interested and hard
working and learning individuals and
make our LinkedIn look a little bit
sexier in the process but like good
stuff and pretty it covers a lot pretty
quickly if it's anything like the PHP
course is it breaks it down in such a
way that it's just showing you the stuff
you actually need to know and a lot less
fluff which what I like about it you
probably do one of these courses in an
afternoon if you really push yourself or
- - but as always guys don't forget to
like subscribe and share and support me
on patreon and keep an eye out for our
weekly Friday interviews that we do with
developers called behind the code very
excited this is gonna be our first
weekly series where we're gonna
interview a developer and designer you
know forced a full-stack front-end the
whole spectrum of tech wiz project
manager it's gonna be a new person every
week and we're gonna talk about a whole
bunch of stuff check that out at
Friday's thanks for watching I'll see
you guys next time
special thanks to our sponsor dev
Mountain if you're interested in coding
bootcamp why don't you check them out
where they include housing alongside
their tuition so you can get up go and
immerse yourself in the environment if
you want to support me go over to
patreon.com/scishow dean tutorials 360
