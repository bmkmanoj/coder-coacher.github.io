a minute since I've been doing some code
combat we're gonna start fresh we're
going to be working through with Keith
guard dungeon doing about five examples
at a time for this one for a video we're
going to start at the beginning dungeons
of kiss guard basic syntax we're gonna
switch this a JavaScript no problem I
did say I was gonna reach out to the
female programmers a little bit so let's
go ahead and start with Captain Anya
west and normally I would go about my
games to use uh male characters we're
going to switch out bring a female one
so we have some boots here you can
equipped items in code combat some give
you just stats such as strength or HP
these boots are going to give us the
ability to move our hero down left right
and up and these are basically
predefined functions that we're going to
be calling our hero object so our goal
for this this mission is to go right
down and write avoid the spikes and to
collect the gentleman complete the level
so that sounds to me like we need three
functions here you can use these methods
yep thank you emails mode on the right
here I move right moves right so we can
take that same logic and say like move
our hero down and then also move our
hero to the right once more to complete
the level now let's run our code and see
if our logic was correct looks good to
me we're done we're gonna gain a little
bit of experience we're gonna complete
some levels get some gems gems can be
used to buy items at the shop oh we're
gonna try and play as long as we can
without having to do that I'm always one
of those guys that likes to stockpile
his gold until he can buy something
really good with it
avoid the spikes collected gems all
right our map is looking a little so
going on with the map arena here may
have to close down the steam download
let's go ahead and pause this real quick
to the past
type out move down command online for
Illyria oh we're back guys so what we
want to do yours move right move down
move back up move back up move right and
move down so let's let's do bring it on
first temp so we want to move our he's
moving right or she's moving right and
then we want to move it down move her
down we want to move her up again and
then we want to move her up one more
time because we're only moving up one
space we need to move up to and then we
want to move call the move right
function to move right and then we want
to call the move down function to move
down now when we run this we leave we
should be good so here I move down once
we vote twice move up move up move right
and then move down and we're done cool
continue on we got our jams we got our
experience shadow guard let's continue
straight forward onward and upward we
don't want the ogre to see us so we want
to go around to set us straight across
should be pretty straightforward we're
just moving right then moving up arrow
da move right here o dot move down so we
should be right here now and then we're
going to go as a hero dot move right one
more time and i believe that should be
it so we're going to move right move up
the statues block interview so they'll
see us move right move down and we're
done it's more about thinking about how
to problem-solve than how the functions
were
sometimes you just need to understand
what the functions to and how you're
going to be able to solve that going to
answer these every day they have a new
thing on here about daily quizzes or
whatever it's really just metadata
gathering which helps them out so I
don't mind doing it this is everything
we're going to be doing is completely
free they do have a paid version I do
have a paid version are they they do
have a paid version rather all right so
here I must survive collect all four
gems no color problems under nine
statements so statement one statement to
statement three statement for a
statement 576 save a seventh statement
eight seems pretty straightforward again
this is more about understanding what we
can do with these functions and how to
solve problem solved so here I move up
we want to move right twice we want to
move right again we want to move down
and then we want to move down again and
then we want to move up and then we want
to move right so assuming I did that
correctly oops and I did not shoot a
straight-up died right there all right
so this needs to be mu right
there we go now we should be good right
and if you if you're not sure check
your coat it's checking off line by line
right here I'm just kind of nice so you
can actually see the code iterating
through itself nice it looks like we're
getting a sword so we'll see what that
does next it's called the simple sword
was this it's optional challenge level
for experienced programmers ok we'll
come back to this at the end of this
dungeon so true names basic syntax of
strings I don't want to jump into
something that may be too hard to
understand for people are just starting
out so we have a belt this is going to
give us additional health health is just
going to make us tanker so we can absorb
more attacks we have our simple sword
that's going to give us Lao hood is
going to give us a damaged parameter and
we're gonna have a tack so attack is
going to be a new function that's going
to allow us to kill the outdoors pretty
pretty familiar for anyone who's done
any action RPG sort of strategy games or
anything like that all these things
should be intuitive so what we need to
do is we need to move right we need to
kill Brock or Brack then we need to move
right and then we need to kill tray and
then we need to move right to the to the
end so first thing we're going to do is
move right attack attack and then we
want to move right so it looks like it
takes two attacks to kill them not just
one and then we want to hear o dot
attack and who do we want to attack
we're going to input the string so the
name Craig and then we're gonna do it
again
and we traig here as well and then we
want to simply move to the finish line
which is to rights so let's go ahead and
test our code right now let's see if we
were able to do what we wanted to the
right attack attack move right attack
this guy twice move right right nice so
we collected the gems we killed their
guys took a little bit of damage but we
were able to survive or the combo
breaker we finished five sections so up
in the next video we will be doing the
race sword and work our way through and
then once we get done we'll go back to
these harder examples just in cases
people are just starting but as always
