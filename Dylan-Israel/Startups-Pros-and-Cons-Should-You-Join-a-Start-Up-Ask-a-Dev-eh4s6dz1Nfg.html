about should you join the startup why
why not what are some of the pros or
some of the cons and what you can really
expect so like most programmers you've
probably at some point in time Sartre
thought about starting your own startup
or wanted to learn more about startup so
there's a great start a startup Humble
Bundle going on right now and there'll
be a link in the description if you
click it you can help me out so if
you're interested in maybe developing a
business idea a little bit further
there's a lot of books here all to help
you go in that direction and as always
you will help me out as well as help out
the charity code org and dr. with
borders and you can choose if you want
to where your money goes if it goes the
publishers if it goes to me or if it
goes to the charity so startup sorry
interesting thing because sometimes you
don't know which ones are real sometimes
you don't know which ones are fake and
which ones are trouble and which ones
are going to be fun and adventurous and
so I think we should start at that point
where a lot of times you'll have
companies that are barely afloat calling
them startups when they are just really
trying to get cheap labor at the end of
the day so you have it you got to kind
of be wary of that but for the most part
startups are a pretty like legit
startups meaning that they have funding
they have money they're not worried
about you're not worried about the bills
not being paid on time those are the
exciting ones the the ones we you are
like I've interviewed at several
startups and one of the one of the
companies they were very focused on
money during the interview which is an
unusual thing but the one of the things
that caught me really off-guard was the
fact that they said that they don't have
payroll and that they basically are
going to hand write me a check at the
end of two weeks which is really
concerning to me ah I mean you know
they'll and that certain incidents they
say well we just haven't got around to
sitting at payroll yet and I find that
very hard to believe in that instance
but some of the pros are working for
startups there's quite a quite a few one
on the startup but some startups are
more willing to take on developers early
on in their career so that they can mold
them and help build them out to the
developer they want them to be too
oftentimes if you are an experienced
developer working at a start-up you can
get equity not like a massive share it
all depends at what stage as a start-up
you come in at but you can get a piece
of the pie right which is really cool
because if you are a believer in the
product and if you're working at a
start-up and you're putting in the hours
to startup demands which typically a
startup is going to want you to work a
ton right you they have some visionary
or a dreamer where they're like this
idea is going to change
the internet-of-things market this idea
is going to be the new social media
where people now send images of the back
of their heads or whatever or whatever
the idea is you don't know who it is
it's crazy
and so you know they're very excited
about whatever it is is my point and
they they expect a lot out of that in in
return you typically might get a piece
of pieces of pie basically a piece of
equity on top of your salary and usually
the way that it's been explained to me
at startups and I've had three potential
offers at at my companies that startups
where I haven't I haven't taken the role
but the gist of it usually goes along
the line of you get a little peace
equity the first year you get a little
more second year you get a larger the
third year and you get the bulk of it
the fourth year every place is different
but that's usually how those equity jobs
go and and then you get a salary as well
now another cool thing is usually it's a
less corporate environment and this
maybe not be something that if you're
just starting your career out you're too
worried about you're like yo man let me
just let me go in any environment I
don't care if it's third floors hell I
just want that experience I understand
but uh for as a developer and you you
can diffuse experience you have you have
a you know you have easier time landing
roles and so you may decide that the
cubicle environment isn't for you or the
super structured you know HR where you
need to be very correct all the time
and on your toes right and may not be
for you or that that you know you want
to wear sandals in to work and shorts
right and for whatever reason we live in
a culture where you have to wear a
collared shirt and pants or you're
unprofessional you know you got to be
clean-shaven and all that sort of stuff
you know I and developers by and large
kind of they you tend to get a little
bit of leeway for whatever reason ago so
most of us are just slobs and so but in
general in general in a corporate
environment those are things that you
expect I start up a little less so that
goes for a little of the weirder things
as well sometimes you can drink beer at
them right at I've talked about in the
past where the company was in the
alcohol industry specifically in like a
analytic sales aspect and but they were
like you know they drink beers why
they're there and yeah you know just a
little bit more of a relaxed environment
where maybe they have nerf guns and all
that sort of stuff to kind of hype up
the the environment to try and draw
potential developers should which can
lead to a very interesting workplace
right I I know that it would be
interesting to me just AB nerf guns just
be able to shoot so full in the face
hey do my pull request to just cap them
in the face that might be too aggressive
but if you give me nerf guns and someone
didn't do my pole request I might cap
them across the room sideways double cat
pull requests baby pull first name pull
second name request BAM and shoot them
down do my but yeah so it's gonna
be an interesting experience now the the
columns as we mentioned is you may not
get paid that that that job may dry up
and that's it that's a big big con
another another thing is that even if
you do get paid that equity usually it
comes with a little bit of a lower
salary right they're trading you equity
for a lower salary most of the time and
not always but most of the time and what
that results in is you putting faith
that this project this business is going
to be successful and that's not always
the case right I think it's like 9 out
of 10 businesses fail and you
maybe you maybe or that one in 10 and it
works out but you are you are risking
something right that equity that you
know you took a $50,000 salary instead
of a $75,000 salary but you got equity
and you were planning on that equity to
be more than the 25k a difference that
your salary would would normally be to
make that up and you're there for years
the business crumbles and all of a
sudden you you lost out on a hundred
thousand dollars of actual money in your
pocket not to mention the fact that you
probably stayed because you instead of
taking like large raises maybe they gave
you a three percent raise or something
some nonsense you probably stayed
because you needed you were staying for
that equity the whole time right because
the longer you stay the more equity you
get and and so you you're not in the
position where you can jump jobs and get
you know $10,000 raises $20,000 raises
you you're investing time for that
equity that maybe cost you a hundred two
hundred fifty thousand dollars and in
theory in you in your income right so
that kind of ties you down to that place
and the average developer stays out a
roll for a year and a half and you know
to get your equity you're usually gonna
need to be there four to five years to
get all of it so there's a little bit of
risk with it but it is something I can
definitely pay off I think it's it's one
of the one of the cooler things and I
kind of consider my last job a little
bit of a start-up now we didn't need to
worry about funding because the company
was already established in the in the
military-industrial complex I guess
would be the like keyword the military
training industry and but they never
been involved in software before and so
they were building our team and I didn't
give me equity or anything but I will
say that working on a smaller team on a
project that's just starting out you get
exposed to a lot of cool stuff you get
to you get to have your hands and all
pieces of the pie now I've talked once
or twice before about typically when we
are learning and we're trying to get our
break into the industry we're kind of
generalist and that kind of applies to a
start-up as well right where you can now
go and and check and that you can now
sort of do a little bit
I'm gathering requirements are doing
wireframes building front-end building
back in doing QA doing deploy doing
DevOps right and so you get all these
little bits of information in every
which direction which makes me like I
think that's really cool and then
typically as you go to a more and this
this is a more general statement this
isn't necessarily always true but
typically as you progress your career
you might become more of a specialist
right you may do full stack but that's
it you don't do deployment you don't do
testing you may just do front-end meet
you may just you back in you may just do
DevOps and you kind of become more
specialized as time goes by but as
startup most of the time
do the resources due to the nature of
just trying to get a business off the
ground they're not necessarily gonna
want to hire somebody for everything so
they might lean on you to say eh we need
you to pick up angular we know you've
never touched JavaScript a day in your
life but you're gonna learn today
because I mean that that's just the way
that it goes so startups are an
interesting thing I think when you are
considering working at a start-up you
should just kind of understand where you
are at in your life and understand that
you are essentially taking the risk for
a larger reward at the end of the day
and just be okay with that I don't think
there's anything bad with it I don't
think there's anything necessarily good
with it I think it's kind of an equal
trade-off right if you theoretically are
taking a lower salary some equity you're
just essentially applying the value for
it and in return you're going to a
slightly different environment than you
would in you know maybe a larger
corporate company but that that's really
all I had to say today guys I appreciate
