we're in refractories n a ruby according
this and this course will learn we'll
look at the best practices and
conventions that make Ruby unique we'll
see what that means so if this is true
I'm not sure it's gone all right let's
see here
simpler if so looks like it's just one
if statement if true it's true
all right seems easy enough the one line
unless so say unless end it all right
all right
one good turn deserves a ternary
just alright so this is saying that
ternary is puts true okay just like a
different way of doing it so it's true
question mark value and let's see if
that true value all right
when and then the case statement it's
just a shorter way right now to do
everything very but doing ah excuse me
okay okay so this wants us to clean it
up so I will say when English so in
English then we want it to print out
hello okay
change it up so when put on you
and then win then put booth in town it's
I love else and then we need to and I
believe this should work
so we'll try English and there's our
hello
this is just saying that we can combine
the conditional assignment operator
I don't think we're actually even doing
any code here yeah
now you try create a variable I'll do
Ruby for this don't be disrespectful
favor it underscore it oops
cool
all right implicit return
you know that messes every we can't
return value cast return really wanting
it was Mantha modify the code in the
editor to use implicit return so
there you go it's just automatically
returned it is you don't need to return
there just one extra thing that we don't
have to worry about I guess so that's
kinda cool short-circuit evaluation
these all seem like things you just pick
up naturally as you code in Ruby
all right so we're just going around
this code so a was evaluated so we're
undef a it returns true rerun death be
see right here
Hey and then be it was a was evaluated
first or be so they run to a or b you
know it was evaluated a or b then it
prints this up and then it prints out a
NP cool if we were to switch it would be
dropped a so see here let's get a little
inventive right a loop that only puts
the even values of my array bonus points
if you use a one line if all right bonus
plants we like bonus points if my array
see how they wants to
let's try this one
so take the value my rate value and I'll
say if value modular to see it's just
evens all right so we want to take the
values of the my eraser
network
so it worked but that doesn't seem right
let's see here
all right I guess so art it's been weird
alright so next we're going to use the
up to down to four loop sections use up
to that puts the capital letters L
through P so we're just say L dot up to
be I'm not sure this is going to work oh
we gotta give it a shot real quick and
now we're gonna say take the value and
then we will put
let's see all right okay cool
call and response so let's see well dot
respond over to you a question where it
takes a similar it's truth object can
receive that method and false otherwise
all right
so it basically finds if this work or
not
alright so we're gonna say age dot
respond to question mark and we'll say
okay
oh that's it no do you remember to get
first one to symbol not Nexus 7 X yeah
okay so you don't include the dot in
there you just include okay that makes
sense so respond to being pushy let's
see here
object okona editor do you use a
concatenation operator instead of dot
pusher + so let's look over the example
here we can concatenate with two less
than signs so
cific you like this cool so we just swap
this out it's a little bit less work
especially in the first case string
interpolation
it's weird that it's showing us to do
what we've been doing this whole time
so instead it's just saying that it
wants us to do it like we've been doing
which isn't anything new
I don't believe cool let's see we're
gonna do a little bit of review it looks
like refactor the conscience editor it's
just like uh oh it's only the end
statement
- all right so let's go back to the
beginning and remind ourselves okay
so we're kind of doing it backwards
alright so this is what it was and so we
need to we need to do like that there
you go yeah so you put what you wanted
to do you say do this if this is true
all right the ternary operator refactor
refactor this statement that reviews a
ternary operator and puts the correct
sentence so
all right so we want it to do this so
I'm going to say puts on this listen to
this yes this is actually kind of
counterintuitive to me and I guess we
can get rid of that also but uh like for
me I would just much prefer it the other
way but I guess it's I guess what you
gonna handle on all this the syntax is a
little foreign but you should be able to
pick it up pretty quickly if your work
exclusively with Ruby all right in case
of many options in fact if else if else
statement into a tiny case statement all
right what was the tighten occasionally
when when something does this all right
so say case language and then we'll say
we'll say one in Ruby
again this JavaScript do this when HTML
and CSS this finally else but Seidel not
language - what's your favorite language
I'll say Ruby oh yeah did it again
there we go Oh looks like your program
doesn't puts Ruby just great for web
apps one language is II believe go
through me Oh dainese dotty too soon
okay so this is a head so yeah they
didn't seem right because essentially we
the whole point of the case language was
to do this oh it may I wonder if that's
anything to do we need to indent let's
see so let's go to the Q&amp;amp;A forum see
what's going on here
that was what 17 it's fine
you
so one Ruby puts this
okay since we probably ran in the
comments here that there just seems to
be a little bit of a err on there and in
programming so we're just gonna go ahead
and do it like this for whatever reason
doesn't Houston it wants to see his
foots you only accept foots then should
worked out just fine good additional
assignments so in this is my favorite
others for animal and there we go and
then implicit return write a method
Square def square and it takes a number
as an argument number let's say number
number and then we'll end it we don't
need to do return that should work just
fine for shame
so we want to do the times and we'll say
for I in 1 2 3 so 1 2 3 3 3 . times 2
BAM I'm a refactoring machine this is
entry we so we learned a couple things
that are probably the standard I'd say
in Ruby on how to set up your code it's
probably less typing easier once you get
the hang of it the next section we're
going to be doing is called the refactor
factory so um I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
