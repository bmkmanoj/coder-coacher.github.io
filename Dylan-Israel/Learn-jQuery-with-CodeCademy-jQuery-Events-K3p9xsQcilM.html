way through our jQuery Codecademy course
we're in jQuery events jquery events
alright so let's take a look at script j
s make sure you understand what it will
do click Save summit all right so it's
when we click our button it's going to
take our bar to add that the input name
is equal to message and where you can
get that value store it into the ad and
then our messages which is right here
our div messages it's going to add this
paragraph right here so type your text
to add testing 123 ad and then bam it
adds it to the div and if we click it
again it should have it again nice so
looks like we understand what's going on
there so your diff rev resents the
planet Krypton this is our div make it
fade out and fast go ahead and do this
immediately without the need of a click
so first thing we need to do is doc get
our document ready
ready
and what is art this is our div I guess
so we'll say give dot fade out and we
want it to be fast so you can see it
fades out very fast all right rewrite
you jQuery code so that Krypton only
fades out when you do click on it so I
get where it's going to be similar to
what we did so we have our document dot
ready with our function and so the next
thing we need to do is let's see this
dog would it be this or the diff all
right so when we click on the div div
done
dot click we need a function to do some
stuff so in here we want to say we want
our div 2 dot fade out no you want it to
be fast
so if we did this correctly when we
click this it should fade out cool it
looks like it's working test it again
back to the editor not too bad not too
shabby all right below your dot click
event code from the previous list and
create a new selector alright so below
that we want to so this is so below that
we want to create a new selector that
applies a hover and have it at class rep
and red to Krypton alright so when we
hover over the div dot hover we need
that to do some stuff function oops
and we want to say this div so what's
going on here is this is probably if we
go to our style shoot just creating a an
image oh it's an actual image I was
gonna say it's just creating a circle
but apparently creating an image but
we're gonna I thought it was just
creating a circle bang up so we're going
to change the color of that image by
adding the class red so now when we
hover it it should change it to red we
click it it's still this fierce yeah
good to go here so used to double click
handler to make our div fade out fast so
same thing here set everything up
and we need to call on it we want to say
we're going to say for the div dot our
event which is double click we want a
function to do some stuff and in here we
want to for that div div dot fade out
and how we want it to do it fast
alright so now single click doesn't work
double clicked us again single click
double click home about us contact so
we're ready to apply a hover effect to
our site navigation in script jsu select
or target / menu items so you can see
right here we have some stuff going on
here when we hover over the menu item so
these are divs so when we hover over div
hover then our function let's apply a
class of active so function and we want
to say well this sorry so for this
that's our current dip that we're
hovering over this dot add class active
don't forget
well our mouths Lisa many let's remove
the class active so we're saying do this
and then we're saying this dot do this
when you hover and do this dot remove
class
so we hover it changes when we leave it
ramosa hover so this way it looks like
it's constantly changing it is not too
bad so what did we do differently what
did we do in correctly rather was it the
semi clone
so since we're having an air here I
don't see it this class active
so it looks to me like we're doing all
right but apparently we've made a
mistake somewhere so let's just go ahead
and go the Q&amp;amp;A forum real quick hover
number six here's why you are passing
if your code is working exactly as
intended but you're giving some air do
this when you click save and submit
mixtures hover over one of the titles
for one to three seconds before taking
your mouse off then continue okay one
one-thousand two one-thousand three
one-thousand oh my god alright so we're
doing everything right it just needs a
second to see that it's working I guess
alright so instead of a yes get your
document dot ready do two things alright
so first thing is asking us to do is get
our document good to go function at this
point we've done this enough times that
we should kind of have a handle on just
memorization of the beginning of this so
turn the input into a jquery element and
call the focus event handle on it so
we're going to say you say input a name
here text name Oh input so all right
there so inputs works just fine input
and we're saying dot focus inside your
event handler function alright so we
this is a function and we're going to
need it to do some more stuff we want to
call dot CSS on your input element so
input dot CSS and we want to do some
stuff so we want outlook line dash color
I remember correctly this is how you do
it pound FF 0 0 0
not all browsers have equal CSS
implementation so for this lesson if
you're using Fox Firefox
we solve instructions so it may be that
this needs to be like this and this
let's see if that does it no
this funk didn't work last time for us
so let's just go ahead and look at the
form real quick see what's going on here
so that was let's start focus
what's wrong that sounds like a good one
so we're doing it correctly okay so
maybe this Nazi SS
which browsers are using Firefox
let's see if that fixed it for us
hmm
so
let's go back here and compare the
working example with ours and see what's
going on so document already function
we're good there that works we are
getting the input and we're saying when
it's focused I'll take out the brackets
there and add a zero and we're good
so see now when it's on focus i guess is
the key word for when you have an item
selected and you can see it turns the
right not bad so after sending up with
the document dot ready call alright so
again document dot ready function
we want the whole document object to
respond whenever key is pressed
call dot P down event on document
alright so we're saying win the document
dot key down we need a function
and let's I yorkie down animate your div
we want the div 2 dot animate
and with the same inputs as above so
let's just copy this so apparently it's
going to go left 10 pixels and then 500
so
document dot event function to div
your event is your key down okay effect
is animate
just my colon semicolon stride again so
that was it Chris oh I forgot to hit so
you see wanna when I press the key down
I was clicking now our thing is moving
cool alright let's get started first get
your document dot ready oh my god the
Mario we're bringing out the Mario
that's great I'm really excited to get
this working now so and then function in
our flexion we do some we'll do
that some in a second so we set it
up good instead you're talking ready set
up call key down event on the document
same thing we did a second ago so we're
saying for our entire document thought
key down
we want a function to do some
past ski down what's of functions and
here's the choice your function should
take a single input key which will help
jquery figure out which key so for the
key where event is key down so for the
key do we set key
complete your code for upright and down
oh my god switch statements nice all
right so case 37 left left arrow so
parse int key which so we're going to do
something similar here oops so let's
copy this line of code so when we press
the left arrow we won oh this is left
ours first so we want this to be up
maybe I'll do plus 10 p our top is the
left right bottom top I think it's yeah
I think that's it so save top fast all
right and then break and then when the
right arrow is pressed which we'll see
we want to move it to the right and then
again one more time here except this is
for the down arrow and this is bottom
and the right we wanted to go plus up
its + left just- and and bottom is minus
as well so let's see if we did that
correctly so if we move to the right
nope that didn't work correctly alright
so
why didn't it work
so we have right here Plus 10 pixels so
move can't move our image which is this
any image we have animate it to move
right 10 pixels and do it fast so I
think this is right let's try it one
more time
come alright so now we need to get the
key 0 37 k 37 case 38 so maybe that's
where we need to change our case but I
don't know what the the left arrow key
on the keyboard is this case 37 to the
computer the right one this case 38 okay
so this is already taken care of but
it's still not working we try it one
more time maybe we have to turn num lock
off no that's still not working so let's
go back to the editor and let's see this
is 11 of 12 filling out the cases let's
see what's going on here the main event
variant so we're doing everything right
this is common occurrence here I see the
sensor extension accession extracts and
CSS scope exit out of this except this
you one more time what's going on won't
pass it is is it so important for my
write code about will pass pass what
Mario won't move
you will have to change 37 left arrow
let's see or do we have that correct I
believe we do so our left arrow is minus
10 PX our top is minus so this needs to
be minus 10 PX then our
oh ok so we're doing lefton so if we go
left and right instead of ok so let's do
left and top and it should work because
it sounds like right now what we're
doing is we're cancelling it out so it
might be a little easier to understand
if we're just moving things left plus 10
left or minus 10 left let's see if that
fixes it instead of doing left right
left right ok and now when we go full
screen should go it's not moving still
but it looks like it looks like some
other people are having the same issue
so let's see let's full screen this
Oh up and down it's moving I'll there
goes so those are Mario and he's going
dude is it going like you not believe
and he's going and going and going
alright so our Mario object now moves
nice cool stuff what happens just
working alright so we finished that and
that's all folks click save and submit
code to rescue the princess or finish
this late f it this later so cool we
finished our our jquery events at this
time it should be getting a little bit
more familiar up next we're doing
something called you know this and we're
probably just going to be working around
with more events and more styling for
HTML but so far i really like jquery
it's a little short section but i feel
confident enough that I could actually
implement this on my own site and I
probably will the short future as always
