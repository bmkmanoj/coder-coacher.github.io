should you be a specialist or should you
be a generalist in your career with that
all really Intel's and why right so it's
always important not to just say yes or
no but let's give a why as to why you
should be one or the other you guys look
quick shout out to get some affiliate
money I've been reading the complete
software developers career guide for the
last month I have 80 pages left of it
you can see I'm almost done
it's almost 800 pages I think this is a
one of those books that John did a
excellent job on first off but also I
think it's the book that everyone who is
going into software development should
read at some point in their career to
sort of have some I open Enix
experiences as well as just some solid
advice so if you're interested in there
will be a link in the description so
generalist and specialist is something
that I'm I find very fascinating and
we'll talk a little bit about each one
of them each each of them and why but
let's start at the beginning of your
career right you are interested in
becoming a developer and you're saying
how can I do it the best
70% of jobs right our full stack and
we'll talk a little bit about why I
don't really believe that stat always
and but it is true that the job
descriptions are you know 70% full stack
in general so when you're starting out
you want to typically be a generalist
because you want to be applicable to as
many things as possible right you want
to have some front-end skills you want
to have some back-end skills you want to
have some UI UX skills you want to have
some testing skills you want to have
some DevOps skills because especially
you open yourself up to a lot more
positions and you become a much more
attractive candidate and whether this is
fair or not typically the thing that is
going to be most relevant on your resume
in your career other than of course the
skills that you have is just job years
of experience right now so you need to
get that as soon as possible I think it
was the stackoverflow service at one
third of
helpers haven't met coding more than two
years and there was something like 57%
five years or under so when you start
getting those years of experience you
could see very rapidly how you are
becoming more and more valuable in a
very short period of time right if you
have six years experience in the
industry you are you are above the
majority of the people in the industry
right that's kind of crazy but so when
you're getting started you want to go
down that generalist route because
you're gonna be more you know the full
stack sort of generalist route that
you're gonna be more sought after
because you're gonna be able to do two
jobs essentially three jobs right or
maybe you have some startups where like
look man we can't hire a front end and a
back end we just gotta have one right
and that is that is a very real
consideration and when you're getting
your career started that is what hiring
managers are gonna look for that is what
you know the managers are just in
general are gonna say hey we're looking
to fill this spot this guy has no
experience but you know I could see that
he has full front-end back in you know
Davos because although you may not need
to be doing DevOps all the time although
you may not need to be doing testing all
the time or front in all the time and
perhaps they'll just make you in
back-end it is good to know that as a
candidate that you do have these skills
so that if something does happen that
you can go and and handle the situation
and so when you're starting your career
a generalist is kind of the best route
to go to right no one really wants that
employee says hey man that's the back
end I don't know how I don't even know
how to look at that right um but it is
worth mentioning that as you get farther
down in your career the industry as a
whole is moving towards a specialist
route right there's so much to know
Justin back-end just in front end and
DevOps and testing that in general as
you progress you will become a
specialist more than likely right and
you'll you'll be paid very well for
right if you have ten years as a full
stack developer which is you know you're
doing a little
of everything that's good but if you
have if you want to hire the best you
know C sharp developer that's only been
working in C sharp while someone's been
working in C sharp JavaScript has been
working on you know in Linux are trying
to deploy things and and bash and all
this sort of stuff they're not going to
be better than the guy who's only
specialized in one thing and what ends
up happening is the specialist later on
have a little bit more value not to say
that the full stack devs don't or
developers who are more generalists
don't they they have plenty of value as
well we're just comparing the two and so
as you progress in your career you you
probably should be some sort of
specialist and whatever facet of
software and development that you really
enjoyed that's another great thing about
starting your career as a generalist is
that you can you can sort of try it all
right it's it's like a buffet right so
if you've never you know if if you've
gone to a new buffet that you haven't
gone before at least is my mentality is
I like to go and I like to get a little
bit of you know one or two bites of
everything it's kind of that same way of
software development where that first
trip you get one or two bites of every
little piece of software the front end
the back end you know the UI UX the the
QA the dev ops all that and then you try
it you try each one and then you've
realized you know what
you know that chicken-liver dylan that
you got was awful don't ever get
chicken-liver again okay this is a very
recent buffet experience though but the
the point I'm trying to say is that you
can try it all and then figure out what
you should specialize in and typically I
just recommend especially I've seen and
what you enjoy because I think you'll be
more successful in what you enjoy and
what you you know work on outside of
work because you enjoy it right and
you'll be more successful a long run
than just choosing something that you
know makes $10,000 more so that's my
little recommendation when choosing your
sort of specialist route but one thing
to keep in mind with every good
specialist is a decent generalist right
so as you are progressing in your career
for you to be a good front-end developer
you have to
understand how the backend works right
you have to understand how how routes
work you have to understand you know a
little bit of ui/ux to say hey this is
what look better here I know the
requirements have it like this and speak
up to that and how testing would work
and you know I give you a perfect
example it's like two weeks ago one of
my endpoints wasn't working properly
without even looking at the code just
because I understand how the backend
works I you know did create a bug ticket
or anything I just message my teammates
that amen
you probably met there's a 95% chance
that this is what's breaking this end
point you want to go ahead and fix it or
you want me to dive into a knock it down
I don't do back in but I understand how
I understand how the backend works I can
also read code and go and fix it and I
saw I you know because I'm able to
understand how the backend works I
understand what's breaking and a very
basic thing where heist don't worry
about looking through all the code I'm
95% sure get started on this direction
and just eliminate that one and end up
being it so the reason I'm talking about
that is in order for you to be a good
specialist you have to understand how
the other parts work so you have to be a
decent generalist and it's it's very
powerful to you she's not only do you
find the correct path as a specialist
but you also provide a lot of value in
that way and that's why that 70% full
stack of jobs right I forget the exact
number but something like 30% of jobs
are or 10% of jobs are front end 20% are
back in 70 percent are full stack that
full stack number is a little bit
misleading I've worked with a ton of
full stack developers and I can tell you
that they can do front-end much like I
can do their back-end and that's usually
not very well and so it's so what ends
up happening is you get a lot of full
stack developers who oh yeah I know
JavaScript on the end of this back-end
this isn't like talk on anybody or
anybody specific so if if one of the
co-workers are watching this I love you
all but this is just a generalised
statement there's a lot of times what
has
ends up happening is you have front-end
devs or specialized and then you have a
lot of full stack devs that really are
just back-end developers that can play
around in the front end right much like
how you can have a front end of that can
play around in the backend in and
unfortunately that's all that's the
reality of a lot of full stack
developers and it's not necessarily
their fault at times but it is something
to be said that you know you become a
specialist later on in your career even
if these roles are hiring general
generalists because they really just
want to make sure that you have these
one two core competencies right they say
okay you know full stack dev and C sharp
and dotnet and then they have a bunch of
other crap but they really just care
about that C sharp or dotnet and they
want you know you can get better as you
need to work in the JavaScript right as
you need to work in the HTML CSS they
just expect you to get better for that
and so a lot of these full stack dev
offerings are very misleading in that
aspect because there's really sort of
one or two skills on every resume that
they're looking for and they just want
you to be able to say yeah I can jump in
the back and I can do a little DevOps
yeah I can do a little bit ui/ux you
know be familiar with the tools that are
being using but you don't necessarily
need to specialize in them and know them
inside and out so that's sort of my
thoughts on being a specialist or in
general it's just to sum it up pretty
much generalists at the start of your
career because you'll get exposed to a
lot of things that you can find out what
you like right what's fun what's
exciting for you and then you can be
able to apply to a lot of different jobs
because it's hard to get those years of
experience so once you do it's like
you're on the inside man you brought you
brought your robbing the bank blind no
uh yeah but uh and then as you progress
in your career after you've sort of
played around with a few things becoming
a specialist mainly because I think
long-term that's better for your career
and then the other thing about becoming
a specialist is that once you have sort
of you know quote unquote mastered
something right we'll shake a decade in
my opinion and as the trend seems to be
to be more specialized than more general
you know it's very easy to
transition to another thing to
specialize in right so if you're worried
like oh well I'm I've specialized only
in the front end Dillon and now I don't
there's no front end jobs well you've
learned how to specialize in something
you've learned a large skillset that's
still gonna be valuable to a degree but
if you need to you can take that skill
and now you can go specialize in
something else right and just jump one
one specialization to another every five
to ten years right so something to keep
in mind so anyhow guys I appreciate you
