topic and what people ask quite often
when getting started in web development
is how do I know what to study how do I
know what to learn in my off hours if
you're a developer maybe you're looking
to get a bump in pay how do you know
what is in demand and to me the simplest
answer is to just look at the jobs on
the market and see what skills you're
lacking because if you're studying
something you probably have a few and
the next thing you need to do is make
sure you have the rest and the easiest
thing is exactly what I'm doing here
you'll see I typed it depending on what
you're looking for I encourage everybody
not to just be a front-end or back-end
developer between a full stack developer
that's what I strive to be and that's
what I am and I'm trying to be a better
one so I encourage you to do the same
but if you're looking for UI UX you're
looking for maybe project management
you're looking for just front end just
back in whatever it is you can apply the
same strategy as I did here so you see
here I plan to work in the entire United
States I don't care what part of the US
if you want to pay me well in Alaska I
happen to like snow I will be there and
I'm flying that same thought process too
but if you're if you just want to work
in Southern California then it's going
to be a little different because there
are technologies that are out there that
are kind of floating around but for the
most part it's pretty pretty pretty much
the same let's go ahead and pop up a
couple of these we're just going to pop
up the first five and see if we see any
similarities here and I haven't ordered
these in any specific way actually close
that one that's the same company and to
do go so here we have five job apps and
right now I'm always I'm trying to make
sure that I've always said at one year
at your job you need to evaluate what
you what your worth is and how to
increase that worth because if you want
to get to that hundred and fifty
thousand dollar salary after five six
seven years it's going to be up to you
to make sure
you're worth it yeah you're going to get
a crazes just like being developer but
you need to see make sure that you're in
demand so what is this first jobs full
stack developer angular okay typescript
nodejs so I'm working on all of this and
it I do have a little bit of note but I
don't have any type scripts okay
typescript is good I see angular and
this is probably talking about angular 2
unless you see angularjs it's probably
talking about angular 2 but if you are
confused if you don't have these things
you know and I incur if you want to just
take one day and put a list and put a
little check mark next to all of them
see what is the most important and go
from there and also make a separate list
of preferred items as they preferred
because the preferred stuff is really
what gets you kicked to the next level
so okay we saw some angular some types
rip some node next step let's open this
bad boy up testing if you're not
familiar with testing another good one
CSS JavaScript jQuery REST API this is
actually pretty this one doesn't go too
much into details all this stuff it's
just saying hey we just let you to be a
good developer modern Perl catalyst MVC
framework so this so they have nothing
in in and firm looking at other this
seems to be pretty specific to this job
because I've looked at several of these
in the past few days but one thing that
I haven't seen increases Python and go
and so that's on my radar specifically
go because that's Google's programming
language we also hear HTML CSS
JavaScript jQuery AJAX angularjs
bootstrap CSS so if you're not already
studying those those should be the first
thing you should be studying and then we
see react on here as well so ok the
react is a good one and you'll see it's
mentioned again here some SQL stuff but
you could probably go side get just
start highlighting these words on your
list it's okay this is make it says some
you go one more full stack mean
developer angular again note again react
again HTML CSS JavaScript of course this
one happens to be Mongo GB
you're searching agile and JIRA and get
and github jasmine all these things are
very important and those are the sort of
soft skills that you can really get from
a weekend or two weekends just by
putting you put on your resume and then
maybe go get a certificate four hundred
bucks in it things like that will really
help you go far but you guys kind of see
how this was not a very good one so
talks about docker and API agile again
you'll see agile a lot but you can kind
of go down the line see piece by piece
what is what is on the resumes for the
job that you're looking for so when I
when I go and I study it's not something
random I don't just decide hey you know
what I want to study view Jas now huge
is is growing but did we see any view
Jas Jobs did we see anybody paying money
for your view just does that mean they
can't good job you know it does it but
from if we went through here what are we
probably going to see we're probably
gonna see node probably going to see
angular
confront those skills that clear to be
emphasized we are going to be seen many
more that align with it like typescript
just say you know angular react all
these JavaScript frameworks typescript
is probably something that I should have
on my resume that go along well with it
but this is how I choose what I study in
my off hours and I encourage you to do
the same don't be spending your time
studying random things study things that
are actually going to help progress your
career make you a better developer and
get you to where you want to go so if
this isn't the only way of learning
obviously you can kind of based off of
what your stack is that you're currently
working with you may want to go in one
direction or the other but I think this
is probably a pretty solid way if you
really don't don't know the market as
well as you should just kind of see
what's actually out there what are they
paying what are they expecting and where
where can I so that when I look at these
right for me Sam looking to get hired
where is my number one gap in my resume
that's going to screw me over from
getting
this potential job and that's the one I
work on first anyone's that I work on
we're at work
nope we already got those any that that
aren't on all them or that aren't core
ones like little things like maybe
webpack is like something small that you
might see on some yeah that oh uh they
won't worry about that one but the types
of things that will make sure that you
don't have that you that you're not that
you don't qualify right let go or or
angular2 or react thinks that the big
ones that's what you need to take away
from this and once you get a couple
projects and that you're worried on that
those are the jobs you need to go after
but that's how I choose what to study as
always I appreciate you guys watching
the video and for the keyword for the
giveaway because this will be on a
Friday video and every Monday Wednesday
and Friday
for the time being we give away a free
course thank you to our sponsor angular
University angular - University IO
