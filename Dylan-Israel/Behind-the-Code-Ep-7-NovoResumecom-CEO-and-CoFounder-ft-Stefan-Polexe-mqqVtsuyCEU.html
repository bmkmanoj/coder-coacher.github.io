talking with the co-founder and CEO of
novo resume com you're looking at their
site right now we talked about how
important the resume is what things you
can do with it how to get your foot in
the door at what type of people he looks
for when you try to hire interns and
developers and things like that for we
go sorry I just one guy to show you a
quick rundown on their site by the way
he's been kind enough to give us 10 free
codes so the first 10 that like and
comment that they want a coat and they
share the video we'll go ahead and get a
coding you could access to their premium
version for a month the codes are good
for a month and you'll have a month of
active with it so I really encourage you
to take advantage of it they're free
version is just as great I used it for
my resume let's go ahead and show the
junior level ones because most of us are
junior level and you'll see right here
you have the standard you have the
classic creative I like to create it
that's just me I like I like my to
stand out a little bit more so you can
see right here all this is customizable
you have your work experience you have
your personal project you can change the
colors relatively easy these are all
downloadable as well you know you can
change the font to a whole bunch of
stuff it looks like these are some
premium font so that that's the type of
stuff that you can get with the premium
kind of add ons additional things you
can change the layout around so if you
think your education needs more your
projects need more in a whole bunch of
other stuff you really can do a whole
mess of things with it and i really
encourage you if you want a good-looking
resume take advantage of it go ahead and
download it and it transfers over right
so if you want to change a different
template that works as well but as
always going to enjoy the interview I
had a lot of photos the second interview
I've dealt with him actually he was the
very first person i interviewed way back
in the day before we had started behind
the code so i really enjoyed this thanks
for watching and I'll see you guys too
how's uh how's it gonna know you guys
just you've been working hard because
you you know had a premium version of
here your product that's always a lot of
work to get going yeah we launched its
pinnacle clubber
that's really pretty well and yeah now
we're working on a plan for the next
year nice it's a you mind introducing
yourself for a quick for everybody sure
so hello guys my name is Stephen Pollock
said I'm the seals the resnet my
burgundy background is as a software
developer right now printing all the
developments at numbers in it and the
version I basically is a platform that
can actually help you to build your
resume and our vision is to it's
actually what draws us is a desire to
simplify and improve the resume which
has been around for decades yeah
description it's something that i
stumbled upon way back in the day and i
loved it we we've talked once before
about this but i recently with the
resume that you guys made for me i
actually got a the the person who hired
me was like yo man I love your resume
you got show me how you made it and I
was like look man I really didn't make I
wish I could take credit for it but um
and I point him to the site and he way
needs like okay if I ever sighs leave my
job I'm definitely going to be going
here so everyone that I've shown it has
absolutely loved it which is a good sign
and I've congratulation for doing your
job thank you thank you man i've been
i've been working hard to make sure that
my ass doesn't get laid off no it's hard
to you know it's always hard getting
your foot in the door sometimes i'm glad
that i was able to definition as far as
i remember or as a little unique right
as a web developer yeah yeah so I had
you know just basically freelance work
and then you know a little bit of side
project single page applications but now
I'm doing real web development I'm
working primarily in front end i'll be
doing full stacks pretty soon you know
when you have a smaller team you got to
branch out and kind of check if you can
do it do it and keep moving forward
which is a great experience to have
versus being on a large team be like
look this is all you do right here don't
ever step out of bounds so that means
it's emergency like this tendency where
we actually have the full stack
developer looking for a problem stems
back and then actually most of the
kitchens actually make sense yeah I mean
I mean with your I I'm getting that's
are you know yeah i know you have like
three co-founders right and and a cup
i'm sure you have a couple other people
but even even with such a small team in
general i'm sure everyone's learning
everything at this point right i mean
actually that for example in the
beginning of the next is a Beckham guy
London mission which was the designer he
was actually supposed to the front end
but actually was very like very great to
do that and it was very good at learning
new technology very fast so idea which
is decided it's better if the actual so
to the front end we take in the code is
faster than him and i also have a more
maintainable code which is quite
important and then he just focus on the
design part and andre is actually
handling marketing and research and acts
just like the way we wanted to start the
team actually having people with
different skills because there's no
point to sort of start up with the chi
computer science students or react three
people from marketing that's that's very
interesting so because I i I'm of the
mindset that everyone should do
everything if you can and so I'm glad to
hear that you're not just trying to get
one person who does one thing because a
lot of times you you make accomplish
your task and then you'll be like yo man
all i know i do is marketing my
marketing shit's done i got nothing to
do today then it's like all is good to
develop yourself and learn more and more
and more skills but again you know it
can actually be proficient just in a few
areas and then then that's why i need a
team you know you ever have different
skill set you just yeah i managed to use
all of them nice let's uh let's talk
about that for a second because i always
try to drive our conversations or
interviews and in a certain direction so
let's talk about as a
you know as a start-up how do you
actually go about building a team out
like what was your strategy to it is
there a certain type of person you're
looking for certain skills you're
looking for when you get a resume and
things like that actually I right now we
are taking some interest they're going
to start and generate and actually we
hope the gradual because yeah we also
think about the spending with Jim is
hiring new employees for spring and a
lot seems actually very problem for us
when people say there's away is that
they actually like the organized
everything very nicely and Italy so they
actually know how to write a resume and
this is really has to be actually made
with our platform it's just important to
be clean and actually to reply their
personality and yeah why they should
come here and work with us together no
are you injured yeah in terms of skill
set are you are you more flexible are
you is it more on the person that you're
looking to hire then I guess the
geocities like does this meet person
meet all the checkboxes I think it's
more actually part of the person because
if you have an effort of taboo
personality and you like challenges then
for sure you are actually fine we're
learning new skills I also can be
companies you know visually it doesn't
need necessarily to know programming
language you should actually be good at
learning fast yeah but right now
actually we organized a extend the team
in the marketing so for example one of
the interns actually suppose you how to
approach the audience our audience
because we also don't know our sticker
your lab which is good yeah it will have
a blog and also let's get one p bar or
missions to help people so our palace
for Strings we actually find people that
have been unemployed for several months
and actually how them to get hired
thanks now because you brought up the
fact that you're hiring mark
one of the things I kind of I kind of
got I got my foot in the door at a
software company by doing video editing
and this is one of the things I kind of
suggests to subscribers and people who
are trying to get their foot in the door
sometimes is even if you don't have the
skill set quite yet to work at a
software company it helps to like as an
employer if you know when you see like
oh I'm playing for marketing position
and I know how to code does that guy
automatically stand out when you're
looking for that that's it that position
to be filled I think for some people
might do that's actually not necessarily
for me I think the added the biggest
sense for people that say I just learned
coding on Coursera and then they just
start working as the developers because
they also have lower low security and
design patterns and other thing is
important to actually have someone
dedicated to that field okay so you're
here on yeah you're of the mindset that
you need to be all in or nothing
basically like you can't you can't do
one or the other you should be like only
like let's say on seventy percent but
does it feel like yarwood like web
developer if you actually I put passion
what did you and you actually do like
what did you and you are willing to
learn is it because I just what you have
to be a whip or substantive lip or nose
it's like you have to be a good one you
have parsley too yeah or and learn
because like in two years you can easily
become as a dinosaur that's definitely
true and it's funny because I'm part of
all these coding groups and one things I
think quite often is people saying I
just graduated a boot camp right so they
started from zero went to like a hundred
right in three months and they're
already burnt out on Cody and I'm just
like thinking to myself like you never
you're done you're really done like even
if you get a job you're not going to
learn anything from that point on and
like that's really a crucial part of
coding when you say
a little bit you always learn there are
some new technologies there are always
new traits that would ya now for example
I see like many young developers feeling
like okay like Java or different
programming languages they are perfect
actually we were the programming
languages they have bugs and you're
supposed to know like the pros and cons
of using the technology against you for
like knowledge Iran is very focused on
zynga like only lodges are wrong way to
be but ok this is only a set of problems
not everything now what what would your
advice be for someone who is has just
graduated up with the sig CS degree and
trying to do you think they should kind
of study on their own or should they
jump into internships or should they
just go straight for the junior dev role
what do you advise me for somebody like
that actually I class rule that would be
very good to start an internship I mean
like in when Alex my AP degree in
Copenhagen Denmark like yeah a lot lots
of things like in the first two years of
school but then afterwards I had an
internship and I feel like in those team
are so the internship I learned as much
as in the two months your school and
that's the thing you know it's very
important to read they learn the theory
but you should also like a practice
practice and that's yeah the best it's
actually sharpen your skills by doing
nice and sexy like how you become a good
developer like a good lots and lots of
six and then you learn from those
mistakes now like like we said earlier
in the video you launch the now premium
version of Novell resume can you can you
can tell us what the because I want
premium common I magic now that I have a
job I you know I don't think it's
usually update your resume when you're
getting ready to look for worker we just
got fired right I haven't had a chance
to check out the premium version can you
tell us a little bit about what that
what that has added to to your account
from
a basic free account to now the pay
premium actually first of all I want to
have one remark and actually it's very
important even if you are working the
same company for five years you should
still have a cure for Mia at age six
months so it's actually going to be
updated because if you're going to
actually need a job in 5-10 years will
be actually quite hard to remember
everything that's a very good point yeah
and NSA is like just about this side
even on our platform it doesn't cost
something to just to update their
information well yeah we have basically
like three plans right now the graduates
template which you can actually get free
student and then they drew meet it as
here we basically have more salsa
frightening more fonts for color those
who have some video tutorials and we
actually like testing to see how that
goes and if you were actually using them
we're going to develop more and also
want difference between like an
intermediate a senior plan in the senior
templates you can actually have more
than one page NATO sort of features for
a moment but we just we plan to bring
more feature next year nice yes I know
supposed to remember or like we made
this web developer is wait for you yes
and yeah also plans to do that and I
asked her service for bartenders and
different areas that's that's really
genius once you kind of just add a
little bit of style directed in the
field that you want to go to you really
stand out like it's just that I mean
that was what I was told went by the guy
who hired me he was like hey I love your
resume it's on point I love the you know
the tags that are included in it and it
really made you stand out I rest my pop
and it's like all right cool I you know
that's exactly what your regiment you
want your resume do you want it to set
in and out but actually there's a
cricket bar because in some companies
you have to actually have more quickly
ones and some love that also depends on
the job position so for example if you
are like a designer then yeah I should
go like full-on creative but if it's the
more traditional bank then you want to
keep you more
or clean a little of them that's a
creature i personally prefer the the
more like a little bit stylish yeah but
i have i have submitted resumes to
recruiters and they say get this
out of here send me a Microsoft Word one
right now you know I really want that
they want the more traditional one
sometime but i think it is like it's
very important when you apply for jobs
to actually do research okay by the
culture of the company and how do they
work but the models are like yeah what's
the company's accepts pdfs and they have
no problems especially because they
actually want to use them together with
that the application tracking system
yeah there are some soup we have some
companies actually prefer yeah the old
word documents but the problem with the
word document like for example you have
like a different version on your
computer then everything is going to
become messy so that's why I actually is
whether to use the PDF instead of a log
file then it doesn't actually have to
worry about versioning and back to your
point about always having a resume ready
and always updating it consecutively
that's pretty smart because I do that
right now with my linkedin and it's been
very beneficial to me I and also recruit
we're going to industry where recruiters
will hound you nowadays I'd be like you
don't even have to look for jobs you got
a couple years experience leg we want
I'm trying to get my commission come
come come to me and so it's always good
to have that updated resume if you're
like I'll just stick it out there and
see what happens yeah precisely I mean
is this a text when you know where
stories coming you know its resurrection
to prepare for those know before we come
then after it snows that's our
knighthood um so I i know that you if i
remember correctly your your college you
last year of college you basically
create a start-up right and are there
any other like classmate startups that
are kind of shaken off or any any real
interesting one so you kinda want to
give a shout out to or mention as far as
I remember like I I just keep in touch
with legs yeah six seven of them and
mostly yeah they are working in
different store up
from Copenhagen also extract I have this
great Timmy friends she's call Tamia
around oh she's like why should cause I
canvas pouch face so she's working for
company called pragma which is basically
doing open source projects and also
helping companies set up their
continuous delivery framework nice some
of them are actually as we are at this
face and they actually learn look at how
to work with different companies are in
the syrup but I don't fortunately they
ya do ya like this or something in chief
or yours but my event just started with
like when you're very young because
usually if you just say like aguila bt
four or five years then you're just
going to delayed and delayed and delayed
over again just keep going while you can
and it's like you as as we all get older
we get more responsibilities and it's
like look at actually make paycheck
whether you have kids or bills or
whoever else going on cats whatever
whatever it could be right it was like
you know it's good to put your TV the
Detroit to make your company because he
shows actually like your fighter and
yeah you are not afraid to take risks
for example I sometimes watch this
developer his nickname is MPG is from
Sweden and he pitch black had his own
company for your cue and then he failed
and then he just got a job to fortify
there you go I mean he actually run
something and you know if he fails then
is at the end of the world yeah you
still have something to show for you
have a skill set now you have liked you
a lot of its passion a lot of it is like
a this guy actually likes to code
because he did it for two years straight
on something that is probably making no
money on it yeah one of it yeah what one
of the thing or not making anybody feel
like you're so huh it's a girl like you
see i giorni and we are still taking joy
you gotta roll awesome you got to enjoy
the journey that's definitely true
especially at you know the startups as
likes
startups can be vague startups can be
small but if if you're at the literally
the ground level chances are you're
struggling to get by most so most of the
time learning a ton and doing a ton so
you're sure you're putting in even now
10 hours but when you hit the ground
running even more so yeah now as a
employer kind of taken on the interns
and things like that so on and chat says
they basically have a couple IT degrees
and what's wondering if these kind of
online certifications mean anything to
you when you kind of when you you get
applicants in here does it kind of say
oh you know maybe this guy does little
help them aside or you still look for
that traditional education I'm into the
kitchen is this very important and also
like certificates there on Adam so like
for example yes you saw such marketing
and this is a pint of the marketing guy
but then I feel like he also
certificates some coding then yeah
definitely is like a plus it shows like
one kind of person he is like all this
eager to learn new things I things like
very important actually to put
certificates on your resume but a lot
problem i see actually like some people
i have the tendency to put too many
actually a gradual thing when you make
your resume know it's like world robe
you can have many beautiful clothes but
if you put all of them on you in the
same time then it's not going to work
that's a very beautiful analogy actually
know any but i remember reading
somewhere on Business Insider working
nah man just take it just say allows me
I'm glad to hear that uh you know things
are going well I always really liked
Nova where's my comments 1 what like I
said I I reached out to you and kind of
we've kind of kept in touch a little bit
here or there over the last few months
and I'm glad to hear that you guys have
now watched a premium version and you
know things are going steady thank you
and also like if you want to give some
you know
is like we will come forward with your
subscribers yeah just tell me yeah yeah
definitely when I when I end up chopping
up this video I actually look up if I
can see who shares the video because
that if I can if I can see you can share
a video that's what we'll do if you
share the video you know you will give
you you know however many that uh you
know codes we can get we can do
something like that that'd be otherwise
people that get cricket oh yeah comment
from the video oh there you go yeah
let's see see this is why you guys gotta
gotta go noble resume comment how often
do people just give you free stuff like
that that's about as good as they can
get I mean yeah actually other thing is
really happened loves awesome I mean we
got the real free space for school and
we still have it although we are not
sliding there anymore yeah for Ellen
dosa security okay i think is more
vailable we made lots of new people
giving us advice like career or
programming or business wise and I
realized those advices yeah I feel like
when you're in these sort of startups
and this kind of happened to me on a
smaller scale just with YouTube I get to
talk to a lot of cool people on occasion
other other coding youtubers people that
i watch and like that's when things have
you met anybody as you kind of just kind
of been doing your job and I got in
touch and you know that you were like oh
man I was actually pretty cool talking
to this person I mean for example we
actually with this girl from school I
know more easily as she just recently
came back and yeah she was lost hella
far off in the career area and we had we
just has a sour BAM yeah this could just
short some advices and it's only worth
many people and it costs about it and
you don't necessarily have to work them
it's still nice you have to share fault
yeah a lot of it is just like oh well
that's interesting or oh it reinforces
what's in your head and just like you
know what you have some nice
conversations with people who are
passionate about the same things that
you are so I know I know you're
incredibly busy but are you
you ever go to meet ups anymore or do
you do you have any like side project or
you know do you have any any sort of
online coding groups your part of or
anything like that actually I really
because I also bring my master oh wow
yeah that is collecting so my time but
usually yeah we just have it like this
you know incubator these tuesdays
meetings where we meet with all the
companies and also I for example you
want to do some training events or
Christmas but yeah basically I goes for
my time is rather spend X most of my
time is spent in the syrup and it's not
then yeah it's cool look that's your the
perfect example of these people who say
they can people are like how can I get
better at coding it's like look just
code every day and on the days you're
busy code at least 30 minutes so some
people make excuses meanwhile you're
right you're helping run a goddamn start
up over here and getting your masters so
there's no excuses like you just have to
manage your time properly that's really
impressive man good realize that only
comes inside me know it was like girl
because like I mean that care when I was
like and of course your school then I
ways that can just focus for parties but
that said you'd I just SAT start
thinking more about my career in my
future yeah man an outcome one of the
things I was questioned about yeah it
takes time yeah for me for me to get
serious about coding and just getting
better and actually improving as a
developer i had to stop playing games
that was basically i play so much video
games and I we've that out of my life
and i might play like one or two hours
every 2-3 weeks now but you know you go
from spending maybe 20 hours a week
playing games to half an hour a week all
sending of 20 more hours to code and
things like that so it's got to manage
your time a little bit better at night
sometimes you have to you know maybe
you're at the point where like look man
I'm single I gotta go on dates like I go
to parties and then you know your cozy
suckers for you got it you got to make
those choices when their rights for you
to make it actually I once they have to
give up one of the parties because I
used to go like
push the tiles in the city and other
days and just going like what two three
weeks another okay I used to be at the
game were before but like what really
works for me now this you know I just
yeah reserved like four days you know
Europe and then just like I play all day
long there you go just like hey I just
got to get out of my system and then I'm
good to go is necessary though I
actually like you like looking forward
you know like yeah so like rose up a say
okay I'm just gonna take one week in
January and then yeah just play games
and it's still fun you know and then you
just take a break and then yeah when you
play again it just gonna be I'm excited
but that sort of thing yeah it's a good
thing to exit play each day I mean yeah
I also like in a way you know it
develops your brain but I also believe
like if you can't sleep play video games
then you come you can become a little
depressed because they are just sitting
on the computer and yeah yes playing and
it's mr. act as if they go out socialize
or who sports or I actually example into
sports like you also going to feel more
yeah better you have more energy exactly
there's definitely a correlation between
physical activity and be able to think
clearly and focused and so like I was
one of the things I had to implement
also as I had to start kind of
exercising regularly would you do all
these healthy things your body healthy
your mind can function a little bit
better and whether that be asked for
exercise whether it should be it's like
when you're the sports is very important
to actually find something to enjoy you
know they just do it but I for example i
also tried to go to the gym but i just
don't yeah i'd like to send all the
lifting weights it says idea i just
found some cardio exercises sensor or in
doing yeah like kungfu kicks pot for me
just let that's something i need to
implement as well because like i've been
going to the gym and like lifting
weights and I find myself not that I'm
being lazy but i'm just bored i am just
bored oh this is so maybe I should start
place book for its exact that is not
about actually any muscle to see what ya
making your body feels more help
I have more energy see I got all the
muscles I need man so it says it is that
someone says in your diet important as
well yes guys we definitely have to eat
hell that um God knows how you like
that's one thing because I so my
coincidentally my personal life my my
girlfriend lives with me but I moved
down here before for like the first six
weeks before she got down here and let
me tell you man I think I might have
slowly been killing myself with all this
 i was eating in my system and now
it's just like I feel so heavy all the
time because actually I'm nutrition in
my body definitely definitely got to eat
healthy and uh you know eat six weeks of
 and then you're just like oh my god
we start eating healthy food until
things feel natural to feel like you're
poisoning your ex ok here it yeah i just
lost you for a second but you like it
look like what it is what they do like I
has a dream a stupid like six days in a
row healthy and then you just select
that flat one pizza or spaghetti I mean
yeah I forget to like junk food for
Donna like cam from time to time but not
that's awesome now let's let's step back
a little bit in no more Nova resident
first you're talking about our weekly
diets and his work on hanging or paleo
what is uh how would you say to handle
because handle your LinkedIn account for
an novo resume how do you think you
should kind of ink you know one compare
one with the other how do they interact
together then acting myself so this a
little too big need that's awesome
because I'm not looking for a job but I
still updated from time to time I'll say
like for the first it makes more like
when you're actually playing to a job hn
yours of em and there is gonna actually
show what's the most important for the
company so for example dia NSA you have
been working for ten companies but then
again you should select the tree the
workplace is actually show why you are
the best candidate
for as more position and if they
actually going to like yours man they
can either also check your link in
before the interview or after the
interview let the edges are example if
there are like 1000 candidates apply for
a job then they're going to select 30 50
SMS and only for those people you will
actually check the LinkedIn and a lot
actually probably you know this people
just copy paste the content and it's
also very important to actually show who
you are with your own Road oh yeah words
like there's also public with writing
CVS or SMS services because usually
people like hamiltonicity to hire so
much rather resume but the problem about
that did not use the old world so
actually like if you hire someone to
write my resume then no matter how that
person is gonna write a resume is not
going to be me because I haven't used my
word and that's actually something we
are trying to do is to see actually
people here what kind of content is
right on your Israel with your own words
