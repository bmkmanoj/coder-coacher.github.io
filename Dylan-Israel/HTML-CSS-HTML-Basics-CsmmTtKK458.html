HTML and CSS you can see I already have
about 27% of it done but I did this a
while back like probably nine months and
I need a refresher and it didn't do any
videos on it so we're gonna go ahead and
start from the beginning and work our
way through so up first introduction to
HTML HTML basics alright so in this case
we're gonna need to reset the code since
we've already done it so you can see
right here
doctype HTML and change text online to
between anything you're like so let's
we'll change it to the standard hello
world save and submit and it says hello
world ok easy enough strong basically
it's just bold the tag for bold rather
this is talking about cascading style
sheets CSS helps make your website look
pretty it really says so in this case
we're gonna go ahead and put three lines
men above the test dot HTM which is now
linked and we want to put our HTML tag
and it looks like our ending HTML tag
three lines mentioned above and then we
need of course our documentation this is
basically saying to read these chanel
then we need Nystrom it right so we just
this is basically what you want think of
it as is the bare essentials to get your
HTML code to work one more time we're
gonna be put in the exclamation point
doctype HTML and I don't
this is case-sensitive or not I've never
actually tested it so I guess you could
test it on your your own time and then
with a Chanel you always have a hanging
bracket in this case which will do again
hello world save and submit cool so just
remember the doctype HTML in the HTML
section alright next we're going to be
adding a header tag and a closing head
tag you'd have to look at a little bit
more of what a head tag is but basically
I don't want to explain it wrong but
it's just part of HTML kind of like a
body thing it's almost good to think it
was a header of a page I guess wouldn't
be the best way to think about it then
we want to have it title and I want to
add a closing title and you notice how
everything is getting layered with it so
things get close it's important to know
what you're gonna put in there so for
the title we are going to put my web
page oops
then we're gonna save and submit and
you'll see anything because it's
actually the title up here I believe if
I remember correctly alright so
underneath the closing head tag put an
opening body tag and a closing body tag
so let's see right here so it wants to
be underneath the head we're going to
have our body then we're gonna have our
closing body and then inside the body
create two paragraphs you can each
paragraph alright so this is kind of how
you display tags true degree I remember
correctly hello world
and then we'll create another paragraph
right and this one will say hello to you
too
all right so you can see our text
everything's going nicely next up we're
going to work with something called body
elements so in the body section create a
heading to do this create a h1 so
there's various ages but like h1 h2 and
they each do various things and regards
the size of text so shoot your slash and
then we want to add content hello world
I think oh we're gonna leave world
capitalized okay so you can see this is
this heading is significantly bigger so
let's try will do H 5 and H 5 you can
see right there it's smaller but in this
case example is for each one we want to
close it underneath the heading tag
create two paragraphs alright so in this
case I'm just gonna write out our two
paragraph let's see alright
greetings goodbye sounds a little bit
morbid but so I figure hello world
goodbye world alright so next we're
going to be messing around with the H 1
H 3 and H 5 paragraphs so your code
currently has one h1 heading two
paragraphs add an h3 heading before the
second paragraph so this is paragraph
one this is paragraph two so we want to
add a second heading so there's h3 you
see how our text change
and then an h-pipe after the second
paragraph here clothing and then it
wants us to add a third paragraph after
the same closing PP and so you get to
see a little bit of what's going on here
well pretty basic stuff so far so we're
gonna add three more headings to this
code H 2 H 4 and H 6 under you're
chatting in that short paragraph don't
forget pair you're asking just start
with them all right so let's try and do
it in order a little bit so we'll keep
on doing hello so this h2 clothing each
shoe and then that's h3 then with
another itch for here in each 4 is 5 and
then let's see h6
world closing and it says under each
heading had a short paragraph don't
forget the paragraphs need an opening
and closing so we we added age to so in
this case start repeat here and then we
need a closing P before the end of the
closing h2 and when we add attach or
closing then we added in h6 the
paragraph here and we need our closing
paragraph and so it looks like a lot but
I believe that's what they are asking so
cool so we have a lot of hellos hello
world and everything in between so add a
title between the title tags we'll call
this a low title and then we need to
create h3 size heading then the body so
this is the body I'll assert I will
create an h3 sized heading in the body
just don't forget to close it create a
paragraph tags looks like we already
have done that with our previous thing
yeah so kind of a weird example so let's
go ahead and reset this alright so
you're going places in the body section
create a link all right so enough of all
that garbage we're doing add description
to your link close the element with a
closing tag alright so say we want to
create a link a clickable link you start
with the a and then the href and then
you say it's equal to and then some some
website so we'll just with coke atom
e.com
and then you put the closing bracket but
not the closing out and then in it we're
gonna say some text for the link this is
a link you can see up top and then we
want to close it so that it doesn't have
any other text behind you that clicks on
this link so if we were to click in it
oh it's only happen but uh it's we're on
that later but yeah that's a link so
let's see here when we set the code add
a second image below the first one so
you can see right here in their case
they have added a a rubber ducky so we
need to add something equally good so
let's go ahead and we're gonna go pull
up Google and we're just gonna say meme
and see what comes up whatever the first
people in this real life never heard of
that server okay so we're going to copy
image URL go exit out of that we're
gonna just go ahead and put that in
there and bam there's our our thug-life
going on I think save and submit
ah
okay so we need our closing our closing
up parentheses there we seem that
accidentally deleted it so in this case
we're going to create an a tag all right
in the body and we are going to we'll
just go ahead and copy and put this in
there because you're just gonna put coke
Adam E in here and between your opening
and closing ID tag don't forget to SRC
alright so that's that right thing all
right the and EJ and I believe that
should be it
make sure okay
they wanted us to my mistake so they
wanted us to open up something so it's
gonna let see a hint not sure what
they're asking so they'll make sure you
put a full web address a link URL an
image URL
okay so what's happening here is instead
of having text you can actually have a
clickable image that's what they want us
to do so we will just layer these
appropriately so notice we'll leave our
ending a bracket here and then our
closing one like that and then this one
will be what we'd be able to click on
you see now that it's the link we can
click on it alright so in this case we
are going to create two and add two
images with the image tag one should be
a link that other should be not so we're
gonna have a href equals something
closing bracket and then we will have a
closing and image' SRC and yes I'm a
Jess RC and then make sure you have the
closing slash at the end and do the same
thing here and so we need to go ahead
and go get some images again so let's
type in name
images get I got back with my xbox 360
copy image URL very good meters when I
say to her
I says no I got your nose all right
I'm so paranoid copy the URL properly so
there is the first one and then this one
is actually messed up here this needs to
go in here and I will display that and
this will just go to I guess Facebook
column or something so we can click this
one we can't click this one go ahead and
close that and let's go ahead and save
and submit make sure you have three
elements I'm glad to add two images
using Michelle I should be a link for
they should not link not after two
minutes create a link that's just a line
text up okay so a href equals
facebook.com and then Facebook link and
then closing a and if we scroll down we
can see very tiny lis right here our
Facebook like so let's save and submit
and then last but not least
congratulations we now know the basics
so those are our HTML basics we learned
how to insert an image we learned
basically the formal setup of an HTML
document how to put a title to a web
page create an image or put an image and
links and kind of how to loop those
together so let's see what we will be
doing next next we will be building our
own web page it looks like so as
sandwiches I like eggs and ham mostly
sandwiches I don't know I guess that's
their example I don't know they're
taking that that's pretty good that will
you for our sandwich website so I will
see you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
