have you been coding for and are you
self-taught did you go to boot camp and
it's kind of a interesting answer and I
think this might be the same for a lot
of people especially considering that
after looking at the Stack Overflow
survey 90% of people consider themselves
taught which is kind of strange and
probably not true but it talks a lot
about to me that that stat means that
you have to teach yourself so much that
you're basically self-taught whether you
went to school or boot camp for it now
for me I've been coding for about four
years now - less than two years in web
development which is what I've worked in
and what I've been doing primarily and
but I really wouldn't say I had really
learned to kind of think like a
developer until about two years ago when
I started studying web development when
I kind of started my channel and I
really took it seriously and the reason
I did it was because I didn't like that
I wasn't I was still having difficulty
on like homework in college and a lot of
the assignments and I wasn't as good as
a developer as a lot of these other you
know you have li yeah leave the like
these 19 year old kids who are and I'm
like 25 or 26 at this time trying to be
a developer and they've been developing
since they were like 12 and I'm just
getting started and like it wasn't an
ego thing so much as I could see how
good they were and how outclassed I was
and I wanted to get somewhere where we
were in the realm of competition and it
wasn't like you were the Jedi Master and
I don't have any force at all well I
feel like I didn't need to be Yoda you
know I mean but I did need to be a
Padawan and so I don't know Star Wars
reference some of you may not got that
but basically I just wanted to be able
to I could I could see how good somebody
was and I wanted to get better and
that's how my channel kind of started
but
I would say really I've only been
studying code for two years in web
development which is what I work in
before then those previous two years for
all Java development so Java is a very
robust language one I actually hate and
I don't really enjoy and that could be a
combination of it being with it part of
school and how its taught and what you
do with it as well as other things but
basically two to four years depending on
how you look at it but I've been working
professionally as a developer for six or
seven months now and freelance for about
a year before that and so I think once I
really started freelancing is probably
when I felt comfortable enough to say
that I've been studying code well enough
that I could pick up some clients and
and make a little bit of a side money
doing easy and basic things now
do I consider myself self-taught or how
you know what category do I fall into
because I was in school and I will say
that those two years that I spent
studying Java did give me something and
what it gave me was the ability to kind
of reprogram my brain to think like a
programmer and to think like a developer
was just a skillset that you need and
when you can develop on your own as well
but it just happened that it it
triggered that process I think I really
grasped it when I started working on the
free code camp project signing to build
something and that was when I really
started loving this but I consider
myself self-taught because everything I
work in to this day I've never had a
course on you know JavaScript never had
any course work on jQuery no course work
angular no course work no no course work
Express no course work no no MongoDB no
mongoose no coursework I've had one HTML
CSS course that was most outdated piece
of I've ever had in college and
everything that I've worked with in in
the recent terms has all been
self-taught so I do consider myself a
self-taught developer and it's a skill
that you need when you're trying to be a
successful developer because like that
90% of the Stack Overflow you are
learning things especially web
development so fast that if you want to
if you want to be a good developer you
have to constantly be learning and
you're not gonna have time to go back
and wait for the college curriculum to
update 10 years later you need you need
it now and you need to do that through
documentation ain't change it so fast
that colleges wouldn't even be able to
do that let's say in in a reality let's
say they only they could change every
four years because that's how you start
here this is what we're going to teach
you over these four years and then we
refresh our curriculum four years a long
time the whole industry could change in
four years so that's why it's important
like when you go to these boot camps as
well and they could change their Cricut
faster this is only three months but
when you go to boot camps it's really
important that you continue your
learning I if you're the type of person
that thinks you're gonna go and get your
CS degree and you're gonna go to the
boot camp and then you're just gonna
start working yeah you may start working
but if you don't continue your own
education in your off hours or at work
something you know I'm supposed to spend
about fourth of my time becoming a
better developer at work if you don't
actually do that you're not going to get
to be a successful developer you're not
going to make lots of money you're not
going to make yourself stand apart and
you're not going to go from a front-end
developer to a full-stack developer in a
reasonable amount of time and in the
technologies your work to working with
may be outdated by the time you get
there so you really have to have that
self-taught slash hunger and
understanding that you need to go out
there and you need to absorb as much as
you can
well that that's my two cents on how
long I've been coding for and oh and
also putting in perspective for web
development specifically I think this is
kind of important to mention is that
when I got serious and I said okay I am
going to now start working as a
developer how do I need to get there it
took me nine months roughly so I dropped
out of school and I said look I I'm in
school and I could see I've looked at
apps I can see what uh excuse me I could
see what what is in demand on
applications I can learn all this stuff
I'm ready to be a developer I don't like
what I'm getting taught in the school I
don't think it's relevant and I've burnt
out whole best of things so that's
neither here nor there but so I stopped
to go in school took a job and in that
in about six months I realized I was
ready and I've talked about how I knew I
was ready in previous videos but it took
me from stage zero of hey I just started
learning JavaScript to nine months I am
now moving to Tampa Florida for a nice
pain good benefit web development job
where I'm gonna be one of the one of the
main developers building out a brand new
application start looking I realized at
six months seven and a half I I started
applying nine months it was completed in
there and that was really I would say
took me about nine months to get to
where I wanted to be to be a developer
as well so there's another two cents
that kind of falls into that but for you
guys how long have you been coding let
me know in the comments below and if you
have any questions that I could maybe
provide some insight on I love doing
these ASCO devs I think they're really
beneficial and we can kind of keep you
focused in a ten minute video or
whatever and keep me focused right out
of it by reflecting upon my life
sometimes we're so busy going through
life that we never sit for a second and
reflect and think you know that is an
interesting question how does that apply
to me and I find myself oftentimes kind
of having these conversations in my head
before I do these and I reflect upon me
in my life and what it's taking to get
to where I want to be and where I am and
that's a little well out there but I
enjoy these at the point of this so
