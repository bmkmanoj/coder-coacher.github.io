with Nicolas Spinoza if you remember
about two months back we interviewed
Nick who had just graduated from the
hack reactor boot camp he's now been
since been hired by Bank of America as a
developer working in New York doing
quite well for himself we talked about
his how he negotiated his salary what
sort of salary he got you know what type
of interviews what the interview process
was what he's learned in work first is
learning a boot camp and what may be the
biggest gap was and a bunch of other
really great nuggets of info that that's
kind of awkward thing to say but lots of
great stuff I hope you guys enjoyed I
know you will hey Dan what's up hey hey
sorry about that man I uh I was I'm
trying to learn no didn't Express I
completely forgot so I was just going at
it yeah no worries no worries
I appreciate you taking the time man
yeah no problem at all um how you like a
nude dude I love it I absolutely I
is PHP at my work and I hate it
yeah use now that work no it's so much
better yeah I I think I'm going to just
learn the traditional mean stack in my
off hours you know I have to use PHP at
work I don't do too much of it yeah it's
I could see why people would give that
 up real quick for some no yeah yeah
no just so simple I guess it's not easy
per se but it's simple mm-hmm which is
important and so last time last time we
talked you were in the middle of the
grind man you were we were doing the
interview from the the kitchen right of
a friend's house yes
so however how have things been since
then uh well things are significantly
different I've been at my job now for
about a month I think was a month
yesterday and I have my own place I'm in
not New York but Jersey City which is 20
minute train ride so yeah thanks sir
things are a lot different and I
making like six times what I was making
before so yeah so like that so you were
four people who maybe didn't see the
first interview which by the way you
should go watch that one as well
no but uh you were a chef before then
yeah yep I was working as a chef a lot
more work/life balance as a developer
and we'd like to get into the exact
amount but what would you say the the
the jump in pay was from a chef to a
developer at Bank of America oddly
enough it's literally exactly six times
I was making before yet it's six figures
definitely within hacker actors
advertised median starting salary yep
six times I don't know if anybody heard
that but six times geez yeah for you
it's a big oh man I was like doing my
budget now cuz I like just paid my first
month's rent and I was oh wow I could
actually like save money it's amazing
yeah it's like oh you know what I guess
I can eat more than just rice and beans
this month this is great yeah oh it's so
great I just interviewed a guy Chris
Sean who's just getting started his
YouTube channel but he got his first
developer job and it's great to see how
people are turning their lives around
with code and like getting like really
kind of going on to the next stage
almost yeah you know it feels like it
feels like I just graduated something
it's funny cuz all my friends from from
college are graduating in June with
their Comp Sci degrees and I got the job
first right it's it's crazy cuz um so I
don't know if we went into it but I
actually stopped going to college I'm
debating if I want to go back or not but
I actually make more money than some of
my friends who stayed in college and
graduated it's kind of crazy because it
really is on like the individual
developer basis like can you prove
yourself if so nice job out there for
you yeah I really agree with that I'm
like helping helping my friends get
ready to get jobs as well and I feel
like you're not very job ready without
with a four-year degree if you haven't
like been doing stuff on the side
like they might be like really good at
Java but they don't know like the build
tools like maven or grundle or any
frameworks like spring or sequel or au
RMS and it's like it's that stuff is
like 60% of what you do on a day to day
basis I mean it's really cool if you
could whip out like an awesome binary
try but you're just not doing it all the
time
and I talked about like you don't really
being a former computer science student
myself you don't really have the time
like you're you have so much homework
and so much to study for that
you're not never gonna use you don't
have the time to do those side projects
you have the time to study the things
that are actually relevant or to go to
hackathons and do all this cool stuff
yeah it's it's like a trap it seems so
yeah I don't know I don't know what you
do but I can see just take the the
slightly lower job and then and then
hopefully you make more than than us
maybe if you're a good developer though
right like yeah if you go and you get
your CS degree and you're a good
developer you're gonna do good but if
you go to boot camp you go self-taught
if you're a good developer and you
market yourself well you should get a
good salary as long as you're looking
right yeah that's that's ugly an
important thing to know you really get
what you you get out what you put in I
think I mentioned last time about hack
reactor that there seemed to be in my
class like a clear divide between the
upper students and like the lower
students and some of almost everyone is
already hired it's been like I think two
months since I graduated or so but the
but every one that I thought was very
strong we were all hired and within like
our first month so hiring managers can
no they definitely know if you're good
or if you're not after an interview and
the other thing is that interviewing is
a skill in itself like whiteboarding
interviews because a lot of that stuff
is not actually what you do on a day to
day basis so even if you're getting
ready to do your job make
sure that you're doing that's why
problem at least one or two every day
like Saturday and Sunday just just do
them all the time because it's it's
building a school that you don't get
from building side projects you know
like talking through an algorithm coming
to a conclusion and optimizing and
talking about accessibility how old
something would scale across you know
bigger input sizes you know time is base
complexity big o-notation
it's not stuff that you're thinking
about all the time despite like when
you're writing code every day at work or
if you're building side projects so it's
definitely a skill that you need to
focus on building alone yeah it's it's
it's interesting too because it's as a
junior developer oftentimes they are
looking for you know they want that deep
knowledge but they also want the
practical skills but more than anything
else I feel like when you're really
going for a junior role they're looking
for good communication which is it
really associated with developers
because you're working with other junior
developers senior developers can we get
along with this guy and always seems to
be the case that communication is key
and yet so few people focus on kind of
those outside of the technical skill
boxes yeah I was lucky to have good
communication skills especially from
from working as a chef so wasn't a
problem for me but there are so many
people I have problems with those soft
skills and they're just as important as
technical skills maybe even more
important really because you know if it
takes you like for example if it takes
you know programmer X twice them out
twice the amount of time to learn
something then program or why but
programmer X can explain it to the rest
of the team much more efficiently and
he's still more valuable to the company
because it's still a net time like
saving so communication skills are very
very valuable and it's it's one those
things to where so I'll give up free
today I got an email from a recruiter
with an app that they think I should
apply to right so I'm sure you get them
all the time too right I get like two
every day what
turn my linkedin from looking for jobs
to have a good job it's like now all the
recruiters want to give me a job right
but one of the things that I've been
seeing a lot more often on the on the
apps are things focusing on
communication or things going like you
know the workplace I hope you're okay
playing ping pong and getting shot with
nerf guns and stuff like that and the
whole like getting shot with nerf guns
what that's really saying to me is like
can you kind of relax can you be a good
person be around are you gonna be so and
nobody wants to work with him I
shoot you with a nerf gun are you gonna
be like like that guy yeah
yeah that's and the thing is like you
can get a you can probably get away with
with not having great soft skills right
now but in the future as especially as
boot camps are getting more popular and
people are realizing that you can self
detroy into it eventually it's not gonna
be as easy I don't want to say it's easy
to get a job but there's definitely way
more jobs than there are developers and
eventually companies start will have the
luxury of hiring people who have better
soft skills and I'm willing to bet that
that will be the bar that gets raised
before the technical bar gets raised
that yeah that's my insight anyway and I
tend to agree like there is there will
always be a technical standard but like
the jobs that they're sending me like
experience-wise I'm like halfway there
but they're like nah don't worry you're
you're golden if you apply it so they're
dying to have positions filled and you
have to have a little bit of knowledge
and you have to be good but you also
need to be someone they can work with
say look we can develop this guy into
whoever we want yeah that's for sure
especially with the JavaScript ecosystem
right now where it feels like every
other week there's a new library or new
bill tool and it almost doesn't matter
what you know it matters like what you
can learn or how fast you can learn so
yeah I definitely think soft skills and
like you're learning threshold I guess
is what's most important so I'm trying
to remember the exact amount you spent
on hack reactors like 14 there's 18,000
17 something so it seen something so 17
to something $17,000 sounds like a lot
but you you just since then you got
hired how long did it take your get
hired like let's see I accepted the job
I started on February 5th I think I
accepted the job like halfway through
January just it's a big bank so it takes
a long time for onboarding how long
since you graduated to job offer
acceptance
I finished December 10th so like a month
and a half or so but in Christmas and
years just like in the middle of that so
it would have been shorter for work for
that I think so seventeen thousand plus
two for the bootcamp six weeks later you
didn't double do triple six times your
income that is impressive yeah yeah I
quit my my last day of work was March
22nd of last year so in less than a year
she's pretty cool so what would you what
would be your advice to someone who's
perhaps considering going to a boot camp
so I said this before but I want to
reiterate you really get out what you're
going to what you put in so I really
advise doing as much ahead of time as
you can because people people have this
this fear and I I thought this as well
that well you know the value of bootcamp
X is that they're gonna teach me why but
it's not that you're not going to learn
something even if you you know something
going in you're just gonna get a deeper
understanding or you're gonna get the
opportunity to teach other people and
help them learn which is like a really
good way to like cement your knowledge
and learn how to talk about it too
because that's how you're you're gonna
do well in an interview is if you've
talked about you know mongodb for six
weeks that obviously you'll be able to
talk about it in an interview but if
you're a MongoDB wizard and you've never
said anything and you know you're you're
not gonna be as strong so definitely do
as much ahead of time as possible I
would really focus on some of the
computer science fundamentals hack
reactors is a good job with it but I
know
boot camps are sort of notoriously weak
with with data structures and algorithms
and there's tons of resources for it so
definitely learn them you know
especially your vsts your hash tables
you're like lifts no you know quicksort
and mergesort be able to make a bubble
sort joke that's important for
interviews yeah I I always tell people
the best thing you can do is have a joke
in your interview it's like if you can
get somebody to laugh and they because I
really do think it's a matter not only
having some skills but they will
overlook the skills you don't have if
they like you I really do so oh yeah for
sure
go in there and make them laugh and like
if they if they do that like you know
what I like that guy let's give that guy
a job yeah it's it's definitely it's
definitely the way it goes oh and the
other thing I would suggest if you're
going to a JavaScript boot camp and
again I can really only speak a factor
but for the most part they ignored types
because you know JavaScript is a
dynamically typed language but it will
behoove you to learn types one it will
just make you a better developer but two
if you can talk about what a lot of
people will see is the flaw of
JavaScript of being dynamically types
and they used to like not agree with
that but I definitely agree with it now
if you could talk intelligently about it
and and you know sort of the flaws to
JavaScript development especially like
giant applications and understanding
what type type languages do for
development that will also make you look
really good even if you just have a
conceptual understanding plus of course
there's type scripts which is is getting
bigger I really think it's going to be
adopted in the react community not just
the the angular 2 community so
future-proof yourself
also if web assembly comes out then for
sure if there will be type languages in
the web
I'd like to use talk about future
proofing cuz I was talking about this
with my coworker the other day and he's
like why you live any node why he
learningexpress why you
you know diving into react and angular
to all these things that we don't use
I'm like cuz if goes south I want
to make sure I got a job tomorrow
like and it's I it's really important
swish as a web developer rights
like we were just talking about
JavaScript something's new daily yeah
you have to you always have to keep
learning you can't you can never stop
learning unless you want to be like the
people who are working in Fortran right
now you know or like standard Lisp you
know you don't want to be stuck with
like super old technologies that are not
gonna be fun to work with you know 10
years from now and the more you know the
more you're gonna get paid as well
that's your your motivation and very
quickly as well - so like a lot of
things like yeah if you have five or ten
fifteen years experience you're probably
gonna get paid well no matter what but
if you're at one or two three one two
those five years and you want to get
paid very quickly you wanna make $20,000
jumps every year $10,000 jumps you're
gonna have to learn the newer stuff
because it's less people are gonna know
it oh yeah for sure I really think that
there is sort of a linear relationship
to the stuff you know as opposed to the
salary you get paid like I know one of
the reasons that I did as well as I did
and my interview and and my negotiation
was because I like I could display a
passion for functional programming and
I'm just like a geek about it but at
least my hiring or at least my boss
really thinks that it's the future and I
I do as well so being able to talk about
different programming paradigms and to
compare you know imperative programming
and I'm just going to programming or
functional programming and the
differences and how that affects
architecture from a systemic level
that's the kind of stuff that'll set you
apart from other bootcamp grads and I
know it's not focused a lot but you know
take the time to learn it outside of the
bootcamp
whether it's during your boot camp or
afterwards while you're in the job
search because this stuff like that that
makes you stand out and this really
should be your goal when you're looking
for your first job now you had mentioned
the negotiation process when it came
down to do do they cut send you an offer
you looked at you said yeah I'll
take that or how did it go down I mean I
looked at it and I said to myself yeah
 yeah I'm gonna take this but uh you
always
never want to leave money on the table
and there's no as far as I know
and what hacker actor told me there's
really not a situation where you're
gonna send someone and offer and then
they're gonna say well no we're gonna
take or you're gonna you know send
someone a counteroffer and they're like
well no we'll take the offer off the
table you know the worst that happens is
they're like we don't really have that
in our budget and then you say okay I
guess I guess we can make the original
for work or something you know so you
always want to say you know have that
little give-and-take and it certainly
worked for me and I from what I
understand it it's very common in the
industry yeah it was something that I
like I think I got paid fairly I think I
do get paid fairly well but it was much
more money than I was making at the time
I don't have the balls to pull the
trigger yeah I wish I did I wish I did
but yeah yeah well I mean to think about
hacker actors I had so much coaching
with it and the I forget what hurt what
they call her but oh the outcomes coach
her name is Lena is like a monster she
is so good and she would like drill us a
lot about it she thinks I was like super
prepared by the time I got there no
that's something I didn't think about
how a boot camp would prepare you know
we're always thinking about the
technical skills and stuff like that and
like how to go and get a job but
negotiating was that something I heard
to me and I mean you could have I don't
know what you negotiated upwards Oh
but that could have paid for a good
portion of your boot camp I would
imagine um the the price increase that I
negotiated for paid for my boot camp
completely and it did that for a lot of
my classmates and a lot of them were
able to negotiate we're signing bonuses
that just paid for their boot camp
completely I wasn't that lucky but but
it's definitely possible if you're just
really good at negotiating or just
getting really a job well it goes down
as well to be in a prepared developer
right at the end of the day it's like
hey I know I'm I know I'm worth what I'm
saying I'm worth so give me the under
seventeen plus thousand dollars yeah
yeah and then the other thing the sort
of idea that I had as a developer or as
a bootcamp person
I wouldn't be like I didn't really look
at really cool companies like snapchat
or Facebook that I think of like as the
epitome of like tech companies right now
but one of my good friends started at
snapchat like two weeks ago so don't
limit yourself to like your second-rate
companies go ahead and just apply for
everywhere that you want to work at and
let them decide don't rule yourself out
of anything you know there's enough
people that are gonna do that for you
yeah there will be plenty of people to
hold you down don't hold yourself down
right yeah have you been I know last
time we talked to you you were working
on a blog have you been posting actively
to it so I definitely neglected it for a
while after I got the job I sort of took
a good break but I'm getting back to it
I have I'm working on a post about
typescript and defining the Haskell
monads with the typescript type system
that should be really cool and just
gonna come out the end of this week so
definitely look forward to that you're
right yeah my head off so where can
people go and find your your blog it is
just blog dot Nicola Spinoza calm and
I'll link it in the chat I break mostly
about JavaScript or other functional or
functional programming so if you're into
immutable data structures monads funk
tours applicative funk tours
higher-order functions or just like
react then then that's the place now now
that you've been working as a developer
for you know three four months now and
obviously you got prepared very well but
what's the one thing that you've kind of
you was you weren't expecting being an
employed developer from someone who's
just studying development as far as
day-to-day work it's just in general
whatever comes to mind well the thing
that comes to mind for me but I imagine
this is only because I'm in like a huge
enterprise is that all the red tape
there is to like actually doing anything
I'm sure this is very different in start
sir or medium-sized companies but in a
in a big company like Bank of America
there's like a lot of forms to fill out
so just like get note installed and
there's a lot of like things that happen
in the company that are not have nothing
to do with you that will affect the work
that you do as far as what projects
you're working on they I had a project
gets scrapped like a week after I
started and now I'm like on a new one so
like there's stuff that happens that's
out of your control and for me the best
thing to do is just you know I come into
work every day and do the best I can
with what they give me
that would be that I'd be a little bit
of a hey I know you just spent X amount
of days but we decided we don't do that
 jump on this other thing yeah yeah
that's a I mean it happens it's sort of
like they're competing solutions within
the company from different teams and a
different team one but you know it
happens the other thing I would suggest
for day-to-day work is even if you you
specialized in like one framework you
know like say you're like a react guy
you need to know the ecosystem around
like all of the frameworks to understand
which one is better and what place I
mean like I am making decisions about
what text to use and and I have sort of
like full control over that but I am
sure some people will not be in that
position but even if you're not you want
to be you want to be eating gonna be in
that conversation and the way you get
there is by demonstrating that you know
you know this short that like the impact
that decisions like that will have on
the app and accessibility in the future
nice no any any final thoughts for
anybody if you want to share share
anything with code every single day just
don't stop coding once you get your job
don't stop coding learn new things be
like Dylan and learn node when you're a
PHP guy and yeah I think that's it
that's the most important thing I am
glad you say that because I tell people
all the time does code everyday and it's
nice to hear other people agree with me
but I know it's a it's the best thing
you can do really it's just it's a
steady sort of climb to becoming good at
code and a day the daily grind is the
best way yeah you know it's really
exponential you know the more you more
you learn the easier it is to learn
other things as well I remember when I
was first starting and like struggling
to understand the concept of an object
like you know a year ago and now like
it's it's nothing so like as you and
they all build on each other it's like a
big snowball effect so once you learn
your first programming language picking
up another one is like easy because
almost ever like there's so much
similarities you know jumping across
paradigm is more difficult but you know
going from Java this c-sharp that's like
you know it's nothing and I also would
encourage people to if not learned but
look at different programming languages
and understand that the science
decisions and how that impacts like your
program like programming language of
choice and I think that's a good thing
that's kind of something I've suggested
before where and people think it's kind
of crazy like how can I get how can I
become a better programmer I wanna you
know I'm doing the code kademan doing
free code camp and learning JavaScript I
don't really get it and my suggestion
has been going to Python go into Ruby go
into PHP do all the free language
courses on there and eventually you'll
just start to stop seeing nomada
languages start just thinking about how
does this relate to what I already know
and how can I kind of put all these
pieces together yeah I did literally
every language on coke atom a before I
started like to do other stuff and that
really helped a lot because like there
are some concepts that are maybe like
seem tactically more common and you know
like Ruby or Python but that still
exists in JavaScript and maybe having
that understanding from another
languages will help you pick something
up that's like just syntactically
weirder or less idiomatic and in your
ear language nice well thank you very
much man I'm so glad things are working
out and like I see I knew they were I
knew they were gonna work out because
you were it when we had our last
interviewer in the garage
and like I could see it you're like look
man I graduated yesterday I'm doing an
interview today I'm in the kitchen I was
like this guy's gonna make it man yeah
yeah it's that's what it's about you
know if you work hard and you put in the
time that'll come through in an
interview and you're gonna get the job I
have faith in all 26 of you right now
thanks we'll be good
I will thank you again man I hope that
you stay active on your blog I I really
do I like I like when people are doing
the social media and doing kind of
create more less coding more creative
coding I like that stuff cool all right
Dylan you have a good night I'll touch
you later thank you again but hey guys
thanks for watching the video if you're
interested in coding bootcamp check out
dev Mountain comm where housing is
included in your price of tuition and
