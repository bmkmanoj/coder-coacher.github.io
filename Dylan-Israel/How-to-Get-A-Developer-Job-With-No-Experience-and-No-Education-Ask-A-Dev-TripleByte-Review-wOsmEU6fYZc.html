you about something that I came across
as you know I probably get targeted with
more coding ads anything else and I like
to check them out because I'm interested
about the space and I came across this
triple bite which through a Facebook ad
I think and it was I checked it out and
I'm really impressed with what it is so
a lot of us struggle with getting our
first job a lot of us are concerned
about not having a CS degree not having
resume experience and getting a job at
one of the major companies our job at
all so the triple byte kind of addresses
that to to a degree they're an online
recruiting agency in which you take a
test a programming quiz and then you do
some programming problems and then you
have a technical interview but you do
all this and what makes them really
unique is one you don't submit any
resume experience and you don't submit
any education it's literally just
completely based off the skills and they
have over 200 companies that they're
hiring with and hopefully you'll get an
offer but they have a higher hiring the
most you can see that these aren't like
you know Joe schmo's web designer
Dropbox
Facebook Apple a bunch of different ones
twitch I'd love to work at switch oh
that would be a dream come true
YouTube probably first but reddit a lot
of big companies that you that you would
recognize Coursera and people are all
you do so so it's by the way it's
completely free I don't want you think
that I'm trying to sell you anything or
anything like that
but how it works if you're interested on
on my website coders course comm
actually document one of the test that I
go through to kind of see ok well this
is the first one this is the programming
quiz and it's essentially how the first
part goes is first you choose what type
of developer you want to be essentially
you have the general developer questions
which is hey I've never worked as
involved developer and that's what I
chose just because I wanted to work my
way through all three but once you
choose one just be aware that's kind of
where you're going
because so far I haven't been able to go
and go back and change to the the web
developer front-end developer path but
the way it goes so you have the general
developer which is I would imagine your
recent college student or your
self-taught developer and you're trying
to break into the industry that's the
test for you you have the front-end
developer that's web development based
that I don't know how that is what I
imagine goes somewhat similar to the
test I took and then you have the mobile
developer as well so you have three
different paths depending on where
you're in in your career the front-end
and the mobile are four if you already
have some experience you've already
worked in you're maybe trying to get new
job or you're trying to check something
else out but essentially what happens is
you get a question you get a least in
the general one you go through 30
questions I think it may have been 35
and it's just a B C and D questions sort
of hey in this situation what would you
do in this situation what would you do
what's wrong with this situation you
might get some code and it it was it was
very intriguing because the code would
be in like five six seven different
languages but if you are a semi
experienced developer coder you can
piece it together it's not very
complicated stuff like for loops with
stuff missing what what piece of code is
missing stuff like that so something
that you should be able to piece
together and the next thing is after you
do that you then choose it with for me
it was for algorithms they give you for
algorithms and a short period of time
and they're not the most complicated
algorithms but they are about a five to
seven maybe nine minutes at a time for
each algorithm so they're bam bam bam
bam bam they're time-based I actually
ran out on the last one I was like a
minute away from solving it I couldn't
solve my issue and so I was trying to
beat the clock and I literally uh I
didn't get it but all but after that you
go on to the technical interview stage I
haven't done that yet myself but for
people who are really concerned who are
good developers or aspiring to be a
developer and they don't have that
computer science theory they don't have
an engineering degree they don't have
relevant resume experience right like if
you go three jobs back I was working at
Domino's I was a unemployed depending on
what curtaintime was
so you may be in that situation and
triple bite is a cool way for you to say
hey I've been working my ass off I've
been out there to grind in and out I can
dub solve algorithms I can build
webpages whatever it is if you're if you
are a developer you just can't get that
job triple bite might be able to solve
that because they they literally never
in the process does a does a employer
get a resume never in the process that
they get education work experience it
all bakes off your skills and it's it's
beautiful
I love everything about that because I
think a lot of times people qualified
candidates are getting filtered out and
it's really hard to get your foot in the
door if you guys are interested in it
I'll include a link down below it's a
check it out if you get a job I get some
money with so that's cool but but uh if
you don't at least you can see what
skillsets are out there how did how to
kind of what to actually expect because
it is pretty realistic I mean the
algorithms were a little bit on the
easier end because you only had a
shorter amount of time to deal with them
but I imagine that they'll pick up the
pace stamp down the road if if maybe I
did the one with the developer
experience which as I showed up right
but as always guys thank you for for
checking out the video I definitely
encourage you to check out triple bite
there will be a link in the comments and
there will be a link in the description
and I'm sure other places as well if
you're interested in checking them out I
encourage it I definitely think it will
even if even if you don't think you're
ready I think it'll give you some
perspective about what it takes to be
ready right because they are trying to
get you jobs that's their job is to get
you a job at the end of the day and
don't care about your education that'll
care about your and that's not sick by
the way because sometimes when you say
they don't care about your education or
your resume experience that doesn't mean
that it's not worth anything all I'm
saying is that it's a great it's it's it
puts everybody on an even playing field
if you don't have education you don't
have resume experience to those who do
it puts you all right cool
let's see where you're actually at and
that's what I like about it because I
know there's a lot of good developers
out there you can't get that break and I
think triple bite will help you out so
check them out guys as always if you
want to see
me struggle through these quizzes and
you know don't worry you're not gonna
get the same one I'm sure that thousands
of questions you can on my website
coders course comm along with a bunch of
other stuff
thank you for watching join our Facebook
group grope group Goethe Group Co tech
and caffeine and the keyword for today
for a free course giveaway will probably
be an angular 2 core so V sub course all
courses are great courses will be bite b
YT e b ite is also cool so that will be
the the keyword for the giveaway as
always guys thank you for watching
support me on patreon all that good
stuff I'll see you next time
hey guys thanks for watching the video
special thanks to our sponsors dev
Mountain if you look for a coding
bootcamp or tuition and housing is
included definitely check them out
appreciate it and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
