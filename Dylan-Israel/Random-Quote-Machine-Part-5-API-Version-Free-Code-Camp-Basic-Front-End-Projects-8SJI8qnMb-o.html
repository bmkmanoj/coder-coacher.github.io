short minute since we've touched the
random quote generator but it's been
requested by quite a few of you to do it
with an API last time what we did was we
used an array of authors and an array of
quotes and then we randomly generated a
number that would select a random quote
instead of that we're gonna replace that
get rid of the randomization of the math
and we're gonna go ahead and use an API
to randomly generate our quote so we
have our quote here now if you remember
there's a couple things that we're gonna
change first thing let me just go ahead
and show you the API that I use fors
matic com
it's nice little API here go ahead and
take a look at the documentation learn
it understand it but at the end of the
day feel free just to copy mine as well
as long as it works it works definitely
spent some time the documentation isn't
the best but it's not the hardest thing
to get kind of used to anyhow alright so
we have a few things that we're gonna
change right right off the get-go so now
that we're not doing gaming quotes we're
just generating random ones we're gonna
go ahead and edit our HTML real quick we
want everything to what everything makes
sense let's do that first
all right cool that's gone we also
aren't gonna have hard-coded text in
here anymore so before we're having a
default quote load like this we're no
longer gonna do that so let's go ahead
and do the same thing just kind of
comment this out excuse me we just one
delete the delete this right here
like so gonna save it cool so we just
have this very empty looking page now
what do we want to do well first thing
first I've already done it go ahead and
comment out all our code in our get
quote and there was a function here go
ahead and delete that as well comment
out our get quote original call cuz
we're gonna be doing that right now
everything else should be the same you
should have your tweet out function
actually bring this I believe this was
originally inside of our get quote
function go ahead and bring that out
this should already be from the previous
examples everything we're gonna be doing
is within our get quote function so what
are we gonna do well we're gonna store
URL so we're gonna have URL and if
you're not familiar with API calls what
you basically do is you get a URL such
as this one now this is gonna make a
call to the server in our get JSON
jQuery call that we're gonna do right
now that's then going to return some
data and we'll show you what that looks
like right now so what you're gonna pass
in here is a URL and then a function
that's going to return some data that
we're gonna do some stuff with so we
have our data here
cool so let's go ahead and make sure
everything's working let's clear this in
the meantime before we go on so we can
just check to see if everything's
working console dot log and then we want
to go ahead and just log the data and to
see what the data is gonna look like we
can also just go ahead and copy and
paste this into the browser like so and
we'll see an example API call here for
some reason this is gonna format it
usually I have a Chrome extension that
normally formats this nicely but that's
that's an example of the data so let's
go ahead save this and now when we click
new quote you'll see right here we're
getting some data cool let's go ahead
and keep it moving so what do we want to
do with this data we just saw what it
looks like now we want to go ahead and
target our spans so that it outputs that
data so every time it makes that get
JSON call it's going to generate a
random quote and author
so we have our span class quote here and
what do we want to do we just want to go
ahead and change that HTML into
something else so we go ahead and target
it and because it's a class it probably
should be an ID but because it's a class
we use a dot and I named it quote so
we're gonna target the quote like so
well I think I've insert turned on there
you go and then we're just gonna say
look change the HTML in there basically
start fresh and input this into there
and what do we want to put into there we
want to put in the data what we just saw
when we put the URL in and then if we
were to follow that the quote text so
let's go ahead you'll see here and now
we can click new quote it doesn't want
to work obviously
so let's see what we did wrong here real
quick did we spell anything incorrectly
we have oh excuse me so we have to put
get JSON right here or he's not gonna do
anything there we go
I dot get JSON so I guys been working
mainly and angular lately so my jQuery
is a little bit rusty there we go
so you'll see right here we have our
quote we could format that to make it
look a little bit nicer maybe do some
quotations on it now how we do that just
a little something like this double
quotes plus data that quote text plus
double quote single it's gonna save that
and now when we click on this you'll see
we have single quotes now that I look at
it I think double quotes might be the
way to now if you're not too familiar
with like how quotes work in JavaScript
if you want to use single quotes you
gotta use double quotes on the outside
and vice-versa so we're just gonna go
ahead and reverse this real quick just
for appearance sake
and now what we do it it should work
just fine
see there's it Oh unless you mess it up
like I did all right yeah
it's trying to be helpful it's just
causing issues okay so what do we want
to do next the next thing to do is
simply to generate the author in the
same fashion
so we already put a br in our HTML or a
line break and I name this author so
again this should be an ID if you're
doing that and maybe we'll go ahead and
change that but for six this video we're
just gonna skip that so we just want to
change it to the nope no one no quotes
this time but instead what we want is
maybe a dash and then we just want to
add data dot quote author save this make
sure it's running new quote and there we
go we have our quote we have our author
let's go ahead and refresh the page and
we'll just do a reminder as to because
we removed our generic quote nothing
displays what if we just go ahead and
run our get quote when this document
loads you'll see that we have a quote
there every time when it refreshes so I
hope you guys found this helpful
again there's you do whatever you want
with the quote generator be is a
creative as you would like this is
basically just a standard sort of API
