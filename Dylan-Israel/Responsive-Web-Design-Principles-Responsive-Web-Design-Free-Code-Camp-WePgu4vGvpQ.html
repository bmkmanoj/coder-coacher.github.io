web design principles in the responsive
web design section let's go ahead and
jump right in zoom in a little bit so
today there are many types of devices
basically what responsive web design
means is that nowadays used to way back
in the day used to only program for a
computer but then we got computers that
were the size of our phones and now we
have computers or exercise of watches
now we have computers that are in a
Google glass and so we have all these
sorts of computers and various sizes and
in responsive web design we need to make
sure that it works well for everything
so that's basically what the structure
and CSS rules are important in
responsive web design and that's the
reason why so it does make a good point
here that if your target audience is
like a mobile those on mobile you
probably should focus more on having a
mobile first approach right where you
design your what that means is basically
instead of designing from a test desktop
down you want to sign your application
from a mobile device up so your bolt
your your desktop look I just based off
your mobile device while your mobile
device is kind of the main the main view
if you will so CSS cascading style
sheets at this point you probably
already know our one of the ways that
you you design the way things look is in
your in your on your page
alright so we're going to add a media
query within our style tacit add a media
query so that the pre tag has a font
size of 10 pixels so let's see here I'm
not too familiar with media queries I
use a lot of front-end libraries like
bootstrap that will help me with this
but let's see what's going on here at
media max with CSS rules ok so it looks
like if we do at media and then we go
ahead and we apply the max width of and
neck / with 800 PX what we want to do is
we want to go ahead and add a P tag that
does what as a font size of 10 PX let's
see if this is right I may have to get a
hint here I think that's right
if it looks like I made a simple little
brain part there but what we need to do
is instead of max width we actually need
to have max height so when things when
the hyatt is less than a hundred I'll
run that do simple media query now
images you want your image is to scale
well you want your images to scale well
too because that's really important a
lot of web pages only look as good as
whatever you have on your application so
we're going to use the max width of our
image so instead of actually hard coding
a value in pixels what we can do is we
can go ahead and target the image and in
here we want to set the max width of our
image to one hundred percent so that
takes up its entire container now it's
not necessarily what's going to take up
the whole page but it will take up the
container that it's in now we want to
set the display to block so it treats it
that way and we want to set the height
to auto so we want to treat it as a
block element which is why we're saying
display and then the height to auto so
that what we don't want to happen is the
image then scales all the widths that we
that it would but it doesn't actually go
the height that it needs to to say in to
stay in the correct dimensions very nice
using a retina image for high-resolution
I now I'm not slow down for a second
because I'm not too sure what they're
talking about here the simple the
simplest way to make your images appear
retina and optimize them for retina
displays is to define their width and
height values only half of what the
original sizes okay so in our image here
say we have a height of tooth
I guess I retina is just a very good
looking image for someone in the
comments below let me know what they
mean by I don't even know if I'm saying
Eric retina display but we want to go
ahead and just target our image some
basic CSS and we're going to set the
width so 100px and the height 150
someone in chat has informed me that
retina is iOS this flight it's around
900 pixels so basically this is to work
better with iOS that's that's my
understanding cool so you can see it
adjusts making typography responsive now
this is interesting i don't know about
the viewports width and height so
viewport being kind of what you're
looking at but instead of using em or
pixels to text size you can use you view
ports to make the font more responsive
as well so our age to tackling is set to
a TV w which would be you'll see a VW
would be ten percent 10 BW would be ten
percent of that which is nice alright so
let's go ahead and we'll have our we
have an h2 tech will run this real quick
so that we can see it so important if
some cool and what we want to do here is
we want to go ahead and set the font for
this equal to a width of
a TV w let's go ahead and run that and
we want the P tag to have a width of 75
BW heads and drop the P tag on it 175
excuse me with of 75 VW and it's going
to run those tests and you'll see now
you'll see how it adjusted right here
too oh excuse me 75 min so keep in mind
that there's this min and Max here where
it's going to be seventy percent of the
viewport smaller dimension so if the
width is smaller than the height because
remember now that we're working with
phones we may be looking at it
horizontally or we may be looking at
vertically so when we set the men we're
going to be selecting 75% of the men of
the smaller one so if it's horizontal if
you're looking at it like this that
would be up and down like you're looking
at like this would be left to right
that's pretty cool I like that so that
was the the first section of the beta
doing the responsive design I look
forward to doing doing much more with it
it looks like we're going to be moving
into the CSS flexbox challenges moving
up next but as always guys thank you for
