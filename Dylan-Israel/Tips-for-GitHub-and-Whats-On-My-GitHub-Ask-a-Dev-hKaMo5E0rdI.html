about github what it is why we use it
and we're also gonna showcase my github
some of the things that I do to make it
pop a little bit as much as version
control can pop I guess and just kind of
let you know I have I have 21
repositories on there so if you're
interested in what sort of projects I've
worked on or if you've watched some my
tutorials online and you want access to
the source code here's where you can get
it quick shout-out to our sponsor dev
Mountain comm if you're interested in
getting getting a new job and starting a
career might I suggest dev Mountain
they've been sponsoring the channel for
quite some time I'm happy to to tell you
about how great they are and how you can
get yourself a new fresh start they got
courses a web div design iOS development
Salesforce software QA check them out at
dev mountain comm so let's start real
quick and talk about what is github and
by the way if you want to drop me a
follow on github just to make it look
like I'm doing something you can go to
github.com slash Pizza poker guy that's
the OG some of you know about the OG
channel name of Pizza poker guy
long before coding tutorial 36 existed
anyhow so github what is it and why do
we use it
github as a form of version control what
that basically means is that it's a way
to store code as well as pull code down
or copy that code make changes to it and
then somebody can decide if those
changes want to persist or not and in my
case I mainly just used it to push out
my repositories repos being your code
parts of your code anyhow and that's
really what I use it for why is that
there we go
and so what sort of things do I have in
my repositories well recently I I've
been working on a vote app you can see
this is in typescript I also have a
Chrome extension called code meme that
in jet whenever there is an air injects
a Gliffy cat which is that cat with the
rainbow behind it I
have a annular Jas portfolio site that I
did for a friend of mine if you go to I
think it is if you go to Vance feiyr.com
you can see it there I have the source
code for that this was a fun project
this was I took a template and I altered
the template and then I added my own
content made it a little bit more spicy
but uh that was what the Vance Faro repo
is I have these certificates this is
something I think it's kind of nice and
I'll I'll be doing more of and something
new that I've started started doing
recently so I have an entire repo of
just certificates that I've earned from
from udemy from solo learning free code
camp I still have a couple more I need
add on here and there just for the most
part pictures okay well here's an
example of of diversity media's angular
for front to back eight point five our
course on angular and as I continue to
do you dummy courses I'm working through
a few I'll add them on here
so learn front-end free code camps
front-end certification this is
something I think is kind of nice and I
should do a better job on the readme I
added this the other day so here's my
front-end certification where is my name
this should have my name on it I'll have
to go back and check I wonder if the
beta messed up something I have to go
back and pull it out but um so learn
certs as well this is something new that
I've done on my on my page here I think
it's kind of a cool thing and I
encourage you to check it out front-end
assessment one this is actually a you
guys want to see what sort of things I
got tested with for a potential job that
is a assessment test that I did markdown
previewer this is a react project that I
did that when you run it it allows you
to preview markdown which is kind of
cool
camper leaderboard this is another react
project for free code camp where you
they're using the free code camp API or
an API to just I don't know if it's
actually free code camps API but
free code camps data who are the top
hundred top most active sort of people
on free code camp Udacity projects I
think I didn't finish this one my reads
is a react project that is the first
projects from the react now degree
program simple weight converter is just
a test project nothing crazy I think
this is a duplicate I might've made a
mistake code fights so this is this is
something that I think is kind of cool
and fun and this is my I actually took
time to write the repo for this which is
more so than I normally do um so I have
to go back and fix this but this is
actually right here links to a playlist
of all my code fights algorithms and so
you'll see here if I go it's broken up
into sections this one shouldn't be here
but if I go into no intro you'll see
that I have ADD and then add MD for
instance these should actually be
folders so that the readme page displays
he's easy enough but essentially it has
the the video at a link to the algorithm
solution it also has the the the what it
is we're trying to solve and then if we
were to actually go to the function
itself and it looks like last time -
this was six months ago so you'll see
that we have our little comment here and
then of course some code here the show
this is a relatively simple one alright
we're talking about having two numbers I
think it might actually be the very
first one let's see is this one a better
one this one's a little bit more spicy
so you can see here we're finding the
median value all that sort of stuff so
that's probably my largest one angular
for projects was an introduction to -
what do you call it
introduction to angular there's
something like I was doing the the
angular heroes tour if you go to the
angular documentation no I'd skip over
that one exercise tracker I don't think
I ever finish this one this was a this
is a a react project on free code camp
that I was working on URL shortener
another react project for free code camp
same thing with file size another react
project on free code camp basic
algorithms I believe this is the basic
algorithms from free code camp
all right here yep
that's what it is so you can see all the
algorithms from when I did two years ago
oh my goodness I'm sure that I should
redo this for fun has it really been two
years since I've done free code cancer
versus Turing I probably would still
solve reverse to string the same way I
might instead there's a million
different ways you can solve this but
what is this separator is equal oh my
goodness
I must have been diving deep into
Firefox documentation or Mozilla
documentation to be doing some
like this that's funny so that's that
patreon JavaScript I was for a while I
was playing around with the patreon Jess
I just pulled a repo down see what I
could do with it
free coke on hikes development and then
of course the free code camp I pulled at
one time to play around with that repo
but yes I mean that's really what's in
my github
I followed a couple I think oh here's
something cool I'll show you guys this
real quick work so there is a project
where they actually make a resume based
off your github and then we can just go
to so like if you want to have a cool
resume that you can submit that's
auto-generated it uses your github your
github data so if we're gonna do mine
right Pizza poker guy it will auto
generate a resume page based off your
URL probably hitting some sort of github
API and then it sorry this is it
enthusiastic github user github since 25
15 takes 21 public repositories hundred
for followers here's my website this is
what I spend the majority of my
languages and it breaks it down by your
repos right JavaScript typescript my
most popular repositories and it keeps
going
people I've contributed with and the pin
the pass and then a little bit about
this resume a pretty cool thing
but that's why github if you guys are
interested in I just thought I'd do a
little little thing about it I would
highly encourage you
even if you're not super active like I'm
not really active online I still have
some projects on here that I need to
clean up there's a couple of repos I
need as you as I've talked about that I
should probably delete but it's better
to have something on your just a hat
showcase what sort of fun stuff that
you're working on showing that you're
working on you can see I don't push too
often to it you know I used to get
everyday at work but in terms of
personal projects I very rarely start
pushing things out just because I'm kind
of a slob when it comes I should get
better in 2018 I will get better at
pushing to repos now as you as a as a
developer any developer should have a
github and they should have some code on
there and they should you know just to
showcase their projects so people can
look what they're working on where they
qualified to work on it's just something
I want to work with so I encourage you
to have an active github do a better job
than I'm doing but anyhow if you guys
are interested any of that go ahead to
go github.com slash pizza poker guy
check it out
drop me a follow if you like just so
that uh I can feel better about my
github I don't know what else to say so
it's a is a Vandy thing it looks good -
it looks good to employers I think so so
I've been told anyhow but I appreciate
you all I'll see you next time don't
forget to comment like subscribe share
support me on patreon and all that good
stuff see you next time bye guys
oh hey baby I don't mean to brag I'm
pushing straight to master just left hey
guys there's one thank you for watching
the video if you're interested checking
out any of my courses or you want to
join our Facebook group code tech and
caffeine the links for that will be in
the description if you could drop a like
and go ahead and share the video that
really helps out the channel more than
anything else and of course don't forget
to subscribe
I appreciate it I'll see you guys the
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
