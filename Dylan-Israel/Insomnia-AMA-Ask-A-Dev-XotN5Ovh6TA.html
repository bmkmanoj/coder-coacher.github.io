if that 30 am dance party what are all
these filters me is eight millimeter
sketch I want okay let's just go back to
the normal
I wonder who actually asked those on
their film so we should get some
different people then we normally get in
the live streams since this 3:00 a.m.
Eastern and your boy is having trouble
sleeping just got done watch your movie
in the living room I'm usually in bed by
like ten but uh room Richie what's going
on guys trying to I took a little bit of
melatonin right before it did this live
stream so in about thirty minutes I'm
gonna pass out hopefully having trouble
sleeping tonight got done watching
guardians of the galaxy thought it was
expecting follow-through yet fall asleep
during it and I did not even come close
you to hurry
wise life got you up I think it's just
caffeine on Saturdays I allow myself to
have one monster I don't have any during
the rest week and oh no I think it's
just between that and the focus plus I
didn't get it all out of my system I'm
also doing a detox today and so I don't
know if maybe that had an effect on me
there might be some nice in it nice it's
also an energy drinks so yeah I'm good
for the most part yeah you've working on
videos to Ricky I was working on I
filmed a video I filmed three videos in
the last two days
I got sponsored by Dead Mountain again
so I have to commit to about four videos
a month so which isn't too bad for me
yeah and I had a sponsored video um you
know I have a video coming out about I'm
dreaming about coding again so that's
coming out talk about why that's
important and when the first time that
happened to me I'm I did a video about
why why I went down the why I chose a
computer science degree when I went to
school and I have a video coming out
about my final review on the nanodegree
program so besides that man I've been
working on my um I've been working on my
JavaScript course oh my god I'm at a
hundred and thirty videos right now and
they're like one to five minutes most of
them very few are over five minutes but
um it is it's slowly killing me so let's
see what happens with that course
hopefully um hopefully people like it I
learned oh I tell you what though I
learned a lot going through the
documentation learned about things and I
have a much better understanding of
closures than I did before
yeah man I understand hate in school -
I'm only going back for more so I can
get more money and make sure I don't get
skipped over for promotions and things
like that
um that's kind of where I'm at with it I
found a program that I like and honestly
the thing is that's funny about schools
we go to into class but we don't
actually learn anything in class or do
any work in class makes me wonder why
it's not all online
yeah
you guys having New Year's resolutions I
have like three so far I'm gonna do a
video about it
what did you see in your last video that
you doubt that you will ever work in
node expresso Mongo would you not want
to do that oh no I totally would but I'm
going down a front-end specialization
right now it's just a lot of I looked
for mean stack rolls and it's hard to
find the nodes Express Mongo rolls so
I'm just focusing on angular right now
for my job and just because I think it's
a better skill set to have if I could if
I could land a node a full stack mean or
full stack my role and be the dream man
I don't really particularly like just
doing front-end the reason for it is
oftentimes as a full stack developer the
way that you normally would architect
the project is you built the back-end
then you would start the front-end
however when you only do front-end
oftentimes people want you to build the
front end before the backend is done and
so you're always like rewriting code and
reworking code it's not very optimal and
I finally have fury 18 and I would just
rather like to wait till the backend is
done I never had to wait before cuz I
was always just doing dealing on my own
back-end I thought you were gonna learn
C sharp for the backend it's one of
those things where I think about it and
I asked if I should but we have so many
c-sharp devs that I don't know I don't
know I would I'm at the point now where
I'm like I would like to but I'm also
trying to dive deeper into angular so
we'll see I asked I asked my tech lead
if I should pick up c-sharp he said now
all right I could I could probably pick
it up pretty quickly especially if I
start putting it some hours in at home
oh my goodness start picking up some C
sharps
yeah I don't even know where where I
would start to be honest I guess I just
beat it oh yeah what's going on Arthur
I've been to meet up last night and most
of the 15-year experienced developers
worked in like 12 languages in their
career do you really personally believe
it's better to specialize in one
language I think it's possible to I also
would have to ask what was what like
what did they focus have a focus in
their career cuz if not like I'll put it
this way I work in JavaScript right but
my last job I did JavaScript I did PHP
in the backend let's take this job right
we have a c-sharp back in I very well in
three months may start writing c-sharp
and all of a sudden now I have three
languages that I created although I
wouldn't really say I'm great at PHP but
you sort of have your main language
right especially in web development it's
usually JavaScript for the front end
house to learn so learn is just an
entry-level rundown of the bare bones
basic of a language in terms of
certificates is exactly that it's just
something to pad the resume but really
it's just going to be a quick rundown of
what you need to know
I think the last thing I have to talk
about in line of course for my
JavaScript core so I've talked about
promises yeah they're just one positive
aspect of soul awareness it's an app so
you can take it on the go and if you
have the train you're on the try it
humans for class you can go and just
start knocking him out am I currently
applying to them no I'm just saying when
I was looking for roles I didn't see a
ton of like actual full stack mean roles
I saw angular I saw react I saw a little
bit of node no didn't sense that not
even the backend but uh yeah yeah I
wouldn't say that I'm actively applying
for roles at all I was though three
months ago forgot my new job
how many hours did you code to finally
complete your first project my first web
development project was the weather API
project it took me about 30 hours and
about 15 that was sure struggling trying
to understand what I was trying to do
and what API was I could probably code
that in like an hour now in angular
had I been applying through recruiters
or companies directly both when I was
applying I ended up getting my job I
ended up getting two out of the three
job offers that I got from recruiters
yes micro services that we do a ton of
micro services
nah die I'm doing exclusively front end
right now just angular 5 well I probably
should pick up a different back in
language just at side-projects why they
bench you like that they didn't bench me
it's a new role we have like 12 back-end
devs and like for front-end devs so
they're trying to build out their
front-end team yeah it's a it's as much
as frustrating as it is waiting on other
people it's kind of nice being able to
only focus on one thing it allows me
it's the first time that I don't have to
be a generalist I can be a specialist
and so I can deep dive on to a certain
topic do you think your coworkers study
along their spare time none of my
co-workers study at all in their spare
time except maybe one actually here the
two front end devs I think the - two
front end s might the other like 15
don't
I know one friend dev for sure and then
we have a new a new friend dev who I'm
not he's very good so I'm guessing he
just said he doesn't I don't think he
studies outside but he's a very good
developer so I'd say probably just the
one in myself do you know if your
co-workers to have CS degrees about one
half of them have a degree I would say
2/3 of them have a degree and about of
those 2/3 about 50% have a CS degree so
in total about third half CS degrees do
you still do resumes in the AMA in these
a nice normal E I would man but I'm
actually on my phone so I'm not gonna be
able to guy catch me when it's not 3
a.m. and I'm doing it from the phone I
didn't even want to power through the
computer I do you prefer do you think
you do you prefer front-end work over
back and work um I think friends more
complicated because there's more moving
parts and I like that you can visualize
it back in to me is just databases and
sending data to and from and protecting
said data so I'm not super thrilled
about background do you think you could
get an IT job with a two-year degree I
don't have a degree and I got a job it's
WordPress good for putting on a resume
if you wanted to WordPress
should I look into the logic behind a
project before I start you should kind
of figure it you should sort of write
some pseudocode in your mind or if
you're just getting started actually
whiteboard it out like on a whiteboard
over there what are my favorite books I
really liked ready player one under
scheme is nice death on a pale horse and
a spell for a chameleon so the
requirements for your projects change
very often if I have requirements first
and do they change very often yes all
the cliches about knocking and clear
requirements or requirements changing
it's a it's a very true statement most
of the time doesn't really bother me I
like to give people about it
because I feel like that's the only way
people get better but honestly I'm
accustomed to it and it doesn't bother
me
I'm also very relaxed most of the time
I've had anxiety issues in the recent
term what we typically have just don't
care um I care in fact that I complete
my stuff but I don't worry about
deadlines and timelines because I
understand that requirements do change
well requirements change there are no
timing lights anymore that's how I see
them you know what are the main
languages I should know any that will
put me ahead of the curve it depends on
what you're trying to do if you're
trying to do web development JavaScript
what's the JavaScript front-end line of
work looking like in the next few years
I think it's looking pretty good man you
have a bunch of frameworks that are
replacing mobile jobs so you have like
react native and ionic that's taking
away native to have jobs so the web dev
community's growing in that aspect and
then you have of course all the in-house
jobs and I think it's a tribute it's Jim
pretty well
I don't have any degree except my high
school degree diploma do you think a
four-year degrees needed or is it
overrated
it's not needed but depends on how hard
you want to work
do you use angular animations or you
roll your own so angular doesn't have
any built-in animation say of animation
components that you can then build your
own components with them and assign with
decorators and that's what I usually do
what am i doing up bro I don't even know
do you still go to coding me no I
haven't gone to one in like three months
ever since the iron yard shut down it
used to be ten minutes away now the
nearest meetups like 35 studying for my
final and discrete mathematics right now
what a useless class that is I remember
that class what an absolute joke that
classes
best platform to find freelance work
with JavaScript I know are you gonna do
a vid series on projects we could do or
something of that sort I have a Fitz
video talking about talking about the 27
side project ideas any tips to find job
fast um make sure you have all your
barebone May 6th covered a good resume a
good LinkedIn your code on your github
portfolio website and then apply daily
and be willing to move I do mean daily
when I was looking for work for my first
step job I was filling out 50 to 100
apps a day when are you seeing Matt
again I don't know um he's in the
Philippines right now um I have a
vacation time queued up for a little bit
but I can't spend money I'm trying to
buy a house yes fifty a hundred a day
it's not an exaggeration either what
does a typical junior developer do at
work do they focus on one part of the
website or they add new things it really
depends on the organization I usually do
a lot of build my own applications from
scratch a lot of crud applications
but I I say this just because it really
depends on the organization yes probably
so I supplied four to three weeks and
then I wasn't at fifty to a hundred
those first two three weeks so I was
only flying in California and then I was
applying outside of California and it
took me in total it took me six weeks
here my first deaf job for when I
started applying but I took away a week
or two off because I moved I was moving
the stuff my stuff out of my apartment
to my mom's so it took me six weeks from
Java to signed contract when I started
looking for work
yeah I might've done somewhere around a
thousand app sounds about right
how long did it take you total from
beginner to job would you say um when I
dropped out of school to work as a
technology trainer not a dev yet it took
me nine months to land my role as a
developer at another company but I've
been studying before that so not as
vigorously I still in school but I guess
that kind of answers your question
yeah so I regret dropping out of school
no right not doing it earlier um yeah no
I'm in terms of career I don't have to
go back for school I'm just choosing to
I found a program that I like that's
cheap and that goes out of pace I want
okay do you put your YouTube channel on
your resume or LinkedIn I put it on both
it's one of my best-selling features as
a candidate it it shows that not only am
i passionate about software it also
shows I can code line build full stack
applications employer can see that you
know when you have 700 videos on
software you might you're either really
good at marketing and lying or you're
you're you enjoy software so what are
the other you guys see how much hair I
have I was going through my videos and I
forgot how much how the guy shaved my
head completely bare
how did you develop the discipline to
code daily I started by getting rid of
any distractions that I could getting
rid of all my game systems getting rid
of all that sir stuff I then dropped out
of college and knew that there is no
going back and at that time I was making
about 45,000 in in downtown Los Angeles
and which is poverty wages to put it in
there I I was living paycheck to
paycheck
could barely keep enough money around
for food and whatnot and that's really
all I needed when you're going to bed
hungry some nights or your mom's
bringing you groceries you know there's
everyone has their rock-bottom and for
me it's going to bed hungry and I won't
bring in me groceries and I was really
unhappy and so I could use I had what
more motivation do I need man I came
home every day Monday through Thursday I
put in about three hours after work and
then all the weekends I put in eight to
twelve I was just an apartment cost in
downtown LA
it depends on the quality of the
apartment but like Matt had a studio in
downtown LA and I want to serious $1300
on the low end for his little stud like
250 square foot studio and it wasn't
like a super nice studio it was a janky
like to do so but it really depends on
the area
I was sitting computer science for
nonsensical
what I think a cryptocurrencies I think
they're great man I think I think it's a
great way to do not have to worry about
inflation I think their potential they
have their place I already kind of think
of cryptocurrency similar to credit
cards the fact that these little digital
currency they should built a better a
better card that's still getting credit
you actually have the money as a debit
card it would be a better analogy so I
mean I'm very for it I'm also own some
cryptocurrency so maybe I'm bias I'm a
bootcamp grad but got an offer for a
siesta grief or low-cost FAFSA would you
recommend going because the local costs
are just working it in the field I would
work and get in the fields and then go
back if you decide to
opinion on bouncing back after burnout
I'm finally getting out of the slump my
advice is find something else that
software-related that's fun
the thing the thing that happens with me
is I get burned out on certain projects
so I started different project or I jump
to algorithms or I go to meetups or I do
something different that's off early
maybe I focus a little bit more on
YouTube and I jump around project a
project where I'm still benefitting as a
developer but whatever I'm stuck on
whatever it is the source of the burnout
I go and do something that isn't
directly that right so if you're stuck
on a project and you go and start doing
algorithms right if you're stuck on
algorithms you start a project if you're
stuck on both you go to a meet-up and
then you kind of let that sort of
marinate in your brain and you know you
find out that you solve it by the time
we get home that's my advice that's what
I do and I get burned out it's I also
set time limits for myself now um last
weekend I got burned out because I put
in a 13 hour day coding and working and
I told myself no more so I limit myself
to eight hours a day
on the weekends outside of work so
so like today I worked for eight hours
and nothing more
so I'm thinking of making the app I
don't know we're gonna start or how to
upload it to the App Store Google Play
Store well first thing you have to do is
make the app you have to figure out what
it is that you're trying to build are
you trying to build it for iOS are you
trying to build it for Android are you
trying to build a web app that will
compile down to both once you figure
that out build it and then the end of
the Google Play Store or the the Apple
Store there's guides how to upload that
and and minor fees in terms of buying
servers and data management I don't
think you have to worry about that quite
yet
I went to meet up with free code camp
people and everyone kind of acted like
they were senior developers wasn't good
experience so I've had one bad
experience of all the coding meetups
I've gone to and like one and a half and
it's very strange to see how certain
people are salty uh-huh
and I've told this story before when I
talk about how I became a developer and
where the the guy I was meeting a
subscriber down at a meet-up for a
friend invited me down to oh sure sure
I'll come I've never met her so before
this thing is exciting and then the guy
interjected like oh I didn't know you
know a pizza delivery driver could make
coding tutorials and he was like a super
senior dev with like 10 years experience
he had a chip on his shoulder about
something so you're gonna run into those
people man software on occasion has
those people who have egos and just have
issues
don't let it deter you from going to
more meetups down the road do I think
I'll first try to start your own company
not unless that my YouTube channel does
much better or some not so fun parts of
the job I don't like waiting on the back
end devs
finished their work and having to
re-edit my front-end code to actually
take in early inputs instead of just a
mock day that created what's going on
rocky can you give some tips on what
development for a beginner my tips are
pretty straightforward I would say
kodály build projects start a side
project really that's it and if you do
that you should be successful pick up a
couple your Demi courses on occasion
free code camps great apparently they're
releasing their
do closer look Christmas just a nice
little Christmas present um how would
you describe the biggest difference
between senior and junior devs apart
from years of experience senior devs
usually have a little bit more pull
it's a I also make a lot more money I
would probably make fifty percent more
money if I had senior in my title maybe
more actually but they might architect
out projects a little bit more make
decisions a little bit more they might
be included in the this decision talks
hypothetically speaking of skills
required for the job being put CS degree
do they double check I have no idea the
balls to do that - for 50% more yeah
easily
50% more what's my salary I don't mind
saying but a lot of times your employers
do so I'll just keep it to myself
um have you ever regretted being a deaf
no I mean I've had my my imposter
syndrome moments where I've worried that
I wasn't cut out that's stressful but I
would say I regretted being a devil
how many hours should I go today um
three to four I would say
I will say I make more money than the
than the average junior developer at my
work I found out
I'm I'm well compensated for one year
experience let's put it that way
did ever go through anything that made
you think of insanely different way
nothing that I can talk about on stream
how are you still a junior deaf how many
years have you been employed as a deaf a
little less than a year and a half and
then I have a three month internship
with some contract work we can say
that's six months if we really want to
stretch it so two years Max Plus as a
technology trainer in the field so in
the industry
less than three years longest coding
streak like long as I went to the first
hackathon I went to we started at 8:00
a.m. and I think we left at 11:00 p.m.
back when I did Jake argument
I like web dev not love is that enough I
don't know it's it's a it's a
case-by-case thing I can tell you most
people don't like coding as much as I do
and they are fine developers if I'd be
pop and I could very well in the next
year or two be in the same way right
I still use jQuery at all no I never use
jQuery for anything
and now there should you by the way
you see sharp dine or not I don't know I
don't think so I saw it I said a ton of
c-sharp jobs I'd have to do some
research but when I was looking for
roles three months ago I saw a ton what
do you use if you don't use jQuery I use
angular no no jquery's every time you
look and think about using jQuery you
need to imagine that woman from Game of
Thrones with the Bell going shame shame
shame because that's what's going on you
need to be ashamed why did I say you
should never use jQuery cuz jQuery is
not going to get you a high pain web dev
job you're wasting your time working
with jQuery if you want spend a weekend
or to touch on jQuery fine build a
couple projects you want to make decent
money go learn react go learn angular
jQuery is an optional skill as far as
I'm concerned I'm a hundred percent
serious
about jQuery I'm not like I know we all
like to joke about jquery's garbage and
whatnot I don't even think it's garbage
I'm just telling you I'm just telling
you it's not going to be a skill it's
gonna get you money and get you a job
even people who don't know how to code
use jQuery let's put that in perspective
for a second
I wouldn't even say it's a dead language
it's just you have web designers using
jQuery it's essentially legacy code it's
a good way of putting it yes I got about
five more minutes I mean then pass it
out guys
and it says almost everywhere that there
will still be a siesta man in future so
it's a rational thing but most of these
shows will be outsourced I think I think
you answered your own question should i
major in data analytics or CS both are
great it just kind depends which one
you're more interested in would I put
bootstrap and jQuery in the same
unnecessary both then I'm honest hey I
see I use bootstrap still just because
those are two different things bootstrap
so CSS styling framework and if you're
building some crud in-house tool you
probably don't care and you can write
your own CSS or override or use some
material but teach their own honestly
man but
it's just depends yeah I know I should
be using flexbox if you had to start all
over what skills would you learn in 2018
with your current weight still pretty
much the skills that I put in for a
front-end dev angular or react
JavaScript HTML CSS get then I would
pick up a back-end language probably I'd
have to do some research about what is
an appropriate back-end language
but um probably yeah I don't know but
done it back in language and database
um when you had to learn code in Java
what do you learn mrs. lang research
there's no real learning resources in
Java that are any good do I feel like
node for back-end is sufficient enough
I mean hits a back-end yeah I mean are
you talking about is enough to get you a
job is it super in-demand it really just
depends all I've done flexbox
I'd have to review it but I've built out
projects and flex blocks I know
everyone's always all about that new
have you tried great have you tried
flexbox it's like I don't really know I
should I should though I should take a
look care a little bit more
do I use a standing desk yeah it's down
right now though yeah yo yo yo
alright three minutes guys at 45 minutes
here two minutes something little bit I
am putting a grind good for you I care
for you so good for you how did I learn
get um I started with the with the I
started with a the get desktop tool and
then I started using tortoise good at my
last role and then finally I I was like
you know what I'm breaking this habit
and I'm going to just do get at work I
get it now I fully understand oh I
told us somebody I was gonna do a good
tutorial I forgot all about it um it's
not that bad guys once you I have to do
tutorials just to help you guys out
because I feel bad it's getting
necessary at work yes 100% it's just you
have to just sit down so it just has to
explain it to you in English
that's all it is yeah it's definitely a
requirement
yeah there's literally like four or five
things that you would do with get okay
I'll do it tomorrow I'll do it tomorrow
that will be my task for the day and
it's it's only confusing because all the
names are stupid that's the gist
of it in my opinion yeah but
I'll do tutorial you guys will
understand in ten minutes
I can teach kid in ten minutes yeah I
just got here I'm doing it I'll do it
tomorrow that'll be my task tomorrow
some easy coding
look you guys uh uh I'm I'm a little
burnt out but it's also 3:45 a.m. so on
that note everybody have a good night
don't forget to comment like subscribe
share watch all the video support me at
patreon all that jazz
send me your hard-earned money all that
great stuff I'll uh I'll try and work on
