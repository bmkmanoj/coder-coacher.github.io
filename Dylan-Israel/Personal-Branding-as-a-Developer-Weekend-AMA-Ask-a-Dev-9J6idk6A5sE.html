weekend AMA so for those of you or who
are a little bit new what I like to do
every week is I like to start off with a
topic as people are funneling in here
and I like to from there go ahead and
answer some questions I know a lot of us
when we're getting started in our our
own software careers we're looking for
some mentorship we're looking for some
guidance and that's what these weekend
amaze every Saturday are about so today
I'm going to talk about a little bit
about personal branding as a developer
as a software engineer as a programmer
whatever you want to call it really as
an individual though because that's
what's most important when it comes to
personal branding is the personal aspect
right whatever it is that you're
passionate about in life if you're in
the waffle industry how you need to do
some personal branding to be the best
waffle guy right and it sounds kind of
funny when you put it up say it like
that but it is true personal branding is
very important and part of the reason
I've chose this topic was if you've
noticed it doesn't say coding tutorials
360 any more why is that for my channel
name well it's still going to be YouTube
/ coding tutorials 360 because that's
the route to get to the page but it says
Dylan Israelite site it was just a
personal branding aspect in in reality
the the channel name wasn't really
relevant to what I was doing anymore
right so when I first started my channel
I was learning to be a developer and
then I was doing you know coke atom you
Taurus free code camp Taurus and I still
do those things outside of the channel
but most of my videos now are
infotainment related we are talking
about things we are talking about
software related things up sharing my
opinion and I personally wanted to
promote myself not for me narcissistic
standpoint like everybody has to scream
my name from the top of the hackathon
sort of thing but more so just promote
me as
a developer add a little bit more
professionalism to it nothing besides
that it's going to change with channel
but I think that was the direction that
I'm trying to go with it and I think it
was a good decision but it all comes
down to the personal branding aspect
which is very important as you build
your brand as a developer right and that
could be in any facet does that to be
youtube doesn't have to be Facebook but
you should go about your own own way
what you're doing is you're showing that
you are passionate that you are an
expert or attempting to be an expert
which is almost as good but that you're
growing and maturing you're showing
potential employers and current
employers that the man that air woman
that you were last year is going to be
half of what you will be a year from now
all right
and so as you're building your personal
brand you really want it to be so that
when you go and Google search your name
and a resume things pop up that is
related to you to show that you're
someone active and and integrate
interview it integrated thank you
a little brain for integrated with your
profession with your field and that you
are trying to become part of the field
that's really where I think your
personal branding comes from and it
could be there's a bunch of ways to
achieve this but I do want to throw it
out there for some of you to think about
it because most of us just don't want to
be developers we want to be the best
developers developers and money is the
easiest thing because it's quantifiable
everything's not about money don't get
me wrong but money is something and when
you're comparing good bad it's typically
subjective but at the very least we can
compare salaries higher being better
than lower most of the most of the time
and so I tend to assume that most of you
want to have a better salary I tend to
assume that most people want to make
more money so they can take care of
their parents as they get older so they
can take care of their kids as they grow
up so they can just
reward themselves for their hard work
and part of that is and part of building
a personal brand it's very exciting
this very is something that is because
is something that you carry with you so
I want I want it to be something that
you guys are thinking about actively
about how to pursue it so that's sort of
my two cents about why I changed his
channel name not a big deal I haven't
even changed all the logos I do have a
new hot intro so on mondays video check
it out I think it's I think it's fire I
really do like it
engineer truth didn't like it but I
liked it so I Hughes so I was getting it
worked on why we're out to breakfast
when he was down visiting and he's like
I don't know not my taste I was like
well it's my taste I like right so
that's my two cents just one get you
thinking about how you're building your
personal brand and what it even is and
you're like personal branding what am i
what am i a candy bar you need to be the
candy bar of your space right so vlogs
coming soon maybe I don't know see I
don't know man vlogs or such part of the
reasons that I like to talk about the
topics that I do is it's it's a
efficient manner to deliver a video
right I can talk about something I've
been thinking about all week and sort of
in the back of my mind and I can have a
video out with four hours of time in
theory right where I'm I'm so sorry we
are we have some we're cleaning up some
of those space in the house and we have
stuff listed on like Craigslist and let
go and so in April just asking me if I
can sell it cheaper because someone's
trying to negotiate but your boy does
not negotiate he does not give in to
Craigslist terrorism okay
but uh anyhow I lost my train of thought
on that but I think you guys get the
point
so about other oh yeah so it takes about
maybe three hours to for me to fully get
a video out so but that's also not
that's not counting any time I do coding
chores which is rare lately but speaking
of tutorials
I just finished recording the third
course angular 360 part two the top one
hundred Kryptos project I'm so excited
about that it came out so good III think
it's gonna be a really good one if
you're interested in angular if you
wanna if you're you're curious what
you're building you're basically
building a coin market Capcom a version
of it and so it uses services uses pipes
uses api's does routing we really kicked
it up a notch in this one so it's going
to be an exciting project for you guys
I'll have it out by next week I have to
get it approved and all that um but
would that be so let's open up the floor
if you will to questions not like two
questions but like two questions I got
two questions now so vlogs uh I will say
yes and no part of the issue is vlogs is
time commitment I'm okay if I go and do
things right now I'm stuck in the house
all the time I would like to go to more
meetups I'm going to one on Friday to do
some aetherium Contracting blockchain
helloworld sort of projects and that's
about a four hour Meetup so I would like
to maybe have a project I'll record
maybe a vlog of what I can do there and
I'm going with some co-workers so I have
to see but maybe I can start doing that
when I go out the issue is I spent all
my time at home doing this awful degree
program I'm in and so it takes so much
time to to do
logs we'll see how it is on it is
something you know often times I don't
know that they do very well so that it
may not be like rewarding but it
oh I'll consider it it's not out of the
realm of possibility if I go and do
anything cool like I went to a
blockchain Meetup
maybe a month and a half ago and I
learned a ton but I'm not quite sure how
it would make an interesting blog unless
I just sort of asked the the instructors
hey can I just set up a camera and
record all of this and put it on my
youtube channel if if that's something
you guys think would be interesting I
might do it so what's the best place to
learn UX design do you think the future
is good for UX designers I think the
future is good for UI and UX just
because everything needs to be client
facing right so there's always going to
be a demand to have things that are
appealing to clients so that they use
their products where to get those skills
I honestly couldn't tell you I'm so bad
at design that I mean I can build things
after someone designs them but if
someone wants me to be like yo we need
Dylan you got that you're gonna you're
gonna design our homepage baby from the
ground up what do you got I got
bootstrap I got angular material that's
about all you gotta because I'm not a
designer by nature and I it is something
that I've thought about how can I
improve myself as a developer there's
two main areas that I would like to
improve if everything worked out right
um and one is one is DevOps I'd like to
be more familiar with DevOps deploying
applications automation all that sort of
stuff that goes along with DevOps not
just you like right now I just consume
the tools the that are built into DevOps
and that's fine that works as a
developer but one area that I could
definitely improve on is is DevOps and
some ways that I might go about that is
Michael and get an AWS certification
when I'm done with done with my degree
program
capture that another is design being
much better at CSS going and understand
design principles and things like that
and honestly I have an idea how to get
started with DevOps I don't really have
an idea of where the best resources are
for that and I'm not talking about like
udemy courses I'm talking about how do I
actually go and become a UX designer
what is what is the learning process for
that you know if you're to ask me how to
become a front-end developer I could
tell you that if you'd ask me how to
become a us design a UX UI designer I
couldn't I couldn't tell you and that
that's uh that's a problem so but that
is something that I would like to fix
every year I'm trying to and this
edition this should be the same
mentality you have as your developers
every year you should try to be better
than you were before you should have a
plan how to do it the year prior I have
a whole video talk about what I learned
in my first year as a developer and I
talked in detail about it but in that
year I got familiar with karma Jasmine
better better familiar with get better
better from another of angular more in
detail and JavaScript PHP CakePHP I
start playing around a node Express
MongoDB mongoose that's all that comes
to mind right now but in that year
that's a lot of technologies for you to
be playing with on a day to day basis
and got fit much more familiar so this
year my goal is to do a degree program
finish my degree learn that next year
I'm either going to dive into DevOps as
a learning curve there's three actually
there's three directions DevOps
Usui or or aetherium contracting with
solidity and just kind of get familiar
with the blockchain world a little bit
so those are the three directions so in
2019 that will be how I will be progress
as a as a developer as a channel as a
person as a personal brand so well you
think about the idea of working remote
is angular developer I think it'd be
fine
I have always suggested against working
remote as a start as you start your
career it's also social extremely hard
getting started in that remote role I
think it's better to get some experience
and go from there but I I mean I have no
problem with that I will say that it now
this varies but I will say by and large
I think most remote roles are expecting
a full stack functionality from a
developer so good job Dylan I'm a huge
fan but for curiosity why do you have a
steam SC essential oil diffuser any
back-end tutorials coming out soon for
nodejs of typescript not really any out
there I actually want to do some
typescript tutorials as the kind of the
game plan was to just release it free on
udemy to get students so I was thinking
about doing like a one-hour typescript
tutorial to get people up to date on
what it is how it works all that sort of
stuff it is probably my favorite thing
in a while with coding it just makes
writing JavaScript a little bit easier
it makes it so much easier work with
classes yeah I'm just a fan of
typescript and I'm a big fan of
instantiating types like granted they
aren't enforced but it makes it much
more easy it makes it easier to develop
and you know what the classes and
interfaces and what your methods are and
all that sort of stuff and it's
something that I'm a big fan of and I
think I could do a you know one hour
everything you need to know about tie
scripts typescript is in a very it's not
a very sore I'm looking for so very cons
complex concept because it just takes
things in JavaScript and then
adds additional things just a superset
of JavaScript and what is that super
part it's really all you have to cover
so what diffuser do you have this is the
one right here this is the mack daddy
now heads up you think a dam done that
looks good
wait wait be prepared to be impressed
can you guys see that case I don't know
if you can see it but it's supposed to
change colors yeah see how it's changing
the green you barely see it let me turn
off that and blue I know you're
impressed but also don't get your hopes
up because they sold out of this
particular model so sorry if you're
looking to buy it I was actually looking
to buy a second one and there they were
all out everyone bought it up man it's
Linda a good place to start I have no
problem with Linda I think you can do
just as well and udemy you just got by
the the right courses
am I still learning C sharp at my
current work I am indeed I actually they
gave me a full week to study bless their
souls
so my to elaborate on the C sharp for
work is my work my co-workers came to me
my project manager in BA and said Dylan
why can't you build this stuff I said
well that's a back-end ticket
I do front-end now I can learn C sharp
and dotnet never did any C sharp or net
but I you know I've done full stack at
my last role in PHP and my sequel and in
my in my in my current and in my current
projects whenever I worked with
databases with MongoDB and node and
Express so they gave me about a week to
learn and granted I'm going to be
pairing up I'm not an expert by any
means but I did three c-sharp courses
about 20 hours of content on udemy
knocked him out got exposed to a lot and
started pairing with a co-worker of mine
doing some TDD writing a service of his
um yeah so um I would say I need to do a
dotnet course in general but I feel
pretty good to get get going I'm
probably gonna need my handheld a little
bit not because I think any of the
concepts are beyond the realm of
complexity but a lot of it is okay well
how do I do this in c-sharp is like
I need to connect to the database how do
I connect to the database I need to
query the database I don't query the
database so you just just slowly get
into the groove of you have to learn
that 80% of stuff there that 20% of
stuff you use 80% of the time right but
yeah they gave me about a week I feel
pretty good and I'm diving in uh yeah I
did Marsha's three courses he had this a
beginner intermediate and advanced okay
so I feel I've learned enough front-end
to be take it seriously would you
suggest I learned about WebSockets and
server-side rendering type things or
dive bat or dive into the backend with
node excetera uh I mean have you got a
job in front end because I guess that
would be my thing is you feel like
you've learned by having to employers
feel like you've learned enough to be
good and to be taken seriously it's not
about how you feel it's about how the
employers feel at the end of the day
yeah we we use net core so what do you
like better being able to concentrate on
just one area such as friend ain't your
job be able to at all like at your last
one uh this is something I don't know
the answer to I could tell you that if I
was doing full stack JavaScript I would
love to do it all all of it baby all of
it all of it all of it all of it every
single day of the week full sack
JavaScript is my it's like you
never left
frontend I love it right but one issue
that I have is that I feel that
front-end development it's much faster
than the backend desk it could just be
that I'm code and god no I what
a hook but um I am always waiting on
services to be built for my front-end
applications and so I've had so many
issues where you agree on a contract one
of my co-workers is dealing dealing with
this as a front-end dev that I have to
rebut his rebuilding an application not
from the ground up but he's
restructuring a ton of it because the
services oh he said hey this is the data
model we're going to beginning that
wasn't what was delivered and now he has
to go and reorganize his own app change
everything and that that's a huge
problem so one thing that I've done is I
it happened to me one time I said never
again so uh I will not build an
application until the services are done
or in a point where they're in test
right meaning that they have their code
has been PR D is now in the testing
environment or the dev environment and I
can use it and consume it because at
that point the data structures not going
to radically change once it's gone it's
already been approved and that saves me
a lot of a lot of headache and it also
saves me time and saves the company time
and sometimes you have to push back as a
developer and say yo yo yo
I know you want this out tomorrow and
you you have this fantasy idea that I'm
gonna build this they're gonna build
that in a perfect world that would work
out but we aren't in a perfect world
we're in their world where contracts are
not held in terms of the data structure
to be the absolute truth if you will and
you have these issues where now you're
going back and you're spending more time
on your original application and you're
having to refresh your mind as to what
it was you know applications are
very large very very large just on the
front end you have you know controllers
you have the models of views you have
interfaces data sets you have services
you have pipes you know it starts
growing and growing and when you're
going to have to change all that you're
going to then make mistakes really well
everything's unit tested no no
everything's unit tested based off what
you thought was gonna happen are some of
the unit tests can help yeah so I
personally that is my only frustration
it's not a big one but that is why I
kind of lean towards doing it all
because at least then I know because the
back end is never waiting on the front
end it's the back ends client is the
front end right and the front ends
client is the actual client and so you
have to when you think about it that way
what's really happening is is if you
just wait for a second and then start
once they have the bulk of the work done
and it's been approved one time you know
changes are gonna happen nothing it's
gonna be perfect but you're not gonna
have to rewrite your application you're
gonna have to then become be familiar
with it because in my case I take
typically I'm done with a rough working
version before the services they so it
depends on every company but that is
that's one thing is I like I would like
to do it all but I enjoy I enjoy
actually diving into the front end I
enjoy sort of because I'm a JavaScript
developer that's where it's all about
right I enjoy that
let's connect everything let's get it
going how could we make it better I
think it's a lot of fun and I think it's
better to be specialized long term what
do you think about combined day analysis
slash science and web development almost
done with my Master's with GIS and
remote systems you start web dev a frico
to have are using Python I think it's
fine I mean all these things can be
combined to be an effective portfolio
and career
uh we'll be getting an advanced learner
with both courses I would say you could
skip the advance I didn't really feel
like the advance gave me much value um
not to say that it's a bad course but I
would say that you probably skip it if
you wanted to do you have a job all
right I do okay so you felt you've
learned enough to be taken seriously all
right if you got a job then you've
learned enough uh but uh well that's
just WebSocket server side rendering if
you want to be full stack yet there's
nothing wrong with being full stack and
honestly I think everyone should go full
stack in the start of their career
because it's going to expose you to a
lot of concepts and if you're a
front-end developer and you don't really
know how the backend works you're not
gonna be able to give intricate feedback
you're not gonna be a valued member of
the team if you just if you just don't
understand how any of the application
works so it's always good to have a
rough working understanding of of
architecture of design of DevOps of
front-end of back-end because you're
able to contribute and it doesn't mean
like oh well this guy's back in
developer he knows everything
sometimes back-end and front-end they
goof in their specialties and it always
helps to have someone as a an outside
view but you have a view you have to
understand the basics so I would
definitely encourage you to to dive in
to the backend whatever it is and just
sort of start learning about you know
connecting routes and and manipulating
data and everything else that goes along
with it so I think that's an excellent
idea
Lonzo likes a load no one is going to be
your mentor anyone who said hey anyone
here want to be my mentor has never ever
got a mentor you need a the way that you
get mentors is very simple you provide
value for other people how do you
provide value go to meetup start meeting
people start helping other people out
and various little things and gain mates
it is we don't live in this sort of
medieval time where people are taking on
apprenticeships you know that's just
doesn't really
really work we're like you know Dylan
Dylan now has Dylan junior mentor that
doesn't exist but what you can't do our
make relationships where people want to
help out you know their friends and
their family and things like that but
going into a chat on YouTube with 40
other people say hey who wants to be the
mentor you'll notice that no one spoke
up right just crickets yeah you got it
we all have to strive to be that coding
God uh what kind of project is suitable
for expressed yes anything with routing
uh uh credit create some sort of crud
application with a just a front-end
display that would that would be that
would be my my advice and but I'd like
for instance you want you want
mentorship I give one-on-one mentoring
sessions but they're not free because
you know everyone should value their
time I charge two-and-a-half times my
hourly rate that is how I go about my
early raise and develop or not counting
bonuses and and benefits so just my pure
hourly rate and so that comes to ninety
dollars an hour roughly it should be
probably closer to a hundred but rough I
charged ninety right now so if you want
actual mentorship if you want to say
look man once a month I want to reach
out to somebody talk to him for an hour
and say look am I in the right path what
would you change how can I improve how
can I get better can you review this
project code can you can you know can we
shoot the about this can you code
review something I do do mentoring and
they do that about twice a month right
now
but it's gonna be very rare for a
stranger to show up and say a mentor me
for free baby I need all that knowledge
I need all 67 steps Dillon so but yet
it's uh not really how the world works
right you're asking for free value only
people give you free value your friends
and family that's that's the truth so
how can you sign up for my mentorship if
you go to coding tutorials 360 com
there is a tutor section I'm actually
that's one of my projects I want to
rebuild my my website in angular 2 plus
or just angular and just add some
additional things make it look make a
little more fun but you can pay it's
just PayPal and then shoot me an email
at Dillon's email 3 100 at gmail.com and
we'll set up a time so a lot of times
people just want to understand oh
alright there's so much information out
here this is what I'm doing what would
you do and what should I learn just tell
me what to learn it's like what's your
goals good job ok how should I play for
jobs what's today yeah sometimes people
just want that 101 this is part of what
the live stream is about you know part
of the live stream here is because not
everyone can pay for the one on one so
if you're looking for a mentor this is
what the whole point of the AMA asked me
anything is you haven't asked any
questions all you've asked is for a
mentor what do you want to be mentored
about here's an opportunity for somebody
I'm not the best developer in the world
but I am a working developer I am
somebody who has you know taking
themself from sleeping on a couch to you
know having money in the bank having all
his bills paid no debt full-time
developer and constantly learning and
evolving and if that's something that I
can help you with that's what this whole
this so this whole thing is about this
whole thing is about mentoring in a
session and providing value so uh how uh
so mentorship is nine dollars per
session yes it's a one-hour long ninety
dollars and some of you say Dylan got
that I understand and I feel for you but
you know what do you want me to do about
you know you have I value your time you
should value my time right all right uh
let's see here recently got accepted on
in friendship with an IOT companies
companies mean stack in just hypes CRIF
I've been coding and doing a lot of
research or means that anything else I
can do
building things man get comfortable with
angular build a project in angular
little front-end simple project and
angular I have a course introduce you
some things but I have a second one
coming out in about a week that's gonna
be interesting a lot more build some
stuff
don't forget the research just start
building build a full stack mean
application that's the very first thing
you should do research or you read some
articles you can watch some videos cool
but start building some stuff so sticks
I'm currently learning data structure
and not feeling confident enough solve
any kind of problems on hacker Inc what
do you suggest I have a book that I just
bought called cracking the coding
interview I'm actually gonna work
through side the same issue so that's
sort of what I'm trying to trying to do
here just Dolan that does Dolan the new
mentorship a I don't know if y'all could
afford Dolan's mentorship do you use
types here from working express I
haven't worked with this express in
about six months and I wasn't then no
once I guess I have to use the restroom
real quick I will be right back
all right sorry about that I guess I'm
back that coffee though I uh I don't
have any friends so I just buy finger I
buy friendship you buy my friendship for
$90 an hour I have no problem selling
out would be best buzz rely amen very
that last time I mentored you oh my god
I had so much fun talking to you about
JavaScript oh my goodness we should do
it again every day yeah
good morning bootstrap studio bitter bad
I'm not familiar bootstrap studio sorry
when you say build things I can't even
figure out how to get started even the
question asked Google what the next step
is so force force Aang or force tang
first question is you have to say what
is is that you want to build start there
then draw it out literally draw out a
box dry out a wireframe and go from
there let me see if I can launch
balsamiq real quick and I'll show you
guys so like you're saying oh well I
don't know what to build literally go
and draw something like this so like
this is from my these are the wireframes
from my upcoming course all this is
doing is showcasing what it is and you
need to essentially visually have this
in your head or draw it out by hand it
just have to be super detailed it could
literally just be alright this is the
filter section where we have some data
here and then what you do is you tackle
this you tackled this section then you
tackle the one one here and then once
you have that one working go build this
one this one then this one you just
slowly break it out piece by piece well
you have to visually understand what it
is that you're trying to get going so
please please please please just
start doing that you don't understand
how to put things together you'd put it
together piece by piece you build one
piece and then you connect it to the
other piece you just have to get started
a lot of times people are are stressing
about what to what it is and what how to
get started you just have to get started
and chip away at it and slowly things
will fall into place you saying okay
well I mean without you giving me give
me an example project I'll tell you
right now how to get started let's go
ahead and throw in chat say okay I say
you know what you want to build what is
it that you want to build and let's go
from there we'll use a real life example
right now all right so let's see here
I made a HTML CSS JavaScript project or
make project like MongoDB or node
honestly make both both are good choices
right people always wanted to use one or
the other oh is it this is this better
than that you know what the best choice
is doing it all how much do the
optimization for wetback foreign code
splitting no I did see that web pack for
it's either got release during beta or
something like that I think I saw an
article header it like that um so it's
as well as things where I don't really
care I mean I like so if I'm building a
front-end application I'm using angular
I'm using angular of CLI right most of
the time and that uses web pack I don't
really have any need to configure web
pack on my own if it comes to time we're
like hey we need you to configure web
pack I'll go and pick it up but I've
never had the need to actually go and
configure what back and get it going as
use whatever the the seal is all right
okay so the example of contact manager
so I'm thinking like an address book
sort of thing where you have emails
phone numbers and names how I would get
started and I was defined what is a
contact is it having define the start by
defining that class right I'm assuming
we're gonna do this in typescript define
what's in that class what are the
properties of that class what are the
methods of that class and understand the
data object once you have a data object
you can say okay how am I going to
display this data onto the screen okay
now that I understand the data object
how am I going to before I even have a
back-end what's all front-end before I
even have a back-end I want to display
that back in okay so forth string has
has an example here we'll go with his I
thought he was waiting so he wants to
build a crypto currency arbitrage
that takes prices from various exchanges
from a given currency so multiple a pot
if you guys in display the various
prices in a matrix that's super simple
dude alright so what you're gonna first
do is you have to define what those
api's are because that's what this
project is about this project is about
showcasing different values from
different exchanges so you need to go
look up the five exchanges and you have
to see back what those data models look
like and how you're going to get that
now once you have that you're going to
define five different classes for those
five api's for those data models and you
may have to manipulate the data a little
bit but now that you have that you
understand what what those keys are what
those data points are that you're going
to be getting back you're then gonna
have five separate API calls that goes
and gets that gets that data that data
from the from that from those endpoints
are going to get mapped into the classes
that you just defined so you make sure
that everything is coming back as
anticipated and then you're going to
have a table presumably where you have
now defined what those what those values
are and you're probably gonna have an
array of objects and each one of those
five data points is going to be
connected to an object the your object
could be like Bitcoin right for instance
and then you're gonna have Bitcoin
coinbase Bitcoin bit for next and all
the five and you're gonna do that for
every single cryptocurrency that you're
interested in let's say most of them
cover the top 100 you're gonna have
something like that and that is how
you're going to go about building your
API on the front end and connecting to
it now on the back end I don't suggest
you go and build a front-end application
that does three hundred API calls it's
awful idea but you say you got PHP on
the back end maybe you do do those calls
and then you send the data back in the
formatted form that you would want
so once you have that once you've set up
your data model all of this is the
matter to displaying your data model on
the front end so you'll probably have a
table you'll have a column that says you
know coin based prices you have a column
that says bit for next prices you'll
have various aspects that go with it
that is one way of how you can go about
that project now you may be thinking
like oh my god how do I get started if
you just got starting connected to one
API and then you connect to two then you
connect to three then connect to four to
five just slowly increment it all this
would make sense right you're not but
with probably happening is you're
getting so caught up on the end result
that you can't even get started you
can't say how do I connect to various
applications and go from there so I
would suggest that you just start
connect to one API get the data connect
to a second ATP I get the data and
you're like well how do i display them
now you start manipulating the data and
the front end or the back end usually
when you're manipulating large sets of
data you want to on the back end go from
there so um see have I have heavy works
the through the free coke and beta
curriculum I did some of it yeah I think
it's pretty good I think we'll get it by
2020 I haven't have a good week in
Christ I dev sure
but all the programming language design
on my resume you should put all the
programming languages that you can have
projects built-in on your resume and
that you have experienced it or that you
feel that you know right so say you're
like look I know Java I know JavaScript
put it on there if you actually know
JavaScript and Java if I could come to
you and I could say look I need you to
do fizzbuzz something very simple the
fizzbuzz algorithm on a whiteboard right
now and you couldn't solve that in the
correct syntax do not put that on your
resume you could good go ahead but it's
really up to you yeah but yeah you
should definitely put all the languages
that you know why wouldn't you libraries
and API so same thing though libraries
are APIs so api's are application
programming interfaces they're sort of
like web applications
allowing you to do certain things and
libraries are usually downloadable
functionality I don't know I don't know
typescript how long they take me and
learn a day types here it's pretty
straightforward the Crusader rabbits how
you doing by the way I know you're
always talking about ageism I have a
video coming out just for you on
Thursday two videos this week it's
coming out Thursday you gotta have to
wait because you get it cuz like ageism
you're getting old wait oh no dad jokes
I matter if you know that I am I'm known
for my dad jokes all right I keep it
fire
what is the advantage of using your name
as a brand versus using a company or
product name uh well in my case it's
more relevant to me as an employee if I
was going to start a company or start a
product it would make sense to have a a
brand name it was me that would make
sense but really what YouTube has turned
into is a portfolio item and if I want
to one day you know progress and let's
say that you couldn't you know but in
terms of depends on what your objective
is my objective is simply to to continue
to evolve as a developer and to promote
myself as developer if one day as I get
better I wanted to give speeches I want
to give talks it'd be better for me to
be for my name rather than a channel
name so that's all so it just kind of
depends on what your objective is what
are their videos do you have planned on
Monday I have my top ten tips to become
a self-taught developer so I think this
will be a video that a lot of people are
always asking for I know everyone's
always having your self-talk developer
how how can I do this how can do that
well I compiled a list of my 10 tips and
I hope you find them helpful it's it's a
long video it's about 25 minutes but it
is detailed and I think it's I think it
will be helpful for those who apply it
that's what I got planned for for this
coming week the following week I have a
my course announcement that my course
announcement as well so that'll be one
video that I have
your tips relevant for 2018 of course
they are does your video discuss age
discrimination tech hiring
what else would I talk about I'm talking
about age it's ageism in tech is the
title of the video why would I make a
video that's not relevant
okay let me tell you the top 10 tips to
becoming a self-taught developer in 2005
why would I make that video what am I
trying to do here right click like yeah
like I do want to give views I do want
to get you know Adsense money right I do
want to provide value and if you want to
learn stuff from 2005 go to college all
right if you want to learn in 2018
come to YouTube alright cuz that's how
we do it here so so I mean that what
what am I gonna tell you the two
thousand five tips right so am I too old
to learn to learn to go he's not the
question I I quite literally just told
you we're doing ageism in technology
that is the topic of it you may not like
my view standpoint on this but it is
what the topic is about but yes so
bootstrap or CSS flexbox either one it's
not gonna matter one way or the other
hey coding connections with the $2.00
with it Collins no message though a
super shot you talk super Thank You Man
that is appreciated your money helps me
pay for school I'm doing I'm learning
 for 2005 myself right now
let me tell you about I'm like this
close to drop it out I hate I hate what
College has become
um I appreciate it though man I really
do so thank you so much for that my
favorite language javascript' but
specifically typescript just that counts
just cuz I really am loving typescript I
have ever since I started working with
it
how's school going it's going man
right now there's a technical issue with
one of my courses so I can't see my
practice test results and I can't use
the preparing resources and that's
driving me nuts so I've had to move on
to another course but but I finished I'm
moving fast but it's just every moment I
spend in school I slowly die a little
bit because like I want to build all
these sort of projects I have all this
like I want to rebuild my website for
instance and I have some really cool
ideas and I wanted to to sort of sync it
up with changing the channel name but I
can't because I so I'm done
did you at all so don't be throwing
around that wife word it where I come
from you start calling the girlfriends -
wife those are fighting words alright
April and the cats are doing swell child
keeps me learning everyday I'm glad man
I try to keep everybody motivated and
then diabetic manatee with $2.00 saying
don't drop out I'm not dropping out man
I just say I want to drop out I might
even do a video about wanting to drop
out of college and being able to force
yourself not to I think I might be doing
pretty well on that because let me tell
you I've never enjoyed the college
experience I'm not enjoying it now but I
will complete it uh so but thank you
yeah don't worry guys I'm not dropping
out
just frustrated with it that's all I
look like a fighter welcome to the gun
show baby
oh but yeah so let's see ever since I
read launched my new website for my
business I had a PHP contact for my
business has been moving excellent what
I think about ageism in the web dev
community I have a video on Thursday
discussing that I don't think it's as
prevalent as people think I do think it
is a problem though just to summarize
but I also think that and I have an
article that I'm just that I talked
about in there that that a lot of the
newer jobs in tech are not even being
sought after by older developers from
unseen or dev community and there's a
couple of reasons for that and we talk
talk about that but literally there's
jobs that are five times more likely to
be clicked on by a millennial in tech
than by a baby boomer or someone over
the age of 45 and when you have that
that's not discrimination that's just
that they have skills that are related
or relevant and you know maybe someone
who has been in technology for a while
doesn't or doesn't want to go and they
don't feel they should have to go and
get that there's a bunch of reasons a
complex issue is there a chess of course
Ares you don't have you know kids do I
think it's as bad of an issue as I think
a lot of people make it out to be no but
I've also worked half the developers I
work with are older and like every
company I've ever been at and my last
work place I was a youngest developer
there and I'm that was when I was 28 at
my previous workplace I was one of the
youngest people there but I was like 25
I wasn't a developer everyone else was
older and half the developers for over
50 so it really just depends man it just
depends on what it is that you're trying
to do what is you're trying to learn so
it varies I worked my workplace so my
personal life I haven't experienced that
um any plans to make a react course for
udemy I'd have to brush up on react I
would love to I would love to learn
react just because it's so in but I have
so many other things that I'm focused on
right now I'm not too worried about
react
I'm loving angular honestly I know a lot
of people aren't fans at times because
it is a large project like architecture
right so there's just a lot to learn
about the the framework but I I'd have
to be working with reactant for a while
before I probably make a course on it
who is my best friend probably Matt Matt
and I talk pretty frequently outsource
the website we're cook a junior dev up I
want to build it and so the thing about
building like your own site is you can
build it to your specification and
continue to work on it also I don't want
paint if you guys I don't have the money
for that if always putting himself
through college and not taking it on any
student loans to do it so hello VIX what
do you recommend to learn after node.js
I recommend building stuff when you've
learned no js' connected database to it
you know MongoDB is usually the easiest
with Mongoose and Express what if you
have a load GP I'm not dropping out but
does a computer science degree have any
value of too low GPA yeah just don't put
your GPA on your resume that would be my
advice unless you have like a 3.5 or
above I wouldn't even put your GPA on
your resume just drop it off drop it off
completely that that's my advice
hey John I've got to finish non-si s
degree from a great university I'll have
the internships just some projects how
do i improve my chances getting full
stack web dev job well the go-to answer
is first off get your github pop in
start pushing to it on a regular basis
hopefully you already have a LinkedIn
hopefully already have a nice and a good
resume keep building projects build a
portfolio site start going to meetups
start volunteering through coding
organizations start working on your
personal brand those are like the the
minimum eight things that you can start
today getting good at that is sort of
the the go-to app stance o also get some
certifications that would be that would
be my advice to stand out so once you do
that you know work on maybe the I think
I already said personal branding social
media slash is kind of personal branding
but that would be what I would do
immediately yeah and also you know you
might have an easier time getting an
internship than a full-stack dev job
right away and so I think that would be
something to consider I don't have any
problem with interest rates just make
sure it's a paid internship I talked
like Elon Musk I don't think so I've
heard you Elon Musk's talk I don't think
I talked like him Elon Musk here's a
thug though Allah Allah
Ilan lives that thug life and so I I get
I don't say it because I'm embarrassed
to sound like Elon Musk I don't agree
with it I'd love nothing more than to
emulate that man that man is uh no
given with Elon is that it's how the
kids would say
rebuild the website in Wix now can you
please talk about PHP being a good in
road to lead landing your first Java
self-taught web developer so um this is
a funny story I'll share a story with
you from work one of my co-workers so I
work with he's a he's a front-end
developer he loves PHP and I love to
make fun of PHP from the channel so and
coincidentally every other developer at
work hates PHP also which is about 20
people so they hate pastry so we all
kind of give him a hard time for PHP so
we're at stand-up and he was like hey
I'm gonna reach out to my old co-worker
so because I think maybe I'm not
communicating to the communicating to
the developers at work why PHP is so
great
so I'm gonna reach out to my old
co-worker about like a man I wanted to
talk to you about pH what you know
what's going on with PHP how is it
evolving and so his old co-worker sends
them back a message that says yeah man I
so uh I'm worried about the future of
PHP so I've left that and I'm not going
back and I thought that was really funny
uh but I don't know I have a mixed a
feeling feeling about PHP I do not like
the language and people give me
about that I'll you know every language
is unique and but it's all the same
stuff shut up I don't care
I hate PHP you can I actually gonna have
a shirt that comes out and says PHP
sucks that's it they're not gonna be
anything else it's just gonna be in
purple and let you know what's up but uh
so um but there are a lot of jobs in PHP
um I don't know man uh I don't think
there's anything wrong with learning PHP
but if it's PHP or react I say learn
react you'll have an easier time getting
a react job then you will PHP job just
because there's so much time and in PH
to so much so much demand for react
right now you're going to learn the
reactor ducts and maybe one or two other
things that go along with react but
do you work away snow never what
are some things that regular expressions
are used in real web programming you'd
write a regular expression to evaluate
email strings phone numbers you know
making sure that no numbers are in first
name no numbers are in last name to
evaluate the formatting of and address
things like that you know it's basically
just to make sure that the inputs are
correct example project ideas down for
new devs my my suggestion to you is
choose something you're passionate about
let's say you're UFC fight like you like
UFC I I watch UFC outs all right so it's
like my one hobby outside of coding is i
watch the UFC events and so my
suggestion to you is if that was
something that you're passionate about
either right at UFC API or use the UFC
API and you know build your own sort of
like side-scrolling
side-scrolling application that takes
the characters it makes like character
sheets with their stats and go from
there and build a donate dedicate a
website to that and build upon that also
in bill authentication and go from there
oh my goodness
salsa dude coming out with the big $20
donation says got to spread the wealth
thanks for all the free code camp videos
man these videos helped spark my coding
journey has been a right thank you so
much and congratulations to you for
continuing on man the hardest thing for
you guys to do is not to start coding
but to continue coding so I appreciate
you for the support man it is
appreciated I am I don't even know it's
a my twenty dollars a lot so thank you
so much see here thanks for all the
advice John to get a full stack web job
what types best
am I gonna stand out anyone it's just so
guys the best projects forget full-stack
forget friend and forget back in the
best projects are unique projects once
that are unique to you that no one else
is done right you know if you didn't do
a calculator you're gonna do a something
else all that has already those are
tutorials out to do that you need to
build something custom because that's
what you're gonna be doing in the
workplace so the calculator is the
weather apps no one gives a about
that people are sick of seeing the
weather apps people sick of seeing the
calculators and they've been sick of it
for like a decade now that's all you've
got
that's all you got right now but your
goal should not and that you can you can
do the best you can with it but good
projects will be unique ones I think
again sausage a man that that is
appreciated PHP is not for me that's not
too bad I might I might steal that I
like that good morning Jaime MacGibbon
what do you plan on joining after
software engineering I think that's a
question that's off into the future um I
just turned 30 in October so I'm an old
man now by tech standards right ah
I'm mature your boys mature alright
so ten years from now who knows man I I
really only plan my my life in five year
Sprint's so I can tell you kind of what
the game plan is for the next five years
but in the next five years I have
absolutely no plans of leaving software
engineering but uh just want to continue
what I'm doing right now YouTube
building courses writing books self
education working a you know software
job
become a senior developer become a tech
lead those are all sort of the things
that are in the five-year period
hopefully coming a tech lead from in
five years from now might be a bit of
extreme I'm not really quite sure what
the barrier of entry for a tech lead is
like so let me tell you about some some
of these like my tech lead he is very
knowledgeable in all of it and I I'm
nowhere near his level so the idea of me
getting there in five years it's
possible but who knows maybe he maybe
he's a dunce of tech leads I don't think
so but uh I guess that is the direction
my career is going by by some property
learned about investing a little bit
more so I'm built I'm making a chat
application like this scored that last
people chat p.m. other users saying
that's not unique or do you mean real
word pressure so that's perfect
that's a fine application to make add
features adds stuff but there's not too
many there's not tutorials showing you
how to build this chord right I have no
problem with you building something like
that it's the really traditional stuff
that's the issue
what are the message for people still
write code it's a notepad why are you
doing that to yourself now what is it
that you what happened to you that you
just hate yourself so much any tips or
ideas coming coming up with great
project ideas guys we're gonna circles
here unique projects I also have a video
called like 48 side project ideas so if
you want some ideas there's a video
devoted to ideas to start a side project
30 is still very young my got no I I
know I'm not like ancient old man but uh
the Crusader rabbits would make you
think that your boy is is on his way out
of the tech industry due to ageism
that's what Crusader Roberts would say
which PHP framework is best learned
layer Val
where do I work can't tell you that but
rumor has it there's a LinkedIn that
might have it on it
I do the reason I just don't say where I
work for the most part is most companies
don't want you talking about them
most companies you know I have no
problem talking about where I work and
whatnot but um I also have custody
couple times in this video and very open
and things like that and so in terms of
the terms of you know I am an employee I
have to hold myself to some standards
and I would have no problem justifying
this video but uh I also just saved
myself a little bit of a headache
telling you where I work and then and
then maybe being perceived as speaking
for the company that's not my goal I'm
not in marketing I am in development so
what does to develop lead developer do
on projects from surrounded by senior
junior to us this probably varies but
the lead developer the tech lead will
sometimes be making architecture
decisions be making choices on how what
technologies we're going to be using
will be we'll be moving forward on you
know essentially the tie breaker if you
will say say you both have say you have
a stance on on how to progress the front
end application and a co-worker another
junior senior dev disagrees you know
sometimes you gotta say alright tech
lead what's the right way of doing this
sometimes it doesn't matter but where's
your ideal place to live I would like to
live in Portland Oregon that is my my
ideal place to live
I've visited there several times I
really enjoyed it I really liked it
my brother he lives there my
girlfriend's sister lives there there's
one other city I would like to live as
well which is Seattle Washington I
haven't been there but from what I've
read about it the software the tech
community it just would look like it'd
be an excellent place and I probably
when I move if I move to Portland it'll
go visit because I believe it's about a
three-hour drive and so I'll see that
how are the parents I don't want to talk
about my parents I don't know that they
would appreciate me talking about them
not to say I have any issues with my
parents to like not but not everyone's
comfortable about putting their world
out there right so like I respect the
fact that I am okay putting myself in a
public setting right but but not it not
everybody is what were you like in high
school
depends what year of high school um this
is kind of a dorky kid that uh you know
watch animal II video games went out and
made mistakes with friends on the
weekends so that's that type of guy
where am i from
I'm originally from Southern California
my hometown would be probably San Dimas
California which is like in the Inland
Empire but I've lived in Los Angeles I
graduated from Redondo Redondo high
school from Redondo Beach I I lived for
the last 10 years or so before I came
down here and the Redondo Beach area
Dallas seems like we guys sit in the
back of the couch here and play pokemon
go and everyone is waiting on the bus
do you think programming videos
woodworking a five minute video game
Duncan Qaeda format
look up the real tough candy the real
ocean I wonder if that's is that an
anime reference for the ocean anime just
a curiosity but uh look over the real
tough game because she does something
very similar and I think it might give
you some inspiration just show you a
little something
3d tech box currently if so which one
yes I am let me go grab it
I've been reading and you'll see I have
thrown some Amazon links in here so I've
actually been loving this book you can
see I'm about 40% through I've been
reading it pretty much every night I
read a chapter or two it's been an
amazing book I would highly recommend it
and if you're interested let me throw my
affiliate link in' it's the complete
software developers career guide I'm not
a big believer in reading other things
I'm like sorry I say reading hearts kill
books I much more believe in the soft
skill books of software development and
I've absolutely been loving Jon's book
I'm a huge fan of it it's well written
it's entertaining it's it's something
that I I wish I read much sooner along
in my career so if you're interested in
that I'll throw the affiliate link in
chat you guys can help me and Jon out so
I have a I I it is it is really good
guys it's a heart it's hard work it's
700 pages long which is some people like
oh man this look if you're not this is
the easy part
reading 700 pages is the easy part
implementing it's the hard part life
straight sponsored by Johnson no John
didn't send me this book or anything I
bought it straight away and I've been
reading it I love it it's got some
really great suggestions the book covers
anything from getting into the industry
to being in the industry to excelling
and the industry just like $20 for the
book you can't beat it I really should
just checking it out I'll do a full
review when I'm done any plan
don't long marriage liquor if Joyce I so
I'm not a hard liquor guy I'm not really
much of a drinker I
I prefer beer much more up until I went
out with some co-workers to the bar
maybe two three months ago I hadn't had
hard liquor God probably in five six
years so I really don't like liquor
I don't listen to podcasts is something
that I may want to get into there is I
guess they're not really podcast they're
sort of podcast is if you go to code
tech they do like videos of topics like
so you know someone's giving a
presentation at a meet-up or something
like that they they record them put them
up on their channel I do watch those
those kind of like podcast Seattle ten
people trying to find work and sale even
people frown so instead of evening a
name video basically indifferent well
yeah it's a tech city man do i watch
short and petersen videos no but I have
seen it a couple interviews of Jordan
Peterson on like Joe Rogan's podcast
have I ever met John no I did a item on
the channel once I email him from time
to time just to talk to him or ask some
questions has always been very kind and
gracious to you to to me are you a
millionaire no I don't know how much
money you think I have but like three
years ago I sleeping on a couch uh we
are much better off than we were before
but I have nowhere near being a
millionaire best financial advice you
give new grads save 50% of your income
pay off your student loans before you do
that pay off your student loans before
you do absolutely anything have zero
debt except to build credit so my
honestly I I can't stress this enough
pay off all your day you'll feel like a
weight is lifted
off your shoulders paying off pay it off
pay it off pay it off live at home if
you can work safe pay it off pay it off
pay it off once you do save 50% of your
income that's my advice it's st. Peter
for st. Petersburg the new text box see
a lot of videos and deaths in there do
you really I would say now I'm getting a
degree in software development but yeah
so my financial advice for you is first
eliminate debt second keep your costs
low that means not taking on any debt a
lot of people will buy like they'll get
look they'll get they'll go and buy a
$50,000 car when they get their first
$60,000 salary and they won't have any
money in the bank and they'll be paying
a $6,000 or $600 a month car bill don't
do that don't follow us for that I make
my car brand new was $13,000 $13,000 I
on my taxes this year I cleared over 80
if I'm if I'm driving $13,000 car when I
made $80,000 a year you should not be
buying a $40,000 car when you're making
55 or 60 thousand it's your first deaf
job
and honestly until you have a house
until you have property you shouldn't be
you shouldn't be buying a nice car cars
are depreciating assets they are the
larger unless you're talking like
dealing with boats there is one of the
worst investments because they're not an
investment they're actually the exact
whatever and it exact opposite of a
investments they're gonna expense
they're an expensive expense so my
advice to you is save pay off your debt
keep your car keep your monthly costs as
low as possible and then buy property
and go for that so I have a 2015
Mitsubishi Mirage that's my car brand
new not counting tax I think with taxes
like fourteen one it was thirteen
thousand one hundred dollars 100,000
mile warranty gets forty four highway 40
City I love it it's a tiny car it's a
subcompact but I love it
but that's my that's my financial advice
not a financial adviser just saying
these things do we have to say that do
like I have like I said every everyone
these financial channels not a financial
advisor this is for entertainment
purposes um what you think my friend and
development field do you think seems
makes me have JavaScript developer a
front-end developer JavaScript developer
a front-end developer very similar I
don't worry about it I fret I love doing
front end just one thing uh what
smartphone do you say I use a busted-ass
yes I'll see how busted my phone
look at that can you guys so can you
guys see the cracks in that phone looks
that corner there and then look at that
that special purple line down it oh my
goodness well I have a like Samsung s7
edge something like that try and learn
friend iframe will surely learn react
view angular really it's only between
the reactant angular I know JavaScript
but do the do to work and I give too
much time figure what I need to do
better at one which one would you pick I
would pick react right now just because
there's a lot of jobs on it I definitely
wouldn't mess around with view because
there's not enough jobs reactor angular
is really your only two choices do I
watch WWE now get a case it's too late
for that iPhone it's done so I won't be
buying a new car when April gets a job
I'm gonna be getting a Honda Civic
hatchback
it's about $22,000 so I'm holding off on
getting a new phone till that til til
she gets the job as well just keeping
the expenses low I just so the one thing
that I hate is people who don't practice
what they preach right I mean it it's
okay if you give advice that people ask
for but you don't have that lifestyle
you don't have so you can't practice
what you preach I understand that but so
like like um like any books you're
reading would you recommend any books
you know what book I would recommend the
book I'm actually reading right
so like um you know the the the thing is
is I hate I hate I hate when people
don't they just want to tell you some
 that sounds smart or they want to
tell you
since they're not that you know stuff
they don't have the answers for I really
recommend if you can live that lifestyle
only preaching practicing what you
preach which is what I try and do on my
channel anyhow your job demands you sit
a lot what do you do keep fit I haven't
been doing to keep fit dude it's
one of my things I need to I need to do
better so you know guys I think it's
about time to wrap this up I usually
like to leave these live streams with
some words of wisdom or what I consider
words of wisdom and so one of the things
I want to just sort of bring back to the
conversation real quick before I go by
his earlier forests hang basically was
worried about how to get started on a
project and how do I even what do I do
when essentially getting overwhelmed
getting overwhelmed by this the end goal
when oftentimes all you have to do is
get started and just piece by piece by
piece are you gonna do it perfectly no
we don't ever do anything perfectly but
piece by piece start putting it together
so when you're feeling overwhelmed by
life by school by everything just relax
for a second and try to figure out how
you could just get 1% of the project
done or 5% and just start knocking out
piece by piece and you have to look at
that good the same way that you do
anything in life is you know if I want
to go and get a six pack
am I gonna be overwhelmed because I'm
not gonna have it tomorrow or I'm not
gonna do it the perfect way or am I
gonna start today and steadily get
better and learn more as I as I go by so
have that mentality and with that being
said dole on be seen y'all soon bye yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
