wireframing what it is why it's
important and how to use it to your
advantage as a developer so let's start
by talking about what wireframes are
then I'll kind of go through some of
mine that I'm building for a course and
just kind of showcase how I use it
traditionally so wireframes really are
there to essentially take an idea that a
client has or somebody has and to
actually put it to pin to put it to
paper essentially and you may use a
program so like I'm using for instance I
use balsamic and I want to thank them
actually because they sent me a free
license of this use so I couldn't kind
of talk about this and have something
show and then just use also so thank you
to both sonic so if you're interested in
that go and show them some love you can
buy this program for like $89 for a
one-time fee but you know so the point
of wireframing really is to take an idea
and then to kind of say hey maybe your
project manager builds your wireframes
and says hey this is why our business
analysts this is what we're thinking we
want a portfolio application we want to
look like this and then they they give
you the requirements you know you should
usually with some text as well but
sometimes you'll have some wireframes
and this will be able to essentially
showcase what the client wants now it's
it's pretty important once you dive into
it a little bit to kind of notice a few
things so again what we're looking at is
some wire framing that I'm going to be
doing for a course of mine and just to
kind of make my course sound that
standout but you'll notice a few things
here is I have an idea in this case I
wanted to to go ahead and make a
personal portfolio and I wanted to
showcase that idea let's say I had a a
manager said hey we're having a
portfolio application can you come up
with something and depending on your
role as a developer you may do this I
did a lot of wire framing at
previous role and the reason for it is I
don't really want to write any code for
a client that doesn't know what they
want so instead what I what you would do
is your wiring it also lets you work
through some of the ideas in your head
and you get to see some things and when
you actually get wireframes so you can
pull them back say well based off these
five wireframes there's kind of a
disconnect at this one spot and let's
talk about it right let's let's dive
into a little bit more in detail but you
can see here I basically created what I
want my final project it'd look like and
you'll notice that it's a very low
resolution wireframe this is it's not
gonna look identical to this but it's
gonna have some of the same form it's
really to communicate an idea and not
find details now there are more detailed
wireframes and you know depending on
what sort of business you're in you may
actually go and talk with you may
actually get like a Photoshop file and I
said we want exactly this that's not
what most of my wireframes are like and
that's more of a web design sort of shop
but in a more of a web development shop
a lot of times you'll get something
where they're not too concerned about
what it looks like but it needs to have
this functionality and through these
wireframes we can see what that
functionality is in our case here in our
initial load is what I called this we
want to have a name our title an image
some social media and then we have some
other stuff here and then as we go when
we see the wireframes we start depicting
what that functionality is so when we
click on this icon we want it to
collapse and we have our notes here and
then just a little thing here to say
date and highlight to showcase what the
changelogs supposed to be what it's
supposed to do this one's actually
probably a little more fleshed out than
a lot of wireframes I get so a lot of
times you get wireframes to say that are
if you get wireframes they're not super
fleshed out
this is a very basic project so it's
much easier to go and create wireframes
and it took me to give you guys an idea
it took me less than an hour while
live-streaming to come up with this
because I had already normally you would
do this to the starter project but
something like this I already had in my
mind of what I wanted to make it would
have taken
as long and so in this case you say look
when I highlight when I hover over this
I want to go ahead and and see
additional details and we have this
mouse here it's a showcase that we're
hovering over it I have a hover effect
in when we click over here we want it to
have some links and we showcase that and
we click over here our speaker bio that
drops down and we've now illustrated
just with some very basic wireframes
what it is that we really want this
project to do at the end of the day and
it took us less than an hour so as a as
a developer I might go to my boss or I
might go to the client say hey is this
what you were thinking and at this point
I've wasted very little time and I've
actually not written a single line of
code and I can go to them and they could
say absolutely not get this out
of here and you haven't wasted one tenth
of the time you probably would actually
writing this up and so now and also it
can it once you it just sort of
visualizes it for the client and that
for the developer and it depends on what
your role is oftentimes as I mentioned
the project manager may give it to you
and you may edit it or you may come back
and say look this is what I was thinking
and you may just print this out right
now you have physical copies where you
can just draw on it you don't even need
the file I really like wire framing
because it really allows me to sort of
see what it is I'm trying to do and I
think it could be very beneficial to
when a lot of you are starting brand new
like you're you're the bait you're the
brand new fresh developer I am just
getting started and you still have this
oh my god how do I start a new project
feeling you know you open the text
editor and then just panic sets in it's
blank it's empty it's scary and you
don't know where to get started well
when you win it may take you a second to
sort of thing but if you can actually
visualize what it is you want to do and
you start breaking out piece by four you
say ok well I want a header that has a
name and then below that I want a sub
header that's a title and an image in
social media let me start
taking it out piece by piece and if you
just try to tackle those pieces that
you've defined in your wireframes you'll
it'll be a lot less intimidating as you
continue on and you'll learn and you'll
you'll learn a little bit about how
things should be broken down and how to
proceed and and every everything else
but I really have always enjoyed wire
framing I also think it's a cool skill
that you can add to your resume that
will showcase especially as a junior
developer that showcase that you're a
little bit unique I oftentimes tell
people that when you're building
projects to go and build wireframes for
them and include a link to it somewhere
in your somewhere in your portfolio
maybe on your github you just have these
exported in a folder that says
wireframes and people can see what your
initial thoughts were and then compare
it and contrast I say the same thing
about testing a lot of time people don't
right a lot of times people write very
few tests if any and you can go and just
do a couple tests to showcase that hey
you know I'm trying to to hit the whole
spectrum here and you'll look much more
impressive in the process now there are
various depending on on I think there's
actually two oh hey now I think that's
presentation well that's not what I
meant to click over here so this is the
wireframe and then this is the sketch
it's the same thing really just so that
you can see it slightly different
because balsamic specifically is
supposed to be very very low resolution
and there to communicate ideas now there
are things like is it sketch and
Photoshop but there are other ones that
are supposed to be we want exactly this
in a much more detail I tend to shy away
from those things because I I like using
wireframes for ideas and that's why they
have this sketch and wireframe so it's
just basically a Genki or looking
version of what it is that you're trying
to do at the end of the day so that
you're it's just there for idea not
necessarily to to say this
what we wanted to because that's
dangerous right when you present
something like this and to a client and
they sometimes you're like well why
isn't it done Dylan it looked to me like
it was done whoa slow your roll there
pimp it this is just a picture this
doesn't really have any functionality
it's not connected to any back-end
well it looks white to me it looks done
it's working all right
especially when you start to actually
chain them together so in more
impressive not impressive but in more
detailed tools you can actually
prototype these out and the big
difference between wireframes and
prototypes is that your prototypes look
like they work they have click
functionality input functionality they
chain wireframes together that you've
defined and essentially it's a mock
demonstration of how your app would run
much more detail usually a little bit
more styling is provided but again it's
more to communicate the idea and it
actually gives clients a way of saying
yeah this is exactly what I'm thinking
oh no you know what this was actually I
didn't like check boxes here I know I
probably said check boxes but they're
really radio buttons but I don't
understand the difference I'm a client
right you just build you probably cut
the checks I don't build it you build a
right but uh the the point being that
prototypes will give them a little bit
more of a interaction while wireframes a
lot of times are more of a a dry rough
sketch and I I personally love doing
them because I think it helps me flesh
out my ideas a little bit how I want
things to look and how I'm going to go
for me we also notice that if you go and
check out my course which should be out
in a week or two you'll notice that not
everything is identical this because
this was really just there again for the
idea so I hope that you guys decide to
find a wireframe program they use again
I use balsamic it's not a free tool but
I think they have a trial if you're
interested in getting if just sort of
getting your feet wet giving it a shot
that's free for a week or two or a month
and I appreciate you guys watching the
video don't forget to comment like
subscribe share support me on patreon
and I will see you guys in the next
video bye
maybe we should I wireframe for my next
project
why don't you wireframe a ring on this
finger
