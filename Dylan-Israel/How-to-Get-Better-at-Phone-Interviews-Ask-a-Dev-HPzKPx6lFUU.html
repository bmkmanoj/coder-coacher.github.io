topics are really important to be honest
with you but I consider this one one of
the ones that you should really take
some notes and because it's simple
changes that you can make in how you
conduct yourself do during phone
interviews they have a dramatic effect
on how quick you get hired these are all
things that I do and I continue in
looking for ways to improve so why are
we talking about phone interviews well a
lot of times when you are being a
candidate for any job not just a
development job but this whole channel
is about being a developer we're going
to talk about white as the developer
typically it will have a phone call with
you at which point you will sell
yourself based off your resume and
you've submitted your resume a recruiter
or potential developers looks at says
hey this guy it looks like you might
have what it takes let's follow up and
see if we can work with them that's
really what that phone call is for you
to do is it's to sell yourself as well
as to see if everything on your resume
is true and what's not on your resume
how great of a candidate you are and
there is an art to getting a job that is
more than just being a good developer
the best developer does not always get
the job and so that's what really why
you you have to kind of understand that
there other than the software and the
coding aspect there is a skill set
involved in getting a job and part of
that is phone interviews so we're going
to talk about phone interviews now I've
had a lot of phone interviews so I've
gone well some have gone bad and I've
implemented sort of three things that I
I do now and I've had a couple recently
through recruiters and things like that
we've been reaching out to me which is
another reason I take calls from
recruiters not only because who knows
what may happen but also it gives you a
chance to practice your interview skills
it gives you a chance to to actually not
it just to be prepared for when the time
comes right like if you're going to run
a marathon you don't just on marathon
day go and run you practice up to that
point and it's kind of the same with
what
anything else so my first tip is to
practice having phone interviews have
phone interviews right so if if you're
not in a position where recruiters are
reaching out to you some of you may not
be go and apply for jobs and get phone
interviews and practice actually going
through the process and in doing that
and if you can't get phone interviews
have your girlfriend have your wife have
your husband have your boyfriend have a
friend and practice going through the
motions have them have a copy of your
resume and you go and they interview you
right there on that slide take it
seriously and I would even suggest -
even if you're even if you're there in
person I would even suggest doing it
over the phone
have your have your girlfriend or
boyfriend go into the other room and do
it over the phone that's because in a
phone interview can't read their facial
expressions and you're going to
naturally be doing that especially
somebody you know very well so as that
would be the first suggestion as tip one
practice tip 2 this is something that
I've recently started taking advantage
of and I wish I did it more and as
someone who sometimes gets in his head a
little bit too much I found this awkward
to say now I always say it every
conversation I've have ever had with a
recruiter or someone who's interviewing
me it always ends with do you have any
questions for me right and I my usual
responses nope
if there's anything you need from me let
me know do you have any questions for me
that I can follow up with that's my
usual response I still say that part but
I say I follow it up now with giving our
interview or giving our phone in tahrir
given our conversation is there anything
that I can improve on is there anything
that my resume is lacking is there
anything in my interview skills that I
can improve on in there oh they are very
helpful there's a lot of things that
they'll you know sometimes I'll go in a
more technical way but that gives you an
idea what technically you need to fill
out your application and then sometimes
if you're if you really hammer down the
interview part they'll talk about well
yes I thought that your
I thought that you were speaking a
little fast and you were nervous or I
thought that perhaps you could elaborate
it or you elaborate it too much and it's
gonna you have you're going to take the
good in the bathroom it but this is all
things that you can do for a relative
for free most of the time and for people
who are actually looking to hire
somebody in your position to go and
improve your interview skills because it
is a skill you're not just going to and
and people may disagree but the cold
fact matter is that the best developer
does not always get hired they hire the
developer that presents themselves the
best and still has skills to do the job
and so what you need to worry about is
how can you present yourself better and
to do that get feedback feedback from
people who actually hire you is a simple
thing to ask for and a lot of times are
willing to give it 99.9% time they're
willing to give it I know for me that I
felt awkward asking that question at
first I don't anymore and I encourage
you to do the same I've learned a lot
about how to maybe improve my resume as
well as how to be a better interviewer
and I think it's helped me out
tremendously I hate saying tremendously
now because every time I say I say
tremendously that's the truth Trump yeah
as soon as not about politics the third
and final thing is practice what you are
going to say think about it beforehand
and occasionally you'll get caught
off-guard by questions that you weren't
expecting that happened to me recently
your recruiter asked me what I was most
proud of for my youtube channel and I
gave an awful response because I've
never really thought about what I'm most
proud of I'm very proud of my channel
but I've never thought to get the idea
or the answer prepared mentally so when
you're when you're before you have your
interviews always practice what you're
going to say whether it's in your head
you could probably repeat it verbally
you know what what's your spiel and
you'll have the ten generic questions
you know what's your experience so have
your whole conversation plan out what
you're going to talk about that why do
you like software what technologies do
you use what projects have you been to
you know just all that sort of basic
prep those are the easy ones but when
you get caught off guard with a question
like I did
I have a very good response for that now
at the time I said I was happy what it
did for my career and that wasn't a good
response and I recognized that but have
a good response ready for anything that
you from those interviews and that's the
thing about practicing it sometimes
they'll come up out with questions that
you never anticipated and you will be
able to create a good response based off
of the feedback so those are my three
tips for how to get better at phone
interviews I know that part of the
reason I'm creating my course coders
course comm it is not going to be just
courses we're actually going to depend
on what tier you get it's not out yet
but it will be shortly probably about a
month is we do we are going to do mock
interviews and mock phone interviews and
the code review and debugging sessions
and stuff like that because it is so
crucial that you work on the skill set
of getting a job as much as the skills
needed for the job
that it's I'm building it into my
platform so that you know a weekly basis
you can be interviewed or somebody else
in the group can be interviewed and we
kind of work through it and you and
you'll get over the sort of fear that
comes along with it especially if you're
if you're a junior developer trying to
be a junior developer and you've had
very few white board interviews that's
another thing we'll be doing but I hope
you guys are really practicing on the
skills of being interviewed of being a
good of having a good interview and
getting a job as much as these skills
needed for the job because it's Justice
Department anyhow that's my field today
