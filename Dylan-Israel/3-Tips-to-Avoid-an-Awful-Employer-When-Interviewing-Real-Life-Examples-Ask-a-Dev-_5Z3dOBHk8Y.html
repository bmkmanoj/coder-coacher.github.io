video but today exilim the combination I
wanted to share what he said and why
this video is so important today's video
is about basically trying to avoid bad
employers and you can see from his
comment here that he finished his first
month as a web developer and he hates it
his employer lied to him in the job
description he has a bad boss he tells
him dude do something then yells at him
and that the people he's working with
are messing with the code and he's even
thinking about changing his his life
plan and changing careers this is how
important it is to not work for a bad
employer and why this video is so
important this is
commented three hours ago on today's
video and I I'm gonna re-encode the
video and put this in the beginning
because I just want to really have
everybody here understand why it's so
important that you a lot of people are
like I'll take any job they'll come my
way and I understand that but do
understand that sometimes you get the
awful and and you should try to avoid it
if you can and so I hope you listen to a
few of these tips and I'm sure read the
comments below people share theirs as
well but I just I just feel for this guy
cuz here's a guy who probably a month
ago when he landed his first web
development job I know Eve was cuz came
into my live stream and we were talking
about it and he's just loving life it
was like hell yeah man I got my first
web dev job I'm so excited I love coding
and now thirty days later he's
questioning everything because of a
shitty boss a shitty company and maybe
if he was able to pick up on a few
things in the interview process he would
say you know what I'm gonna hold out a
little bit longer so P I hope this
really this really just sort of sinks in
because like for me this is it's the
reason I make these videos not only so
that you guys can grow and learn but so
you don't make the mistakes that I have
made and luckily I haven't had any truly
awful working situations but I've also
been very careful to avoid them as well
and
and I just feel free I feel for this guy
because I I know that feeling when I
first got my first web dev job and you
know I'm only a year later at my second
one and it I loved it I loved it and it
would suck so much to be in such an
awful environment in which somebody
would kill that for me so I just wanted
to share that before we go in today's
video so in case you guys thought that
maybe Excellencies case was an isolated
incident 37 minutes ago this is the next
morning by the way I was just going
through my facebook stuff I saw this
post in our Facebook group code Tech and
caffeine and here it is let's go ahead
and read it just a little warning to my
fellow coders out there when someone
offers you a job make sure that they're
suitable credibility such as a website
or a LinkedIn page I just had three
months of hell after being I even
accepting an offer it's really easy to
get into something for the money make
sure it's a right fit for you as well
I was dumb even that's the sole
developer ever the company I didn't code
anything for three months I was made to
do office admin work my boss was useless
he even made me write the job spec for
the new guy when I resigned he didn't
have a clue about technology he tried to
intimidate me into sharing where I was
working next I didn't say anything and
was fired / I resigned not really sure
which just remember that you should
always have standards the places you
want to work and not just try to fit the
employers criteria it was a good
learning experience for me in that
regard so why am i sharing this and why
is John sharing this because it is
important a lot of times we're so caught
up in just getting our first job or not
you don't want to waste time with a bad
employer or be miserable with the bad
employer so I just want to share that
was just another I know it's not as
uncommon as you think so I really hope
that you guys end up watching the video
and learning from from other people's
mistakes my my own as well and you know
salon Z's and John's hey I want to talk
to you about my three tips of when you
interview to find out if the company's a
good fit for you or a bad fit so make
sure that you end up at a good company
because there's a lot of companies that
work you to the bone and not appreciate
you and I found interviewing with these
companies and and that I can pretty much
guarantee what the result is going to be
in it worries me a little bit because
not everyone's so observant not everyone
maybe maybe it's your first one or two
interviews and you don't know what to
pick up on so we're going to talk about
a few things that you can to find out
hey I want to work for these guys or a
let's run like hell in the other
direction so the first thing I want to
bring up is understanding what they're
asking what I mean by that is recently I
in the last month started accepting job
interviews and at about 7:00 in the last
month in-person interviews and numerous
phone calls and I would say that
everything I talk about is going to
relate to in person because it's hard to
pick up on exactly what people are
intending without the facial without
being able to read their body language
and things of that nature so understand
what's being asked and what I mean by
that is I had an interview with a with
two different companies and one was a
small company one was a multinational
corporation so it doesn't matter the
size of the company now there are
different aspects that come to working
for a small team or a large company
that's for a separate video we're
talking about the interview part so that
you can understand is this a place I
want to work specifically based off the
people and how that you're going to
interact and I had a video chat with one
company with both actually what was in
person one of those in video but
specifically the one I'm going to talk
about is the video chat where it's in
person having a Skype call and typically
when people asked me about my side
projects it is oh I see this YouTube
channel could tell me a little bit about
how that start and you go into your
spiel you know I you know this is what I
do on it these are my side projects I
also have a podcast I eventually want to
write a book and I'm working on a coding
channel course I start telling a little
about me what makes we know what gets
even right now I'm getting a little hike
to about it right and so this is good
height this is stuff that you're
passionate about software you enjoy it
and you're continuing to learn right and
most companies most good companies will
say that's really cool and maybe if
they're the right type of person they
might tell you yeah you know I I think
that's really cool and I I did this back
in the day and I wish I stuck with it
man and I you know they sir co2 there's
feeling start connecting right these
particular companies will say and
understand again what are they actually
asking is do you have time for work with
all those side projects do you have time
to work and what that basically means to
me and I think a lot of people would
agree is that we're actually gonna work
you more than 40 hours every week we are
going to work you on the low end
probably closer to 50 hours on the high
end 60 it's gonna be a common thing it's
not gonna be like oh well we need to be
a team player this week or you know one
week out of the month or even one week
out of three months I got no problem I
understand that we live in a world
that's fluctuating and so the 40-hour
workweek some weeks isn't gonna work you
know if once every three weeks I got
work an 80 hour week is not enough I'm
not worried about it alright that's this
just that's just the working world but
when your main concern is that when you
have a developer who's passionate about
software and and working become a better
developer and doing all these you know
side projects and your main concern is
that he's not going to be working enough
that to me says this guy isn't gonna
work our forty or excuse me our fifty
hour plus workweek and I'm not there
completely right but my thing is is a
lot of times those companies themselves
aren't going to pay you to work 25
percent or 50 percent more you might
make five ten thousand dollars more
which will only probably be maybe ten
percent more than your competitor at
fifteen percent more at most but they're
expecting a fifty percent return and one
thing I can say about one of these
companies is when I went there in person
who's very clear how stressed out all
the employees where I met four
developers face-to-face and talked with
them to them looked very unhappy and
looked like they were stressed beyond
their belief and when I was walking down
the cubicles and don't get me started
I'm cubicles when I was walking
down these straight up box cubicles with
the sign with the the please be quiet
we're in a library sign and I was
walking down and I saw on the left on
the right other developers the bulk of
them looked very unhappy the bulk of
them looked like they didn't want to be
there and they were there collecting the
check and those are and this just
reinforced the you know that thing I
noted in our video called before winning
in person that I thought that there is
something weird about why you would ask
how many hours I'd be able to work and
how you know are you gonna have time for
work you know that that to me is a very
strange question because obviously right
obviously I am a salaried employee I'm
expected to put in 40 hours a week no
problem not like it's not like I've been
working at 8 hour work week all my life
and I just decided I want to kick it up
a notch so that's the first thing is
understand what the questions are being
asked and I'm not saying read into it
too much but based off of the
conversation what are they really trying
to ask the second thing I would say to
watch out for is the what I call the
coolness factor when they're trying to
sell you on how cool it is to work here
more so than good salary and good
benefits and everything else and
oftentimes in the coolness factor they
will they will ask you how much you
expect to get paid and start negotiating
with you not necessarily even
negotiating but trying to to put you at
a price point because money's tight a
lot of times this is at startups a lot
money's tight or they actually just they
don't care how good you are they just
want somebody that can barely fit that
role at a certain price point and
essentially wasting your time a lot of
times - and what would I mean by the
coolness factor well the the it's always
like the same guy I've had this guy like
three times and I don't mean like
literally the guy but it's always the
same sort of personality
like I kind of have this wonky
personality and how you doing bro
and so um to me it's it's comical almost
so um you know sometimes they'll even be
like very very very relaxed which is
nice right but also at the same time
they'll be like having a beer right one
of the start of saying oh look how cool
and and I think the the image and again
what are they trying to impose upon you
where are they trying to image wise
they're trying to sell you I'm just
trying to sell you on how cool it is
right here's this guy who's gonna be my
boss sipping a beer and you know things
like that oh that's really cool man you
know if I could have a beer once or
twice a day at work and that definitely
make up for the $20,000 less they're
gonna pay me right and oftentimes
whenever I've had this over-the-top
coolness factor and that's not to say
that you can't have a cool workplace
right my current job has a slide from
like the like the second storey down to
the first and it's cool it's like I
think it's cool but like when I went in
there they didn't like sit like the
thing was on the job yeah yeah yeah
where this nice new built building
they're they're proud of in there
telling me about it and but they're not
like look at the slide usually I bet the
other place you work outdoors outside
right so it's it's one of those things
where why are you so why are you so
focused on the coolness factor and a lot
of times those same people are focused
on the coolness factor is the second
year in there let's talk money
let's what are you looking to make
because that's all that matters at the
end of the day and they want to get you
as cheap as possible
regardless of if you're a good developer
or not they just want to get someone in
there for cheap and that's part of
that's part of the process so when when
they're focusing too much on the
coolness factor start having some red
flags go off and start maybe not
necessarily being on guard but start
making in the mode where you're making
mental notes about the other things that
are happening at that point and thirdly
the the last thing is the old switcheroo
as they say you know what I mean by that
is a lot of the companies that I help
you put on the brakes and search like
flying red flags is you
you have a individual who is telling you
all the things that you have to write
and then immediately start slamming
you're like they're building you up
right and immediately start slamming you
about everything that's wrong with you
and how they're gonna fix you and that
there and they'll literally use the word
fix sometimes I don't need fixin bro all
right like I'm a grown-ass man you know
fix me this is what you get I may become
a better developer on my own time but I
don't need fixing so that's one thing I
really thought was kind of where you're
gonna fix me all right but the little
switcheroo where they build you up and
then they just tear you down in the
process and this happens a lot believe
it or not a lot of a lot of a lot of you
know hiring managers and look this is a
lot of times at smaller companies where
there aren't any hiring managers to be
honest there's just like the person that
owns the tiny company and they go when
they like to build you up and then like
to tear you down to make the drop that
much harder I think so that they can
negotiate a little bit more and this is
something I really advise you to stay
away from and it's a it's a strange
world out there when you're interview
because they're all let's so we've we've
talked about the three main things that
stand out to me when I interview and
some of these you can tell over the
phone it's a lot easier to tell
someone's intentions in person right so
like the the switcheroo where someone's
building up and telling you what's wrong
it's it really depends on how they're
delivering that right so maybe a perfect
example I interviewed and what one
company that I wanted to work out I had
a pleasurable experience was they said
yeah well we're an angular and angular
shopper you know currentversion angular
4i i have practical experience in
angularjs of professional rather and
they say you know you're not a perfect
fit but but you know clearly you have
experience in working with angular and
you can see can see that you have a
passion to learn and so we don't see any
problem with that
that is a very civil i sore spots and in
the other case negative person they
would say
only have angularjs experience we're
gonna have to we're gonna have to teach
you everything from the ground up about
angular four and we're gonna we're gonna
fix that so you're gonna be much better
and we're gonna you know they're trying
to sell you on that and that should be
the thing is watch out for the salesman
so you shouldn't have to be sold on
working for a company you should show up
interview the people you've done a
little bit of research about the company
presumably and it should be apparent by
hey are these guys happy but the
developers I mean do they look happy and
can they carry on a conversation with me
do I think I'm going to vibe with them
that should be what's going to sell you
what technologies are they using but
when they're trying to sell you on the
coolness factor when they're when
they're trying to do that or they're
trying to sell you on how great it would
be if they they think graced you if you
will with their presence to fix your
your gaps right it's always going to be
gaps but sometimes people sell you on
how hard they're gonna fix you on that
and this and that and so that's always
something that really feels dirty it's
when they're trying to sell you on how
you need them so I look bro
you need to hire me to help you alright
like it's a it's a two-way street and
what happens is sometimes these these
selling aspects of it's like they're
doing you a favor giving your job you
got do me a favor I'm a developer we all
get jobs eventually right and I'm you
yet so the the mentality I'm trying to
send you and this is gonna be a harder
thing for people who are trying to break
into the industry I understand if you
have to go work for some scumbag
employer that is going to tear you down
for six months while you're there just
to get that experience look I hate to
say that I'm okay with it but I
understand right I understand that
sometimes those those people who you can
tell they're going to work you 60 hours
a week and not pay you a 60 hour weeks
salary I understand that yes you it is
important to get that experience and and
on the resume I get it but try to avoid
it the best you can man watch out for
the salesman and look out for the people
who are in the opposite boat right the
people who
they ask questions respectfully and they
want to know more about you about what
you do have not about what you don't
have right focusing on the positive
while the other people focus on the
negative right and I'm not saying
unpractical says oh well Dylan you know
obviously if you don't fit the role if
they didn't art if they weren't already
interested in you you wouldn't be there
interviewing in person right that's what
the phone interviews there for that's
why you send your resume in right so a
lot of times what those people are
trying to sell you about the coolness
factor and about the the the oh how
you're not perfect but we'll take you
you know like sort of thing is because
they want to pay you less they want they
want to get they don't really care about
who they hire they just want to get
somebody that can do the job and they
could pay below market rate and so watch
out for that and definitely keep an eye
out for the the people who are
respectful who you can carry a
conversation on and who you say you know
what this is actually pretty good
interviews are usually pretty uh pretty
terrifying pretty stressful but in this
case it wasn't all that bad it sucked
because it's an interview no one likes
you
but you know thank you for your time
sort of thing and go on your way and say
that was pretty pleasant watch out for
those guys that aren't though that's my
two cents if you guys have any tips
about what are red flags for you in your
interview process please leave them in
the comments below cuz these things
should not only for my sake I got a job
but there's plenty of people either
viewing and I want I want people to
understand that that there are things
that you can look out for so that when
you do take that job and then you are
working six hour weeks and you're
getting paid nothing for those extra
twenty hours that maybe next time
there's something you could avoid or
hopefully you never got in that position
as well so thank you so much for
watching guys don't forget to comment
like subscribe share support my own page
here and all that good stuff I wish you
all the best of luck out there for those
who are trying to get your first role
for those of you currently interviewing
and for those of you that are in awful
roles right now and wondering how did
you get in here in this situation maybe
next time you'll avoid it and I've had
so many interviews I feel like that I've
you know it might come from a ice
poker right with my friends and stuff
like that
and so reading people and their
mannerisms is something that's very
unique to poker and that's that's
something that you you know you're gonna
lose money or make my so I'm necessarily
even about the cards half the time it's
about what is this person thinking and
what are they trying to impose upon me
so that they could get me to do
something and how can I do it back to
them and in this case I think the
reading of people is kind of what I'm
trying to get across and it's something
that when I have these these these
questions that are being asked and how
they're being asked it's very apparent
what's getting what's what they're
trying to get out right what they're
trying to find out and why so anyhow
guys best of luck to you out there it's
a hard world I'll see you next time bye
