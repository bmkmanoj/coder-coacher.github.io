time what we did was we targeted our
list all your list items here so that we
get the correct data now what we want to
do is make it so that we can switch our
F temp here between Celsius and
Fahrenheit so the way I did it was I
used jQuery and basically what I did was
I targeted the F temp on a click
function and I created a variable that
would switch between true or false
essentially so we'll just go ahead and
create up here and I create this
variable called temp swap and I just set
it equal to true and then right here
we're gonna target our F temp now the
reason that this is displayed is because
of this I I just wanted because we're
gonna be doing an on click function we
want this to pre-populate with something
in this case it's going to be Fahrenheit
that's all so we're just gonna say
targeting F temp when someone clicks it
we're gonna run a function that does
some stuff now what we're gonna do here
is we're gonna say if our temp swamp
that's what is keeping track of this
true or false
is equal equal to false what do we want
it to do we want me to output the
Celsius temple f2 excuse me
so again we're gonna target our F temp
and we're going to say output C temp now
C temp is our Celsius temporal and then
we're just gonna go ahead at set temps 1
temp swap equal to true and then we're
just do a simple else statement this is
else what we want to do is we want to
target our hashtag F temp and we just
want to go ahead and set that HTML to F
temp so this is going to be when it
switches over on the next click
essentially and then in this case we're
going to set it back temp swap is equal
to false and this is so that we can keep
switching back and forth between
variables so you know so this is a
Fahrenheit we click it it's not working
all right so it looks like I have to
actually have this triple equals to make
sure that it's checking is this boolean
I think otherwise it just checks if it's
a string something along those lines so
now when we click on it it'll switch
back and forth between Celsius and
Fahrenheit and so what we'll do next is
we'll clean this up a little bit so
we'll probably modulo off the end or
there are some formatting on it so that
we know which one's Fahrenheit and which
ones Celsius after that we'll turn this
into a button so it's not so clunky to
click on and then we'll also display
these as buttons as well and probably do
some units and maybe even wind direction
for this so I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
