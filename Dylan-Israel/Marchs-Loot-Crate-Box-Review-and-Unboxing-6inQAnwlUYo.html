crate here and I'm really excited about
it it's nice size box pretty big feels
feels pretty heavy um last month I
wasn't I didn't really like attempted
offer us I liked the book and that was
about it ready player one good book
check it out if you haven't not you're
not already part of the crate go too
boring to know we'll pick it up but uh
let's see what we got here so the boxes
typical box has some sort of design that
you can fold it into looks like that's a
keyboard so maybe fold up into a
computer or something and the first
thing I see here I'm very excited about
is a shirt I am so happy when I see a
shirt in one of these and it's all right
you know it's like a little James Bond
thing you know shaken not stirred and
this is stirred sad James Bond I could
wear this you know I would I like it not
bad and it's not black that's one of the
things they were teasing about on their
website is one of their first shirts
they sent but isn't black so you know
every should it's been pure black this
twice nice little what you got I like it
see what else um this one low survival
let's open up well it looks like one
looks survival parachute fans they're
real we have time we got my video here
hi so yeah um I mean I guess this is
cool to wear for fashion I don't know
that you would actually ever you'd
actually ever be in a situation where
you would need this to come undone and
maybe if I was a Navy SEAL or ex-marine
or something uh yeah it's got a nice
little blue Krait thing on there cool
colors we had some bad well let's see
what else do we have this looks like a
okay alright so this is like one of
those clip on things I'm guessing
there's something that we clip onto it
so let's see here I think it's in here
so this is a anyone who probably like
soup great loves marble like myself so
this has to do with agents of shield
it's a collectible we're open it up I
don't collect anything I don't have the
patience or
we're with all of you with it but um
this is a certificate oh it even comes
with a certificate of authenticity here
so nice little cool thing here um but it
looks like a like a agent pass and we're
gonna pop this out I clip it and now we
can officially enter nowhere uh I don't
know um it's all those items that
doesn't really serve any purpose i guess
it's you're just gonna kind of where it
or not wear it i mean it's someone gonna
wear this probably not it's probably
just going to take up space on the shelf
or hang somewhere but it's a cool idea i
guess it's a collector's item to a
degree oh this month's team was covert
so everything's gonna be kind of spy ish
so that's why the James Bond theme and
the Marvel's agents of shield so let's
see the next one is like field notes
this is kind of cool uh by the looks of
it it's just like a little notebook but
so this first one is just like regular
lined paper it's got like the calendar
and everything in it and the other one
is actually graph paper so I mean I'm a
college student look radar but not all
art but everyone I think a final purpose
to that Nia two of them that's critical
graph paper regular paper I like that so
yeah they give you instructions on how
to use the parachute pack us go look at
I'd have no idea even if I needed to use
this you get a free ninja nin nin Jax
the first II comic they have for it so
I'm not big on comics um this was
probably my favorite thing so far other
than a t-shirt because t-shirts just a
rule it's a stealth watch so you put it
on you can't see anything and then you
press it and the time comes out um I
gotta figure out how to set the time
because that's not the correct time
right now so I really cool and then it
goes away so no one can tell what time
it is I guess it's a team um
a cool little loot crate pin if you like
me I love the pants i just have actually
have them hanging up on the wall if you
can see in the glitzy over there where
that red the ryu band Lucretius they're
all just attached to it so i'm creating
my collection the covert you know item
list and you know they show you all the
big cool packs you can win that you'll
never win um that are worth a thousand
dollars or whatever mad libs this uh
this is actually one of the cooler
things that they said ice cream a
delicious kids road trips can't be trips
all that sort of stuff so this actually
will get some use the next like trip I
go on to I'll just bring it and have
some fun on the plane the train the car
whatever and nest last but not least a
comic the orphan black series I've not a
comic I haven't heard of orphan black
but uh I read a quick thing on it it's
about doppelgangers that are trying to
kill her so click so I don't know maybe
it's good um takes place in Canada she's
got a hot so maybe it's worth checking
out so that was this month's Luke react
to say you know the call me whatever you
know throw it in there cool madly it's I
like the you know the watch and the pin
cool you get this little thing I'm not
too stoked on it and then t-shirt I
think I pay like seventeen dollars a
month for all this cuz I worded six
months thing a six-month package and I
have to say I'm really impressed I like
this a lot so last month I do I wasn't
really too big of a fan of but so far so
good i'd say about of my five months
I've been happy with about four of them
so Luca it's been doing pretty well and
I think this is one of their better ones
with a shirt a watch and a little
bracelet and all the other stuff I'm not
too fond of</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
