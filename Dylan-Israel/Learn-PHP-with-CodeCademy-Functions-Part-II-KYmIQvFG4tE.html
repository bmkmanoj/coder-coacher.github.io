are doing functions in PHP part 2 so
beforehand we use functions that were
defined already seven hundred or so
thickly and now we're going to use our
own function then so in this case it
wants us to get the length our name if
you forgot how simple simple enough we
want to echo out scra blen the string
length Dylan and don't forget to
semicolon and so there's five letters
have done that works just fine all right
now you can see right here their
function you're defining their own
function called hello world and all it
does is print it out so when they call
it right here PSC it prints out hello
world so it's going to use that as our
base example so we want to create a
function and notice that it's of course
called within the pH P brackets or
anchors where you're gonna come wire so
display um see I already forgot how good
are you so we meet our bracket site so
it's like a standard so and what does it
one takes no parameters and will echo a
string that contains your name so it's
going to echo my name so the first
now of course and you see that it
doesn't run it unless we call it on line
10 write a function takes up for our
service did your armor declare function
a function display up so go to follow
direction display name so now it should
work cool on the line after your
function you can see your name
displaying the panel results I think
it's asking us to call it yeah okay so
weird way to say display name so there
it is right there so now we're going to
write a function called return name
function Charlie and those up even those
whose alone
alright so we want to use return and in
this case we doesn't ask for a parameter
so it's going to return bill and it
doesn't display because we didn't call
it so now we're going to kick it up a
notch so we're going to write a function
called greetings and it's going to take
the parameter name of course your
release the cash money dolla sign on our
variables then we're going to echo out a
message greetings comma make sure and
add space and then it looks like if we
want to concatenate the stream together
we have to put a dot and then dot and
maximize right then semicolon and then
we want to call greetings with our own
name and so we're going to call
greetings we're going to supply Dylan
are still calling out and there you see
right there greeting still cool so
pretty similar to any other functions
we're going to write another function
about me going to take two parameters
this time name age and from there go to
echo oh hello my name is put make sure
to include the space oh can we do like
this looks like maybe we don't have to
concatenate it like that
page if that's the case that is a little
bit less of a headache so then we're
going to call our function about me
supply it with the string Dylan and the
integer 27 and there it is BAM so that
was functions part two as always we're
going to share our Codecademy work and
next course we will be working with
objects in PHP so we're going to start
creating classes so you can see a little
bit of what's going on here but I will
see you guys next time
