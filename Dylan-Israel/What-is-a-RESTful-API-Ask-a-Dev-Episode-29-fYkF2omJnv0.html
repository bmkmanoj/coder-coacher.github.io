definition oriented but rather important
web development talk today about what is
a restful api now you've probably heard
about api's before that would be things
like the open weather api where they
have an interface where you can get data
about the weather and the api sense for
application programming interface it's
basically a way for us to interact with
databases that has data and do stuff in
our code a good example would be let me
pull up my website real quick would be
the YouTube API which I've used for my
website coding 2rl 360.com and on here
what i have done is I'm go to the home
page you'll see that i have my most
current video that's up right here with
a little description in the title this
is coming from the YouTube API I also
down below here have my channel stats
which is my current subscribers lifetime
views and total public videos so you can
get all this information and what's cool
about it because it's an API you don't
it's not hard coded so you don't have to
go back and change it and I'm not
manually every time I go in and change
it for 18 24 19 when this video comes up
and you can get real data going over
real things and you can do a lot a lot
more than just get data with API so you
can also add elite update and and create
and that really is what an API is so or
what a restful api is a RESTful API has
four functions it has the ability to
create data in a database so if the data
never existed and let's say I wanted to
add a let's take the open weather api
for instance let's say i wanted to add
the weather to my city and that city
never existed through the API with the
URL i could pass it in certain
parameters and I'd be able to send data
to the database and create a new row in
the in the
in the table or a new document in the
collection depending on what type of
database you're talking about but that
would be one functionality it basically
has forced the ability to create data
which is a post so there's post there's
posts which is create data there's put
which is to update the existing data so
say that that city already existed but I
actually misspelled it and I want to
update the name of the city that would
be a foot and then there's the ability
to get data which is what I just showed
you on my web page which is you know
with the with getting the the video
count the subscriber is occurring video
that's all get get statements so to go
and pull data out of the database and
there's delete which is the ability to
delete stuff permanently from that
database and that's what makes up a
restful api the ability to create new
data the ability to which is the post
the ability to update data which is the
put and then you have the ability to
retrieve data which is the get and then
you have the ability to delete data
which is the delete I guess at the end
of day plus Oh am I forgetting the name
of the actual delete post full I don't
know you get the point though but that's
really a restful api is those four
functions and at the end of the day it's
pretty pretty simple and pretty
intuitive so if you ever hear this term
thrown around just just understand that
there's basically four functions and API
is in general by the way are a massive
massive thing and web development you're
retrieving data from everything and even
if you're more into web designs and
actual web development it's really good
because say you want your client wants
you to just have their social media feed
on there you're going to have to use
instagrams API or Facebook's API to have
their latest picture on there or
whatever it is or have a thing of
scrolling comments you saw mine I just
wanted my youtube set so you know you
just a big part of my life that's what I
wanted and in terms of being a you know
building web applications you can yield
d you'll be making your own api's forget
used in somebody else's but you'll be
creating your own restful api to have
those four functions and you'll be
creating cooking it up to the back end
and make sure it works or fixing it when
it doesn't like so that's what a restful
api is a it's a you know a terminus turn
around quite a lot in if you're new
you're not familiar with it you know you
can enter you're trying to get better
with it you watch some of the freaking
camp projects I've done with the twitch
API or the open weather api which are
used in jquery and i actually have an
angular version of doing it as well but
that's the RESTful API I hope you guys
