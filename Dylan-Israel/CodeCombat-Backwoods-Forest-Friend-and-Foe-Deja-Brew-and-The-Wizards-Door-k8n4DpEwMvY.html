free code Campton friend friend and
fellow pretty cool also thanks to James
I don't wanna say his last name because
he does want to be known but thank you
for supporting me on patreon I got my
second patron now that's really cool
I appreciate it tongue man goal so curse
must die how cool to battle James what
Illuminati Illuminati right now I don't
know what's going on how they knew that
we're talking about James friend out
idea this is some Illuminati right
here I now find the nearest enemy and
tell them to go away i peasants and
peons are gathering command peasants of
battle and fianc to go away alright so
this is someone with a to battle and
this is soon all right find the nearest
enemy still our enemy
I'm having an Illuminati moment right
now guys long enemy if enemy so if an
enemy exists or if enemy is true meaning
that it's not undefined or null we are
going to say
I'm before something gets real let him
know man we messing around I was here
they're gonna dude's about to lay them
out what is that it that's all we're
trying to do here fail all right
Oh Chris must die Oh
so they want us to attack command the
peasants and paddles needles all right
if enemy
how do we get to the fence
yeah all right so how do we tell
let's see if this does it friend Don
attack enemy do it here this is I think
this is what they wanted us to do
Oh skip that we put friend out here so
we want them to go get equipped
friend not attack us on a function
so this finds our nearest friend
so fine nearest friend
should be within our nested scope so if
there's an enemy friend dot attack enemy
interesting
buzzing the feelings are gathering
command the peasants a battle and the
peons to go away maybe I need to
actually put go away all right so I
can't have them attack
Congress must die
now finally necessary enemy to go
I'm undeclared here
jashin I'll see let's see
except I want brand ID attack all right
could be an architect
so this I think this is so mr. Coad it's
not working
Janson
and attack is my function alright
find the nigger said to me and tell them
to go away let's go let's go to help
I'm genuinely stumped on this one
command the peasants go to battle and
the peons to go away oh you know what
go away kitchen
I may have to do the ID I think I think
I really water
all right so let's try this what we want
to do here is actually do
I'm gonna do enemy dot id+
go away let's try this one more time to
see if we get to battle James total pond
go away there we go there we go all
right a little bit of a brain fart there
looks like our boys got it I don't even
need our help
cool um took me a second to see what it
was that we needed to do there all right
up next day job brew
code combat watch there Veda in October
2013 about two years two and a half math
is bad alright you can concatenate
combined strings with other strings or
numbers so you'll see right here here at
uh say I have plus number of potions
plus potions will return I have five
potions so let's see what's going on
here sing the next line here I'll say
potions on the wall assuming the assign
them to take down
take one down faster than oh my god
alright so he rode on say and then name
here X potions on the wall so this is
potions on the wall
plus so potions on the wall sing these
potions of health sing the next line
take Y down I believe number down
alright so then we're gonna say here
take say and then we're gonna write take
space plus to take down plus down comma
pass it around
around sing the last line and X minus y
potions in the mall okay so here they
already emeriti do it right here so we
we actually could have done that we
could actually have put this in our code
right here so that it would minus one in
our in our code in our hero dot say but
it wouldn't do it we'd have to still do
it there so might as well just declare
here with so saying it would have been
bad practice but it's just good to know
that you can actually run equations to
get a result returned so X minus y so
potions on wall plus oceans of health
the wall all right let's see if I did
this correctly
oh cool
nice little fun one and then we can
either go wizards of the door useful
comparators alright I guess we'll do
wizards of the door everything to tick
basic syntax and variables this one
seems like it's gonna be a little bit
easier discover the door to the wizard's
lair
all right move to Laszlo and get his
secret number so fine Aires friend and
get secret at 7:00 to last the last
number so this gets a secret number we
had seven then we asked Aires a bit to
say the number so we live there say the
number divide areas of its number by 4
so we're gonna say bar num equal Z or Z
divided by 4 and take the remainder to
get someone's number
go to Sloane to tell him his number he's
Simoni hi resistor hero dot move peridot
find find news friend and then alright I
think we can do this time nearest friend
and then I think that will let us put a
parameter in here that will take in the
name let's see if that works
we'll say finding a friend on get secret
and go and take the remainder to get the
Simmons alright let's just run this to
see what's going on right now actually
skip this for running knots a minute
so fine nurse friend takes no arguments
okay so that don't work so let's run
through our code real quick so go here
what a team that's it now divided by
four all right until that just I'm
guessing this is this guy so we're gonna
move this guy to 30 39
and from here we are going to say yeah
say and let's say our num and then here
we want to go ahead and save our Simone
me equals hero find nearest friend dot
get secret x Laszlo's to get I got his
number and then we'll say pardon um 2 is
equal to some mone times glass and then
we want to go here then we want to 0
move X Y and this was 42 26 so I want to
move the arrow here and then we want to
yeah we want to say num - I'll be amazed
if this works so let's let's see what we
can do
what a team
so I died here so that ain't work
let's stick this out
got five nearest friend I get secret am
I going crazy because that seems to be
working just fine up there
let's I built their own just possibility
all right add seven molasses number to
get air so that's number paradox say no
we were doing this right say and we want
to say what a team what a team
tumbler remainder so the remainder of
0.5
denied
it's been a rough one today let's see
here fart nom
maybe this guy remember moving to the
wrong guy
what a team
No
a little bit of a brain fart there so it
said divine I was just focusing so much
on that we actually need to just return
that five or they were mayor the two
remainder and so we have two left over
so if we just do modulo like this which
basically means that if we were to do
let's say eleven modulo 7 it would
return for if we were to do five modulo
four it would return one so that's
basically what modulo does it just
divides whatever the remainder is so I
apologize for that
so we move here and then go to sue until
this number so we're gonna move to this
guy tell them the number x all right
let's go to run this to see what goes on
here
so all right Otis we have to store so
num2 is actually equal to num times lass
there we go that shouldn't have been so
hard master Ruffman isn't we discovered
the door though life is good very very
nice I call so that was a little bit
longer than it should have been but as
