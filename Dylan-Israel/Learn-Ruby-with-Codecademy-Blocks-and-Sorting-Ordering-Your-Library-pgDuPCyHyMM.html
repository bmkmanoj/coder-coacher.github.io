forty seven percent of the way done so
we're halfway there and we are currently
in the blocks and sorting ordering your
library section so in this project will
design a single Ruby method to sort
large quantities of data and either
ascending or descending order if you
remember last time we started using num
methods all right let's see here we're
going to kind of scan this so we have a
rev is equal to false and r is some sort
of nothing all right so I'm sort of
array maybe but alright cool so this
sorts it all right so define how
appetizing and editor below leave me Oh
Alfred eyes has an hour and a rest okay
it's been a mat so let me remember so
guess off the ties I'm not sure if this
will work because it doesn't say submit
anything ok cool so now it's going to
ask for the brain when your sister is
what you saw alright so yeah let's look
over what is Rev is equal to false the
first parameter R is basically declaring
an array and and have equal to false
let's see here rev is for reverse that
will default to false if the user
doesn't type in two arguments ok so it's
basically saying the default value is
false if they don't give it a parameter
so in this case alphabetized books it
would result to default value of false
because it wasn't included ok so we
updated the method cool next section
we're going to be ordering the log right
so you met to add a line that calls dot
sort on the RA since the last line about
this sorry so we want to call the r
which will be supplemented when we call
the method sort now test your work after
your method make a new array called
numbers alright so we're numbers equal
array
all right oh so you want two three
actually we should do that order for 31
to make sure that it works and then we
want to call the call alphabetize and we
want to submit our numbers right to it
and we can just leave that empty and
then we want to put I think that should
work and as you can see after we
alphabetize it it's goes one two three
four and then it went prints it out one
by one cool all right in this case we're
going to sort with control flow so after
our dot sort method if it's true if Rev
is equal to true it wants us to call our
and then we need to end that also
complete us what it's asking
wait let's see so it looks like your
method doesn't default the alphabetizing
the rate when it doesn't receive a
second parameter
I let's see what they did different here
um oh let's see here let's see if red
ralph is equals true call reverse on our
let's go to the Q&amp;amp;A forum
let's see how they do it
all right simply a 500 more example
looks like it wants to see some house
just wants us to have an else statement
in there um I don't know why be honest
with you because it should remain
unchanged I'm not sure what it may just
be the convention in in Ruby something
keep it back of our mind so you did it
for real this time click same assume it
okay cool so it all worked there pretty
quick we stumbled a little foot on the
the else statement I thought that might
be if I thought it's kind of worried so
next course is hashes and symbols um so
just to recall the hash is here but uh
yeah so next sessions hashes and civil
so we'll get started on that in the next
video see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
