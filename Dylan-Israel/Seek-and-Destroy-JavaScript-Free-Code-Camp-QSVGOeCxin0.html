camp we're finishing up the basic
algorithm scripting bonfire
seek-and-destroy now I have to say this
was by far the longest time wise and the
hardest one for me in this section the
last section is a little bit easier in
my opinion or at least it was more
intuitive so the first thing you have to
do is go over this arguments object and
a rate up filter we use once before and
this is actually a great example of
trying to recycle your code and you'll
see that in just a second so essentially
what's going on with this line of code
this is just copy and paste from the
documentation is we're creating a
basically a temporary array that's gonna
get the whole value here and why that's
important is currently we're only
returning this array and not these other
values so when we do that let's look at
it now we're gonna get to two in the
three so that's what we really need we
need to compare the two and the three
with that first array so how do we do
that
well we're gonna splice it so we splice
from zero to one and you'll see now that
we should have spliced out oops
spliced out this index and now we only
have two and three perfect so now we can
just kind of do what we normally would
do so in my case I would create a
placeholder you don't need to do this X
I just I don't know I just don't look
more comfortable doing this but as you
get better for me I don't like just
changing the same variable again and
again I like kind of following the steps
and having a clean original version to
an array and it's kind of what the the
idea there is so we're gonna need to
iterate through the original array so at
this point you should kind of have an
idea how to how to set this up just from
sheer practice so set a variable just a
counter variable zero why it's a lesson
the size of our original array
one and then and then we're gonna do
another array because we need to
actually compare it with our second args
oh right here of two and three so we're
gonna create a variable called J and say
well J is less than our X dot length
increased by one and these are iterated
to be in it so we're going to check the
one value and then the original array if
it's there delete if it matches any of
the arcs so that's kind of why we do it
in that order so what do we do we're
just going to delete the the array item
if it but we don't want to delete them
all so we have to do an if statement so
we're gonna say if our I it's equal
equal to args J then get our brackets
correct here delete that value so Y is
and then here we'll just a placeholder
is equal to our our
and then return placeholder so you can
see right here it kind of worked we
removed all the values over two and
three but unfortunately we're left with
these nulls so this is a great example
of how if you remember back a few
bonfires back we had to use a the filter
function so if you don't remember how
that works
you call filter on in an array and then
you have a function in this case I
called mine remove false variable and I
literally copied and pasted this over
from the example so we're gonna create a
function here called remove false VAR
and then the value is our parameter
infinitely in this case we just returned
the boolean of value so any false ii
values such as null we're going to be
able to remove then we run it we're all
good to go so let's put in some codes
right here get full array values remove
original all right compare arguments
compare array with values and delete any
matches filter out false ii values
oops and and that's it
so this one was really hard there's
about ten different ways I saw online
for people solve it no one really solved
it this way this is how I found it
intuitive to solve it I don't know if
one's better than the other we could
probably get rid of this placeholder and
just set it all are just a matter of
opinion but that's probably the best way
to do it but as always thanks for
watching the video I hope it helped you
in solving it yourself and if you solved
it a different way let me know in the
comments below and constructive
criticism always appreciated and likes
and subscribes are appreciated among all
else I'll see you guys next time
in the next video thanks for watching
the video don't forget to Like and
subscribe that helps me out a ton and I
appreciate all the comments that I get
and all the questions I get in the
comments and I'm happy to answer them so
keep them coming and I'll see you in the
next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
