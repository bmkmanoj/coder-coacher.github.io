rains of Reason doing even digits only
of the intersection what we're tasked
with here is we get a numeric number and
we want to know if every single digit
each character the to the 4 the 8 the
six the two the two are are even numbers
so even though that on paper this is the
even number there's a three in there and
thus it is no longer even that is what
we were trying to find out the way that
I did it was I split it up into an array
and then I I used the array function
every which allows you to put a
statement in that every single element
in the array has to pass if it does
returns true if one of them fails it
returns false that's what we're going to
do so we're going to take our end and
when I first break it up into an array
now we have to use two string to do it
do what I wanted to do here because you
can't split an array of number a number
but you can't split a straight and we're
splitting on each character so first we
turn it into a string second we turn it
into an array of characters now in our
return statement
you don't have to do a return statement
but I
I mean why create extra variable if you
don't have to we're going to take our
end let's bring this over this one's
going to get along and works I look for
every value that is in our array and
we'll set up our callback function here
return the values in which and mind you
we have to parse these hints because the
element that we're checking is actually
a string element that skin casted
check that when we when we modulo it by
2 it is equal to 0
now if it is it's an even number now do
that for every item in the array and if
it passes that test every element is
even and now we are done as I mentioned
the last video these are going to be
some of the quicker quicker ones to do
but there's a lot that you can kind of
as long as you get from it I think these
are one of the ones where they kind of
want you to get familiar with
documentation that's kind of that's what
I'm going for in this if you were to get
something like this on a like a
interview bless your soul you got lucky
so as always guys thank you so much for
watching don't forget to join our
Facebook group discord channel or my
patreon page if you want to support me
that way that's cool as well I'll see
you guys the next video thank you so

comment like subscribe share and if you
have other solutions chairman the
Chairman the comments on there people
can benefit in myself this one hey guys
thanks for watching the video special
thanks to our sponsors dev Mountain if
you're looking for a coding bootcamp or
tuition and housing is included
definitely check them out
appreciate it and I'll see you guys in
the next video
