the very last section JavaScript and
jQuery JavaScript and the Dom document
object model so let's go ahead and jump
right no this all log 116 alright cool
I feel like they're kicking this up
quite a bit so we've basically been
working only with pure JavaScript which
isn't typically what you'll do you'll
have a lot of HTML and CSS and things
like this
open main Jai yes so let's go ahead and
open up our Jas file we're gonna learn
when an alert deniz alert is something
that you probably won't use a lot of
times but it's basically a pop-up window
that comes up when the alert is called
gonna run that you may not see it in
here because of the way this is I
probably have a pop-up blocker blocking
it also so but that's basically what it
does a little pop-up this is a hello
until you click OK so we're gonna jump
back in to the index dot HTML oh it
looks like we haven't linked to it so
we're gonna write a script tag before
the closing body tag it looks like they
want us to use the script X so this
right here this is basically linking
your JavaScript file to your HTML file
we're gonna go ahead and throw it looks
like they wants to run it at the end so
we're go ahead and run that so now you
there is our alert right here so
everything's working it wasn't working
before because we haven't linked the
file so there's our pop-up
there it is again so a lot of times in
JavaScript or jQuery you'll be targeting
IDs and classes if you're not familiar
with HTML it may be a good time to
actually take a minute go take the HTML
course and then just come back and
finish this last section or some of this
may not make complete sense so it's like
index.html there's a div with the class
scale set so this is a class that is in
the CSS that defines this let's select
this element with the JavaScript so
we're gonna go ahead and open up our
main j/s one more time yeah so we want
to go ahead and say doc do we want start
an element or a merkin so we're getting
rid of the alert thank goodness and then
create a variable named skill set so
we're gonna create a variable and we're
gonna actually name it same thing skill
set and we want to set an equal to
document dot get element by class and
then in here we put the name of that
which happens to be skill set so we're
targeting this div right now we're
basically saying it's equal to two this
class we're targeting the class I should
say of which that div seems for you what
did I do wrong
oh my class name excuse me
forgot the name aspect there we go
wait
didn't mean dot J yes it's lethal alert
you wrote then create a variable
skillset I study equal to HTML it was
the class skillset document dot get
element by ID excuse me I've been doing
a lot jQuery so these little little
class names are a lot easier in jQuery
in which you just target this and you're
good to go so I you know I forget the s
elements since the element under
skillset we're gonna set an alert that's
going to be equal to that Muriel's
pop-up so this is an example of how we
might use this so we're gonna say look
in our alert we now want you to display
our skill set class that we're defining
here so you see we have a object
htmlcollection pretty cool
it's basically an object in our
JavaScript that's equal to the HTML
stuff well probably typically you would
never I can't imagine a world in which
you would want to just display this but
more so think of it abstractly this is
us working with the Dom the dog document
object model basically an interaction
between the HTML the CSS and the
JavaScript now we're gonna get an
introduction to jQuery jQuery is a
JavaScript library that basically is a
lot of shorthand javascript and makes
things a lot more dynamic and easy
especially on an entry level sort of
course like this so we're gonna go ahead
and throw this at the bottom here let's
go ahead and okay run
looks like that didn't load was he keep
getting rid of my script there we go I
wanted us to throw up before our main je
s all right now that we've included
jQuery let's go ahead and return to our
main jeaious delete our common out your
existing code then write a function
named main alright so we were gonna get
rid of this then we're gonna write a
function I should take premium no
parameter should I'm an empty block all
right so we're gonna call function and
we're gonna make this main and there's
not gonna be anything in it for the time
being all right
so jQuery the way Jake Oriya works is
you can so you have to ready the
document essentially it basically is
saying this line right here is saying
start running jQuery typically you might
just throw a function in here and not
even create this mean but this is
another way of doing it as well I
wouldn't do it this way I would just hit
ready good but I guess it's just a
matter of preference
so in here we'll load the main so
meaning is the callback function
maintenance the function we're passing
in here
it's basically saying look when the
window main.js file loads this is
basically saying when this loads run
this function as we did the second go
when we get document dot get element by
ID now since we're using jQuery we can
do this in a much shorter way this is
equivalent to this so this is selecting
docket this exact line so we're
selecting this class notice that you
have to include the class dot and the
hash tag for IDs when targeting them
using jQuery so it looks like we're
gonna be doing this is the main function
here all we're gonna do go ahead and we
want to instead target the class using
jQuery and this will be dot skillset and
do we want to name this variable
so this isn't required this right here
but the convention when Target when
storing jQuery variables is to use the
dollar sign in in here so just something
to keep in mind now this is gonna be an
introductory to jQuery there's a whole
jQuery course just on on free code camp
and on code CAD me so make sure you take
a look at that it's definitely gonna be
something you'll probably use quite
often it's it's considered a def a
entry-level skill that pretty much every
web developer should be familiar with
jQuery at the very least alright so here
we just want to call an alert same thing
that we did before so now we're using
jQuery to do it and we're just gonna do
like so I'm just going to run that so
there's our alerting an exact same thing
just a lot of shorthand and much much
easier in my opinion less code to write
so now we're gonna it looks like we're
moving on to some jQuery jQuery built-in
methods and functions inside the main
function we're gonna delete this and
alert that we wrote all right so let's
get rid of that then use jQuery to hide
the skill set element do this where any
selector still set then attaching dot
hide to it with a period all right so
we're just gonna grate a variable here
and we'll we'll call it the same thing
skill set and we're gonna set this equal
to the selector dot skill set
because I'm a little confused about what
they're asking I look out there and it
looks like they just want us to hide
this so dot hide so what this is gonna
do now or do they not want us to store
it in a variable I don't think they want
us turn the very rule okay so we don't
need to store this in a variable so
we're targeting this div which let's go
ahead and pull up our index dot HTML so
this div skillset we're gonna hide this
div now so Broadway move this should be
gone so let's go ahead and run this and
you'll see it's gone our stuff is gone
because we're calling the dot height on
it it still exists in in theory but
you're not gonna be able to see it this
is where how you would hide something
using jQuery we also used a function
called fade in which takes in a
parameter in milliseconds so initially
we wanted to hide and then after it's
hidden we want to go ahead and target
the skill set thing once more and we
want to fade it in so if you want it to
fade in over one second it would be
1,000 so one second is one 1,000
milliseconds let's go ahead and run
you'll see that after it runs you'll see
that fades in go
so certainly make your your HTML a
little more interactive a little more
cooler a little more cooler a little
more interesting let's look let's go
with that
where my glasses all right so now in
jQuery it's a lot easier to use stuff
that when you click something like on
click or on you can target something and
when you click it it does some stuff it
runs some code execute some code
under your existing code in the main
function use jQuery to hide elements
with the class of project so we're gonna
go ahead here and we remember it's a
class so we're projects so that's why
we're using the dot and then we want to
hide it so anything that has the class
projects is going to be hidden so you
see all our projects are gone so now
what we want to do is we want to go
ahead and write some jQuery that says
when you click this run a function that
does some stuff how do we do that we
have a these are our project buttons to
say look when you click this we want you
to do some stuff so these are classes so
we're going to say dot projects - button
dot when you on dot on basically saying
action when this action what's the
action the click action go ahead and run
a function that does some stuff so what
is it that we want to do it looks like
we just want to leave this empty for the
time being
so we haven't actually set it for it to
do anything but it looks like we'll
probably do that in the next example
here so similar to how high works we
hide something the opposite of that
would be show so in this case when you
click are recent projects we want to go
ahead and show our products so that
target the project's class and then dot
show let's go ahead and run this what's
this clears you'll see what we're gonna
click around and nothing's gonna happen
but now when we click this there it is
there is our projects so toggle is
similar in which it will go back and
forth as a toggle should so instead of
show what we want to do is change this
and use the dot toggle so when we run
this we can toggle it back and forth
toggle is actually really important
because you can create a lot of cool
pages with toggle and show and hide and
stuff like that so keep that in mind
when you're like using this develop your
own webpage so next so you can also
toggle a class on and off so let's go
ahead and jump into the CSS again if
you're not too familiar with styling
don't you know don't sweat it
just go ahead and jump into the HTML CSS
courses on free code camp or code Kadim
e and jump on back in so there's a class
called active oh there's not so it looks
like we're gonna create it just go ahead
and throw it up at the top
so you know it's a class by the dot just
going to run that
Oh looks like inside the click function
toggle this class in elements so here's
our alright the class so what we want to
do now is toggle some CSS when we click
on it so we can go ahead and say look
let's try get that and we're gonna save
the dot we won't change the color the
back we won't change the color of our
button so we're going to target that
so that's projects - button dot toggle
was a toggle class I believe at toggle
class and what do we want to toggle we
want to toggle the dot active class
what happened here what did I do oh I
think I forgot this there we go
now let's go ahead and run this and now
once this loads when we click on our
class toggle here projects dash button
let's see let's look at our example oh
it looks like because the class is in
here we don't actually have to denote it
with the dot I apologize for that
there we go and then you'll see that
this is toggling the CSS class every
time we click it
so before what we were doing was we were
setting something that if you click
something we would if you clicked a
projects button there would be some
stuff that would happen so instead what
we want to do is we want to pass in this
so this right here do this run that this
will be the item that you're interacting
with this is the item I'm clicking
choose and you don't need quotations
either because this is a class or
anything like that
this is a built-in it's part of the
document object model cool
so this is the item that we're
interacting with so this is only running
when we click this so it's already it's
inheriting the the idea essentially
so let's go ahead and we can do this
again for projects we can just pass in
this got toggle so projects button is
gonna inherit that this end next to
select these projects untouched this is
next to jQuery is function name next to
help us select elements that are next to
another element if we have this in our
HTML we want to hide item to we could
right so this is gonna hide multiple
things is it next toggle yeah so next
goes first
let's go ahead and do like so sorry I'm
not as familiar with next but
it looks like it's gonna pass on the
value that's what next does alright so
maybe you want to actually change the
text with jQuery that's pretty
straightforward
so within there in our toggle class line
we're gonna write some jQuery checks to
the button mouse click to say projects
viewed so what we can do here is we can
go this dot text and then we'll just go
ahead and output projects viewed so this
will add the text I find it very
interesting that an introductory course
I decided to throw you into jQuery I
definitely feel like if they went
through to make a simple a simpler
version of their jQuery course so you
see right here projects viewed previous
projects viewed everything's changing
very interesting though that they've
decided to do that
so there's also slide toggle you'll see
that a lot of these things make your
website very very interactive so it
wants us to get rid of this line of code
let's go ahead and comment it out two
slashes and select the project's element
all right so we want to target the
projects and we go ahead and do dot
projects and then you slide toggle dot
slide toggle and we're gonna go ahead
and pass in some milliseconds just go
ahead and run that see if we did that
correctly here a second love let's see
what I did incorrectly here
so we want to utilize this to get the
element that was clicked all right so
then use next to get the project's
element alright so that next projects
dot slide toggle just go I think that's
what they wanted although I think it
inherits it directly so let's let's go
ahead and try this one second there you
think that'll do it
so saying this done next slide toggle
and now when we click you see how it's
going a little bit slower there another
cool feature that you can add a lot of a
lot of stuff so what did we learn in
this introductory course learn
JavaScript a lot of cool stuff we
learned a little bit about jQuery we
learned a little about how to connect
your HTML and CSS we also learned about
several of jQuery functions such as
show/hide slide toggle next I'm after
review we also learned how to start with
document dot ready and running the main
function in it or creating a function
but I hope you guys found this helpful
from here if you're looking for stuff to
do I would suggest doing the code
Academy course HTML CSS I would then
suggest jumping into the JavaScript
course that's not the introductory
version and then I would suggest once
you're done with that
moving on to free code camp and that
will definitely take you up to the next
level so if you're still struggling to
code Kadri stuff it may take you a
minute to be comfortable in the free
code camp stuff but it will definitely
be worth it as always thank you for
