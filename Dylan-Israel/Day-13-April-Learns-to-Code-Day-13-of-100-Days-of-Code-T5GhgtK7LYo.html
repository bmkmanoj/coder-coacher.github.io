you're gonna go down right now I hope
you feel like you're gonna get a good
night's sleep because that ain't
happening
all right so excuse you stop the stop
stop it there are n what's wrong
with you yeah oh my god this is fancy
all right crazy person um so what have
you been doing for the last day or so
get everybody caught up with let's weigh
your issues are and what you've been
working on they can't see me good just
the portfolio page and the note I know
we finished JavaScript but I'm still
going over everything myself I'm still
trying to catch up um Dylan wants me to
focus on the portfolio page which has
been kind of like a mental block for me
because well he kind of held me right
now go foolish because he was just like
oh why don't you just do this this and
this and this I'm like deal I could have
broken that up too so um gonna get that
done fortunately it's all stuff I
already know how to do so um hopefully
having him help me break it up I think
what was was I couldn't really think of
that myself because when I was looking
at the code for the example page I would
got really into nated very quickly with
all the JavaScript and all the other
coding that was there so I think they
let that overwhelm me
so fortunately or unfortunately anyways
I'm back on track
my portfolio so hopefully I'll have that
done a little bit and for studying at
least I'm happy that I'm doing it on my
own or you can read it understand what
the hell they're saying and you know
type in what they're asking me to
without because before for like the
first six days I was having to watch the
videos see the answer then go back and
try to understand what the hell they're
saying I keep doing that so finally now
I'm able to read it do it and then look
at the video go yep I got it hear it
again and fully digest it so that's what
I've been doing um really boring I'm
going crazy getting annoyed a little
bored but it's okay cuz today we're
starting something new and I'm really
scared of it so um so today is an
interesting day because I'm not quite
sure where to go from here
uh because I was I was hoping that you'd
have the portfolio done at this point
and we were my god you're so ambitious
of me oh you should've told me yeah so
that's what I was hoping that's kind of
thrown off my game plan so um like it
was who's this two months that's
somebody somebody else from earlier yeah
still about two months
who uh I think I should have a good
basic build up within this week I just I
just had like a mental block okay well
that's why I'm here to help ya
all right um I'm trying to think what we
should thank a God when I can't keep up
with us either so I'm trying to think if
we should jump in to hang all this
monkey thanks again for the book all
right so you've already start studying
HTML CSS um good / front-end libraries
but are you using bootstrap in your
portfolio at all well they have me look
put default for bootstrap so I don't
know let's go over bootstrap why not I'm
hesitant to go over bootstrap because
I'm bad at CSS because I use bootstrap
too much you're bad at CSS because I use
bootstrap classes which are the CSS
classes are you cheating CSS
sort of yeah and it's affected me in a
negative manner I don't want you to pick
up my pet habit so that's why I'm a
little bit well here's the catch I'm not
you yeah
um why don't we go into jQuery what's
Jake very so is that part of the mean
stack yeah to degree not really though
Rita says should I learn PowerShell if I
want to become a program it's not a bad
idea
you just get bash or whatever so jQuery
is a library that you use it's a
JavaScript library that you use
hand-in-hand with JavaScript sometimes
and so similar to how bootstrap has
built-in classes remember John has
script had certain functions that were
built in jQuery is a library that you
import and then it allows you to do
certain things easier in JavaScript
because they've built functions to do
that okay
ah but a lot of it is where jQuery
shines is any use JavaScript within
widget what jQuery really does is it's
called Dom manipulation it has the
JavaScript sounds kinky it uh it
basically has a javascript interacts
with the HTML and the CSS jQuery makes
it slightly easier to do that now it's
it's considered kind of an outdated
framework and library but it's so
important that you use it and when you
get started on the projects that
actually do require JavaScript you'll
probably get started with jQuery I'm
hesitant to have you do this though
because I think you really should start
doing the algorithms why don't we um how
about this we're gonna switch spots
today you said day 30 liar
and then I heard you tell that dick 50
so well okay let's just the debugging
thing today so you saw how I was
debugging my code and you're like hey I
don't know how these functions exist and
stuff like that um y-yeah why is jQuery
considered outdated jQuery outdated
might have been the wrong word jQuery is
still has its place but the libraries
and frameworks that you'll be getting
paid money for our angular and react
jQuery is used in a limited case now
it's really only used as a crutch of web
designers I'd say so it's not huh what
say that hurt uh but it's it's also
slower than certain libraries but it's
just your look man you're not gonna get
hired as a web developer only knowing
jQuery is what I'm trying to say umm so
could you get hired as a what is it
called developer or something
what what designer web designer just by
doing like JavaScript web developer so a
web designer would be HTML CSS usually
web developer a front-end web developers
HTML CSS JavaScript but in reality you
need to have HTML CSS JavaScript jQuery
and then angular or react very fine for
friendly to be considered a junior
to put yourself in a situation where you
would land a junior role yes okay so
we're going to be doing the debugging
because this is going to be crucial um
now that your now that we went over the
JavaScript you need to know how to solve
issues in your logic in JavaScript okay
um we have not got to any udemy
resources yet I'm having her work
through free code camp first and then we
eventually will buy so many Deming
courses okay so um debugging is a
valuable and necessary tool for programs
that's a very true statement um
essentially what debugging means is
falling finding errors in your logic and
finding where your code is broken
that's what debugging means I'm
surprised that a computer there isn't a
program that does it for you well
there's things that help you debug but
because the computer can't read your
mind
it can only read your code it doesn't
know what is broken and what's not
broken so it'd be like hey look this
might be the thing that's broken yeah
check it out
and usually that's more syntax so
there's different types of errors when
talking about but the easy ones are the
syntax ones where I misspelled a key
word or I forgot a semicolon or a
bracket those are the easy ones because
the computer will say hey this is
missing or this is incorrect now the
hard ones are logic errors where you
just don't understand or you wrote some
code that you thought you understood and
you have to go find where your brain was
going wrong with
you have to look at someone else's code
and see what that word thing which
you're not as a developer you'll never
have that what why not because your as a
developer you're making a unique web
application and there isn't like hey let
me just copy this web app and see what
they did wrong and even if you're making
a similar product what's going to happen
is you're using different libraries you
have any different take on it
your architectures do yeah so it
couldn't be the same unless it's like
exactly the same yeah you may find a
similar issue that's going on but you
know so debugging is the process of
finding what's wrong with your code and
eventually fixing it debugging some
finding process but so we're talking
here about syntax errors so in this case
well the syntax error that we're being
able to see is you'll see our function
remember at the parenthesis when we have
a function we're missing the closing one
right here so this would be an example
of a syntax error we don't have that
other parenthesis what princess oh yeah
there needs to be a double parenthesis
but yes see we have the opening one but
we don't have the closing one after it
okay so that's a syntax there um a
runtime error this is also referred to
as an infinite loop is uh is when the
basically is just going to crash your
browser because the loop is run
never-ending there's no um nothing to
break that right right that's the word
break right hmm nothing to break us out
of this loop right because it's always
true cuz we don't have anything changing
it right so before the end of that you
would put break
you put break or you would put um yeah
anything else yeah yeah
anything anything that anything but just
true that you don't have a way of
breaking the loop so there's a lot
different ways to break loose but in
this case there's no way set up to break
the loop thus we have an infinite loop
or run timing
um semantic semantic error logic errors
where say you want to calculate the area
of a rectangle in this example it's the
correct way to do that is length times
width or height times width the fine
area of a rectangle but here you did W
plus h or you added the two values so
it's going to be incorrect and so this
is a thank you tomorrow for watching the
stream but this is what is referred to
as a semantic error or a logic error
these are the hardest of all the years
because you have to find out where
you're wrong the other one this is kind
of like a logic error this is just a
special one because the infinite loop
here your code actually runs it does
something and deal just not getting our
damn thing
exactly um so this is free code camps
right on debugging is frustrating at
times uh sounds exciting
um and so the section that we're about
to do is going to cover a lot of
different tools that are used in
debugging and the ways that you can find
those semantic errors those runtime here
is those syntax errors so that's what
this section is going to be about so you
saw me do it already when we were
debugging so some of these things may be
familiar where if you want to see what
the value is so a lot maybe maybe you're
getting incorrect value needed you need
to trace your steps so anywhere that
object is added you want to print that
value in its current iteration so
console.log right here some B is going
to return in the browser in the console
what that value is okay
so right here what we want to see my
console dot log the value of a and then
if we go inspect over here so a is five
here right and then we're doing a plus
plus a plus plus so we want to see hey I
want to make sure this is right
so let's make sure we're adding one to a
and we run it you'll see that we are so
you see the six that's all right so
you're really not adding value really
having six in this case yet because
we're adding 1 to it but one way that we
can print out the value of things is
with console.log to see that
there's also the type of function this
will tell us what type like maybe you
need that maybe you're getting your hair
and you don't know why it could be that
you're trying to add a number with a
string and your codes are set up to work
like that or whatever the case may be
you're doing a triple equals and the
types wrong so it's failing so maybe you
want to check what the type of it is you
can do that you just go back and look
well you could but things are getting
very complicated very quickly in
software and so this is one way that you
could check the type of maybe maybe you
have something in your code where you
want to only add it if the type of it's
equal to a string or it's equal to a
number or it's a boolean I think there's
different things that you may want to
know what the type of it is no but okay
I'll just accepting I just get like why
can't you just go back and look but I
can understand if you have like 50,000
lines of code and you're like where do I
go back to look uh I mean this this is
just one you I don't want your tools to
help you debug yeah buddy
come on
hi
so here we're gonna also that log how
frequently do you find yourself in
debugging mode I work every day
good question time the same one okay add
to console log students to check their
oops so check the type of each two
variables seven and three I forgot one
so here what this is going to return is
the which would be number and then we're
going to tell you number it'll tell you
number in Council which type of ring of
three would be string weird well if you
can't season them how do you get the
type of that what do you mean like you
can see seven two three the variables
yes yeah you can see them what if the
code is so big you don't know what
you're looking for so how would you do
type of it you'll always notice coats
there now why would you need okay well
you well part of debugging is finding
out where your problem is also in this
you may start in one section and it may
be a thousand lines below depending on
how the codes connected I still don't
see how this is useful if you already
see the code why do you need to know
course it's because I can see that it's
a seven okay but it's not going to be
this simple what may happen is that
seven that variable seven it all you're
going to have is that the variable that
you're passing it and it may have jumped
between ten functions and changed here
here here here and here and so instead
of us having to write out that value
every time we can print out the value
and we can find out what the type of it
is so it's going to pull every seven
it's no it's going to pull the one
it's not going to pull anything it's
going to give you the type of seven at
this point in the scope so depending on
where we counsel like if we have
multiples the seven as its passing
through it's going to print out that
value or the the type of seven at that
time did I let's let me give you example
so here what happens when we console.log
seven the type of seven out when when we
print this out what's the value that
it's printing out is it not very good so
now imagine that we did this 10
times in the background where we did we
did true so seven when we console-like
seven again type of seven now he jumped
around it's not on one screen it's not
right here it's jumped around ten
different functions because this calls
this that calls this that calls this
that calls this sometimes it calls this
one because we have an if statement
sometimes it calls that one it ran
thirty times here and so now in this
case a very simple case it's no longer a
number it is here because we haven't
changed it yet but it isn't here because
now it's a boolean
because we're overriding the value okay
so what I guess I don't understand the
question
okay okay so now seven is a bullion
yes and I say and I'm trying to find out
what type of value it is so if I is a
type of seven and I don't get anything
back then what that's gonna help me know
that it's not a seven yeah so if you say
type of seven right here and it returns
undefined it means that somewhere you
didn't set your variable equal to what
it needs to be or some somewhere in your
logic something broke and or maybe you
were okay so if you're in a scope and
you need to make sure that your seven
stays a number seven all the way through
it and when you console.log type of
seven and it doesn't come back as a
number you know that there's something
that's happen yeah that you're on the
right path but now you got to go back
and so this is one of the tools that you
can do nothing
um okay
so here you'll see that you're normally
not going to get something like this
saying receivables are not fine but what
may happen in your in your text editor
is it will look for this variable and it
will underline it and say you have not
defined this variable anywhere this is
what's known as a syntax error hmm
wouldn't you put something in there like
that as a placeholder what do you mean
as a place to learn what do you mean
what I need is a full affair
can't you put like things down as
placeholders you're talking about um I
think you're talking about a function
that has a parameter maybe and they that
that parameter you pull out and it's you
call the function and that parameter
goes in there no it's not defined it's
just a hole the place for a future value
later I think you're talking about
functions I mean you're looking for you
yeah but in this in this instance like
Dylan I daughter taught you I in this in
this sucessful okay
okay so in this instance there is no
payable placeholder right because
there's payables but because we put the
ass on it the computer doesn't know what
payable is you know what it knows what
that payables is plural so this would be
an example of where maybe in our ID it
would be underlined because this doesn't
exist okay so would you have to go back
to that line of code or could you like
put something to correct it
yeah so we would just go and we put ass
on it to fix it
function throwing his llamas no why
would we do that why would we write a
function for an error in our code know
it to fix the error in the code no no it
doesn't know the only the only help
you'll get is something in the in the
text editor showcasing you that there's
a mistake all right
I see this is not defined and so like
right here you'll see that this so now
control-c escape it do that like so no
so I'm the worst with ease and eyes so
now I said I before E except for every
other time like it it's like this
stupidest thing in my life okay so here
you'll see that this is pretty common
you'll see that we're missing something
and then free code camps idea gives us
some hints and in your idea it might as
well so so we'll see we'll see that so
like what's wrong with my array look at
my array it's say hey there's something
wrong on the slide it shouldn't be my R
mm-hmm it's just a variable I decided to
me my art no no I can't even say it
no does it have to be wet isn't it
supposed to be like aa bar
um this is es6 same same thing though
for the sake of this for right now so I
imagine those lights are bars there's
I'm not yes they're the let's our es6
they're not okay
do you all know what the differences
we'll dive into the difference of this
so variables deal in what's called
function scope so if I say I have a
variable that's the third line and I
only plan on it running in my for loop
for instance I can actually use it
everywhere down below even though I
don't have any plans to use it down
below outside of the for loop that's
because it's it's it the scope of the
variables are in the function scope so
it gets raised to anywhere in that
function basically and let only runs
what's called block scope so it only
runs in that little block of code and so
let is a tighter way of using variables
essentially is it same sort of thing
so it's not replacing it's just another
way to write it correct it it has a
tighter scope than variable varsa
variables they're all variables but
there's our there's let and then there's
Const stands for constant which means
that you can't really it doesn't mean
that you can't change the value but it
partially means that but don't worry
about that all right so how do we fix
and mind you same thing with variables
we can name these things anything they
want as long as it's not a keyword
that's built into the language so how do
we fix the array here that it says hey
it there's something wrong with this
array how do we fix it oh there's
no bracket that's right so we throw our
bracket in there that's fixed so how do
we fix there's missing uh what is called
parentheses parentheses yeah I want to
say paragraph I'm like I know that
paragraph and there we go we fix the
brackets braces and quotes here I've
already been doing that my good little
that I've been writing oh you're just
plus the current because it's missing a
piece because you fix the missing piece
of the array I thought we did my rate up
reduce maybe it needs to be previous
oh maybe we're using this is kind of
interesting that they're using es6 in
here there's really trying to hammer it
in instead of focusing them as just
being complete debugging previous is not
fine after all right so what's happening
here is have to look up with these
jaakor function real quick so this is
mdn mozilla and developer network yeah
huh
are you saying this was new not new but
this is a another resource that you can
use to get better so here we see that we
have what's called a callback function
hello from Surya a Wow so what's missing
here is we're actually just missing this
more function and then in here account
value return again
so that was where I'm sick was a thing
there you go there's that I'm so going
to pull up the documentation one more
time so we have our function pull it
over here so I can look at it so
function that's correct
yes
literature previous plus current Oh God
this this all up
alright I'm gonna skip this one we could
jump around in it but I think we'd be
jumping into callback functions yet so
like there's a lot of stuff going on in
that I don't want to begin to try and
explain callback books it's right now so
we're just going to skip that little
section right there hopefully there's no
more callback functions moving forward
and debugging
okay so we're jump into this so remember
there's a whole bunch of things that you
alright we're stopping here with
debugging because I don't I don't we're
getting we're getting into advanced
stuff let me let me look at this real
quick I'm gonna look at something see if
there's any good ones in here to go over
because I don't want to confuse you this
is pretty simple this is the assignment
operator over the equals so you can't
assign anything in an if statement you
can only compare things so here to fix
this one we put equal and we'd be good
okay um I'm surprised they don't throw
debugger in here
I'm gonna report a bug real quick I
think I should I don't know if if this
counts us this isn't count as a bug
welcome Jim
okay so I'm going to show you something
that they're not covering right now for
debugging um let's go to code panel
shows so there's this thing called
debugger and let's say you want to
because it's all about finding a point
in time where your code is bugging out
where you're having issues and so you
could go through and you can console.log
that stuff but sometimes you just want
to you can you can just pause the code
at that specific point when your code
hits it interests and we mean when the
codes running and it goes to where that
is so in this case if we were to and the
debugger only runs if you have the
inspector open that's the only time that
it works it's part of it but let's say
here we throw a debugger we saved it and
now you see our debugger hit when our
code runs our it's pausing right here
now it doesn't do anything but our code
is right here you can see it in our PJs
now what we can do is say we're not sure
our Ajax say say we're not sure this
code is running here we can use debugger
and
so say instead of console logging the
value of data 1/1 throw a debugger here
so if it if it hits that let's go ahead
and refresh the page so hit our debugger
right here so what we can do in our
console look at the bottom here and I'm
going to move this around so people who
are watching the video can see it it's
right in the very bottom if you guys see
right here in our console what we can do
is we can call the variables that are
local to that so we can call that data
one object and we're data one is and we
can see what that what it looks like in
this case it's links free code camp and
stuff like that so we know it exists we
know the value of it and we can check it
so you can use debugger as another way
of checking your variables and checking
to see that your code is actually
getting called because you may be
assuming hey it actually gets hit here
but you could console-like value there
to make sure that it's going to hit or
that it's the correct value or you can
throw a debugger and just check multiple
ones like that um that might be a little
all right Oh Rose I so that's a little
bit about debugging it went is a little
more advanced in there than I thought it
was going to be - the the debugger stuff
that they added right now we're really
at the point where you are need to go in
two different directions one you need to
finish up your portfolio challenge
yourself with the HTML and the CSS and
two you need to start once you finish
that you need to move on into the
algorithms and this is going to be the
hardest part for you to getting started
I guess a new course we need to get into
the algorithms here this is going to be
where you're going to really train your
brain retrain your brain to think like a
developer this is going to be the
hardest part and I encourage you to use
white boards and everything you're going
to read these instructions you have to
comprehend them and so let's talk about
how you got like an example how you
would solve this so I'm like actually
writing code but in here now gorilla is
essentially logic that it's going to run
in your function that accomplishes a
certain task in this case we want to
reverse a string string is just words
and
that is a massive hint so that it's they
give you a little bit of a hint you may
need to turn the string into an array
before you can reverse it that's a hint
so for you what would you need to do in
that what if you were to break this up
into pieces for you to understand no it
is a string remember it look we're
passing a string it this is our STR we
need to figure out how to turn the
string into a right and then we need to
find out how to reverse it so one thing
that I would encourage you to get
familiar with our array functions
JavaScript so that you know what's in
the library and you can do that at w3
schools if you want and kind of see it
play out so we have JavaScript arrays so
right properties a length is alt your
remember length tells us what it is now
we have the array methods what does
concat do what is copy within do what
does every do what is phil do what is
filter do what is fine do let us find
index view was for each - what does
index up do go through all of these and
see what they do and understand them you
can read this but you know we talked
about pop we talked about push there's a
lot more on here and these are things
that you're going to need to find out
such as you need to find out what they
all do in order to Hulya this is just
array
there's also string there's also num
number so it before you get started on
the on the algorithm so what I want you
to do is I want you to know it
looks like our internet got today
I want you to go in and see the array
the boolean the math the number and the
string functions and play around in it
so like in concat what's great about w3
schools you can
usually see it usually so click the
button join two arrays if I click try it
joins these arrays so if I'm like oh I'm
not sure what this what it's supposed to
do let's go ahead and remove loan and we
can kind of play around with it to see
what happened and what's supposed to
happen is this supposed to join the two
arrays so we run it again Oh a tip
around here sorry we run it again you'll
see it adds our two arrays together so
that's what join does in its most basic
version but you need to know what it all
does in its most basic version go down
so that you can fully understand how to
move forward okay so it's kind of like
what I wanted to do with the vocabulary
oh yeah kind of you're gonna learn what
actually exists in um JavaScript
essentially okay so I'm going to we're
going to end today early so that you can
get back to working on your stuff and
tomorrow I'm going to have some stuff
planned my my goal is for you to split
spend some time on the portfolio and but
really dive into the JavaScript stuff
because that's that's going to be the
bread and butter web development all
right so we're going to literally won't
say buy some code fights code fights are
too is too early for her to do code
fight sounds vicious let's see I'll show
you what code fights are I don't I don't
think you'd be ready for code fight um
so
let's log in real quick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
