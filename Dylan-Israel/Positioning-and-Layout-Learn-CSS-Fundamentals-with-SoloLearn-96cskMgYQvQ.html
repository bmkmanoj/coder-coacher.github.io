and see s s also learned position mean
and layout I'm gonna learn a lot about
this I always get all this stuff sort of
confused so I apologize if I'm not super
n't at and wear my glasses all right I
guess well I'll just do a blind today so
display:block basically creates treats
everything as a block object so you'll
see here one's a dumb to the other
building blocks I did this it does a
split what value display property makes
the inline element act as a blocking
level element block cool and then
display:inline you kind of as you can
imagine they all align in line just
going to read this a little bit setting
the display property of an element only
changes how the element is displayed not
what kind of element it is so an inline
element with display block it's not
allowed to have other block elements
inside of it okay
so if you want a block element display
inline we would put display inline as so
we'll do this lot with like menus and
list items and things like that as well
the text will not display and as we
display none hides an element so it does
not take up any space
got it so basically hides it make the
element with the ID in my style
disappear so if we don't want to see my
cell anymore display:none and this an
angular if you use angular there's a ng
hide this is what this is doing in the
angular it's basically just hiding the
the data when ng-hide is true on a side
note the visibility property you have
hidden invisible so this is a heading
the space of other sphere is empty
because the visibility of the div is set
to hit it so you can hide things as well
so the main difference between
display:none and visibility hidden is
that it still has the it still withholds
the space meanwhile meanwhile meanwhile
the other one doesn't
oops I meant to hit hidden and visible
visible and hidden are the main two
properties of visibility probably should
just be true or false be a little bit
easier positioning elements I guess you
can add to it later on so that might be
why they don't do something like that
also CSS doesn't use boolean so maybe
I'm just a moron but that that's how I
think of it position static so elements
can be positioned using the top bottom
left and right properties however these
properties will not work unless the
position property is set first cool
a little a little final fantasy for you
there
um paragraph with no fish this paragraph
has static positions so you'll see here
right here you've said that static
you've also said top 30 pixels right
five pixels color red alright why static
value using to make that element to make
the element run in the natural order of
the page to make that element huh static
let's review static a little bit more
position static by default control the
normal flow not to make them up
unmovable but to run in the natural
order of the page position fix will make
them unmovable so this is fixed position
elements are removed from the normal
flow of your document and have fixed
position elements can overlap other
elements okay so you're like hard
setting it so that it always is there so
we're gonna do position fix here we're
gonna have the top be hundred pixels and
the pixels from the left on the left
here like so pretty cool so relative
positioning let's read the definition of
that the content of relative position
elements can be moved and overlap other
elements but the reserve space from the
element is still reserved in the normal
flow so basically you move it to a
relative spot you basically move it to a
spot but it'll still kind of adjust
everything else about it an absolute
position is position relative to the
first parent element absolute position
elements are removed from normal flow
and can overlap other elements all right
was the purpose relative value if it's
the element relative to the containing
block but sout rezidentura flow
it's that element relatives with the
browser window no it's fun of these I
don't so it still contains the normal
flow which is what's confusing me which
may be why I got this wrong yeah alright
so I thought I might be answering that
wrong cuz it puts it but it still flows
with the normal flow of the HTML
document now floating is do you float
something to the right meaning it goes
to the right or floats it to left so for
instance this image is floated to the
right with all the text on to the left
of it
so you can float something to the right
and the left I think that's it
yeah elements next to each other set the
width and its place flowing several
elements one or the other phone next to
each other if there's enough room so we
float one to the left
flow another one to the left I'm not
sure how they knows which one to float I
guess it goes in the order of the flow
of the document so the property along
with float is use example to make the
elements float side by side so you have
the width as well and then the clear
property okay it's been a while since
I've touched a clear property let's
review this I use this recently to fix
of CSS issues the clear property
specifies the sides of an element where
other floating elements are not allowed
to be so in float right so we float
right here you basically would have the
clear property which would then allow
tell like look man only only I can be
here or you need to be X amount of
pixels away
if there's an element with the float
property which elements will be affected
the ones coming after that element the
ones coming before out that element I
believe let's see if I flip that it's
gonna be the ones coming before that
element huh because it could be either
that's why I'm a little confused yeah
let's go back and review a little bit
elements that come after the floating
element will revolve around it okay that
makes more sense because like yeah
alright so it floats around it the ones
that are coming after okay use of values
right left or both the stress lives
where other floating elements are not
allowed to be okay probably none here
although let's go back and review I
don't right left and those oh they
already had none whoops I didn't see
both okay so there's both both is used
to clear floats coming from either
direction so maybe you don't want things
floating you can use both saying look
don't float anything around me the clear
properties use reset settings of the
webpage clicks I'll select clear browser
cache take an element off the floating
group there we go
and finally the overflow property so
what do you do when things are
overflowing as discussed earlier every
element on the page is a box sometimes
that box overflows if the height of the
box is not set the height of the box
will grow as large as necessary to
accommodate the content so you see our
div here we have various colors like so
the CSS over flow properties specifies
the behavior that occurs when an
elements content overflows the elements
box all right
there are four values for the overflow
property visible the default scroll
hidden and auto so if you want to create
a scroll bar like this it's pretty
simple using overflow fill in the blanks
for horizontal and vertical lines oh
let's go back let's go back real quick
and there's scroll hidden in Auto I
guess scroll Scroll does both I was a
sure scroll did both they're not but so
we're gonna set our overflow property
here and scroll is going to allow us to
create a vertical and horizontal line if
there's any overflow so you're more than
likely use overflow hidden where it just
cuts it off like so although not always
so you're really just sub pencil when
you're using so I believe it's Auto
always an auto huh Auto is overflowing
clipped
overflow the default value overflow
property is visible okay cool
and the z-index property is z-index so
just how like imagine a graph you have
an X which is horizontal Y which is
vertical z is kind of the order of
positioning right so you could kind of
quate it to a height like which one goes
on top of the other that's basically
what the Z index does like so so red
here has a Z index it doesn't have any Z
index all right so basically right now
this is the red is overlaying the blue
because it was placed later in the HTML
document but if we want to change that
which is used as the amp index the last
element will overlap by default and then
you can assign a z-index property so
maybe we wanted blue to show up it would
overlap that thing to keep in mind the
higher the number the priority the
higher the priority it's not like 1 is
greater than 2 because that should
always be the first of all in the stack
note n is greater than 1 and therefore
10 will show up above 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
and then 10 so one thing to keep in mind
only works on position elements that
means absolute relative or fixed
cool all right let's do this quiz if you
have a negative value to the top
property which direction will it be
moved will be moved down what really Oh
No cuz top pushes you push away from the
top whoops
little brain freeze gonna move up when
the flow property is used with the
values of left or right anything else
that lives in the containing element
will be moved down flow around the
element with the flow property cool when
the text needs more space in the
dimensions of the Brock's
the browser show scrolls for the
overflow property with the values of
scroll and I believe it was display no
position when the text needs more space
in the dimensions of the Box the browser
show Scrolls
it's overflow properties with the values
the scroll and width no oh shit what am
I think so the overflow property would
have been scroll and I just get a hint
guys let's see here
Auto there we go all right a little hint
assign the width of a 500 pixels to the
text element and enable fixed scrollbar
so if we want to do that we're gonna put
scroll here for overflow and we're just
going to assign 500 px so if the width
or the height is greater than 500 and
200 thus it's going to give us our
scrollbar that we want fill in the
blanks to make the blue box disappear
from the page so we're gonna do fixed
absolute and we're gonna do display:none
sit oh excuse me
display weight position why did I do
typing fix this position there we go
cool so you saw me stutter step on a
couple of these granny I have mentioned
that CSS is not my strong suit I'm
trying to get better which is why I'm
doing this slow of course I hope you
