doing is lucky in the intro section
we'll be doing this in JavaScript as
always now what is the objective here
well we need to write an algorithm that
is going to find out if when we add the
first half of the numbers the in this
case you can see we have 1 2 3 0 if it
is equal to the second half of the
numbers so you'll see here that we have
1 2 is equal to 3 and 3 0 equals 3 thus
it is a lucky number and we need to
figure out a way to do that I did it in
a interesting way I would say but what I
did what I did was I converted it to a
string I I reduced I made it into an
array I then reduced the array after
parsing the int on each half and then I
compared the values that's what I did to
do it so let me show you what I'm
talking about so and it's the number
coming in it is 12:30 for instance first
thing I did was I convert it to strings
so I say m dot 2 string the next thing
that I did was I found out what the
halfway point was for that string so
we'll create a let half equal to and
length divided by 2 in this case we know
that everything is an even number
because of the instructions here so we
don't need to do any additional logic
this will this will work just fine it's
always going to be a whole number
because the speak even number now next
part I'm going to chain a lot of things
together but we'll go piece by piece as
we explained so we'll call this the
first half and with the first half is
going to start off is we need it to be a
substring starting at the zero point and
going up to the halfway point meaning
that we want half of the
drink and we'll go ahead and return
first half we can check piece by piece
everything's going so you'll see we have
two three nine of this right here the
strength the next thing that I did was I
made it into an array and then I reduced
those values so so let's try that so you
make it into a right by calling just
split I'm going to save or run our test
so we should have an array of 239 you'll
see here 239 very nice
the next step is reducing those values
using the array function reduce a comma
B what we want to do here is return a
plus B now this isn't going to work
because we need it to actually parse it
as a integer we need to get that in tell
you and treat it as an int so we can use
parse it otherwise it's just going to
concatenate the strings back together
not actually add the values together so
now when we run our test here you'll see
that 2 3 9 that's 12 plus 2 is 14 so
everything's working perfectly so far
now we're just going to copy this and
we're going to duplicate that for the
second half we'll call this second half
and the only difference between this and
the name in here is that where we're
starting for the second half we want to
actually start at the halfway point and
then we want to iterate for the entire
length of our string in and we can go
ahead and test this by calling second
half and run our code so with zero one
seven is eight and we get eight right
here okay last but not least all we have
to do is is compare first app with
second half
and this will return triples and we're
done good it submit real quick so a
interesting solution to to a problem
there's probably a mathematical way to
go about this this was a combination of
string functions and math function and
an array functions to to get the data in
the form I want to compare the first
half of the second half just go over
real quick we convert our enter in here
to a string we get half the length of
that string so that we can find the half
the substring of it which we split into
an array we reduce those values we parse
the int out of them because otherwise
it'll just concatenate the string back
together and then we compare the first
half with the second half to assign out
if it is a lucky number I don't know
anything about lucky numbers I think if
you're playing lottery tickets you're
better off playing poker so that's
that's my two cents on gambling anyhow
