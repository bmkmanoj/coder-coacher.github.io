back in Mann's packages with NPM and we
are in the section let me bring it up we
are in publish again so we just finished
version let's go ahead and open up
publish again so now that we have a new
version of NPM we may want to push it
out which is why you would publish again
I imagine so publishing once it's fine
but healthy packages get published again
again with new and exciting bug fixes
and features right so it's something not
all bugs or features not all future bugs
it's not a bug
I so tell my boss it's not a bug it's an
additional feature that nobody wanted
but all right guys so you can't reuse
the same version number because it's too
confusing for in for obvious reasons and
NPM smart enough to not do that but now
that we've changed the version number in
the last exercise we can now go ahead
and publish our our package and so let's
go ahead and do that when does your NPM
publish and you'll see that it's now you
see this change right here are at 1.0.1
instead of 1.0 2.0 and now when we go to
how to - verify or how to NPM verify
we'll be done with this this challenge
now what to take away from this is that
you need you can only publish things I
have new version numbers you can only
make versions with new version numbers
um but uh you're gonna be publishing
updates to hopefully if you have a
something you're passionate about
passion project whatever it is you're
gonna be making updates here there and
you know kind of like with my videos
when something breaks on my videos the
twitch API is a great example where they
changed the twitch API now the videos I
did no longer work I would then go and I
would do an update video showcasing how
to fix that how to change your code
accordingly and you need to do the same
thing for your packages but um as always
guys thanks for watching don't forget to
Like subscribe to share and support me
