I am a front-end web developer who's
only been coding for 11 months now and I
am currently at the angel hack hackathon
I am on my team the design and somewhat
of the developer but I'm mostly handling
the design today so what were you
expecting day one or the hackathon
because this is like like me this is
also your first act flock yeah I was
expecting us to be a little more a
little faster with our production so a
lot of our time was spent just
discussing what we were gonna do and
actually according to some people it
actually we didn't spend as much time as
some people usually do like I think we
spent like three or four hours but it
felt a little directionless to be honest
even though we had been talking about it
for weeks I mean met up prior to that so
coming into that I had a very clear goal
and it was basically for me just to be
here okay good I think what was kind of
beer ball did you want a finished
product do you just want the experience
what what was the overall like this is
what I want to accomplish with my time
here yeah it was wholeheartedly just for
the experience alone but being here it's
evolved into this competitiveness looked
like a part of me really just wants to
win but yeah initially it was just like
someone in our group called la coders
was just like hey we should've joined a
hackathon and we got a whole team of
people we actually had two teams or some
people yeah two teams worth of people
come in so it's really cool just being
here with all of our friends you know
and just working together so if just the
experience of being with people you know
we work with often and working together
cohesively is really cool
what would you change what's how you
kind of tackle because for me there's a
couple things I would change one I would
have done no thinking about ideas for
hand because it's kind of limited what
we're trying to do now with the API
integration is there anything that you
would have changed how do you kind of
tackle the whole process I think I'm on
the opposing hand of what you just said
I would have thought more creatively
about it I think we were just kind of
stuck in the scope of okay well let's do
something good for people and we didn't
think of things to do that we're like
unconventional and just even talking to
some of the groups here some of the
ideas that came up whether they're super
creative so that's not one work one
regret I just wish that we kind of
thought more out of the box though I
really like our product which is an
educational app for kids to learn
finance concepts that's cool you know
but I feel like there are just so many
worldly issues that you could tackle and
no one like even cares to try so that
would be something I would change
differently just to think about other
kinds of issues that most people don't
really touch are you going to another
one hell yeah
like though it's like such a tiger
inning experience like a hectare I
literally slept for three hours and that
was three hours too long this is just so
much fun and Loki Loki go to hackathons
for the food I spent 10 bucks and I got
five meals one of which was like a
salmon dinner this is my six right cool
yeah
multiple things that cost a lot yeah
yeah I got two shirts as well yeah you
got to get your shirt like overall I
think the cost of what I've consumed
and have taken from this place is well
over $50 but that's not the primary
reason but the more primary reason is
that yeah just it's so much fun and I
like just being in a group of coders and
making an awesome project together great
experience too I really having fun I
don't know if I could speak for everyone
though but I love it I just don't know
when the cns I'll do it will be it's
kind of like I say I would be willing to
do one like once every two months like I
think that gives me enough like this it
is a draining whole take whole weekend
it's kind of like going wild and just
getting my face for it not for like
a 36-hour period yes and then being like
 I don't think they do that for a
while yeah it feels like that it feels
like this is the Burning Man for
programmers like we just kind of camp
out and eat weird things and consume
things that aren't quite healthy for us
like eight Red Bulls in two days I have
a tiny Channel right now where I teach
some JavaScript programming if you're
interested I don't know what is my
channel I think it's my my name of
everything I was looking myself in I
don't know my youtube channel but Dillon
could make a pop-up box appear right
here where my hand is and that will link
