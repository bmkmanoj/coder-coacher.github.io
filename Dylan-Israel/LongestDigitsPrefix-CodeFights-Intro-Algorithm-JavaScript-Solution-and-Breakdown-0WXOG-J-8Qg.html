in the arcade the intro dark wilderness
launched it longest digits prefix quite
a bit to say what I did for this one was
I created a digital let's talk about
what it's asking you wants us to get the
prefix of the substring the start of a
string that is a substring is a prefix
so they want to find that in this case 1
2 3 would be the longest prefix start
with the way that I did it was I created
a digits array that stores in a string
version of all available digits from 0
to 1 to 0 to 9 rather
so after I did that my hands are kind of
achy today so I might detect a little
bit slower guys apologize for that after
I did that with our input string that
we've done which is in this case 1 2 3
AAA 1 I just went ahead and I broke that
up into an array of characters using the
split function now the next thing that I
did was I I created a array that I
called prefix which will be what we're
going to push the digits to where first
we're going to start by innovating
through the for loop and then after that
you're going to check each value up
until we hit our if statement so our if
statement is going to say hey if digits
dot includes includes will return back a
true or false value if that value is in
our digits right so if it includes this
current number this current letter which
is a string number right if it includes
a 1 a 2 a 3 all the way is 9 great but
if it's equal to false we want to go
ahead and break our for loop because
we're done with what what we have to do
here so we're going to break now if it
doesn't hit that it must be true
and those we're going to push the
current letter or the current character
that we're on that number a string
number and at the end here in our return
statement all we're going to do is we're
going to root before we do anything we
show our prefix to show that everything
works you'll see that it's going to be
pushing oops
of course don't forget your equal sign
one two three
you see right here one two three that's
are those are all the characters stops
right there
so our logic is right all we have left
to do is join it back into a single
string and we are done
this one not too bad there's probably
not probably there is a regular
expression to do all this I just feel
like doing it so I wrote this if you
have a better way I encourage you guys
always to share your solution not
necessarily for my benefit always but
for mine and everybody's who's watching
this videos trying to get better trying
to maybe think more like a developer if
they click programmer and kind of
analyze these situations for multiple
angles but as all these guys thank you
so much for watching don't forget to
comment like subscribe share check out
our Facebook page our discord channel in
my patreon if you want to support and
I'll see you guys next time hey guys
thanks for watching the video special
thanks to our sponsors dev Mountain if
you're looking for a coding boot camp
where tuition and housing is included
definitely check them out
appreciate it I'll see you guys in the
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
