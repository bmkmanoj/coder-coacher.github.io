learning HTML and CSS part 1 images
adding images let's go ahead and jump
right in this should be a good section
obviously images are very important part
of your website and things like that
let's go ahead and jump right in and see
what we can do here so we've kind of
messed around a little bit with images
before showing how to add them and
whatnot now we're gonna go ahead and
change something so that's what right
now apparently these images are too big
so how are we gonna fix this well in our
CSS let's go ahead and find our project
IMG here we are we want to go ahead
we're basically saying for the product
class where there's an image we want to
set the width equal to 100% now let's go
and run this you'll notice now that
these it's taking the way say look only
accept it to the hundred percent of the
content box and now we're able to change
our images to dynamically change based
off the size that we have available
let's see it so you'll see how they're
kind of scaling a little bit but they're
never going outside the box
now you'll see that sorry it's talking
about some other stuff take a second to
read over this it mentions display:block
as well and the margin property and
float so we'll probably be using those
right now now let's go ahead and add a
background image so you see how we have
all this is all blank we want to add a
background image to our cover ID to do
that it's simply a background - image
property here and then we're gonna pass
in the URL like so there's an example
here and then within it let's go ahead
and copy this you're gonna need to put
quotes in here so don't forget to do
that just go ahead and run this and now
we have a background image for that ID
so there's a couple things you can do
here although no-repeat is probably the
most likely one that you'll you'll be
doing you can actually repeat the
background especially if it's smaller we
don't want it to repeat so we don't want
this image to repeat regardless of of
the size of the page to do that we can
go ahead and put the repeat and then no
in the background - repeat and put no
repeat or no - repeat rather so let's go
ahead and do that so we have background
- repeat no - repeat now if you have
like a simple tile or something like
that where it's the same throughout
you're gonna probably want to make that
repeat but that that's usually not too
many sites nowadays now you'll see
there's a whole bunch of positioning
that we can do for this you have left
top center top right top all these
definitely uh basically everything can
be combined so that you can target the
background and do certain things with it
so where do you want to position it
right center so what is right center
come to
right column Center row let's go ahead
and see what they want us to do here so
we're gonna have position using
background - position this website -
oops up it to top center so that moves
dark image around a little bit
so we learned how to set up a background
position it's rep repetition pattern and
how to position it now oh they want us
to combine this as one so similar to how
we did before you can actually just call
background instead of doing these
properties one by one put it in the URL
first then you're gonna put in if you
want it to repeat or not and then
finally the position so my suggestion is
to always do it like this don't don't
start separating out throughout various
properties and things like that you're
just gonna create more if you can at all
it all depends on the situation but
that's the best way to go about it go
about it so background - sighs this is
something you're gonna be using quite
often as of right now we have such a
large image let's go ahead and do some
stuff that maybe will make this image a
little bit more manageable and to what
we want it to do now contain here
extends the image as large as possible
which means that won't cover the but the
image will be letterbox that was
letterboxing so cover will extend the
full width or height of a container
without distorting the image so let's go
ahead that's probably what they're gonna
do here
oh they wants to wants to contain it all
right so we're gonna do background -
sighs contain just gonna run that and
you'll see now it's contained within our
div this specific dip
so it doesn't make sense to use it
obviously so what we're gonna do here is
go ahead and change it to cover cuz this
looks much better and you'll see that
this image isn't distorted at all and
that's what cover does is it basically
will fill up the box yet it won't
distort the image
so background attachment kind of a weird
name for what it does is you can set if
the image is to move up and down as the
user Scrolls this is a default value so
you see right here or if we want to set
it to fixed so that it's always there so
say you wanted to have the same
background on like a one-page
application this would probably be what
you're gonna do so let's go ahead and do
that so we're gonna do background -
attachment and we're just gonna go ahead
and set that to fix so now let's run
that our background see how it's staying
there like so it's only in the one
section but it's staying there
regardless so this is kind of one of
those cool things you'll see a lot on
websites where you have divs blocking
out some of the content but it'll be
something behind it that's kind of what
you would do with background - fix I use
this on my website to basically have a
single background on I believe my about
Me section
all right
so gradient we're getting into a little
more advanced stuff here it looks like
so let's go in the background image
property of the BTN selector background
- image property bTW and selector
alright here we are and we want to have
a WEP a linear alright so we have this
background image and we want to add this
right here this I believe there's some
cs3 stuff so add the background image
property so instead of adding an actual
image like we did before we're actually
gonna add a gradient color scheme so you
basically start out one color here and
then move across to the other coloring
transition so in the BTN selector here
we are we're gonna go ahead and say look
background
- image and then the first color is
going to be a shag ffd one nine four and
I imagine you could probably do RGB RGB
a and then colors as well one three to
four just going around this so you see
right here we did a nice little gradient
so it looks like it goes top to bottom
there's probably additional things that
you can do to make it so but uh nice
little gradient
all right so we learned quite a bit in
this section about images we learned how
to how to set the width and the height
so that things fit like they're supposed
to we learned about the background image
background repeat' background position
we also learned that the background
images support color gradients like we
did here which is a cool way of making
your buttons look really nice if you're
doing your own CSS so there's a bunch of
these was it called WebKit filters
yeah WebKit that you can look up and
find out more about that's kind of real
introductory to just one but as always
