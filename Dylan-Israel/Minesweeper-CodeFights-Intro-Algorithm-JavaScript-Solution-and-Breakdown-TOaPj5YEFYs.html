code camp super-fit over bagging code by
doing minesweeper Island of knowledge in
the intro section so if you've ever
played that awful awful game minesweeper
essentially how it works is it lets you
know how many mines are are close to
these so you'll see here we have a false
value and it's a true to the bottom of
it and a tree to the left of it so thus
there are two mines nearby and it's what
we're essentially going to recreate that
and push out our own grid to showcase
that now the way that I did it was I
created two for loops and then I checked
because there's only eight spots that
you're going to check around it three at
the top the left the right and the
bottom thirty book bottom left the
bottom in the bottom right I just check
to see if for those for it now because
because of the edges we have to do a
little bit of logic to make sure that
we're not checking undefined values and
but all in all it wasn't too bad let's
go ahead and get started we're going to
start by creating a variable called mine
count this is just going to be what
we're going to push our values to now
now that we have that and iterate
through the array and in here we're
going to say what I equal to zero Y is
less than matrix I plus plus and we're
going to same thing with K now we'll say
for
oh and by the way for the mic in this
eye we need to go ahead and push a new
array to it right so now that we're on
our correct row we'll take mine count
and we're going to go ahead and push an
empty array at this point the
two-dimensional array so we push that
empty array and then on here we have our
standard four loop okay equal to zero
well J is less than matrix I dot length
J plus plus all right so now we set up
all our looping
so we set up our looping what we do now
is we take our mind count and we say hey
on IJ on the row and on the column that
we're currently on go ahead and
initialize that and set the value to
zero
and the next step is we're going to
check all eight slots to see if there's
a true value and if it is we're just
going to add one to it that's it now
there are a couple things that we'll
have to add some additional definitions
but we'll worry about that later so
first thing first is let's go ahead and
I'll put some comments here this is how
I did it to keep track we need to check
the above one know if the way that we
check the above is if matrix I and
matrix J minus one if that is equal to
equal is true yeah it's J minus 1
because minus 1 and the would go up
right we go up because we're in a row a
column so if that is the case go ahead
and take money count and add one to it
next if statement this is below and we
have if now the issue with this one was
that I was giving it home to find air
and we're going to take care of that
right now so we're saying look if that
and then J plus 1 is not undefined
proceed otherwise we get some here so if
that's the case we have a nested if
that's in sight
if matrix I
and then k plus one equal equal to true
go ahead and take mine count oh this is
my count ifj excuse me I okay this is
coconut same thing my count I have K
plus plus and we're going to do this and
for all the values so it may seem a
little bit tedious next we have to the
left and if matrix I minus one is not
undefined
and then in here we'll say another F
so this is going to check the left and
we're saying hey if it's true go ahead
an increase mine count I J plus plus now
we're going to check to the right and
that will be the four for semi basic
ones I guess I'm safe if matrix I plus 1
now if that is not equal to undefined
and if matrix I plus 1 6 plus 1 is equal
equal to true we're going to take our
mind count when I I of J plus plus it
one more time and we're halfway we're
halfway there now what we have to do is
check the diagonal the top right the
bottom right the top left the bottom
left alright so we'll start with the
down right and on here we have if matrix
I plus 1 is not equal to 1 to 5 go ahead
and check it through so if it's sure
let's I plus 1 J plus 1 so there
so if that is equal equal to true and
then finally mine count IJ
all right you guys get the idea and then
down left I'm going to want to copy a
paste of these in we had seconds right
and they split you guys get it so if I
plus 1 not equal on the fine for the
down left because it's the eyes that
were giving us some define airs J minus
1 is true go ahead and add it and then
we have the top right in the top left
I'm going to go ahead and paste those in
there right now so damn Stella when we
have top left top right at top left
checking each eye for each one of these
make sure that the - thing and the
adding isn't giving us undefined there
and then at the end here all we have to
do is return mine count assuming that
there is no syntax mistakes let's go to
run our code
there is a syntax mistake
alright let's find our syntax mistakes
so we have our my account we have our
array matrix always matrix ID ex-parte i
FJ is equal to zero and we can go line
by line for each one of these so we have
our above that's one of the things about
comments it makes kind of testing this a
little bit easier let's see here Oh
alright let's run our test ice not the
above and then we'll do the below run
our code last one okay then we'll get
left oh I knew their families in taxes
take me after all that typing that's not
the case now we're going to go ahead and
do right
their code there we go so that was the
one where you messed up on sorry about
that guys
a lot of elect a lot checking and but
essentially we're just checking the
corners and we're checking the the left
right top and bottom and then we are
done we know how many mines are near us
that's basically minesweeper in a hole
if you solved it there's probably a
mathematical way of going about this I'm
not really sure but this is so it came
to me when I looked at the problem
instantly and I solved it pretty quickly
because of it so I look for you guys to
share your solutions in these videos as
always thank you so much for watching
don't forget to comment like subscribe
and share if you want to support me at
patreon and join the Facebook group
that'd be great as well I'll see you
guys in the next video thank you so much
for watching
hey guys thanks for watching the video
especially thanks to our sponsors dev
Mountain if you're looking for a coding
boot camp where tuition and housing is
included definitely check them out
appreciate it and I'll see you guys in
the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
