back in Wikipedia API search for free
code camp we've created our search term
let's go ahead and put some comments in
here gets a search input and then here
we'll just go ahead and put API URL
let's search input all right so what we
need to do next is do a Ajax call I'm
going to copy actually I'll type it all
out so that we can go piece by piece so
we're gonna do within the click function
that we're calling here on the shiny
we're gonna go ahead and create a Ajax
call so Ajax like it is a another way to
get a JSON phone so look at the Ajax so
there's couple things we're in need here
first is what type of caller we're doing
we're doing a get call we need to get
the information next we need to know
where we're gonna get it from its URL so
we're gonna go ahead and set URL to URL
probably gonna give it a better term
this async I wish I could explain that
in more detail but it's just a dated
thing and I don't fully understand it
but it works when it's false
I'm gonna tell you that much so what's
happened what type of data do we need we
want the data type of JSON
javascript object notation and then we
need to do some stuff when it's a
success and we need to do some stuff
when it's a failure so let's go ahead
and just do function data and then when
it's success success do some stuff and
then it is a failure do some stuff as
well so we'll go our air excuse me so we
need to set the air if everything
crashes it happens well yeah well input
an error message and then we can just go
ahead and console alert something that
says like air
all right so how do we want to test this
JSON call the first thing we do is just
console dot log out the data so we know
that our we know that our URL is correct
and we know that our search term is
working we've already tested that as we
go along so let's go ahead and in here
type in good there God will type in God
let's see what comes up with God and so
you'll see right now it's outputting our
data here now let's see what that looks
like
when we see it as a it looks good when
we get the actual JSON object so go
ahead and give God one more time so that
you can see exactly what's getting
displayed so let me go ahead and open up
postman I suggest everyone use it or
something similar postman is a chrome
application that you can store your
api's in so it's really helpful when
you're doing a bunch of the API calls
NSA kick more complicated with
authentication tokens and session tokens
it's really gonna be helpful so yeah
we're gonna go ahead and see everything
that's going on here
so it looks like we have an array that
this is the search term and then we have
kind of the heading in an array with the
heading and then we're gonna have an
array with the description and then
we're gonna have an array with a link to
each each one of those pages so this is
what our JSON object looks like it works
like so let's go ahead and see if we can
get out a the first one so we don't
really need the search term what we do
need is the the the heading and the the
text and the air if the a tag so let's
go ahead and just get that first one so
if you remember we have it's an array so
data 0 would be the search term data 1
would be
the the anchor tag and then we're gonna
choose the first object in there so then
we can do the same thing so that should
be the anchor tag and then we're gonna
have we're doing do the same thing for
that as well now except we want the
description of the first object or zero
that our first input is first index of
the array or the zero index so we will
say do the same thing now and this
should be for the heading and let's go
ahead and clear our console and see what
happens when we save it and search so do
it one more time for God and then you'll
see there's our title there is our our
description and and there is our
Wikipedia so the reason it looks
remember that it prints out this one
first that one second this one third so
it is working in in order so in the next
video what we'll do is we're gonna
basically set up how to do the search
and then concatenate the data correctly
outward and then we will also show how
to clear this so that if you search a
game that just doesn't and the way I set
it up concatenate on top of it and then
you have two searches to swing and then
we're gonna style it in the next video
after that so see you guys then thanks
for watching don't forget to Like and
subscribe and support on patreon thanks
guys
hey guys make sure you check out my
twitch API videos which will be coming
out pretty soon as well as my new series
drunk developers where I ask questions
on how did you get into the field what
was the favorite thing you ever did what
languages do you recommend learning for
a beginner all the sort of stuff while
having drinks so I hope you guys enjoy
that and keep an eye out for it see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
