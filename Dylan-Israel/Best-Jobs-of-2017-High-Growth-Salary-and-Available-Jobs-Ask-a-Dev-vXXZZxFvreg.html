getting pretty annoyed with people
saying you know software development is
going to be automated or is it still too
late to get into software development is
it a good job how do you know there's
going to be jobs oh my god I'm so
 paranoid sort of things I've
been really sick of hearing about it so
I came across some stats the other day
the indeed best jobs in the United
States - the United States for 2017 and
it's based off of how many job postings
there are the salary and the growth in
that job category so all important
things how much money are going to make
how many jobs there are in the growth of
those jobs we got a list of the top 25
and lo and behold look at what we have
here boys and girls full stack developer
ranked the number one job by in deeds
based off that category average salary
$110,000 that's great in a three year
period 2013 to 2016
I guess it's four year periods thirteen
fourteen fifteen sixteen one hundred and
twenty two percent job growth in just
four years now let's go over the rest of
the list real quick so that we can see
data scientists that's also software
related that's that's hot that's that's
in the same sector I should say
development operations engineer sales
force IT sales force QA Quality Engineer
digital project manager this is also
good think cloud engineer consulting
analytics manager I'm going to match
that falls into the same category as
well project architect definitely
penetration tester senior senior audit
manager maybe not civil engineer none so
we have a one maybe and one no that's
not in the tech or software Oracle layer
software infrastructure engineer could
be software so we'll put two maybes and
one know machine learning engineer
definitely patient experience manager
I'm going to put that under maybe so
three maybe is the one because that
could fall under UI UX somehow
commercial project manager if you
that's it registered nurse okay so
there's two notes and three maybes
revenue manager put that in a maybe four
maybes and to nose operations lead
that's the construction superintendent
that's three noes three maybes
continuous improvement manager are so up
here we have four maybe jobs that aren't
software related because I don't know
too much about a lot of those and then
three that for sure aren't so out of the
top 25 jobs seven of them are in the
software and tech space that and data
space that this sort of suffering so so
please stop worrying about the money
being there please stop worrying about
the jobs being there and just understand
get your foot in the door and get going
and put that but alright so let they're
still going to be people are good you
know should do it you're just going off
one of the world's most popular
job sites that the real world uses you
don't know you don't know what's going
to be automated all right
well suck these nuts because here we go
with the automation grass all right so
because I am sick of these
trolls that I really have all right
the future employers let's see let's
just see what jobs are getting automated
for the sake of argument right and by
the way this is done by the US Bureau of
Labor and Statistics and Frey and
Osbourne which is a agency but the US
Bureau of Labor Statistics if you say
that's not a good source I'm done
talking with you alright that's about as
good as a source about this as we can
get so this entire chart here is about
automation so retail okay if you're in
retail and you don't know that it's by
the way so the jobs getting automated
estimated automated are the gray and the
white is what's remaining so you can see
fast-food retail everything that you
probably should expect to get automated
is day laborers secretaries and
administrative assistants not to
surprised about that cashiers I think we
all can agree that's going away but
let's get down to what we really care
about in this case which is computer
information analysts look at that barely
any change all right
or Support Specialists that's like tech
support so that's probably what's going
on there but if we look to where is it
there is a software section on here oh
well by the way school teacher is also
great this is something I've been I've
been think about here we are software
developer and program are some change
yes there is a Newton amount of change
in which about ten percent of the jobs
will be automated I would say maybe
twelve percent if you really look at it
software developers and programs not a
massive change and a lot of these
industries for the most part there are
things that will get automated of course
right WordPress is maybe it's so much
easier for web design to be done so
stuff like that does happen but what
you'll see on all of the graphs here are
that the creative jobs the technical
skill jobs all of those things that in
terms of technical skills and creative I
want thrown out of software all of these
are in the number one all the technical
skills everything in here that makes
good money has good job growth for last
four years is all this is it's
everything that's on here and there's
very little automation in those jobs so
if you're worried about you know what's
the best job to get oh my god is it too
late to get into software and you just
want to be pessimistic and you just want
to pass these silly questions here you
go man some real-world stuff job search
site US Bureau of Labor Statistics I
don't know what else you want to not
worry about it I hope you guys are
motivated I know I am I know when I see
 like full-stack developer ranked
number one and there's someone is always
a social institution doing I look to big
digital of 2017 and it was third all
right look man if you're in the top 25
for any job be happy guys right so your
goal as a developer it's beautiful tech
developer go in one of these directions
right my goal is full stack that's what
I do and that's what I'm continuing to
do do I make the average of a salary no
but I'm in my first year and I
eventually will get there but what I'm
trying to tell you is look don't worry
continue working on the skills there's
jobs and there's postings and there's
growth and the money is good and as we
have seen from this chart very little
automation is going to take place and a
couple of these that fall into the you
know software developer and then you
know computer support is a different
category I would say computer
information analyst that's the data
analytics I would say so if you combine
those and average it out it's like
there's a 7% change but you guys get the
idea I wish you all the best I and if
you're still custom istic about about
learning software engineering I don't
know what else to show you ma'am
just if you want to be stressed out and
you want to worry all the time just
don't do it Matt and I've been that way
it sucks and I don't want you guys do
that but um one last thing this is
