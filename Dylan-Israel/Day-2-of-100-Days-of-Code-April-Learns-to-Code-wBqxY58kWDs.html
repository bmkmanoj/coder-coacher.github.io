this is day two of April learns to code
this is an official name of this section
so day two of our 100 day coding
challenge we are going to be doing the
JavaScript section of free code camp
we're actually going to be doing the
beta because it includes more stuff even
though she's going to be doing the
current version of free code camp the
reason we're going to be doing the beta
is because it has more topics and a lot
of stuffs the same in the basic
JavaScript section but we'll get to
cover more she's going to take notes I'm
going to go through it and explain
topics as we go through and if there's
anything she doesn't understand she's
going to ask questions and I'm gonna try
to give real real-world examples as we
go and on top of that she's gonna do it
on her own
probably in two or three days right so
you gotta finish up your project yeah
did you wanna look at many project oh
yeah we insert with that you actually
sent it to me so if you guys remember
yesterday um we got started what I did
was I reviewed whore you her word floor
yeah yeah I reviewed her her code pin
project of which she was okay see this
enormous gap right here yes I can't
figure it out
okay I've put in each of its own
padding's and it still didn't change
unless I was putting in the wrong
padding
so lot yesterday what we did was if
you're just tuning in is I reviewed her
project showing her how we were factory
code showed her how to get better at it
it looks like she improved upon my code
a little bit this looks this looks
cooler than mine did and so it looks
like you're having a padding issue so
let's jump to your heading 1 and heading
to say your font size is 100 px clover
font-family text-align:center
h 1 h 4
oh all right so what we're going to do
is I'm going to have to go line by line
real quick so we have a div connect
solicit of your h1 to h4
oops
all right so we're going to do a little
bit of trial and error here
the image padding is here that's what
this is coming from that's fine so I'm
going to show you what's called the
inspector tool so we're going to a
full-page mode and we're going to
inspect here so this is these are
debugging tools and things like that
in
in our code
so we can click on it and we can see the
CSS just gave me up light on it
so I think what is happening is that
your code before it's inheriting some
basic styling - this a nice you think
it's just heading one that has the type
of I just want make sure you're not
using a bootstrap class called heading
one no you're not
alright let's see here
so this div alright so I'm thinking this
HTML issue or something's off so I did
this div connects to this so you have a
div around here and then we have a div
that connects to here give so here okay
no let's don't baby my life okay yeah
cuz this is what took me the longest
time I would have been done with this
fairly quickly
except for so what we're gonna do is
that's crazy
but I was literally trying to like well
I know I I would I would wager that last
updated actually wanted to create it I
would wager that there's some basic
styling that comes with the h1 tag or a
font size so I bet that oh but what we
can do is so it's prop what's going on
here is I bet our code yesterday was
slightly different in which we assigned
padding and we assign margin so
sometimes these h1 tags and h4 tags have
margins and padding's of their own so
what we can do is we can do something
like this where we'll do our padding
thing is padding maybe now we can do 0px
it also juice 0 let's save it and run it
it is margin whoops simpler get you your
correct for me already baby do their
happy now
all right so we're gonna add some margin
I bet you had some margin you see how we
got rid of some of that already
and there's margin in them too yep and
so remember when we were looking in this
did you see how we hover over it yeah we
click it and we go over here you can
kind of see that's an art yes that's the
padding that's the border and that's a
margin if you actually look in the
inspector it says 67 yeah so the margin
there is 67 so you can kind of use that
to see how much of a margin you want to
do so this guy this is commonly how
you'll debug your code a lot of the
times as a developer and so we can do
something like margin and you want it
right below it right just save it and
run it and obviously you can play around
with it so if I had to guess you
probably had some margin that was going
on there so cool well all right is that
the only main issue you have um yeah
also on the table so you see the double
lines taking place yes so I was trying
to actually get rid of that okay and I
tried a couple different ways and I
couldn't like I tried this other way I
saw another website called so I'll show
you why that's happening okay um it's
because remember a table row table data
yeah so I I tried a bunch of
combinations to get that to go and I
couldn't
okay well for the most part oh yeah so I
tried this border collapse yeah I know
like I like it but that's not what I was
going for so the fact that I can't get
what I was actually going for is what
upsets me okay
and I couldn't get so I just want to
make sure I know how to do it all right
so here
so my rav4 alright so got some people
from st. Pete huh yeah alright so you
see we took it out there so we took out
the table dated now only over the table
head the first thing we can try is to
see how it looks when you play to the
table row okay I did nothing
yeah I don't know why it doesn't do
anything was this border collapse so
that was supposed to make it just have
its the post from what I understand it
was supposed to help acknowledge I hope
the thingy acknowledge that there's only
supposed to be one line there as
possible that's what I got set the
collapsing border models for this is
this still use
all right so that's the first thing that
doesn't make sense to me go ahead and
throw TD on there
save and run it huh I don't know baby
I'd have to look into a little bit more
but I think you did a good job on it it
looks nice on it could be that oh you
know what it was I don't think we did
table data I think we did table body
let's see this is kind of you play
around see what works what doesn't
hmm I don't know um I would say just
because I don't wanna focus all the time
I'm getting some borders going just play
around with it and see what's going on
but chances are I there there is it all
looks right to me this is what's
throwing me off yeah but I don't I think
there's something wrong with the table
so okay okay okay no no no no I think I
know what's going on so um before we had
no padding now there's padding so what's
happening is now there is time let me
take out the padding real quick okay
we're just gonna come just a lot so it
doesn't mean anything
table Center comment that out
paragraph is fine okay cool so
you'll see now it looks a little similar
to how it looked before
oh just squishy you've done stone yeah I
think you know baby up I must say I'm
stumped on this I don't I don't really
know why but it looks better this way
and I don't worry about it I have to
hide out there to keep on playing around
with I don't do 40 minutes of us no less
trying to work on a border
 borders and always with you
alright um alright so uh what we're
doing today guys is we're gonna be going
through the JavaScript JavaScript
section of the beta free cocaine and
we're gonna be working on that and I'm
gonna go through it she's gonna ask
questions I'm gonna explain topic so
then of course she'll do all this on
your own the way that our lessons are
gonna kind of work is I'm going to
troubleshoot whatever she has from her
for working on it today and I'm going to
the best of my ability okay okay so what
how it's gonna go is because I learned
better in a teacher-student environment
so it's it's going way differently from
how he was going to have us originally
do it but I enjoy being in a classroom
so much and I really do learn uh well
with lectures I know it's weird but I
love lectures so he's going to literally
lecture hit the JavaScript from free
code camp I'm gonna write my notes down
and then after this tomorrow I will then
go back and go through draw the script
itself and do that homework up until the
point where we get and then if I have
any questions or concerns go back the
next session ask those questions
concerns also I have still some projects
to finish up for my front-end source
certification so I'll be doing those on
top of the JavaScript stuff so alright
so let's go ahead and get started
we're going to be doing the beta version
of free code camp so comments there's
two types of comments remember how we uh
we were I showed you how to comment an
age
EML you can also do comments in
JavaScript as well so you have this
slash slash which is a single line
comment and you may there is you'll put
comments in your code is so that if you
write a function and you want someone to
know what it does or why this line is
here there's a comment to explain it now
in a perfect world you don't need
comments because your code should
explain itself but you're dealing with
thousands of lines of text how how is
that even like I feel like you should
comment everything yeah I mean comment a
lot right so April's goal is to in a
hundred days apply for an internship and
eventually go down the development route
or the tech route and see where it leads
yeah if the ideas eventually have a
brokerage office a developer and this
hundred day is this kind of a boot strap
what's the word I'm looking for
it's kind of a joke sorry I don't know
so getting to getting her going with it
alright so those are single line
comments I could type anything here and
it'd be commented up but my type
something here wouldn't be now if I want
to do multi-line comments do we do with
a slash star star slash now I can type
whatever I want and this will comment it
up and remember you can select things
well okay but what hmm because you can
type in this one lane as long as you can
and then eventually it'll pull over to a
second line right no no you're going
infinitely to the right now you
shouldn't yeah you shouldn't but you can
slash star star slash good all right so
create a comment at least five letters
will say hello world and that's our
first comment and I here we have our
multi-line comment and we'll put slash
world hello let's go ahead and run the
test everything pass we are the greatest
all right so you're going to be using
variables all the time in in JavaScript
and Java scripts what known as a in
other programming languages sometimes
you have to declare what type of
variable so there are there are strings
which are words and sentences right so
you would denote that with a string with
quotes um this would be undefined
because we haven't set it to anything
and we can name our variable the way
that we define variables is with this
var keyword there are other ways to
define variables and we're worried about
that later but what we've done here is
simply named a keyword we'll define a
carrot you have as many variables as you
need and here all we're doing it oops
sorry typing with one hand here we've
just created a variable we haven't set
it to anything that's why it's time to
find if we wanted to set it to let's say
five which is of the number type so
variables have a type and a value the
value of this is five the type of it is
number so it makes sense
so these are all the data types right
here you have undefined which would be
our name right here that it's nothing we
haven't said anything we have no idea
there's no which is we've set it to be
empty that's all no means there's
boolean which is true or false so like
you only have one of two options are
inside the true or false like flipping a
quarter there's a string which is
sentences what words characters um I
didn't know there's a symbol but it's
the symbol I have to look that up and
then there's number which we talked
about an object so objects are a little
complicated at this point but we'll
worry about that one later yeah do you
have any questions whatever variables
used variables are used for storing data
so if I wanted to add two numbers
together maybe I'll have variable number
one variable number two and we'll return
the result and we'll say number one plus
number two
but I thought variable was supposed to
take down an odd yes uh it takes in in
this case this one's taking the value of
five it's storing the value stores data
so like you store things in it it's a
storage container okay and I store
values in it yes okay so why do I store
these values in it um so that we don't
have to rewrite numbers and sentences a
million times it makes things easier so
in this case so let's say hello my name
is Dylan Israel
and I like I like to code a lot of text
going on here so what we're doing is
we're showing what what what sizing
string string that's right we're
starting a string and so instead of me
if I wanted to print this out type in it
all out again I would this is how you
would print something in your console
console dot log I could say I could
instead just call my name because we
stored this string in the my name
variable okay but how would you use that
in an application like where would that
make sense okay so if we wanted so let's
go to numbers so if we wanted say we're
making a calculator and we wanted to add
some numbers together and let's just say
that number was five and we'll call this
number one and then we'll have another
variable what number do you want it to
be Thanks equal to six and we wanted to
those spaces no but it's probably best
to write clean code okay so it's just
it's a lot easier to kind of see if it's
not like this right yeah I was curious
yeah so just good it doesn't some of the
code like identify space as like a type
of character not in not in JavaScript
okay because when we went to that one
place the space was considered character
are you talk about the meetup yeah no
you misunderstood that yeah okay um so
let's say let's say this was a function
and we want all instead of actually we
could just go ahead and add these
numbers and I 1 plus an option
but maybe we also want to just so much
easier to type five and six but this is
the most basic example there is okay
because remember you're getting input so
you don't know that it's going to be
five or six a user ascending you this
data by entering a key and you're
sending these numbers and regardless of
what the numbers are
then you're transferring over saying
look whatever number one is and number
two is whatever website would use this
this is I don't understand why I'm not
grabbing this okay um I'm gonna pull up
one of my web applications
we're gonna go since you want to skip
over like you've not skip over but like
you want to see a real-world exam I need
a real world example okay don't get it
I'll show you real world examples so it
doesn't make sense to me to have a
variable something like this if you're
not we're gonna have a practical use for
it
like how am I supposed to use it if I
don't know how it's gonna be used I know
babe one second let me uh let me pull up
okay you know what better yet let me
pull up my calculator example typing
it's not the best code I ever and what
it does use exactly what we were talking
about every website uses it do it how
like because it's it's how you it's so
you know how hTML is kind of like the
body it's kind of like the template and
CSS is the looks so javascript is the
brain it's the logic it's how okay when
I get that Billy but if you want to do
anything how are you gonna use a
variable that's what I don't understand
however I understand a website taking it
like the brain how to use the brain and
the on the website well that's what
we're going to teach you better okay all
right
okay so I can't learn like that rather
like I will find I can't accept that all
right all right look so here what we
have is in our an array um this is
considered an object okay an array is
nothing but a list so you can have as
many things in it as you want so let's
say it goes 1 comma 2 comma 3 so a
reason that we would have stored data in
the calculator example is right here we
are putting in an input so each one of
these buttons has a variable yes in this
case it's a 7 and this one's an 8 and
this one's a 9 so right now our inputs
you don't see it right now but our
inputs is actually an array of 7 8 9
so we're storing that data okay now we
also wait okay so it's already being
stored mm-hmm and once the user uses it
yes they can store their own variables
into it their values into the variable
so what the variable exists and it is
the variable exists and what's happening
is you are changing the value of it
right now so we set we set the type we
set it to an array and we're pushing the
value to it is what it's called or
splicing it but we're just inserting the
value to the iraq so in this case we
have an array of operators plus - slash
star and this stores these values
because they're different right these
are different types and the reason that
we have this numbers array is because we
just store it and print it out and
things like that so don't worry about
all this but so this is this right here
is our code where we're actually pushing
in to the array there is a jet say focus
all right so what happens is we set up
all this logic to work
with the user working our project and
our inputs we check to see but that's
that's that's why we store the values
does that make sense why we use
variables okay so let's jump back into
here um I will just reset this because
it's showing haywire for a second so
we're going to create our variable my
name and because we don't set it to
anything it's undefined
okay now usually when you usually when
you get the value undefined chances are
it doesn't exist either you never set
the value or the value itself doesn't
exist okay so let's say we tried to
console.log my name to it would return
undefined because it doesn't exist does
that make sense
umm why didn't they exist because we
never created it and it can't find it in
this case it returns undefined because
we never you know even though we kind of
did we basically initialize it but we
never set it to anything if we wanted it
to be empty we would set it to what no
good all right yes all right so as we
showed a second ago we were just
initializing the variable we didn't
actually set it to anything in the in
free code camp so now what we're going
to do is the assignment operator it's
basically just an equal sign what that
means is if we want to reset the value
remember how we had to we had the inputs
array but let's say we just wanted to
instead of adding something we wanted to
reset it entirely we do that with an
equal sign so in this case they have
they initialize the variable a which
they haven't use it and then they
actually set the value of B equal to two
and you can do it all in one line
I mean you can do like you don't have to
create ver a variable a and then in the
line below do it a Z so you can't tell
me that then how what that look like I
put a and B equals 2 or I cuz I don't
understand what you're saying I'm just
saying that you can set set it as B is
being set here so that make sense know
what you can set the value and create
the value at the same time so in a if
there's no value right it's under okay
there's no value for a so if we wanted
to set a we would do it after we
initialize it like this and does that
make sense because maybe down the road
we don't we want it to exist so our code
works but we don't know what it is till
the user inputs it right it's kind of
like why we set up the array with no
values because we're going to we know
that we need the array the person is
going to apply the values after while
they're using it correct
so you're compensating for exactly it
exists there's just nothing in it yet
all right so all right so I should have
a value of 7 so remember how we set that
and our code wants a to have a value of
7 so the ways we use that is the
assignment operator the equal sign we're
in saying a equals this number and we
want B to equal 7 so you remember
happens so far all we've done is set
values but you can actually use these
variables to something equal to each
other so you can put B equals 5 yeah you
put B equals 5 and we can change the
value but in this case we want B to
equal 7
oh I thought you were saying that
putting this here and then adding
another B with a value will add it
together but those
the case no it could be if you wanted it
to be but not not the way you're saying
so so if we wanted it was like wow yeah
so um in this case we want B to equal 7
now we could do it like this right that
would work but the the example here
wants to show you that you can actually
use variables to set it to the variables
as well so in this case a is equal to 7
and when we want to set the value from 2
to 7
using a all we have to do is B is equal
to a okay does that make sense it makes
sense why would you do that what how
would that even be I guess you just have
to be in a situation where that just
becomes useful okay so you have a
variable set for B equals 2 yes okay is
this also variable B yeah yes equals a
no no um we're resetting the value so we
have only okay we say it's resetting it
so 2 is totally no yeah two doesn't
exist
when you hit this was like whoa so
unlike the only the only item second
store multiple values are arrays okay
which are the lists okay um other than
that you're just going to be overriding
the value ah oh yeah because the yeah
okay
I forgot all right mm-hmm
so we a second ago said it's that
usually you will initialize a value all
that means is when you create a value
when you create a variable setting a
default way okay so there's assignment
yeah which is the equal sign yes and
initialize it is the same thing it's
just another way of saying when I create
my variable assigning a value at the
same time okay so what you can use
them intermittently or they actually
mean different things
no they initialize is just setting a
value when we create our variable an
assignment is kind of the same thing
except it can be just a placeholder
known placeholder isn't the right word
assignment is when you override the
value or you set it equals to something
so initializing is no initialize see how
we're creating our variable and setting
it to zero at the same time yeah that's
initializing now assignment in this case
would be equivalent of setting it here
we just assign that value to the already
created variable
all right that's all right that's all
hey baby we all learn right so so when
we initialize a variable we create this
right here this whole thing is being
initialized because it's fully complete
yes because we're creating a variable
and we're giving it a value to start off
with okay so it's totally done yes
yeah it has its initial value the value
has been initialized the variable has
been initial okay so the variable
has been initialized now the bottom is
just an assignment yes we are assigning
a new value to that variable the
variable already exists because we
created it here okay but why would they
teach you the assignment before they
teach you you did feel like I think what
they're giving you is they're trying to
just teach you some terminology here now
now don't forget that I'm teaching you
this as we go because you're asking
questions and we're not necessarily
going in order so some of the things
that we've been discussing is because
you've been asking questions no I get
that but we were talking about an
assignment operator before this one were
me yes right here and what so it sounds
like initialize should come first and
then the essential I don't know second
so that's confusing so this is still an
assignment operator here okay
the equal sign is the assignment
operator but the action of setting
initial value you're initializing the
variable with the assignment operator
does that make more sense so we're
sending an initial value and this shall
be in the first value on creating of the
variable okay so
okay so initial is initial yes okay
there's a special other turn nice show
so very first right okay and so and then
so assignment can go back and reassign
to an initial value for the variable so
the equal sign sorry baby it's new right
so the the equal sign is the assignment
operator okay hey you're right yes all
right look
so the equal sign is the assignment
operator that's all we use it when we
create our variable if we want to write
in this case we're using it to assign 0
now this whether we use that or not it's
the or initializing the variable okay
now you can initialize it with the
assignment operator that's how you set
the default value the initial value now
all we're doing here is reassigning it
okay
it's still the assignment operator it's
just we're sending an initial value when
we create it here we're reassigning it
okay but assessment can be either/or
then assign the assignment operator yeah
yeah you use it in both days okay full
stages throw an initial and okay okay so
let's tell me tell me describe what we
just learned because I want to make sure
you guys okay so for initializing it's
your first value you don't even have to
give it an assignment you can just have
it there so the Venerable are there yes
and then for an assignment that means
is the equal sign so you can give it a
value or you can give it a value later
because you can give because of the
assessment yes that's correct
oh so in this case we're giving it 9 to
pass our example here oh and this needs
to be a that needs to be a initialize
value of a so the assignment here is to
initialize variable a cool all right so
so remember how we're talking about
undefined
whatever that mm-hmm okay so here if we
were to forget this bottom part if we
were to write here ask hey what's the
value of a it would return undefined
because we haven't said it yet right
because there is no assessment yeah and
and remember your code runs top to
bottom right so whatever is last it goes
line by line for it for right now for
the sake of this shortcut so this runs
than this fronts and this runs and so on
and so forth
so a shout out to code course who was
kind enough to do a interview with us
you did my interview with me last week
oh yeah yeah I'm gonna make that some
good sign equals on every sign of value
all right in the previous life yeah
that's what you just said to me yay well
yeah like coding YouTube groupie hi oh
alright so when we run our code right
now
is you'll see that night none these are
passing and what we want it to do is we
want to you can actually use when we set
the value we can use our own variable in
here to reset the value as well so in
math come on white board because you
can't use my that's alright so so in
here what they want is to do is
initialize the variable to 5 so we
initialize it with the assignment
operator the equal sign okay assign no
let's let's use the vocab alright so
they use the assignment operator and
we're going to do the same thing for B
and we're going to set that equal to 10
and what type are these again no they're
not they're numbers all right and then
we are going to set I am A and what type
is this aa string good um and when we
run this I wonder why they had all these
new words for them like why why not
sentences
do you want to know what I was told I
know this is true because you string it
together so like the way I kid you not
in my school the way they explain the
string was they wrote this up like this
and then he took over he took a
highlighter and then he did this and
then you string it together that's like
the string I'm not sure not sounds like
a load of alright so it could be
from like Old English whether when they
first started writing that everything
was put together so even if you're
looking at it there is no spaces between
letters or words and there was no period
so it was all strung together
not only until we got the great vowel
shift from what country was that I
forget but that's when everything
started becoming separated oh yeah so um
so that could be it
so that makes more sense to be that yeah
so in this case you'll see that we're
reassigning the value of a right okay
because they're saying that a equals a
plus 1 once so we can use the value
that's in a to set a new value for a so
a is 5 so really a is 6 once it hits
here a is no 6 yes and what would be B
in this case 15 good now what do you
think C is gonna be I am a string good
so what's going to happen here is is
actually going to my finger up
right now it's actually going to to add
the strings together good
now um when they talk about what's
called camel case now there's sort of
we've been talking about good-good
conventions right we want to make sure
that we write proper code some of those
things are putting comments in our code
good spacing
another thing is naming our variables
correctly um
you want your you want to follow the
best practice use what's called a camel
case is exactly like this you start off
with a lower case and when you hit a new
word in there you then capitalize it so
you saw how our name then n was
capitalized right or maybe you didn't
but so in this case we have those are
like midway what Edley is a new word
studly
captain no it's idli Kat bar yes I'm not
not good right uh cuz it's busily
steadily cap far I think that's okay
down for so yeah in this case the way
that we would fix this we have Studley
cap and then we bar bars for very punch
steadly cap is short for capital all
right now the proper camel case is
already set up right so proper so you
start off with the lower case and then
the reason it's called camel cases
there's no hump the next word there's a
home just say hi uh if I gotta draw a
camel right so so you imitate this okay
so to fix this title case why is this
wrong title case over
because it's best to start with our case
yes so you start with lower case almost
engage that it's alright part of the
hard part of coding when you're just
getting started is knowing what to look
for and it's going to be the most
frustrating thing so a lot of times
people try and get me to debug their
code but I don't because I charge for
that so I just uh debug debug debug ever
yes I don't have the time for one also
but uh they don't know this but I
usually look at it to see if it's
something easy and it usually is and I
can spot it just because I've I'm
trained enough just know what to look at
once you do your work yeah and so a lot
of the process of becoming a developer
is knowing how to spot errors in your
code yeah that's one thing I do like
about coding was like ah the people who
finish first in high school then had to
go and help other people debug their
things and my friend and I we were
always the ones that finished first so
we'd see how many of us could debug our
other students in class like who could
debug more alright so here we're just
going to go ahead and assign the change
these to their proper now now you'll
never you should never have two
variables named the same thing your
variables are case sensitive so even
though I could create a titled case over
with a capital T and it would be a
different variable it's bad convention
you need to name it something else okay
but it would technically work so here it
was kind of like electricity even though
I could technically work it's bad
practice like electricity
yeah like wiring like just because you
can get the light bulb to turn on does
it mean you wired it correctly yes I've
never heard that analogy in this case
say HGTV shoutout Hey
so so far what we've done is we should
um so we've talked about how to add
numbers right so it works for all now
okay hey Matt well you only have to be
pretty much good at algebra to be a good
developer for the most part so about
geometry can you be good at challenging
if what you're working on requires
geometry and just it just attacks like a
geometry algebra kicked my ass okay well
you'll get better the more you go so in
this case we want our sum right here to
equal 20 how do what are we gonna do if
we change this you want it to equal 20
yeah so we have ten plus zero what do we
do what do we change well you could
change the 10 to 20 or you can put
another tenant right so what do you want
to do I was just put the 20 all right uh
actually we have to use the plus
operator yeah but we can add by zero we
had a zero that's fine and I'll work to
just 20 plus Sarah's trying to say that
great practice was keeping it simplified
yeah yeah but we're right now what we're
doing is we're learning symbols well
yeah we're learning the operators the
math operators so isn't it just a
conventional plus minus multiple to get
started yes so you can also - things so
we want this to be 12 so 45 minus 33
returns 12 this is where we pull out a
calculator all right so you can use
subtraction as well understand it yeah
okay
you can also use multiplication the way
you use multiplication is not within
axis with an aster yeah I learned that I
started using the calculator on the
computer all right came from so you have
8 times 10 it's going to return Haiti
all right and then divide is with the
slash so if we want it to return to
we're divided by 33 the quotient I I
think this is a good place to stop ok we
understand the four math operators yes
okay cool
so easily I don't we're gonna stop here
baby
okay cuz this is a new topic okay so um
we're at ham stand aside alright guys so
that was April's first introduction to
JavaScript
if I had one critique I think wanting to
know the end result without knowing the
path is something that sometimes you
just have to take a leap of faith with
when it come stand up is something you
just have to take a leap of faith with
when learning this sometimes is it may
not become it may not be apparent to her
quite yet why or how these things are
used because she hasn't she's not quite
there yet on how to think like a
developer how to think like a programmer
arm so let's do some review what was it
that we we learn triangle in sequential
order
so first we learned how to comment okay
how and there's two types of comments
what are they single line and multiple
line okay then what we what we start
with assessment no with variables
variables and the different types of
variables so there's no undefined string
number symbol think I'm missing one
boolean boy boolean bully not bullion
bullion and what's a boolean I don't
know
true or false cheerful we haven't used
to yet okay and then we started learning
how to use those things and how
variables can be defined and called upon
and given values with assessment and
then we learned that initializing kit is
the first step towards
and assessment if you want to be correct
so we learned how to initialize values
giving them the initial value
we also learned how to that you can use
a variable with another variable or even
use a variable within itself when using
the assignment operator and then we've
followed it up by showcasing how to add
subtract know the basic and well we also
showed how you could join strings
together using the plus sign no we
didn't get that yeah we did one time one
little line remember where's like signs
divers remember I am a street or
something it has a bar because using the
plus sign well okay so if you have two
strings not just numbers yeah but old
yeah so what do you think it sounds like
a pain in my ass
what yeah it's gonna be it's gonna be a
difficult path but this is this is what
will separate you from a web designer
making forty five thousand to being on
the path to be in full stack developer
making over six that that's six six
figures yeah I don't think that it's
hard it's not hard it's just it's like
learning how to read and write all over
again
like it really is I can think back to a
time when I was learning how to sound
out my valves and here I'm like trying
to sound out my new data strings
like uhm yeah I know it's just a
learning curve just like everything else
I'm glad that I'm old enough to
understand it still think ours at a
moment there I was like maybe I'm too
stupid for this that's just a new baby
um but so my suggestion for you is
tomorrow to finish up the one or two
changes you have to your to your um your
tribute page
and then start on your portfolio page
and try to just recreate the portfolio
they have but with your own images and
your own data and and your own there's
not gonna be any JavaScript in that okay
so work on that and our lessons will
continue going through the JavaScript
well I'd want to work on that and I want
to work through the JavaScript that we
already gone over so don't forget it so
I can start initializing X I know I know
how you learn okay so if you want to
search the JavaScript what I was gonna
do up to the point that we did okay good
all right guys are there any questions
for April or myself and as always guys
make sure to join our Facebook group
code Tech and caffeine the link is in
the description and if you want to
support me and in effect support April
because I pay all the bills up in this
fish you can at fate John can slash
coding tutorials 360 ah ah or you just
want to help but man you know what we're
in the opposite shoes Oh quite some time
ago okay no no baby that's why I'm happy
and did I rub that in your face now
no I do not she did not a single time I
will I will say that fact I encourage
him to be a gamer okay wait he wasn't
making jack as long as he loves
what he was doing that's what mattered
she's right she's right she's a better
person I am ah which instantly puts me
below um oh yeah guys um thank you for
watching hey uh April how do you think
you're doing so far I I think that I may
be doing better than I thought I was
because Dillon was really surprised
about my HTML page in which case I was
like this is total so I'm happy
about that
win-win I feel somewhat I feel
accomplished and then for this Java
thing at least I got the hole at least I
got it and I'm not sitting here still
trying
to figure it out for me that's also
another win because I have walked away
from classes where I feel like totally
helpless or hopeless and that's always a
big problem for me so at least I'm not
walking away from something that I
wasn't able to not not understand so I
feel like I'm doing pretty good I was
concerned for a little bit um in the
back of my mind I was like freaking out
I don't know if you guys saw it but I
was but I think that dylan dinger is
definitely big help so I'm happy with
that I only charge of the same rate I
charge you guys to assess I have my own
way Bing
[Laughter]
why don't you why don't we wrap it up
about the project that you want to build
coke horse ass what kind of stuff we
want to build when you're much better Oh
so there's actually already an
application that I want to build that's
kind of my fire underneath me to keep me
going um I was I'm really affected by
our consumption um and I really do
believe that obsession of what
consumption of food so there's tons of
starving people around the world and we
all know this and and it doesn't have to
be in Africa or somewhere that you don't
even know it could be I went to college
and I would give my meal plans away
because my mom would come and bring me
food every week and I would just eat the
food and I didn't really use my meal
plans but I knew that there are other
students who were going to school and in
class of me who hadn't eaten
so anyways um I started doing a lot of
research on that and it's kind of
disgusting on how much food we throw
away it's disgusting
so um it's kind of my way of helping the
world have something that they can use
that's user friendly to help with that
so that families aren't wasting food and
aren't wasting money because we are
stuck in this type of economy where you
need money to survive and I think that's
total I think we're better than
that I think we're smarter than that and
I want to help contribute to that so the
the app in it and its core that April is
described to me is she wants to
essentially help people um she wants
build app where you don't waste your
food as much and so you keep track of
what groceries you've use what you have
left and what recipes may be available
for you to use yeah with the with the
food that you already have the food that
you have um so she's a much better
person than me
I won't I just want to make money give
you the money people I don't care what
I'm doing and I also plan for the app to
be nonprofit so it's gonna be hugely
based on contribution from people who
want to get involved and I'm hoping that
a lot of people are going to want to get
involved because like they say anywhere
it starts at home you want to develop a
good habit to exert out into the world
it starts at home
alright on that note have a good one as
we are in our home and I'm actually
burning up oh no honey alright yeah
alright well I'm going through menopause
thank God I didn't want it too young for
us got like 20 more years
alright guys um thank you for watching I
hope you are doing your hour a day um I
am going to get back to my grind from
here I
I hope these are helping um where day
three of we got 97 more of these
 and probably a few wrap up
so Oh doing good so far we haven't
fought once so that's good
I'm just too tired to fight I really
thought you'd get frustrated with me if
I didn't get something I'm very patient
guy ha ha ha biggest joke of her patient
yeah hi baby
Ross a black hey mama
Oh was it cold long and prosper cut long
and prosper guys this is B</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
