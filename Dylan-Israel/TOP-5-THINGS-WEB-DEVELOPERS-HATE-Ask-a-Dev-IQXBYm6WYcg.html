today we are going to be talking about
the top 5 worst things about web
development the things that that make
you say did I make the right choice is
this for me I am so over this right now
and then you calm down and go back to
life but these are the 5 things that has
a developer at least in my experience as
well as I've talked to a few people
about this list and let me let's be
clear these are only 5 of many right
anybody if with any job no matter how
much you love it there's always those
things that are gonna make you start
popping off in the middle of the night
in the middle of work day whatever it is
but these are five of the key ones and
we're gonna be jumping right in I guess
before we get sorry I just wanted to
share the humble cloud computing bundle
so if you're interested in learning
things like docker AWS as their cloud
native Python there's a great bundle
going on for $1 king of three books for
eight dollars or more you get also these
five fifteen dollars or more you get
about seven more so if you're if that's
something you're interested in I
couldn't recommend the humble
organization even more it's a great way
to raise money for charity you also have
of course the way of choosing if all
your money goes to charity if all your
money goes to me if you want to help me
out that way as well so I hope you
decide to check it out the link will be
in the description below alright I got
my list right here this is gonna be a
good one so let's just jump right into
the the cancer oftentimes referred to as
the cancer of love development Internet
Explorer oh my goodness this raggedy-ass
web browser how much of a headache has
it cost for the entire industry that it
is just even exist in Safari give it
another year you're not too far behind
so get your together please
web browsers Safari Internet Explorer
that's the first that net for me it's
just the the all star of this list these
aren't any particular order but I think
we had to start with the IE so let's go
to number two now this is going to be
maybe a
a little bit more of a controversial one
as legacy code there's something about
going through other people's cragit e.s
code where you're just like why did you
do this what what technologies are we
using when was this written like was
this written before I was born who wrote
this did they could they only see out of
one eye what is wrong with this legacy
code and what why does it why do they do
it this way it would have been so much
easier to do it like this and you start
questioning everything and then
sometimes when you go in and you are
that's my cat tearing stuff up but
sometimes you go and and you're you you
you're like oh I'm just gonna I'm just
gonna refactor this and before you know
it you've now broken eight other
applications where this code was being
used and then maybe you get a little
humbled but legacy code is something
that I think a lot of people is like Oh
like because a lot of what you love
about web development at least in my
case and I would assume most people's
cases is you're oftentimes building
something new building something from
scratch and that's the fun that's the
sexy part of of web development where
now you get to but with legacy code a
lot of times you're just maintaining
doing slight modifications text edits
nothing super exciting and in my in my
experience so the the third one is the
merge conflicts the merge conflicts see
oh my god man I told you I was working
in this why are you working on this now
we gotta go and spend all this time
merging it but it's okay you do what I
do you just delete their code cuz I
ain't wasting time you I'm just kidding
don't do that don't do don't do that you
know they're just pushed straight to
master and whatever happens happens now
I'm totally just key but merge conflicts
are something that are pretty common
especially depending how many developers
you have and who's working on what
projects win and there's just something
about that version control where things
get jumbled up and you know sometimes
it's easy to fix sometimes it's not
often times you know some people will
use gooeys specifically for that
that aspect of version control I I've
used gooeys for a lot of things such as
tortoise gate I'm trying to get better
at the command line version of git and I
have recently but merge conflicts are
are horrendous
so the the the next one is one I mean
it's gonna take a little bit of
explaining and for the developers and
you make you so a lot of you will be
able to relate but for the developers
you may not have even realized it but
now that we're gonna mention this next
one you're not going to be able to stop
hearing it for your entire career the
just key word and what I mean by that is
the the the individuals project managers
the the business whatever whoever it may
be who's going to assign you aspects
they say can't you just do this uh you
know it's only it's just gonna take a
few a few minutes of time I'll just add
it into your sprint I'll just add it
into your projects it just doesn't seem
that hard I don't understand so you'll
start hearing this just word and if you
start thinking about it and now that
I've mentioned it you'll go into work
tomorrow and and I promise you you're
p.m. you're whoever it is that your boss
that just word is gonna be thrown out
quite a bit
the just key word is a is quite
legendary in my books now and I didn't
really realize I tell a co-worker
suggested I was like oh my goodness
you're so right about the just keyword
so um this is what I refer to as the
classic and some of you I let you sit on
that for a second and see if you can
guess what the classic is the classic is
the hey we need you to build this
immediately the hey this thing that is
super important super important we need
it but in reality is not that important
and you just that's just sort we just
need you to get this to us tomorrow we
just need this immediately the the super
important project that had no planning
and just came up last minute those sorts
of requests see hey we need this
immediately it's so important in reality
it's probably not any more important
anything else going on in your sprint in
your in your workflow but those are that
that is that is one of the these are
probably my five personal favorites but
I have a list of five more maybe I'll do
a part two later on this is a and I by
the way uh when I make this list right
we're having some fun here you know it's
always fun to talk bad about ie least in
my book but wherever so funny I don't
want this to dissuade anybody from going
into the the web development field or
the software development field because
it's there's a lot more positives and
these sort of things that that weigh you
down and and drive you a little bit nuts
in the process and so the reason I say
that is I'll have a top five things I
love about web development coming out
and I'll link it in this video or I'll
come out two days after this video
however I release it but but what are
you what are you something
what's going on up there what are some
of your guys's
favorite I say favorite very loosely
where some year guys is I guess triggers
they so that's what these are really I
mean I don't really like the word
trigger but what are some of your web
development software development work
triggers in the workplace and if you
haven't worked as a software developer
tell us what some of your things are
when you are debugging when you are
whatever it is cuz it look this is this
is true I spent 40 to 60 hours a week
writing code I could go on for days for
takes just about ie and how much that
has caused me headaches ie8 yeah we're
gonna need ie8 compatibility what
Microsoft doesn't support ie why are we
supporting ie just this Donna and I
would question the sanity of somebody
who uses IE there needs to be some when
I see people use IE I wonder I wonder I
wonder about why like what is going on
man what do you know that I don't know
like cuz there's got to be some sort of
secret loophole where you can you know
hack the credit union or something in IE
because I'll bust it about what what
browser it is but all jokes aside it's
it's a wonderful field I don't want to
swayed anybody but uh I hope you guys
enjoyed this video as always don't
forget to comment like subscribe share
support me on patreon Safari though find
that I eat in that Safari I will do one
more
what do one more give you a little sneak
peek at the next top five so uh well
which one do we want to which which one
from this this highly coveted list uni
Tucker
so I guess the universal bonus one would
be users and what I mean by that is
because we love our clients we love you
clients you pay the bills
but sometimes you all do very strange
things sometimes you break things that
nobody in their right mind who would be
using the product would ever do but you
clients you users you have figured it
out and you you are the epitome of
Murphy's Law whatever can go wrong will
go wrong and as frustrating as it is
there's a certain beauty that goes along
with this ability to no matter how many
unit tests are written no matter and no
matter how much QA is done no matter how
much end-to-end testing no matter how
much forethought has gone into the
development cycle somehow you always
find a way to find the one way that it
can break and the one way that makes
absolutely no sense out of you there and
for that you get my respect because you
can do something no one else can so
that's our bonus one uses as always guys
thanks for watching I look forward to
the top 5 or top 10 things that you'll
love about web development or I
personally love about web development
bye guys what's what's going on baby
what browser are you using quick shout
out to device plus comm if you're
interested in the latest io tease hacks
do-it-yourself projects revolving around
Arduino and Raspberry Pi there's some
great how-to guides I highly encourage
you to check them out and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
