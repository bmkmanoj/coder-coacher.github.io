in free code camp in responsive web
design design starting our basic CSS so
CSS for those who don't know it stands
for cascading style sheets what that
basically means is it's how we make
things look good it's how we set the
background color it's how we choose this
what font to use it's how we set this
button to green how when we hover over
it it does certain things so this color
fonts positioning spacing sizing
decorations transitions it's a crucial
part of the web and it's used in
everything that you can imagine you use
this a style tags you'll see more of
this but difficulty how you usually do
your styling is an external style sheets
where you basically link it up with a
link tag we'll go into that more but you
can also do what they're talking about
here which is inline styling and CSS
refers to the selector target element
the way HTML and your web page works it
works in the Dom which is a document
object model the document is your HTML
document that's really all you really
need to know from this section more than
anything else let's just jump right in
and see what we're trying to do so
you'll see we have our cat photo app
let's see what do they want us to do so
when we run this let's run the test to
see what we have here so our cat photo
app which we designed in the HTML
section we want our h2 element to be red
now we can do that by going into our h2
element and do what's called inline
styling which is right here so we do
style is equal to and then we're gonna
put the attribute in this case it's
color and then the value which will be
red so we want to put color is red now
when we run this we have now just styled
our cat photo app right here and we're
it's now taken effect that's basically
inline styling
now what we want to do here is it says
we want to remove our inline styling and
instead we want to create a style
element so instead of putting it in
there we can also do the style tags or
style elements and we can put various
this is would be similar to how we would
do a cascading style sheet and in here
we're gonna use our h2 element target or
h2 element and notice how we put the
brackets in between here this is
basically where we're gonna put our
attributes and their values for our h2
and then we want to make our element
here our color of our element to blue
like so very nice now as we continue on
you'll see our h2 element should be red
okay let's go ahead and change that to
red oh we want to give it a class okay
so instead of targeting it like this we
can now assign classes this is pretty
simple
classes are basically think of them
almost as styling variables that you can
use over and over and over again so in
this case we have class and we're going
to set this equal to red dashed X we
haven't defined this yet we're going to
define it now
now when defining a class use a dot
infra-red of the name to basically tell
your style shoot hey this is a class and
we're going to call it red text and in
here we're gonna set set our attribute
our color attribute when we set it to
red this we're gonna set the basically
our CSS class is the red text we're
assigning the class here it's gonna
inherit its attributes we're not going
to need to do inline styling or anything
else the reason we do it like this is if
we wanted to add additional stylings it
would be relatively easy and we wouldn't
have to keep on doing a huge long chain
of styling in our HTML now should be red
should adds class your first paragraph
element and as I was saying earlier we
can actually reuse this class so we
don't have to retype out
style tank instead we're anti pout class
and we're just gonna sign read - text
first element should be read second down
the second third should not alright cool
so when we run it you'll see now this is
right as well we didn't have to do any
additional styling all we had to do was
assign the class that we generated that
we created excuse me now another aspect
we've been messing around with color is
font - size now between the style tags
we want to give the P elements the font
size of 16 now how we do this is we can
go ahead and just target the P element
like before and we want to do font -
size and we want to do this 16px so
you'll see that the font size changed
ever so slightly and we want to do we
want to use a certain type of phone the
way that we assigned font families our
font types is font - family and we want
to pass in mono space like so this here
is gonna change what type of font is
outputting you'll see that it changes
into this other this other type right
here now not your browser will come with
some predefined fonts but not everything
will you know there's thousands of
custom fonts out there lobster is a
popular one to import a font you can do
it with these link tags in our HTML
document is one way of doing it so let's
go ahead and do that so link this is how
you import a style sheet or a font
notice how there's no closing tag and
we're just gonna pass an href to it and
let's actually just copy this over so I
don't miss type anything and I'll
explain it so we have our link tag let's
get a little bit space in here basically
this is where the font is located this
is just telling the browser that it's a
style sheet and this is just saying that
the type is text and CSS now if we
wanted to assign that font family
all we would have to do is pass in
lobster-like shop so we run our runner
here and you'll notice how now we have
oh excuse me I signed it to the wrong
class so what we wanted to do was in our
read our read text here we also wanted
to sign the font - family the lobster
and the pea should still use the font
mono space so now you'll see our cat
photo app will change it's fun h2 CSS
selector oh excuse me if they wanted us
to sign it to the h2 directly and not
through the class that we create kind of
silly but we can do it
so font - family and then we'll do
lobster so this is going to affect all
h2s and not just the classes that we did
before still the same affects us we only
have one h2 element at this time now as
we move forward you can see that there's
multiple fonts and you're saying Dylan
why would we have multiple fonts
basically not all browsers have the same
fonts so this comma says if there is no
Helvetica go ahead and use sans-serif
now if there's neither of those your
browser will use some sort of default
font same thing goes for a lobster so we
want our h2 element to use lobster that
test pass should degrade the font when
lobster is not available so when
lobsters not available we wanted to use
mono space cool so what's gonna happen
now is this link tag that we put up here
we're gonna comment that out now a quick
quick little side note yeah you can
it's a comment things out is the carry
exclamation - - then - arrow now if you
want a little quick tip to kind of save
yourself a ton of time hold down control
and hit slash and it will do it
automatically as well as make it so that
you can comment in and comment out
ferret it relatively easy so now that we
comment this out it's going to
you fought to the mono space so let's go
ahead and run this you know see right
here and now is defaulted to our mono
space because we got rid of our lobster
library thus our font-family our first
choice fails so now we're gonna assign
additional styling here and we're gonna
sign it on the image level like so and
the our image should be a hundred pixels
wide so we can do that with with the
width attribute we're just gonna sign
100 px see if i zoom in a little bit
that will help yeah oh that's better
we'll do it like so so we're gonna sign
the width attribute and it's gonna be
100 pixels wide oh excuse me and instead
of image we actually wanted to create a
class here and we're gonna do smaller -
image remember classes start with the
dot and we're gonna jump to our image
here which is searching searching
searching where is image why can't I see
the image here we are okay so we're
gonna assign the class equal to a
smaller image now notice that we don't
actually put the dot in here this is not
something to do you're only do the dot
in your style sheets and your style tags
nice so we still wanted to have the
smaller image cool your image should
also have the class that green border so
let's go ahead and define another class
and you'll notice now that we can
actually add more than one class when
using classes in our style sheet so
let's go define that so this is the
class name is thick - green - border and
within here what we want it to do is we
want to give it a a border let's see
what I forget its border - color okay so
we're gonna do it as separate parameters
set separate attributes so we're gonna
give it a color green
give it a width of 10 pixels I believe
right and then a border of style so this
is border - width of 10 pixels and then
we're gonna give it a border - style of
solving so what this basically means is
we're gonna add a border around our our
image which I forgot to add here so
let's jump into our image class here and
we're gonna add the game of chess Nick -
green - border so when we run this
you'll see that now we have a border so
this border its color is green is with
the stem pixels and it's type is solid
now let's continue on your image element
should have the class a thick green
border your image should have a border
of 10px our border radius excuse me
so border radius is basically how much
the image curves in around the corners
that's all that really is going on here
so we don't we don't really like that
there's rigid corners like so what we
want to do instead is one a assign
border dash radius and we want to make
it slightly curved because we you know
for style purposes we think this looks
better right now and you'll see when we
run it our corners curve ever so
slightly now say we wanted to make it
circular we could do that as well but
instead of ten pixels the way that we
would do that is by assigning border
radius of 50% and this will make any
square into a circle and you'll see like
so you have your perfect circle around
your picture which is really helpful so
that you don't have to customize all
your pictures you can just assign the
CSS and have your pictures as circles
even though they're squares you don't
have to go in and edit them now
what we want to do now is we want to
target all our divs so in here we want
to give our we want to say look for our
divs our containers we want to have a
background color equal to one of the
built-in colors that are there so silver
for instance so when we run this we'll
have a nice silver background like so we
need to go ahead and give your
development the class over where is our
div element so I don't see a it looks
like they didn't assign us a div here
but look oh they did your div element
should have the class silver background
so this is my fault I forgot to create
the class I misread that so let's go
ahead and just add this in real quick
and we already know everything how to do
this so a class swap out our art term
here it will have the same CSS effect
but we need to make sure we followed in
the instructions so there is our silver
background like so pretty cool so
we've been working with classes now
let's talk about working with IDs
classes you can reuse things again and
again and again with IDs you really only
want to use it once that identifies that
person like my name is dylan chris for
israel there may be a ton of people or
my social security is a better example
there may be people with the same first
name with Dylan in theory there should
not be people with the same social
security number and that's kind of how
you should think of they both do the
same thing except IDs or singular
classes are multiple you can use them
again and again so we want to give the
our form element an ID because we only
have one form right so let's go ahead
and find our form which is right here
and we want to give it an ID of cat
photo form all we have to do is pass in
the ID attribute and run our test so we
assign the ID we haven't done anything
with it yet that's just how we assign it
now we want to go ahead and target that
so the the main difference in your
styling to kind of other than the fact
that you use one but you have to let the
stylesheet know one's a class once a
element and one is an ID and the way
that you tell it's ID is with this
hashtag or if you're an old sob like
myself the pound sign but I got told in
other videos to stop using it it dated
myself so we are doing the hash tag
because that's what the young kids be
saying background - color and we're
gonna sign green to this as well
and I we should be good now so now
what's gonna happen is the form element
should have background s color of green
of course make sure that you pass in the
the name of your ID which is cat photo
form what's these and continue on like
so so you'll see down here this is now
green now we can also do some padding so
this is all very close together on the
edges not something you want
now you'll see our red box has padding
and what we want to do is now assign it
to
our green the green box padding right
here is 10 pixels instead what we want
to do is give it 20 pixels so look look
closely at all right our box here and
you'll see now oh we got a new app let's
actually let's reset this one so that we
can see it we're still working with the
the old info so you'll see right here we
have a little bit of padding on here 10
pixels let's actually take out and apply
0 pixels so that we can really see how
much padding is getting added so you'll
see right here this left and right or
the top bottom left and right is not
adding any padding so what we're
actually going to do is add 20 pixels of
padding all around it that means top
bottom left or right you're not going to
see it on the left or the right side
because the width is greater than that
padding right now but you'll see now
this expanse expands it expands based
off of our padding above it now there's
padding which is the space of the
element with itself and then there's
margin which is the space between
multiple elements so margin is another
thing that you can do you'll see right
now this is basically the space in here
and what we're gonna do to kind of
showcase this is we're gonna go back to
0px and you'll see that the margin
around it around the the item on its
side is zero pixels so I did it so what
we want to do is assign a margin of 20
pixels and you'll see it expands and so
the items around it expanded alongside
of it like so so an elements marching
controls the amount of space between the
border and its surrounding elements now
you can also make this in the negative
direction so let's go ahead and do -
15px for our margin and you'll see that
we got rid of what was around it because
without that border we basically brought
it in it doesn't exist and everything
moves accordingly
now what we are doing cover it again
left right top and bottom what we're
gonna do now is we're gonna only target
certain aspects of it so we're gonna go
piece by piece padding - top you can do
hanging - tapas 40px let's run it so you
can see you'll see right here we added
additional padding to our element here
so this is 40 pixels of padding right
here and then we go on and we want to
give it 20 pixels of padding to the
right we can do that by just doing
padding - right and we'll do 20 px and
we're go ahead and run that like so so
this is pushing it a little bit and we
want to do it to the bottom so it kind
of evens out so padding - bottom that's
20 px we run around like so a little bit
better still off-center let's go ahead
and do padding - left I did another 20
px as well and you'll see we finally
move Oh shoes make 40px kind of move
back to into space so that we match with
this right here but you can see how the
padding depending on if you're doing the
top left bottom right will affect the
element in various directions you can do
the same thing with margin so we
showcase out doing padding it's the
exact same concept with margin where you
do margin - top and we're gonna scoot
through this as we kind of demonstrated
a similar thing and padding of 40 pixels
we can do the same thing with the right
element so that's just margin - right of
20 pixels and then we have margin -
bottom of how much should we doing for
that 20 pixels
and then we have margin - left
of 40 pixels so you do that and you run
it and our margins are all the same I
change as well now we had showcased that
we could use various various padding's
patterns I stopped paying this right but
if you just use padding and you want to
apply it it goes right let's listen to
this I forget I always forget the order
but you can you can assign it in one
sort of attribute like this and put four
values in there and it'll sign it
accordingly
so it goes padding top padding right
padding bottom padding left okay cool so
let's go ahead and do that and you'll
see that we still get we'll still get
the same thing we have now by doing
padding and instead no top we're gonna
pass in 40 pixels for the top our next
thing is we want to do 20 pixels for the
right we want to do 20 pixels for the
bottom so it goes top right bottom left
and then we're gonna do another 40
pixels for the bottom and so in here it
simplifies our code instead of having
four attributes we just have one and
everything works accordingly so using
clockwise notation to specify the margin
of an element exactly the same concept
where now we're gonna do margin and
instead of passing in four attributes
for a new one with 40px
then we have 20px then we have another
20px and then we have another 40px for
the left-hand side all around it's I
didn't know the name of it but
apparently it's called clockwise
notation so remember all right now I
will always remember clockwise notation
because you started at the top go the
quarter all right go to the bottom and
then left that makes complete sense good
job whoever decided that I like that a
lot so you can also use what's called
the mm at the unit of measurement and
I'm not gonna you this is kind
of a silly thing am I in my my opinion
but the M is a relative unit so is
relative to length values it's kind of
strange but basically it's it's a it's
relative to the font sizes and
things like that where it's 1.5 m/s so
it's like 1.5 times the the font size
being used it's kind of a way of looking
at it so the font the red box should
have a padding property so let's go
ahead and add padding and what do we
want to give it give it 20 pixels all
around oops
padding 20 px and we want to give the
LMO padding up 1.5 mm so instead of
applying 1.5 am i are 120 pics so we're
gonna 5 1.5 m which will inherit a
certain amount and emphasize that like
so now CSS style the HTML body element
so you can do you can style the body
element as well so before we've let's go
ahead and run this so that we have a
blank screen here we've been targeting
elements you can do the same thing with
body you can go ahead and assign the
background color of black you'll see
that I'm using the dark version if you
want to turn that on you can do so in
your settings I believe somewhere that's
where I did it somewhere in your
settings so let's go ahead and put black
run this BAM so we get our nice sort of
midnight black section like so excuse me
you can also inherit styles from the
body elements so a lot of you don't
always have to define things to be very
specific for instance if we throw a div
or an h1 element let's go ahead and
follow the example I'll explain so let's
go they want us to create an h1 element
and we're gonna put hello world pretty
cool and uh first for those who don't
know this is good from line one to the
end of this document that we're all
considered that this is part of the body
so I know you don't see a body tag but
this is all part of the body so we have
our closing tag and we want to give the
body element the property color green so
this is gonna set the font color in our
h1 element you're like well we're not
targeting it with a class and ID or init
the element itself but because this h1
element is
nested it's within the body what happens
is is it inherits that property now if
we go when we write our own styling for
h1 or a class or an ID that is more more
that's nested deeper for instance so the
class is nested in the body element
we're gonna obviously use the class or
the ID but since nothing is nothing is
there it's gonna inherit it from the and
we'll run this real quick so we can see
it you'll see that it inherits the value
same thing with the font family that
we're gonna assign so instead of
actually going through each element and
having to assign the font family and the
color to green we can just go ahead and
do it in the in the body and all our all
our code will inherit it like so so this
is why I was talking about a second go
about prioritizing one style over
another now we want our so right now we
have green text however we're gonna go
ahead and to create a class called pink
- text and when we assign this class
we're gonna with that battery it's gonna
be pink so let's go ahead and get this
set up
so I'm just spell and we're gonna assign
a class here it's going to override that
class and use our pink text class
because it's it's what's ever closest
right if the h1 is nested with nothing
in it it's gonna inherit from the most
nested item in this site the class is mo
more nested and directly in here so it's
gonna inherit that and now we have our
pink text which looks very good with the
black by the way so every dude pink I'm
black good job on that
so we have pink text your h1 element
should have blue text so override styles
sup subsequent CSS so you can actually
override based on which of these text
goes first so we're gonna have class one
in class two it doesn't matter which our
listen HL element what matters so what
what they're trying to say right now is
that when we type in our class it
doesn't matter what order they come in
into your class so we're going to let's
start by creating our blue text class
and we're gonna sign a color of blue and
let's go ahead and sign this class blue
dashed X and let's run it and you'll see
that the text is blue however let's just
showcase that if we move this text it's
still blue that has no effect but if we
actually go ahead and pass this above it
the text is going to be pink the reason
for that is because in your CSS if you
have contradictory statements like this
where you're assigning two classes it
doesn't matter what's going on when
you're assigning it in the element the
last value will be the value that you're
your H 1 in this case takes so since
blue as you're working your way from the
top of the document to the bottom of the
document that bottom document will
override the value of your CSS that's
what's going on here declarations by
styling ID attributes so your h1
elevation of the class pink text should
also have the class blue text we want to
give it an ID of orange text and we're
gonna color orange and then create this
h1 and we're gonna pass in the ID here
as well so you can't have IDs and you
can have classes assign and you'll
notice let's go ahead and type this out
and run it you'll notice that this is
orange let's actually move this around
and run this you notice is still orange
the reason for that even though it's not
the last one it's because it's an ID and
it's singular it's making the assumption
that the IDS are more important than the
classes because there's only one of them
thus it will always take the ID for
these alter for this overriding values
okay so we're talking about a lot of it
and this is really good because this is
like kind of things that you pick up
along the way of being a developer that
maybe you're not taught in a traditional
course and they're really covering
things that are kind of relevant that
you really need to know now we are we
have two we have our pink text we have
our blue text we have our ID and now
we're gonna go back to our inline
styling so the thing that trumps IDs and
everything else is our inline styling so
now when we call color white it will
trump everything else because the idea
is look we define this in a style sheet
but we're defining it we're basically
hard coding it here so you should have
you should appreciate the fact that that
is going to always be the case all right
so so we talked about overriding with
inline styling we talked about
overriding with style tags classes how
that works IDs there's also this
important tag that you can throw on here
what this basically does is it says
forget the normal overriding rules just
listen to what I have to say this is
basically what it does so in our pink
text the way that you use it you just
use exclamation point important and now
when we run it it's gonna the pink text
which should be the very first one over
over and basically it's going to now be
the most important and thus the text is
going to come out now use hex code for
specific colors now you can also use so
we've been using these these words here
that are there's like 250 predefined
words I believe something like that but
you can also use hex codes which have
tens of thousands different colors by
using the hash tag and passing in the
six values that go with it so this will
still set it to black so it's still
black the background color but we just
instead of using the word black we use
the hex code now give your h1 element
the text I am red so right here we have
red text so we go ahead and assign red
here like so so this will be red use the
hex code color for red was that
so red instead of red we use a hex code
which is f F 0 0 F F 0 0 0 and then
we're going to give the I am green so
the green color is and you don't tipping
honest you don't really need to memorize
most of these you'll memorize some of
the more common ones like white and
black basically I don't really have any
of them ever I said but as you as you
kind of move forward you know most of
the time look for colors that you like
and go on from there there's so many
that you're only going to memorize a few
the web design and development isn't a a
thing that you memorize is the thing
that you say hey I'd learned about hex
colors and now I know how to use them an
orange that's hashtag FF a500 now when
we run this you'll see that we have all
our colors now also notice that you
don't have to use caps in your f FS and
your letters if you don't want to use
abbreviated hex codes so you can also
use abbreviated hex codes where we want
to set the green color the abbreviated
version is 0 F 0 and then there's red F
0 0 and then we have fuchsia a fancy
color here fuchsia and then we finally
have cyan almost as fancy as fuchsia so
you can use these shorter text elements
as well and you'll see there is our
fuchsia our cyan our green in our right
you can also use RGB another way of
putting out colors the way that it
sounds for red green blue so you pass
that in like so you have these
parentheses and you pass in the red
value the green value and then the blue
value like so and now when we run this
our background color is this orange what
did I do wrong
255 165 is zero
your buddy element should I have a black
background oh whoops
my fault for not paying attention so
make sure it's black in that orange but
the same principle applies
there's also we're gonna do the same
thing with red here so as you might
imagine red green blue so red would be
RGB red would be zero or 255 0 comma
zero let's go ahead and run that so
there's our red we want blue you kind of
apply the same principle so if you don't
these you don't really not too hard to
memorize so instead of red no red no
green just blue and then whatever
orchard Texas which is the value they
give us here RGB and that's going to be
two eighteen one twelve to fourteen and
one more over here which is RGB and this
is finally going to be one sixty eighty
two and forty five let's go to run it so
it's just another way that you can
basically color these and that is the
end of our section up next it looks like
we're doing visual design and web
development so you go over more more but
many more topics but that was our basic
CSS course it's about five hours we did
it in about 45 minutes or so forty
minutes but as always guys I hope you
