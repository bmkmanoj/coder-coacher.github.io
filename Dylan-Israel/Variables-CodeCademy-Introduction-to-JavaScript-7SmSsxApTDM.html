in introduction JavaScript the the kind
of the introductory basic more basic
JavaScript course that code CAD me has
on their with their new rework site
we're on interactive lesson or variables
rather they're interactive lessons so
I'll try to be as detailed as possible
as this is an introductory course and
you may need a little bit of help with
this so let's go ahead and jump right in
cool so you don't remember from our last
video of variables basically something
you store data and it's a crucial part
of programming so we're gonna create a
variable here called strength now we're
gonna sign it equal to a string of
57,000 pounds so keep this in my deep in
mind that this is these are words not
letter or not these are words and not a
number so we're storing a variable here
called strength with the string value of
50,000 pounds so what we want to do now
is go ahead and console out console.log
something else so if you remember we can
actually console dot log several things
out so how much stuff and a variable
hold notice how we're gonna put a extra
space at the end for good formatting and
then all we do is put a comma strength
and then put our variables so it's gonna
print out this first data and then the
second bit of data as well so we'll see
on the top right here once it runs
eventually any day now let's see they
may not have liked that we use single
quotes so we'll have to change us now
typically in JavaScript you can use
either types of quotes but keep in mind
that sometimes in code Academy is IDE
they're not a big fan of you change
yourself how much stuff can a variable
hold so you see right there
there it is how much stuff can a
variable hold and then we have a little
bit of a space and then our our second
part of that is the variable that we
inputted strength so we're going to
create a new variable called age and
we're just gonna store our number in
this now it knows it's a number just
simply by the type we'll go ahead and
put in 21 it's a good good number
actually that's not my age so we'll go
with my age 28 console dot log out age
so we're just gonna go ahead and console
that log out age as well so you can log
out just a variable as well which you'll
be doing a lot in your code when testing
it looks like we want to create a
variable here called has pet
and we want to set it equal to a boolean
and we'll set it equal to true try to
run that so variables just a little note
here variables can hold any data type
the data types that there are you have a
race which are objects you have boolean
x' you have strings you have objects you
have probably you have undefined there's
it's quite a few which I believe
undefined if you look up the site might
actually be an object but that's more
technical stuff don't don't worry about
that right now
so we're gonna go ahead and create a
variable here called morning alarm just
really getting comfortable with creating
variables and because the syntax wanted
us to do it I usually use double quotes
no real reason other than that's what I
do but since we're using code Academy is
IDE we will go ahead and do that so we
notice the camel case right here camel
case is where basically of two words
starting on the second word you're going
to capitalize the letter here so if this
was like morning alarm night we would
capitalize the end so something to keep
in mind you definitely want to follow
the standard naming convention you also
reset the value of a variable so
originally our when we set the value of
morning alarm Billy 6:30 a.m. it is
actually 1 a.m. right now so we'll go
ahead and do that it is quite late but
that's what I get for drinking energy
drink at like 8 p.m. at night and then
we're gonna go ahead and console out the
value make sure we understand what we're
doing here again we can output data
in our console multiple pieces of data
and I got a console put morning alarm
when BAM and now when we run this it
will then I'll put our data correctly
which is 1:00 a.m. because we reset the
value here of our variable all right so
we're just going to create a variable
here called favorite animal again with
the camel case and my personal favorite
animal is a cat I am just a fan of cats
so we're gonna then go ahead and Susie
we are gonna console dot log out our
favorite animal you'll notice I'm doing
this on line three because we got to
reset the value here so we want to do
the first value my favorite animal space
and then comma and then we want to have
our second input our second input our
our variable favorite animal and we
wanted to come up koala so all we have
to do here is go ahead and reset this
equal to koala
it's gonna run that so you'll see we get
the correct output because we reset the
variable here with our code so let's see
what's going on here
did I spell something incorrect
it looks like everything's then you just
closed French what are we doing
incorrectly use the plus operator okay
so instead of a comma what we can
actually do here is we can use the plus
operator to combine the string that's
what's going on here it will come out
the same it's just a little bit
different typically this is how I'll do
it I find this much more intuitive than
with commas so cool
so what we learn in this this
introduction of JavaScript variable
section we learned a little bit more
about variables we learned how to reset
the value or update the value would
probably be the better way of saying it
we also learned that we can use the plus
operator when when creating strings and
logging strings to combine variables
with a direct hard-coded string to make
a new string so I hope you guys found
this helpful thanks for watching don't

boot camp that's in front-end
development iOS or UX go ahead and give
them a shot tuition includes housing so
you can get up and go and fully immerse
yourself in the program as always thanks
