section we're gonna be going over how to
build tribute page using angularjs now
it may seem like overkill but I actually
think it's a great project to get
started to understand data binding to
understand how to basically set up an
angular application your controller your
app we're also going to be going over
ng-repeat which is use all the time all
right so what are we doing today today
we are going to be building a tribute
page for free code camp now we already
have this built out in jQuery now what
we're gonna be doing right now is we're
gonna build this out using angularjs
there's not a lot of angular that you
need to know to do this so we're gonna
start out if you know nothing about
angular and I'm going to explain going
there now what is a tribute page it's
basically this right here we're gonna
choose a character in our case we're
gonna go ahead and choose Vegeta from
Dragon Ball Z because we all know he's
better than Goku and then we're gonna go
and fulfill some of these user stories
now what are the user stories a user
story is basically something that the
user expects to do so in this case that
we they need to be able to view a
tribute page with an image and text and
we need to be able to click a link that
will take to go to like Wikipedia with
more information so that's what we're
gonna do here let's go ahead and jump
right in now let me pull up some code
real quick
we're in code pin go to it and if you
follow along feel free to create your
own code pin you could also do this in
an IDE or a text editor such as such as
atom which is my personal favorite so
let's go three FCC YouTube or FCC
angularjs build a page gonna save that
always named recess they can come back
and you know what you're looking for
first thing that we're gonna need to do
is go ahead and import angular like so
you'll see they'll import the most
recent version of of angular go ahead
and save that
and then our CSS go ahead and import
bootstrap I'm not sure if we'll use it
but we probably will what we're gonna do
here is we're gonna create a div to get
started this is gonna be where our app
scope goes yeah I'm not certain but I'm
pretty sure I change the name of this is
close this let's zoom in a little bit
more for everybody
save that and one more time we'll rename
this FCC angular J yes make sure it's
gonna just angularjs build a tribute
page alright now that we've imported our
libraries there's uh there's something
you have to do to get started you have
to initialize the app so all you have to
do here is angular module and it's gonna
taking two parameters it's gonna take in
the name of the application and we'll
try we'll just call it app and then it's
gonna take in a function and then what's
in here is where you can define your
controller your controller you basically
can have one application and various
controllers so controllers are based
we're only going to have one controller
because the controller is certain where
certain points of your code will run
basically it's where your app runs and
so you may have multiple controllers
your app may be the whole application
well maybe we have just a page app where
this certain pages use this controller
but it basically breaks up your features
now what we can do here let me go ahead
and pull up this code because this is
one of those things where you type it
out once then you forget it and I don't
want to hold us up here so let me go
ahead and pull up a pin side-by-side
here I was working on
so you just start off by defining your
application because we're doing this in
because we're doing this in code pen
it's slightly different we're actually
gonna store this in a variable so we're
just gonna move our class app is equal
this normally you wouldn't do this but
because we're doing this within free
code camp
that's what we're using this and sorry I
messed up right here already well we're
actually doing is we're just storing the
name of the app which was app and then
we will go ahead and put this and then
right here you depend you dependency
inject things if necessary so I've been
using a text editor it's a little
slightly different so what we're gonna
do here is we're gonna call class app
dot controller again this is slightly
different than how you would do it in a
text editor just so that we can show the
difference why don't we go ahead and
pull up a text editor with some angular
code in it something I was working on
earlier in the week so that you can see
exactly what is different between that
and a normal application if it ever runs
there we go so in this application let's
go ahead and jump into app yes you'll
see that I'm defining you there's no
variable setting and then we'll go ahead
and jump over to our controller and
there's it's slightly different here as
well we're just calling the angular
module and this in our example we're
actually defining a variable and setting
it equal to it not a big deal but when
you're just starting out it's good to
know that what you're gonna actually do
in a text editor so we're gonna find the
controller here and what we'll just call
this control controller 1 and then we'll
go ahead and put our function and our
scope object our scope object here our
scope parameter is actually the the real
backbone of angular this is
allow us to communicate with the do data
binding and communicate with the HTML so
what we're gonna do here is just go
ahead and make sure that we test
everything correctly to do that we need
to go ahead and assign our app and
assign our controller typically you will
sign the ng app directive like this in
your HTML tag but because we're using
code pin we're just gonna go ahead and
pass a dip in here and do the same thing
so what we have to do is just name our
class up like so so that's our ng up and
we can go ahead and nest our controller
within the same thing as well dude what
did I call it controller one
cool make sure I don't smell anything so
let's go ahead and test what we're doing
here
you basically assign everything to the
scope that you want to do over so we'll
do scope dot test one is equal to the
string hello world we're really just
doing this to test that we know what
we're doing and how we want to do it now
this is going to give value attics an
expression we could do something like
three plus two and it should evaluate to
five or it could just not work at all
and then we have to decide what we're
doing here so I name this class up this
is actually supposed to be our app
excuse me so we named it right here so
you see now that evaluates to five it
works the same with our variables so we
can do here is simply go ahead and do
test one and now we're outputting data
hello world so let's go ahead and start
creating an object that's gonna store
various things such as the stuff I just
closed out let me go ahead and open up
free code camp one more time so I can
have the tribute page code pin to
reference you to see what they have what
I know what I need to know it built so
we need it something with an image and
if you and a name so the first thing
that you'll notice is that it has a big
old name so maybe we can do an h1 tag so
we have an h1 close the h1 like so so
instead of h1 there's a little bit of
small like thing so it looks like an h3
/ h3 and then we have a image so let's
go ahead and put an image and what we're
gonna leave that like that for now
because of the what we're gonna be doing
with our image in a second so that let's
go ahead and jump forward now what we
want to do in our scope let's create an
object here
you could an array let's just create an
object to store some data we're gonna
create some key value pairs here the
first one we can go ahead and call this
heading and we'll put Vegeta actually
don't know Vegeta's last name full name
Vegeta name so let's go ahead and go on
the Dragon Ball wiki Vegeta's full name
is no last name for Vegeta alright so
we'll do this instead I kind of killed
the hype a little bit Vegeta and then
we'll do a subheading tag or a
subheading Q key value pair and we'll do
Prince of all Saiyans I apologize if I
misspelled sans you can all call me a
noob so what we're gonna do here similar
to how we would target a JSON object is
we're just gonna target out let's change
test one two
we'll just change it to Vegeta and we'll
say Vegeta dot heading so now our h1
content if you don't misspell it is
going to output so there's our Vegeta
yeah adds an h1 tag we can do the same
thing for a subheading like so so penny
I cheated us uh penny
Prince of all Saiyans which I think I
misspelled now next what we can do is we
can go ahead and create it go get an
image URL so put a comma go image URL
and then we're gonna pass in our image
let's go ahead and find a pretty badass
image of Vegeta real quick images let's
see let's see what we're working with
here you know something good something
good uh uh this one's pretty good
so the right-click copy image address
cut and close that now just gotta toss
that in like so typically you want to
use ng SRC sometimes you can use this RC
but what happens here is oh excuse me I
did this what happens here is sometimes
your code will generate before it
fulfills the the SRC requirement safe
use and G - SRC and angular directive it
will allow you to to go ahead and it
will load the angular before it loads
the image basically so you won't have
that issue now you may be saying as
someone in the chat just said isn't
using angular for this overkill for a
simple tribute page it is but if you're
new to using angular and you don't
really know how to get started there's
nothing better than getting started with
about as simple as an example as a
tribute page could get I highly
encourage people to learn I learned
angular by making my website and this is
basically a simple web page let's go
ahead and jump back in here so now we
have a bomb
inch of data so let's go ahead and jump
into Vegeta timeline and see if we can
get some similar data that we can then
use another directive and I can show you
how ng-repeat works so let's go ahead
and we'll create another thing here of
this object and this will be moments how
do we gonna do this we'll just call it
subheading two and what we're gonna do
is we're just going to call this
memorable moments and we're gonna pass
in a color h3 tag here / h3 and then
we're gonna use yeah alright peace
spoiler guess spoiler warning guys if
you're watching this so be careful you
may get some spoilers from Dragon Ball
super I'm a big fan by the way so we're
gonna call this Vegeta dot subheading to
go ahead and make sure everything's
working before moving forward where is
where is our so pending to
see if our image is pushing it off the
screen a little bit
oh there's our e alright so angular if
you're miss if you're misspelling your
directive what we'll actually do is
we'll get vegeta quotes that'll be
better and quicker if you're misspelling
your expression or you're calling the
wrong thing it's just not going to
display it you'll be able to
troubleshoot it by inspecting the
element and going from there so those
are memorable moments we'll go ahead and
change this to quotes that's go ahead
and close this out a little bit now what
we're going to do here is we're going to
create a new object in this case we're
gonna go ahead and use scope dot quotes
and this is going to be equal to an
array of objects and we'll put about
three or four in here and we'll just
have this quote and it'll put something
in here in a second and then we'll have
quote we'll put something in here in a
second and then we'll have quote and
then let's see if we can get some good
vegeta quotes so according this there's
25 great vegeta quotes
so take this one we're gonna go ahead
and throw it in here like so
we'll go ahead and find another one
someone will see go ahead and throw it
in here like so look at about five or so
hey I'm talking to Frieza that's a
pretty good one and quote and quote now
you're gonna see one of the one of the
great great things about ng-repeat it's
a very used tool directive and this then
of course it's over 9000 very nice so
what we're gonna do here is we're gonna
write two lines of code to output all
our quotes using a directive called
ng-repeat now what we're gonna do is
we're gonna create a simple unordered
list with a UL tag / UL we're gonna
create a simple one single list item
here and now we're gonna target our
array and entry repeat in our UL sorry
to say ng repeat he's equal to us an
item in our array in the array and
what's our array name quotes so just
some item we could rename this to eye we
could basically rename this anything we
want so typically the convention is to
say quote in quotes so you kind of know
it's one single object and what we're
gonna do here is simply target what we
want output in this case we're going to
put name dot quote and it's going to
output all five of our quotes like so
or you could like be like me and forgot
that we messed up these all need to be
objects sorry guys I forgot everything
needs to be an object here my bad so
let's go ahead and make these all
objects real quick it's an array of
objects woops news sometimes it's doing
this live you might drop the ball in the
little things but it's alright so you
have an array of objects like so and
then there we go now everything should
be peachy however is not outputting our
quotes
interesting so quoting quotes
oh I wonder Oh so see how we originally
named this to name it actually is this
item so excuse me
and let's not change put this might
cause an issue of doing quote and quote
so of course make sure you're naming
everything correctly and then we have
our five quotes like so so we have our
quotes with only one line of code you
can it's outputting additional HTML as
long as communicating the data over
correctly again did you get this to work
we use ng-repeat directive that takes in
an array and then outputs the HTML
that's within the scope of this array
for as many lates as you have you're
gonna need an array of objects to do
that we are working with angularjs one
and we're doing a little bit of HTML now
let's go ahead and jump back into here
we have this we also need a little quote
and then a link let's go ahead and do
this as well we'll just go ahead and add
a another comment here this would be sub
heading 3 and then we will put something
like why they always doing Vegeta dirty
and Dragon Ball super
find out more at and the next now you do
something like that
we just output a URL tell you could put
we could just put something like find
out more in the next and then maybe
we'll do an h1 tag and make it pop a
little bit so that's our subheading 3
I love the URL we put something like
very like a I want to do do like a
paragraph soon let's join h5 something
small h5 tag pass in our subheading 3 so
we'll call Vegeta dotsub edding 3 then
we can just pass in an anchor tag like
so give it an href actually let's do ng
href
this is similar to similar to why we use
ng source here is in case it loads
beforehand so what we'll pass in
something in a second let's go ahead and
pull up the Vegeta wiki page
pull that in just go ahead and copy this
link jump back Vegeta oh wait uh wiki
link their wiki URL put a comma like so
and then we can just go ahead and pass
this yeah I'm gonna put the word episode
there's actually a better way of doing
this
I'm just being kind of lazy you can
actually dynamically generate HTML in
your code but for the time being this is
a introductory one we'll do that next
one in the next episode pun intended
alright Vegeta dot wiki URL and then
let's go ahead and set target equal to
blank now this should build out the
entire entire thing so next episode
let's put a little bit of a space here
make sure everything works and bam it
goes to the Dragon Ball wiki I believe
that satisfies everything we need to do
we can definitely do some styling though
to make this look a little bit better
and we will jump in and do that right
now this is a nice basic introduction to
angularjs is showed off one of the key
things of the ng-repeat how that works
how to basically connect your scope what
a controller does and the app now I
believe there's something in here to
beautify this trying to remember how to
clean this up
tiny j/s there we go and then we'll do
tiny HTML cool
so there is this so we're done with the
angularjs part now what do we want to do
we could do some CSS I really hate doing
CSS should we do CSS or should we call
it a night
let's go ahead and do some CSS we can
add IDs here actually let's go ahead and
add it ID to the div and just put I
believe it's text Tech Center just
Center stuff from the I think maybe has
to be a class for the bootstrap class so
now everything is centered so if our
memorable quotes we're actually going to
remove the styling so to do that we're
using the text F center classroom
bootstrap to do that we can go ahead and
target the L eyes I'm gonna say
something like god I'm trying to
remember what it was I know you set it
to none I just don't remember this -
style as basic interpreters you can do
so we do list - style and we'll put it
none there's also a li class that does
this so there is that we can also target
our one image because it's getting a
little out of hand the size of it so
we'll do image and we'll set something
like with 500 px that's much more
manageable just go ahead and add some
curved corners on that so we can do
border - radius let's see what 25
percent looks like that's a pretty
hideous
I believe 50 percent wouldn't be kind of
safe
forget what a 5% you just want curved
corners there we go they're actually two
25px there we go so you got a nice
little Vegeta picture it's going to add
a background for this we can just target
the body and you can say background -
image URL let's go find a nice image the
site I prefer for like free images is
unsplash.com
I don't think we'll find any Dragon Ball
related once but maybe we can find an
earth one that might be somewhat
relatable
I like this one Percy of Nassau
so here we go here let's go past that in
and then we will do something like
background - sighs relieve is contain
I don't really like the it's not
contained I want it to connect do the
whole thing but not repeat so let's go
ahead and look up the background that
size property real quick what we are
looking for is cover I believe I think
about it
believe it is cover kind of looks like a
dragon ball that that looks okay nice we
can't really see the font anymore so
let's go ahead and change the font swing
just to color to white Prince of all
Saiyans memorable quotes let's make
everything pop a little bit more we'll
pull up some new fonts google fonts and
we'll get a new font to insert into here
as well
Oswald it's pretty good so let's see
here
we're gonna just copy this link and
import it into our HTML we can throw it
up in the head here save it and then
we'll say font - family oswald and there
we go we have just finished our our
tribute page for this um pretty fun I'm
gonna make this pop a little bit more by
taking this out of the h5 and then just
go ahead and put in a h3 tag around it
and drops down a level I hope you
enjoyed this I'm actually going to throw
one last - on these to make these quotes
not look like they're running into each
other so - - I hope you enjoyed this
