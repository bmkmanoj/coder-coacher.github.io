Rails you can see that some of these are
locked apparently coach Academy is doing
some sort of coke atom ePro thing but
it's not active yet so like all those
some of these labs will look familiar
they look like they're going to be
updated versions of the make a website
project so you won't be able to find
those anymore as well all right so let's
see how you incorporate database by
building a rails app for creating new
rails app named messenger app using
rails so we're gonna say rails new and
then we're gonna say messenger app so
that's gonna create everything cool so
next we want to install the gem files
install install the gems in gem file so
it's it's all here
let's see here
I'm not quite sure what they mean by
gemfile so maybe there's a folder
somewhere in here
no it doesn't look like
hmm let's just go ahead and check these
folders real quick
okay so I'm not quite sure but we see
right here create gemfile so we want to
install oh it's so where you tried this
I don't know trying this again something
this all no hmm so creates the gemfile
so let's go to our local host local host
:
8000 slash welcome
don't have any routes to find hello ah
I'm not sure what that means the solar
challenge in fall so apparently what we
needed to do was actually enter in
bundle install bundle install once stole
everything
so this is our bundle and when we go to
install it's gonna install here and then
we want to run the local server and you
can see right here it's good to go cool
so again that was bundle space installed
to move on and the terminal generated a
new model name message so now we're
going to generate in rails we want to
generate a model named message cool open
the DB so let's see here we have D be
migrated as a message disable the name
of migration fall sex it's nice not one
I was created so add this the line for
so here here we are in line 4 and we're
gonna say T dot text it's physical and
content so let's go ahead and I round
that cool so it looks like this when I
print out a table of messages if I
understand it correctly and then in the
terminal we want to run here you know
say a rake our database and migrate so
let's go have enter that and then we
want to so this created the tables for
messages here don't want to rake DVD
calling the seed
and I shave for the space in there and
then around that and cool seems
everything seems to be working all right
so we want to generate a controller all
right so we're gonna say rails and then
the generate command and we want
what are we generating a controller able
to renaming it messages I think I nailed
that good film there out scripts and the
routes file that maps to alright so
let's go to routes turn on the routes
let's see let's go away
so in the routes file create a route the
map ctrl slash messages to the
messengers controller index
routes files no it's not it doesn't look
like it either
what's a rail such as I know
wait - okay break TV
is so up
controllers
hmm just pause the video real quick why
try doing extraneous research I don't
know how they ever expect us ever to get
there but we have to open up or out
start our beat which is nowhere in here
like it's it's under app and then config
and then right here
so a little bit of a bitch move not kind
of giving us a path but you can see
right here just go ahead and put this
and what we're doing the same when we're
at messages go to messages index I
believe us what's going on to the
messenger controller index to get to
data and then we want to add the DEF
index so let's let's go ahead and open
that up so that was app controllers
which one wasn't messages underscore
controllers are v controller
open this up and then here we're saying
for this class to find this and do
message at all so just go ahead and move
on but so far this isn't a very
intuitive course hoping that view of
slash message index.html live so let's
see we have have have use we have
messages all right so we open this up
underlying 11 type the contents of this
so let's just go ahead and put that in
there so at messages for each one do the
message here's our class the content
created that so I mean you can kind of
look at that and get an idea what's
going on here just gonna run that cool
and let's see what's going on if we go
show our local house is what's going on
right now in our rails app so so far
you've been loading messages from the
database and displaying them in the view
how can we create new messages and save
them to the database looking at the
seven standard rails actions we need to
use the new and create in the routes
file create a route that Maps request a
messages slash new alright so I was
trying remember where we found that that
was app config and on the routes and
instead of going into index we wanted to
go to messages slash new let's see if
this works
so the length that what's coming so
maybe I'm just kept the hashtag let's
try that one more time
so it looks like maybe it worked
nope so after extensive research again
and a quick break to watch the new
warcraft trailer I figured out what it
is they're asking us to do so I test it
around a little bit forget this real
quick test it around a little bit and
what we actually need to do so we're I
was kind of in the right direction is we
need to actually just add this to our
code as well so that it does something
I'm not quite sure what does apparently
supposed to route it differently so in
the index action add the new action so
let's see here I'm gonna say right here
so now we're saying what are we doing
for new so okay maybe this is making a
little more sense so index is kind of
the default page for the app and now
what's in there we're gonna say like
look check out new as well so let's see
if that's correct
below Oh oops
so obviously you can't put one function
into the other and so that should fix
that cool so in the routes file we also
want to add the post messages messages
found create to it so let's go ahead and
add this as well just go ahead and run
it
alright so what did we just do it looks
like we added a method post here so that
it'll post the messages from the crate
tab if I create crate controller if I if
I understand correctly so in the
messages controller we're gonna add a
private method so it looks like we have
call say private message for ammeter
parameters require a message and content
so and permits content whatever content
is content let just be strings at this
point I'm not quite sure so between the
new action and the private method add
the create action new action the private
action alright so do we know let's see
let's see if we all right if I read this
correctly I think we want to create to
be private as well but that wouldn't
makes sense because we want to user yeah
nope because users wouldn't have access
to this method and so thus it needs to
be public because it'll be users that
are adding new content if we think about
it logically here cool and then in the
apps views messages so let's go ahead
and pull that up so we're going to go to
app use messages
I believe it's the index nope it was new
so no news message is new so this is our
new one right here and in here we don't
want to type for our forum let's see if
we can read over this and kind of guess
so for the form that takes in a message
do each portion of it so it for each
message F dot label the message declare
the message in an area to clear the
content cool so we run that very cool
I'm gonna refresh this see if anything's
changed
no so finally in the apps use them in
all right so now we Newt now we do need
the index throwing out app views
messages index we are gonna add the
script tag this is linked to this new
message and for the URL hard URL path or
soft URL path messages slash new
relative URL path there we go and we
want to put this
here so let's go ahead and run that get
that check mark cool just go ahead and
do that on the next section so nicely
done so what do we do we got HV HTTP GET
request for you four messages slash new
so get any new messages it's kind of
what's going on here
create a message object at message and
pass it to be viewed in the new HTML in
the form four creates a form and that
message object browser sends HTTP post
requests so one things about web
development is you're going to get very
familiar with the response cycle of a
server and that that goes hey guys even
though I'm not fully understanding the
rails framework because I think they're
kind of just I feel like they had some
guy throw this together in four in the
four hours I don't know maybe they need
someone to make a more extensive class
but maybe I just don't relate to rails
but just kind of understand that
sometimes you're sending out a response
saying this is what you need and
sometimes you're getting a request
saying I need this data for my page so I
can display things properly and have a
dynamic site so up next is associations
one Sue's alright let's go back to our
picture but again we're not going to be
able to do the Broadway bolt network and
innovation cloud because they have
decided to do a pro version but of
course we will do all the free stuff and
eventually probably will get the pro but
as always thanks you thank you for
