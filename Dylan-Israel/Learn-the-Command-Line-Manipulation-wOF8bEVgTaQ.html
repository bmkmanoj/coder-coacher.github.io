the command prompt section we're
starting viewing and changing the file
system manipulation so let's go ahead
and get started here so let's see just a
quick reminder LS will tell us what's in
our current directory and let's see what
the difference is here we have LS - a
person's preferences action column so
will probably tell us the next screen
what the differences those commands old
file - a modifies - behavior that is to
list the files and directories starting
with a dot foster thought our hidden
don't appear using lslam ok so it looks
like there's hidden files using the dot
in front of them the dash is called an
option option modify the behavior of
commands ok so it looks like there's an
LS dash L and there we go
this tells us back in my FTP slash my
sequel days I don't remember everything
but someone this basically tells us what
we can do with each file I believe and
I'll go into details here so the - L
list files and directories as a table
with seven columns separated by spaces
and you can read through all that if you
want you probably won't use it more than
once you'll probably look it up if you
need to for me I had to change certain
parameters when I TP stuff up so that it
would work properly through the command
line in here so let's try out another
option for the LS navigate to LS comedy
oops
see
see comedy alright so we're gonna change
the director you call me and then we're
gonna type ls' - alt and I'm not sure
we'll see what's going on here
so alright so - all lists all content
and long format including the ones that
are hidden so let's let's move on to
copying and moving or removing files
from the directory so you want to change
the directory to drama / biopic / next
we want to CP the Iblees this is copied
directly takes and that's face
blinking dot txt cannot staff writer no
such file oh I put text ISO
dot txt and link it dot txt
all right let's see what this does next
so CP copies files or directories and
here we copied Friday or Friday entity
ik into Lincoln so we copied the first
file into the second file there are a
few more ways to use CP so let's change
your educated drama and then in here go
CP biopic class will atrophy XE and we
it looks like we're going to put this in
historical cannot regular fun can I
create regular file historical
alright yeah txt space
alright navigate that to the historical
directory list all files and directories
should see any fuss so LS I believe
should list everything well let's see
here
now we read to the historical directory
alright to ensure actory to historical
there we go
and here's one where you see PCP now we
get up one directory so you want to
change directory drama and then there's
me so let's see what directories there
are TV drama
I believe this takes us back a directory
so we want to go back one with the CD
dot dot and then we want to try the copy
8/3 dot txt file / notorious maybe
notorious b.i.g dot txt
nice let's see what this last Commandos
it's a copy of filing into the directory
copy multiple files okay so basically we
copied multiple files the first two
files into the final file we copied a
ray and notorious into the historical
directory all right so I'll change
directory comedy in this directory
create a file named Shrek Tex
I don't remember what the director sorry
about the breakup in the video here I
had to turn my car alarm off a
motorcycle set it off
oh yeah so we want to change the
directory to comedy splash and then we
want to create a new file in this
directory leave this a good touch Shrek
dot txt that creates it then we want to
type CP star satire slash and they
should get everything all right no we
should admit everything there we go so
we're a mini satire looks like navigate
this after we saw file so let's it out
LS
now we get to the set Oh change
directory satire here's another way to
use the CP so actually see see right now
we're just where's Archer are there
action so see da da
let's see what we got here
there's our action so now we can see D -
action oh yeah so uh we actually did
what they didn't want us to do
I guess so slash slash dot slash action
/ so that will take us to the action we
just type in and just satisfy what they
want
we did a worse way of doing it and now
we want to see CPM star dot txt sci-fi
slash and change directories into sci-fi
so we want to list all files and
directories in the word in the working
directory listing here LS so here's our
sigh fine just a copy of all files
starting with
okay so you want to see me do slackline
all right let's see what's going on to
the next example here so CP star satire
these are called wildcard selects
everything in the working directory
and then M star selects everything that
ends in txt but starts with M so in
addition all the files can move files
from the command line so let's change to
the action let's see where we're at
alright so we want to see the action
want to type M V Superman dot txt space
super hero / navigate the superheroes to
either superhero and here's another way
use MV so and we navigate up one
directory for action superhero - action
dot txt superhero Batman let's see here
what's going on do we do it wrong Wonder
Woman dot txt
fire up the Batman pie so yummy
txt Batman dot php' superhero it says
there's no such file or directory and
here's one more when I so see here ok
Batman so there's no such file directory
alright the MV command moose files so
this will move Superman to the superhero
folder cool so let's change the
directory to comedy slash slash like so
sweetie calmly so over there we are
going to RM water boy dot txt from here
we're gonna list all the files and we
can see that water boy is no longer in
there only Zoolander now we want to
navigate up one directory so CD dot dot
and RM dash are slapstick let's see what
this does
now let's list all the directories so we
have satire Shrek The Office
alright let's see what's arm command s
so the RM command deletes files and
directories the - R is that modifies the
behavior the RM command that - R stands
for recursive and is used to delete a
directory in all of its child
directories Wow so if you're doing that
you really are doing some real
so I delete it permanently and there is
no there isn't an undo delete so
basically don't around with RM so
that's sitting here so we finished our
section second section of the command
line pretty cool stuff
in our next section oops just sit back
and see what we're doing next let's view
the course overview so we ready 44% boy
done that we're doing redirection which
is going to redirect input and output to
from files and programs so that's what
we'll be doing next and you know it
might be helpful to make a little sticky
note of what the commands do until you
memorize them because you see me for
getting here there but if you're going
to be trying to use this in and
workplace just go online and find
yourself a nice little cheat sheet but
I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
