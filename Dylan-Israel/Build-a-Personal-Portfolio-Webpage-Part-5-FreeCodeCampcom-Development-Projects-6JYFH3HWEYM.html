part 5 of make personal portfolio some
of the stuff we may have done in part 3
but we're going to kind of cover it in
case we made a mistake so last time we
basically showed how to embed our code
pin so you can see what's going on here
now we have this pick page 4 which is
just a background that we're set up here
and we put in a a s size you set the
covering we added some padding now what
we want to actually do is I guess to
start we can go ahead and add a footer
to here
go ahead and pull up my notes on the
side here we're going to add a simple
footer that's kind of kind of mirror our
our menu here we credit div also be
pretty straightforward
great idea called a class equal to
footer and what's in here
we're going to create some allies
actually you know what we can just do
some anchor tags
I'll work too so let's do our footer
class and I ended up just wrapping them
all in an h3 to make them pop up a
little bit because we kind of oversized
everything for this project since we had
a one-page application you want things
to be a little bit big so we just add
some anchor tags here and these are
going to go wherever they're going to go
and in my example I actually I actually
use my name so that remember how we have
our name to the top left and I linked
this to my my personal website I suggest
that you link it to your portfolio so
we're just going to do something like so
my personal website is coding tutorials
three-sixty calm and then of course we
want this to open up in a new page we're
going to target equal bling
now just to put a little bit of space I
put a dash and then a space here and
because we're going to kind of replicate
this format for everything else so next
for next up I actually do my youtube
channel so we're going to do a YouTube
comm slash coding tutorials 360 and then
we're going to change this as well we'll
just go ahead and put youtube.com slash
coding tutorials 360 and we're going to
do this one more time or actually three
more times except these are actually
going to link to various things so
instead of going to actual web pages
we're going to go ahead and have this
next one linked to our portfolio which
was p3 remember how we link with the IDs
that we set up earlier it's going to
change this put portfolio and then we're
going to go ahead and do the same for
this clip the next one so that is that
we need to do that right here sorry
about that guys so we're going to
hashtag p3 this links by ID as I said a
moment ago portfolio and then it
wouldn't be complete if I misspelled
things as I went along then we have our
about me which ended up being a hashtag
p2 and about me and then finally our
next section was going to be contact me
which is page we're on which is hashtag
before and let's go and change that
now let's save it before we get started
actually let's run it as well here so
we're going to scroll down a little bit
you'll see these take a second to load
don't sweat that a lot of data is going
so cool so we have kind of our footer
it's not looking super great like it by
any means but it's there you'll see it's
on the bottom of the page now what we
want to do next is this is optional but
I happen to like to do it will fix the
styling just a moment so don't freak out
about that outside here we're going to
add a P tag to make sure it look
official and we're going to go ahead and
throw in you know the copyright we're
hitting with that copyright let me know
that ain't going to be jacking our
anytime soon that's going to run that I
believe that should come out white cool
for some reason it is inheriting some
stuff thing so it shouldn't be that big
let's see if I change how I styled the P
I believe I might have go ah so where is
P font size interesting interesting that
is definitely not working as expected
so all we have to do here is we're going
to say look if it's within the footer
and it's a paragraph I'm going to set
the font size equal to let's say 15px
we're going to run that let's go down
the bottom every better yet we set this
up so let's go to contact me jump down
here cool so that's there now what do we
need to do next so we have our footer
now our footer class has a height here
let's go ahead and gut this and see how
it affects it
you'll see right there now our footer is
going to adjust automatically and our
this is way too big we haven't added our
buttons yet but let's go ahead and fix
this hard set height instead we're just
going to add some padding so that was
page four so we're going to add some
padding bottom and padding top of about
five percent instead of this this height
so let's go ahead and paste that in
there run that scroll down so we still
have this padding here which is
interesting because I didn't think that
was supposed to be there let's actually
go ahead and add our content and see if
that fixes it so we're not messing
around with that too much now what we
want to actually do is go ahead and just
add some an h1 contact me pull up my
section here cool what I the way that
this is going to be styled is we're
going to have from here about two thirds
of this is going to say contact me in
our email in big font and then on the
side here taking about one third of the
page it's got buttons going the way down
to do that we can go ahead and jump in
here and we'll create a div and we're
going to make this a little bit
responsive so we're just going to throw
in a row again the column grid systems
based off gifts and rows with twelve
twelve columns in a row now we're going
to just do a div class is equal to call
- MD - eight and you know you could
definitely do small large whatever
you're going to do and then we're going
to have a div class equal to call column
D - or
now the first thing we're going to want
to do is we're going to go ahead and
throw an h1 in this 8th section and
we're just going to put in contact me
save that and let's go ahead around that
and you'll see that things are going to
look a little oh so we seem to have an
issue so this is actually is this game
displayed in the correct section
something interesting this happening
here let's continue on and see if we can
fix it as we go then we have an anchor
tag that's to the right of it what still
within the h1 we have a hoops a href and
this is going to be contact me close
this okay and then we're going to throw
something in like what do we want to
throw in we want to throw in your email
and you do Mel - and then your email
guns email say well no at gmail.com and
then right here we're going to actually
put the text down this email where you
will know at gmail.com and it's just
going to be styled slightly different
the colors can be different so people
are going to know that it's an anchor
tag you'll see right there so we have
this nice big section now this is
getting a little bit lost along the way
and that's because we don't have
anything in our div here or it's because
I forgot to close this call mb8 div
class here we are that's what's going on
my mistake
just going to run that and I'll throw in
our buttons right now so a lot of days a
lot of a lot of that's just
floating around and so now you'll see
this is a little bit different so cool
it's where it's basically working right
now now let's go ahead and add our
buttons our buttons are going to be
similar to our icons but because they're
the main part of the page we're going to
make them a little bit bigger let's go
ahead and jump back in here
and you'll see we have this call and
before this is where we're going to
start adding our buttons now we're going
to use bootstraps class BTN I'm going to
be TM - default and then I ended up
creating this class called padding BTN
and we're having a trust as well go
ahead and set that to your correct icon
let's go ahead and pull up that padding
BTN it is a custom class I created a
while back so where is it here we are so
it's going to add some padding to the
top and the bottom we're going to set a
Mac a width and then we're gonna add
some margin pretty straightforward let's
go ahead and start off in the same order
as before so we're going to Twitter and
we're going to have our icons as well
now if you remember we got these from
font awesome even though the link is in
the top all we're going to do is apply
the class wah wah - Twitter and then
we're going to go ahead and apply the ID
which we set earlier which is actually
really bad that we're using ID twice so
don't do that definitely make that a
class since we're going to recall it
that is the better way of doing it you
should not reuse IDs but we're going to
go ahead and do that I'm going to do a
Twitter icon which was our CSS that we
did in the previous video let's kind of
close that /i and then we're gonna going
to save that it's going to run it we can
kind of see what one of those bad boys
is going to look like
so it's not supposed to look like that
but that is for sure
so let's go ahead and jump back into my
class here on my other page and make
sure that our padding BTN didn't get
distorted anyhow so I have to say I was
not expecting this long schlong looking
thing
so padding Vicenza right here the height
interestingly enough is something on a
whole new level
so my padding BTN is correct so there
must be something wrong with how we are
nesting this let's go ahead and look at
our code here we're going to break it
down piece by piece while we're at it
I'm actually going to go ahead and copy
and paste in the additional ones from
before these are you're going to do the
same exact way except now you're just
using a you're just going to repeat it
so it's going to save that and run it
okay so all our buttons are being
affected like that um little break there
so what was actually going on was for
some reason I I had these as padding 25%
is actually padding 5% but it looks
alright if we just go ahead and get rid
of it all together we did add some CSS
along the way but also the issue that we
would end up running into let's go and
refresh this page because you'll see
that when we scroll down on the bottom
this is off here so we actually added
some unnecessary padding to the bottom
just go ahead and comment that out or
delete it let me refresh our page here
we have this nice little section like so
and now everything's nice and clean and
good to go
that's pretty much it man
there's not too much else we can do for
what the requirement is you'll see that
it's somewhat responsive now we could
always make it more responsive in future
videos and things like that all you have
to do is take that grid column system
that we we started setting it up and
then just go ahead and apply it to
various sections you'll see like this
will eventually relocate as well as much
as it can
well yeah that's basically it hope you
guys found part five in part 4 helpful
maybe eventually a year from now I'll be
like the Terminator like every every
every 10 years Arnold does a terminator
movie but every year I'll do another
part to this portfolio we can do it
better but uh maybe maybe in the next
video we'll set it up so that this
actually becomes the menu icon instead
of just getting crunch like that because
that doesn't look too good and we'll do
the same thing here but look for word

doing it but as always guys thanks for
