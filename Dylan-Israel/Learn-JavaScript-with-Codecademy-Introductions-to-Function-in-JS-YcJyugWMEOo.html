section rather introduction to functions
in JavaScript why we use them how to use
them and we'll see what's going on next
so let's jump into code here let's
briefly review using if else to check
how fast you're diving speed is greater
than 80 so speed is greater than 80 put
that in there console.log to print else
console say damn all right
line three declares a function give it a
name variable divided by three equals
function number barbel divided by three
all right so this is how we define our
method slash function it's a variable
given name it's equal to the function
and then this is a parameter very old
value or a prints value rather all right
so line 3 declares the function gives it
the name my 4 and 5 Ciccone want to use
again and again
line 4 declares a variable valve line 5
prints of value and on line 8 to 11
explain what calling a function means on
line 12 place 6 with any number on line
12 place 6 with any number will say 9 so
it should print 3 good 9 divided by 3
cool all right so it's a little bit of a
interesting way to call function on line
11 call the greeting function put a name
you want the green function to include
so we're gonna say greeting we're gonna
call the green function and we're going
to put a parameter Dylan
so I'm great to see you done all right
cup code more like oh let's make a
function tells the world alright so
we're going to declare it there demand
is equal to a function call it for
anything like call it food function food
and then in here we want it to include
console prints will take out and in this
case all we're doing is taking that food
parameter adding a chat line so to eat
the way they do here is plus space seems
a little weird to me I would just do a
space at the end plus so that you don't
have to add it but I guess it's good for
practice and so I call it and let's see
here call the function so we'll call
through demand and we will put in cheese
make sure you put the parentheses in
there works I want to eat cheese all
right a bit a big part of programming
this debugging this is probably where
most of your time ongoing coding in
general look at line 9 cuz mini syntax
errors see how the lack of space it
makes debugging hard
I fixed a function called agreeance
Pontius so greeting bear equals equals
function and that these are excellent
records and then we have this let's just
delete all that and bracket semicolon
and then we want to call it greeting
reading they have an example up above I
didn't even see that till now reading
name Oh
Broadway didn't reverse so they're
treating there we go you are a creature
of habit every week you buy five oranges
or orange prices keep changing wanted to
declare function that calculates the
cost of buying five oranges right
function so I their orange cost you
should take premier that is cost an
orange our price is better in here
we're going to take total price is equal
to five times price and then we're going
to return total price and then call the
function and then we might call it and
we'll say an orange costs $5,000
sorry syntax there you go got declared
as a function and there we go in our
examples we have a function called x 2
that takes a number and return number
multiplied all mice on line 7 after the
equal sign it's called the function x 2
all right guys let's reset our code and
get back to it
sorry for the interruption in our
example we have a function called x 2 on
line 7 after the equal sign call the
function x 2 so in this case we're
calling the function x 2 and we have to
insert a parameter because that's what
our function takes line 8 prints out new
number notice of the value returned from
time series automatically assigned
engine number so BAM prints out new
number
easy enough functions return and if
slash else find a function called
quarter so function the function returns
a value equal to 1/4 the parameter
so there's alt equals actually we can
probably just return need to create
number call the function inside the if
statements condition
why sure was asking Oh like this
oops
Susa bracket so i don't think that's our
hair alright did you remember to call
quarter inside the estate mount the
value that would cause it to print of
the statement is false see
on line seven it's a statement condition
calls needs you to put value
you're both morons
call it function inside the if
statements condition okay
on line seven the if statements
condition calls the function it means
you've put in the number value okay so
friendly I'm not understanding what
they're asking so we're gonna go to the
forums
all right so so we have there
all right so I think we're probably not
good air in what we're trying to do here
I'm going to actually bring that up and
see if that house
okay so that is silly it was cuz we were
not inserting a proper result they
wanted our if statement to be true
basically as what was going on there so
showing a few little things you have to
just notice by using coke at me all
right so now we're going to write a
function called perimeter box equals its
two parameters
let's try doing it this way plus two
times this
oh we have to call it whoops there we go
so six was forced I'm good to go
all right global versus local variables
a very important concept just kind of
interested in bringing it up because we
have we're not really writing anything
big enough to have global variable
alright hang out change like for to use
the word of our keywords alive for we
want our my number see how this is
global scope also it's outside of a
class and apparently any far in front of
it so that makes it global notice the
value of my number on the function is
now 14 outside the function is seven
using my number without the VAR keyword
refers to global vary with function
however you Sparky were inside a
function
there's a new local variable that only
existed okay so this actually overrides
my number just locally
all right write a function called name
string should take a parameter name
should return I plus D then we need to
call the name string make sure it works
that was
I am Dylan hi I am Susie
it's quite a nervous all right let's see
here this is the source without
consulate outlawed
hi I am Dylan looks like an imprinting
thing to the console
alright let's see what's going on here
she's a name returns a stream okay so it
doesn't we don't need the console dot
log so we have there right do we need it
right here
there we go I'm not quite sure I was
going with that Suzy there but in order
to print out this returns it but it
still doesn't print it out so we have to
call console dot log simple enough all
right we are calling a function called
sleep check that takes the parameter
hours and notice the naming convention
usually a second word on you start
lowercase in at every word that's
conjoined in this case is capitalized
for their first letter any help all
right inside the function write a
statement so if mom hours is greater
than or equal to 8 you want it to do
some
alright then it just wants us to call
the function with different times check
it here so sleep 8 you're going getting
plenty of sleep maybe too much we're not
actually printing it out if we wanted to
see all the values it works but uh
without us printing it out we're not
going to see it I believe this should
work we just did this for the last time
so let's make sure it's working check
our work and there we go we get a 410
it's greater than or equal to num hours
so you're getting plenty of sleep for
five it's less than a so get more
shut-eye and then it's equal to 8 so
asleep
cool it's your newly acquired knowledge
of function let's go build a rock paper
scissors scissors game next so that's
what we'll be doing next as always we're
gonna share coke Adam II personally
fansite people check it out and in the
next section of functions we will be
building our very own
rock-paper-scissors game nice little fun
thing it should be give you an insight
on how to organize your cup a bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
