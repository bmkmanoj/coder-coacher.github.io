my new job I decided do you build a
course in angular it's a mini course but
it's a fun thing something that you
could do over a weekend and I hope you
guys are excited about it took a lot of
time and hard work to actually get it to
the quality that I want it to be let's
go ahead and dive into and talk about
what I learned making my first courses
I'm sure a lot of you are interested in
starting up something of your own and I
can maybe lead you down a little bit of
a path of what my resistances were and
what I kind of learned in the process so
as I mentioned I finished my first
course I'm very excited about this it's
a small course but it is a personal
accomplishment in my opinion so what are
we what are we learning well we're gonna
learn some of the basics of angular are
we gonna learn all of angular by no
means that was not the goal of this this
was sort of to be a project that you had
some fun building and got exposed to the
building blocks of the very basics of
angular and even some of those things
are left out and we'll do those in part
two when I finish that up but what you
will have at the end of this is this
nice little changelog style portfolio
where I thought this was a good entry
level project to get you started one
page no routing no services not too
complicated but kind of get your feet
wet in angular which is the goal of this
part one project so it's a it's as I
mentioned to change locks I'll give your
access to social media for whoever and
then of course you know some some change
logs in your life right and you can see
here you hover over it gives a little
bit more detail then you have your
updates and releases maybe
collaborations that you've worked on to
link to it or portfolio whatever you
want to call it right and then you have
your speaker bio which is just a little
bit about you now there's so many
angular courses out there that it's hard
to one of the things I found is as a
developer is how can I provide value
that
all these other courses aren't and I
think we did pretty good with that in
this in this instance and I'll talk a
little bit about why but we have courses
like Maximilian from a catamite who who
has 26 hours going over the angular
documentation basically breaking down
every bit and piece and there's projects
in it for sure but going over every
little nook and cranny and it's hard to
compete with that right I and not to
mention he probably has a decade plus
experience I mean I don't think I can
compete with that but what I can do is I
can give you a nice easy-to-follow
project it's about three hours in total
content it will always be $10 so this if
you you see if it's on sale be $10 I
can't go lower than 10 it doesn't work
on udemy I was gonna sell it to you guys
for five but hey I'll take it Ted
but if you see the lowest you can
actually market is 20 and discount it to
10 other than free and that ain't
happening sorry guys but I will give I
will be giving away copies of my course
here there as a little bit of self promo
and the live streams every Saturday so
look forward to that and as I build more
courses I'll give away those but you can
always use the code for the first
thousand sales which is a lot I don't
expect I don't expect to even sell a
thousand if you use the coupon code
coding god on any of my courses you'll
get a 50% off so you get it for $10 so
what did I do to try and make my course
unique to make it stand out well I tried
to make it a little bit more change up
one I learned by projects right so
that's why how this whole course is
structured is I want to learn something
by building something and that was where
we started and that is where we ended
and this is where the whole course setup
is going and will continue to flow as I
as I continue to get better at building
courses and build more courses and
things like that so why do we start with
wireframes well wireframes and is
something that's used in the working
world quite often and this helps
communicate an idea of what it is we're
trying to build so I actually walk you
through the wireframe process what I'm
building why I'm building it kind of
showcase and you have access
these as well in the courses this is
something I think it's really helpful to
kind of show you these these detailed
wireframes the kind of low resolution
you'll notice that not everything's I
exact but you get the idea of what it is
we're trying to accomplish through the
wireframe and so we walk you through
this which is something that that it's
you very rarely in my experience as a
developer I'll actually get this meant
you might get one wireframe and they say
figure out the rest but the idea of a
wireframe is to communicate the idea so
that's something we've built into the
course you can start with the wireframes
learn it learn about it see okay this is
part of the process and and go from
there so this is something that is kind
of unique to the course we then have the
actual set up of course we're building
up the we're building of a set up and
you can watch the course introduction
the wireframe preview just kind of get
an idea of what we're trying to do here
set up so we're all on the same page not
know no issues and then building of the
actual portfolio so that's the that's
our first iteration so this is something
that I I really like that I did and I
think it's going to be really helpful
for you so there's basically two parts
one where we build our portfolio free
like free style if you won't think it
that way with zero refactoring so did
the first iteration that I did okay cool
I built it it works everything looks
good
how can we refactor and make the code
better and that's part two right here
the refactoring process and so what
happens is you get you get introduced to
different ways of doing the same thing
but that maybe eliminates code that is a
better better way of doing the same
thing that is a additional way of doing
the same thing but maybe you prefer it
one way or the other you just learn it a
little bit better and it's it's one of
the things I'm really happy that I did
because I think this is a great way to
teach you not only teach you to angular
but teach you how to be a better angular
developer in the process so last but not
least one of the things that I I really
know that I struggle so we do these
courses
right and what happens is we feel like
we know the stuff they're like oh yeah
cool I just I just you know I followed
this video tutorial and now I kind of
understand angular that's great but what
ends up happening is because you
followed nothing but a tutorial
sometimes you miss out on something
sometimes you you don't you don't get
everything you never you never at any
point in there did anything just by
yourself like every you know it as a
tutorial is it kind of holds your hand
in sometimes it's hard to say well I
don't have an idea of what I can build
next I don't know where to go and so
something maybe two weeks later you come
back to angular to touch it that's not
how my course works here what I do is I
build out wireframes and we have these
features here new features these are
features I haven't built I am telling
you what to build next and using the
skills that we have developed through
this course you can go and start to
actually build something your own and
this is gonna be what really this is
gonna be the glue that makes it click
for you this is really what it is am I
doing this because I'm lazy no I could
build all these features and matter of
fact they're not super complex they're
not very and these are just three
suggestions but the they are ideas that
features that you should be able to
implement by the end of this course by
the end of doing the project the
refactoring you have been introduced to
everything that you need to get this to
work properly and so I built some some
wireframes just to kind of show you what
those would look like so that you could
have some requirements right because a
little in the working world you're gonna
get requirements so I'll give you an
example that's not it video portfolio so
I've talked a bit in my in my videos
about creating a video portfolio sort of
an introduction video and I keep on
meaning to record one of my own as a
mock one to show you guys but a video
portfolio where essentially you have
this icon that when the photo is showing
it has a video icon that says
introduction video over it and when you
it's going to then switch your video to
your switcher your photo to your
introduction video that now will play
your introduction video for people who
are on your portfolio page so this is an
example of a feature that you could
easily be able to build out based off of
doing the course and that that is that
is of course essentially we have the
wireframe aspect we have the building
the project aspect we have the
refactoring of things in the project to
eliminate code have better practices do
it in a better more professional manner
right and then we have the new features
that I recommend that you you highly do
because that's really going to be the
glue that puts it all together because
so many people do courses they do video
courses they do all this sort of stuff
yet somehow it doesn't stick this is how
it's gonna help you stick because you're
gonna actually go you already have you
already have the core data set that
you've coded out but now you're gonna do
it yourself you're gonna add on to
something yeah you're going to not have
to start a brand new project you can
dive right in so that's kind of how I
structured my course again it's three
hours of videos
ten dollars basically it's not going to
teach you everything in angular but it
is a good entry-level project for those
are you going and for the one person who
took it and rated me a five-star thank
you thank you
I've been advertised so this is just
someone from udemy I appreciate the love
baby so we got like we got our first
sale baby make it rain no uh um but yeah
I worked pretty hard on this to be
honest and it was an interesting process
trying to figure out how I could make my
content unique and how I thought I could
provide the most value and it all came
back to what helps me become a a
developer what what do I think was the
strengths of me learning and it was
building projects and that was the thing
that made the difference between me not
retaining things and retaining things
and so in part two it'll be $10 to be a
separate course all these are supposed
to be very doable many sort of courses
that you could you know do and
accomplish and and you know it's a very
accomplished well task three hours of
videos
take you longer than three hours but
it's gonna take you less than what maybe
a ten hour or 26 hour course would take
right so again you can use the Coney God
to get it for $10 so in part 2 we're
going to be diving into services we
don't that's one major thing that we did
not touch about so we're gonna be diving
into HTTP calls probably use a little
bit of local storage in the beginning to
mock up a couple things I don't know if
I want to connect a database that might
be too much for part two but we're going
to be creating dashboard with a dynamic
dashboard with data coming in from I
don't know what API we're gonna use I'm
thinking we'll use like maybe an
external cryptocurrency API and then
we'll display dashboards originally I
said in here I wanted to do it in
angular material I've since changed my
mind angular material is a piece of
and and a piece of garbage sorry YouTube
don't don't do monetize this video you
too piece of garbage and I'm just going
to figure out something else but um but
yeah so we'll be doing a dashboard type
thing where you you can create your own
custom dashboards based off of the API
that we're using so it'll be fun it'll
be exciting that'll probably come out in
about a month I'm currently working
through a full stack mean project that
I'm almost done with and I'm also deep
diving in the JavaScript documentation
to build a what I call a JavaScript the
everything parts so that we are going
through that course is going to be
probably 20 hours by the end of it and
that's going to be a deep dive into
JavaScript that is my Michael so that is
kind of what I've been working on for
future courses as we continue roll this
up but this one this one's great I hope
you guys check it out it's fun you'll
enjoy it I'm kind of pretty casual as I
go through it but I tried to be
informative at the same time so I
appreciate you guys for taking the time
to watch this again the coding the
coupon code is coding God for the first
five hundred or thousand I forget what I
said it I think I said psilocin so a
thousand people now you can get it for
$10 so I appreciate you I'll see you
next time bye hey baby what do you think
about my angular course
by teaching geometry I guess if you're
looking for a fun little project to do I
have my very first course out called
learn angular by projects part one where
we build a personal portfolio it's about
three hours of content it's one project
I can teach you everything in angular by
any means but it's a great way to get
your feet wet and go ahead and check the
link down below get a coupon code coding
god or just click the icon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
