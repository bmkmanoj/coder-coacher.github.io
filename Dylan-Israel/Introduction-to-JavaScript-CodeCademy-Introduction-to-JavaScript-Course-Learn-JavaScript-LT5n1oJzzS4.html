backing code Academy if I'm a little bit
on the softer side it is because it is
about 1 a.m. but I can't sleep so we're
gonna do some JavaScript and I'm at my
mom's house before I moved to Florida so
I don't want to wait wake her up cuz we
should we share wall and whatnot right
now so you know let's go ahead and jump
into introduction to JavaScript this
isn't to be confused with the with code
CAD amis JavaScript course this is the
old course this is a introduction which
I guess is going to be an easier version
teaching the basics of JavaScript
JavaScript an important language that it
seems that this needs to be something
that every web developer needs a master
and if you're kind of get having issues
getting started I guess maybe this is
what this course is for you I've just I
haven't even taken a look at it so let's
go ahead and dive right in
coke Adam II if you notice this kind of
rework their their website quite a bit
so let's see if the IDE looks any
different it looks pretty much the same
it looks like the flow is going to bethe
back we're gonna learn the building
blocks of JavaScript and we're gonna do
some fun stuff with that cool where's my
water all right
and the code editor there are three
variables we'll learn about variables so
if you're not familiar with what a
variable is a variable is something that
you store data in they can be strings
which are lines of text they can be
numbers they can which are numbers whole
numbers or floating numbers which would
be decimal numbers so we want to replace
this first my string with your name so
we'll go ahead and put coding tutorials
360 and this is now a string because
we're using quotation marks so you'll
see right here when we output it is now
a string so we ran that we're next gonna
set the next one to our lucky number um
I guess soon it would be appropriate to
set our lucky number to 360 like so is
this in the beta so it's maybe running a
little bit slow so bear with me guys
there we go and then because it's around
a little slow we're gonna go ahead and
move on here and then boolean so boolean
is a true or false the easy way think of
bullying's if you're new the concept is
a heads or tails it's a flip of a coin
in the sense of it's either one or the
other it can't be anything else so we're
gonna go ahead and just put true let's
go ahead and run that and so we have a
string variable we have a number
variable and then we have our boolean
which is true or false like a true or
false question on test there's only
those two options and that would be our
boolean so click Next
so console dot log what does this mean
console don't log is really how you get
a message display in the web browser
consular in your code so that you can
see something it's really a way of
getting output to the console now why
would you use this sometimes you need to
check the values of variables as you're
doing your code so that you can fully
understand what the variable is and
making sure that your code is running
properly so a favorite pizza topping is
cheese and some of you may be saying hey
that it's not a pizza topping but extra
cheese is always a pizza topping
right so we can also console dot log
multiple things so we want to check
multiple values we can do that as well
in the example here they're just having
us go ahead and put multiple things well
go ahead and throw ham on here partially
because I think I'll be embarrassed if I
misspell pepperoni so that's what's
going on here now you can do math in in
programming or in in general but in
JavaScript as well so we can we can
actually log out math operators now you
may say why would we want to add 3.5
plus to our age but if you're checking
two variables and you want to make sure
they add up correctly you can do it
through the console so we'll go ahead I
am 28 so in three and a half years I
will be thirty one point five god that
makes me feel old
so inside another console dot log so you
can have multiple console logs as well
let's go ahead and take the current year
which is 2016 and then we'll go ahead
and - 1969 which probably has some sort
of relevance and then in the third step
it divided 65 by 240 so you can also do
other operators as well so you can do
multiplication division basically any
math off
we'll work and then this will be 240
divided by 65 so we get this very long
number here and then in the last we want
to multiply the answer for step 3 by 100
so I as we said we can chain operators
as well so how do we want to do that we
can go ahead and console dot log or
let's go ahead and create a variable and
store it in something will create a ver
a variable called num 1 and we'll set
this equal to 240 excuse me 60 I did
this incorrectly excuse me this is 65
divided by 240 and then we'll set that
65 divided 240 equal to a number and
then we'll console dot log that variable
out so she remember correctly the
variables store data and we're simply
targeting that data just go ahead and
run this oh and then multiply it by 100
so excuse me forgot that step so you see
everything's going out it's a hundred
times larger very nice very nice very
nice all right so modulo what is modulo
there modulus sometimes you just want to
get a remainder of a number it's so 13
modulo 5 would have your answer would be
3 because 5 only divides evenly twice
and you have a 3 remainder that's
basically modulo so let's go ahead and
look at what they're asking is let's say
let's say full night remorse put your
calculation side comfort on the screen
all right so it says let's start by
dividing 365 by 27 zoom in a little bit
also log and this is gonna be 365
divided by 27
our first console
like that so there's our 13 remember
that gives us 13 followed by a decimal
point 5 1 8 use modulus to find the
remaining days then you need to know how
many extra days we will rotate for the
end of the year
as he wants to do sorry I uh so 365 out
13
what the asking it's just so cool it's
time for the place out they want to see
how many days we have left over I see
and that is our remainder of days so
it's basically this is what we have left
when we just divide this I wasn't
understand what they were asking sorry
about the confusion there but modulo
let's go ahead and dive into this a
little bit more so if we were to do 15
modulo 13 we would have a remainder of
two now if we were to do 30 modulo 13 we
would have a remainder of 4
so I hope that clears that up a little
bit cool well I got a lot of stuff going
on in here all right let's go zoom out a
little bit okay so we're gonna be
talking about comments so oftentimes in
your comment in your code a good
programmer will put comments in there so
they can look back and read their code
and other colleagues of yours can look
at the code and catch up as well so
online right so a single night comment
that's denoted by two slashes and we can
go ahead and put opening line go ahead
and run that single line comments
multi-line comments are so calm out
outlines four to nine with a multi-line
comment so if we want to comment out a
bunch of stuff we can go ahead and put a
slash star and then star slash to
contain everything we want between those
two stars and we run that well and get
our first line right here this is a good
practice to get into I try to about
every 10 to 15 lines of code go back and
write a comment for each line of code
that's relevant so I definitely
encourage you to get in that practice
early as it's an introductory course and
if you're you're kind of working your
way through right now you may you know a
little tip and trick to start the right
way so that was our first introductory
course to JavaScript I hope you guys
found it helpful what we learned in here
is variables
your data using variables how to use the
console to log out data how to how to
get comments we also learned about the
math operators and a few of the math
operators well we'll be there's a whole
math library that I imagine the advanced
Java sphere of course will get into but
I hope you guys found the Sophal and
don't forget to Like subscribe and share
the video if you know anyone like it and
support me on patreon because it keeps
these videos going as always thanks for
watching I'll see you guys in the next
video thanks for watching the video
special thanks to our sponsor dev
Mountain definitely check them out at
dev Mountain comm if you're looking for
a boot camp that's in front-end
development iOS or UX go ahead and give
them a shot tuition includes housing so
you can get up and go and fully immerse
yourself in the program as always thanks
for watching I'll see you guys in the
