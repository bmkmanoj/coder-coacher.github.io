programming and what's going on in the
world right now so there's two things
that I kind of thought were pretty cool
when it came to some of these free
programming sites one of them is code
Academy not necessarily cool but code
Kadim e is releasing a paid version of
their site meaning they're now gonna
have like quizzes and tests and projects
projects are the big thing in my opinion
for each one they're one of their
languages and it's $19.99 a month which
is a lot I think like I think they could
have been just fine in $9.99 a month or
a flat rate a flat yearly rate like 50
dollars for the year something like that
I would have been totally cool with the
$20 a month seems a little bit high but
what do I know
so that's cool I'm gonna try it I'm
gonna try and do all redo the videos in
4k eventually and just kind of fix and
the videos will come out better because
I've been practicing programming every
single day for five months six months
include not including coursework but
every day we're on here doing videos so
the code Academy videos will come out
and you'll be able to see hey for $20 a
month this is what I get and in theory
they're supposed to expand upon that and
be like okay cool like $20 a month so
you're gonna be putting out more monthly
stuff right that's that's what I think
so that'd be cool
if that happened the second thing that I
thought was pretty cool with free code
camp is that Quincy Larson who's you
know kind of the main guy at free code
camp he on set as of today November 17th
2015 not a single person has finished
the free code camp challenge so to put
that in perspective they have a hundred
and forty thousand people who have taken
this court take it started taking
courses and so there's the there's the
front developer certificate the the full
stack development certificate and then
there's like seven hundred hours of pro
bono work that you can do for nonprofits
and stuff like that once you finish that
you finish the course right
so far okay so how many people have got
to that that 400 our front-end
curriculum a front-end developer there
you go
I'm reading I'm looking at the article
or front-end developer certificate 208
of a hundred and forty thousand okay
that's cool and that two hundred I don't
know I don't know what the percentage is
but I know it is very small and point
zero zero zero something okay so what
about the next level the 800 our full
stack development certificate
we're walking or walk twenty two people
a classroom of people out of 140,000 and
growing every day when I started this
free code camp they were at about one
hundred and thirty thousand and I think
I spend maybe five weeks since I've
started doing the free cooking maybe
four or six somewhere around there it's
all but it's less than six and so
they're big basically grew ten percent a
little bit about ten percent in about
five six weeks that's great
that's pretty good you that's uh that's
pretty solid and that's gonna keep
increasing exponentially I have a
feeling so those are kind of two things
I want to talk about look forward to my
next let's talk or I'll come up with a
name for it code talk maybe code talk
video I hope you guys enjoyed this sort
of stuff I really love talking about
things that I'm passionate about and
right now it's free code camp at code
Academy more free code camp because I
haven't been doing coke added me too
much but this is kind of I guess we'll
call it a general vlog blog video blog
vlog but I hope you guys are staying
up-to-date on the free code camp because
I want us I want subscriber wise like
this would be a dream is if we we could
compare subscribe like our man look
Dylan and his channel and subscribers
and we could beat the amount of people
that it fast because 22 you know as the
challenge keeps growing 22 I think we
could beat 22
be like everyone on here was a sub until
town oh my god through the roof
I'd uh I'd do like an Irish dance or
something I don't know oh I hope you
guys enjoyed the video as always
questions comments what you want me to
talk about programming wise coding wise
any sort of things and also on a side
note let's keep talking I'm a side note
I recently joined a group called coding
coffee in Long Beach and it's a cup it's
like a programming meetup free you know
various things and there's like
challenges and every time you go it's
really casuals you know there's code
coffee sometimes bagels and it's uh you
know like I'm going to one tonight
that's kind of an you know built off
that same same group of people but every
time I'm there 20 there's like 20 new
people that are showing up these things
are getting really big and I honestly
suggest you go to your meetup area and
type in coding programming and try and
find something like this because this is
there's nothing more rewarding than
talking to someone who's already been
there and be able to have a one-on-one
and be like amen
can I just pick your brain for 20
seconds here or like a man how did you
solve this because I know you're way
better than I am and there's no shame in
saying that there are people who are
significantly better than I those people
are significantly worse than someone
else and that's significant you only
worry about yourself man wherever you
fit in the programming ladder you know
skill wise the thing is start at the
bottom work your way you know
inch by inch inch by inch inch by inch
so use those meetups man they really
keeping you focused and it's it's great
to be able to talk to people about these
things that you're interested in and so
anyhow Coke ad amis going paid free coke
hits like Dark Souls of the free coke
adding world so that's that that's this
way it's a PITA those many people beat
dark souls on on hard as have completed
free code camps course which has been
around over a year by the way a year so
cool stuff I hope to hope you guys enjoy
this I enjoyed it and I have a nice one
the next one
we'll be I already filmed it I just have
to edit it the next one will be a formal
talk about three tips to become a better
programmer for beginners so three
absolute things you need to be doing if
you're trying to get your skill level
that so you the the purpose of the video
will be here are three tips to become a
better programmer so you can start
training your mind to think the way you
need to to solve problems see you guys
next video don't forget to share like a
