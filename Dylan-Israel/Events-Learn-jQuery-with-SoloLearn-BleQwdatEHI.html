in solo learn finishing up our jQuery
section we have I guess I'll finish up
we have two sections left we're in
events so in the past if you're trying
to do events you'd be doing a whole mess
of things so part of the great thing
about jQuery is it's the simplification
of what would seem at first glance
probably easier tasks so if we wanted in
vanilla JavaScript we'd have to first
get the element by ID like so then do
onclick then write a function however
now we can do it with just the dot click
function and then whatever we want to do
within there it does the same exact
thing except it's about half the amount
of code an event handler is so the event
handler is to click right here there the
function that's handled when we click it
so if some common events would be like
key down when you press a key when you
click when you hover all these sorts of
things that occur when you are trying to
handle events so find the blanks handle
click event so click event is probably
going to be the most common on the
paragraph tag so when you click we want
to run a function that alerts that it
has been clicked and then we want to go
ahead and close the function like so so
use the paragraph use of selector tag
for paragraphs to click to run a
function whatever you want to do when
that happens and continue on now there's
also another way of doing this so before
we're just doing click you can also do
all dot on and then pass in a string
parameter for what that event is going
to be so basically on and then what
would be click or on hover whatever the
event is you can do this as well which
is another way of handling events so
you're gonna use your selector in this
example we're selecting the form element
and we're saying on
what do we want to do on submit so on
submit on the submit event we want to
run a function that has some code in it
that's all we're doing here with our
jQuery class with our with our jQuery
event handler now off the argument off
method is the event name you want to
remove the handler for so you can also
remove the click handler for it so maybe
on click you do this and then you're
saying look remove the click handler so
when we're working with jQuery we have
to pass in the CSS identifier tag for
IDs which is the hash tag and then we're
saying off and we remove the handler
film links from the handler for the
focus event like so now the event object
now this is one I'm not too familiar
with what they mean by the event object
so let's slow down for a second to read
this every event handling function can
receive an event objects which kind of
contains properties and methods related
to the event page acts page y at the
time the event occurred okay so you can
the type of the event is like click
which if you want to specify the button
then you have the data the target
prevent default stop propagation it
looks like you can go into a lot more
detail with the event so the event
object is passed to the event handler
function as an argument I see so alert
event page X ok I see you so if you want
to pass in the event and all the
parameters related to the event you can
do that like so so in this case we want
to fill in the blanks to handle the
keydown event so we have key down and
we're passing in the event attribute to
do some stuff with it this is basically
data at the end of the day and kind of
data that we want handle and one way or
the other
so keydown event on the input field and
alert which key was pressed so we're
gonna say event dot you know I don't
remember what the value for the key down
was there the input field was so target
data
which which there we go so which is find
out what the key is so we're going to
fill in a key down key down and then for
the event we want to find out what key
was pressed if we do this alert meant a
box will show up showcasing that we
press ENTER to enter our escape for
whatever now we can also trigger events
programmatically using the trigger
method so what this basically does is we
can set in our codes I say look trigger
the click of it now whatever we have
setup for click when that div is clicked
will then run and we don't have to worry
worry about it being clicked and less
for this instance so if we want to
trigger the submit event on form we can
do that as well so creating a to-do list
this is probably the most basic jquery
project you'll see give an h1 tag say my
to-do list so the gist of what's going
on here is we want to when we click the
button add the value to our Oh el list
here so we want to fill the blank so we
have some close our h1 tags and close
our Li tags and finally close our
ordered list tags okay so we're getting
started there now what else we need to
do is say look we want to add on click
that's what this is saying here and then
this is our event handler take it up one
level inside the event handler we then
select the value of the input field to
create a new Li element so we're now
creating an element like so notice how
we're not selecting the element we're
actually creating it just by passing in
an opening and closing tag we're gonna
set the text equal to the value and it's
going on and on and on the gist of it is
that we're creating that Li that we are
then going to append to wherever the my
list ID is we can go ahead and clear the
input as well let's go ahead and
actually open this one up because I
think it'll be easier to explain as we
work through it so let's run this real
quick so you see we have our h1 and then
we have a new item
let's open up the JavaScript real quick
so in our new item let's say create a
channel I don't know what's gonna happen
here is it's gonna check this is
statement checks to see if this box is
empty if it's not empty we're then going
to create a li element and we're gonna
add that value remember and we're
getting the value from the input valve
which is going to get the text value now
if we want to append that we want to add
it we're going to go ahead and add this
button which it and then we're going to
append the element to my list and then
we're gonna go ahead and clear this so
you see that BAM and what's getting
created here is this X to clear it out
as well that's the gist of what's
happening a simple to-do list
now let's go ahead and fill in the
blanks to create a new element and add
it to the element with the ID test so
we're creating a brand new div here and
to create an element's again you have to
have an opening and closing tag and
we're gonna go ahead and target the test
tag and we want to append the this div
right here so we're saying like a
pendant new div to this ID pretty pretty
straightforward when it comes to
remembering to do this cool all that is
left to do is to remove the
corresponding element so we talked about
that a second ago so what what keyword
represents the current object I believed
it oh so if you're dealing with an
object and you don't necessarily know
the name but you know that you're gonna
be dealing with that object you can use
this keyword to target it directly like
so so module five quiz so fill in the
blanks at event handler to the ferris so
remember we can also use the on and to
find what event it is in this example
let's click and we want to run a
function that does some stuff when a
paragraph is clicked and what will the
output of the tip be if click two times
so we have a div that has one here then
our script tag basically just saying run
this code and we're saying when this div
is clicked get the text of the div and
then from that text or the text of the
div is going to be equal to the text
plus one so if we click it twice it's
then going to iterate twice which means
we're going to go ahead and output three
what dot text plus one what am i
misunderstanding here oh excuse me
because this is text and not so this is
a string guys right so I'm treating it
as if it's an integer so this what's
happening is when you get the text it's
just actually pulling the text value
which is why we're gonna have 1 1 1
there we go now fill in the blanks to
remove the click event handler from all
AI elements so again with
with the the on-click first year with
jQuery you're gonna first use the
selector in this case it is going to be
the a elements we're gonna select all
them and then we're gonna pass it on and
then we're going to find what the event
is via string so when you select this is
selecting the a object saying pay
attention to this saying on what event
and then this is the event oh excuse me
remove the element so the exact same
except we're doing office it on my
mistake and then finally how many a
characters will output after the Divis
click three times so we have a div and
we want it when this div is clicked we
want to append an A and then div is off
dot click hmm
so we're gonna turn this off I believe
and I'm not quite sure how the scope
works here is it off when it's nested in
this function cuz if so we're gonna have
four divs yeah let's get a hint I I
don't want to jump around I want to see
so - okay so once you do click even
though it's I was thinking it might be
nested in this function that's not the
case so once you turn that click
function off is not going to turn back
on even until you actually do it
yourself so keep that in mind so we have
the first one then we click it once it
appends the anchor tag and then we turn
it off and so it doesn't matter how many
times we click it after that is no
longer going to going to pend the ace
like so cool so that was the event stack
we're up to our last one effects which
is something that in jQuery I will admit
that I've kind of skipped over I usually
use some pre-built libraries and things
like that that's uh that's my
shortcomings as a developer but I'm glad
