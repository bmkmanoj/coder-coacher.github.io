stats regarding computer science degrees
should you get one why why not when does
it make sense and one doesn't it makes
sense there's so not everything in life
is black and white and that goes the
same with getting a computer science
degree let's dive into it so as a as a
blanket statement and mind you not
everything in life is black and white
which is why I wanted to do this video
but generally speaking you do want to
have a computer science degree when
you're going into the field and there's
a couple of reasons for that one it's
one of the best degrees you can get and
we'll show some stats based off that but
it's also one of the fastest growth the
industries that are evolve around there
is the typical entry-level education and
this is going off the Europe US Bureau
of Labor Statistics is a bachelor's
degree that doesn't mean it's the only
way and that doesn't mean that it's that
maybe it's right for you I know it
wasn't right for me I made it to the
towards the end of my junior year before
I dropped out and there you know I'm not
one in a million there are other
self-taught developers that are going
about this but computer science as a
degree is a very good degree we're
looking at software developers because
it's one of the more large category of
jobs so let's just talk about that for a
quick second before we dive into a
little bit of the the negative aspects
of it or the the more the more
controversial stuff so in terms of jobs
number of jobs and this is based off
2014 there's there's a ton of jobs if
you see a million jobs in anything in
the US Bureau of Labor Statistics that
it has a median income of one hundred
and two thousand there's not too many
and that there's a million jobs and it's
growing by 17 percent over the next
year's I think that's actually probably
on the low end I think that's gonna be
increasing but the point being it's
growing much faster than the average job
out there and it's hard to keep up with
the supply of confident developers and
to get a computer science degree and
mind you you're not going to be making
102 thousand dollars this is the middle
part so let's say your MIT intermediate
developer that's probably the
middle the medians of middle most parts
so that's probably where you're gonna
land I think that's a fair statement but
the average person is going to need a
bachelor's degree to break into the
field to get that big break to continue
to make you know $50 an hour so so so
forth but not as I mentioned not
everything is black and white so let's
talk about some of the the negative
aspects of computer science here so as
of 2016 and I'm going to guess in 2017
and 2018 we'll find out as this year
wraps up and the next year continues on
the student debt for the average college
grad is $37,000 $137,000 per person so
that means that the average person is
graduating with a year's worth salary of
debt if you're making about let's say
sixty grand which is the average
computer science student starting salary
and my dua I've known developers who
have started out of my my old school Cal
State Los Angeles where some have gone
and they started it at 45 and some
started at 80 and so it depends right
but with the average person starting at
60 $37,000 a debt if you're living at
home and not everyone is but let's say
in a situation where you're living at
home and you don't have to pay rent
after taxes if you basically gave them
80 cents on every dollar that went into
your pocket you could be clear of your
student debt in a year that's that's a
lot of money to give away not give away
but that's a lot of it's a very
unrealistic situation for a lot of
people right and it's one of those
things where only because the starting
salary of computer science majors and of
the growth in that field right a lot of
these other fields such as human human
these are social sciences you're
basically at a $37,000 starting salary
after spending four plus years of your
life $37,000 of debt to get a degree in
that doesn't even really make a lot of
sense
from from a numbers standpoint right but
my standpoint on college is you're there
to get skills to be a a valued employee
to land a job some people have a much
more I don't say liberal but a different
opinion where you're going to get an
education you're going to expand your
mind I'm more so I'm going to put things
into my mind to give me skills to go
make good money and so that's some of
the the issues I've had with colleges my
personal experience but as a computer
science major and engineering on top of
that these are the degrees that are
going to allow you to actually pay your
student debt off there's a lot of people
who go into debt and they just wait I
think it's 15 years to pay it back so
from a from a practical standpoint it
sucks you're getting thirty seven
thousand dollars of debt you're spending
four plus years of your life but yes it
is a good salary as a blanket statement
it is a good degree to get based off of
what it helps you do because it is the
typical entry-level education required
to become a software developer there's
other job categories in here that's just
the largest one but most of them are
going to be very similar it is a fast
growing field it is one of the higher
paying fields and it's one of the
fastest growing income fields in terms
of how fast you can get to a hundred
thousand the the jump from the thirty
seven thousand here to 50 thousand is as
quick of a jump as you know thirteen
thousand dollar jump it will be this the
same as going for about sixty to a
hundred on average that's been my
experience but you know one case first a
study of one or two not not the best but
I think it's a pretty pretty fair
statement to make that your your income
starting larger grows larger quicker and
being more in demand people are willing
to pay you more so that so as a blanket
statement yes you should get a computer
science degree but not everybody in
their life has four years there there is
a you know there is a a world outside of
somebody going straight from high school
into college or you know a couple years
after some people have made mistakes in
their life some people you know maybe
the guy in trouble with the law and they
got locked up or maybe they maybe they
were just out partying man maybe their
whole their whole existence from
eighteen to thirty I was like look man
I'm just gonna date I'm gonna be in a
band I'm going to have other priorities
and then by the time you hit 30 and
you're sick of living at your parents
house or something like that
and and no judgments by the way I'm just
saying I'm just trying to paint the
picture that you may you may want to go
to school but at 30 or at you know age
you may have children you may have to
take care of those kids you may have you
know a wife family issues whatever it
may be but you may have other
responsibilities as somebody who's 18 to
22 or 19 to 20 23 doesn't have to worry
about and so for years isn't necessarily
a realistic outlook for you so what do
you do in that instance and it's a
computer science degree best for you
maybe not it's something consider you
know everyone everyone kind of believes
that a a as a as a almost as a fact that
if you don't have a degree you are going
to be homeless poor a crackhead and a
failure in life right that's that's the
paint paint fixer and I buy into it just
as much as everybody else so what I
would say is consider what is the
alternative what is the alternative well
in terms of going to get a cs3 why do
you get a CS degree you go to be in
demand you go to have a good job be paid
well live a good life you basically want
financial stability that's that's my
understanding why you go get two CS
degree it's not because you necessarily
love algorithms it's not because you you
wanted to get better at calculus what
you wanted was to get a degree that
degree is worth your employment you
being a valued employee and from there
going out and proving that you have
these get these skills via the degree
and then moving on to to get paid for
such such skills so what I would argue
is that if you are in a situation in
which the idea of you know
maybe you're a little later in life
let's just say 40 then you're trying to
do a career change maybe you I know I
know I have a lot of people who you know
they did more physical jobs reach out to
me I say what can I do is it too late
for me to get started in this field I
injured my back
I was a carpenter I was construction
ex-military and I can't do the job that
I wanted and I want to make sure it's
not too late not at all but you may want
to open your mind to not doing computer
science or you may want to open your
mind to being a self-taught developer
even going to a boot camp because of
that now again as a blanket statement
yes you should get a CS degree it will
make your life easier in the fact that
you're gonna be valued a little bit more
it's not the only thing you can do which
i think is why I wanted to make this
video because a lot of people really do
think it's the only thing that you can
do typical entry level education that's
a very good way of putting that is that
this is expect now you have more than
that great your life's going to be
easier right if you have a masters or
PhD of course is gonna be easier because
you're better than the average employee
in the education in the typical
entry-level education now how do you how
do you move forward right how do you how
do you get better how do you have you
how do you overcome the fact that you
don't have a degree a lot of different
things one is a boot camp boot camp
might still it's about let's say the
average boot cast about $10,000 you may
not you may look you're gonna learn
quite a bit in three months understand
that you're gonna have to continue your
learning before the boot camp and after
the boot camp and you're still going to
be taking out debt not $37,000 source of
debt but ten thousands or so dollars are
dead ain't go from there you're also
gonna be learning in-demand skills in
that ass in that in that way and you're
going to you're going to be learning
things that are used now one that one
the gripes with with a traditional
education such as getting SES degree is
a lot of times you're learning outdated
stuff right you're learning you're
learning stuff that sometimes 10 years
behind and you're learning more
theoretical stuff rather than practical
stuff right
my first job that I got that was in the
field I didn't even know what a
wireframe was
right I didn't know anything like that I
never written any JavaScript and mind
you haven't I went into web development
but there's a lot of things that do
overlap that I had never been introduced
to and from my understanding of what my
senior year was going to be like and I
could be wrong but I have several
friends who are CS Christ
none of these concepts that are actually
used or software's or technologies were
used we're going to be introduced so
they're there there is a reason like why
sub bootcamp grads can get hired
immediately after a three-month boot
camp now you also are gonna have to be
unique kandi you're also going depth to
go and self teach for a very long time
you're going to need to be able to
convince an employer that takes your
call takes your interview why you're
better or at least as good and someone
who's spent their time pursuing a SES
degree so that because there is the
reason I bring this up it's not that I'm
completely Pro boot camp I do like boot
camps for certain people I think about
half people half of the people who go
into boot camps will actually not be
successful in the field I think the
other half we're going to be successful
no matter what because they're willing
to work hard they just they couldn't see
themselves going and spending you know
forty almost forty thousand dollars in
school four years of their time and
instead they said look I can take three
months of my time three to four months
of my time continue learning before and
after that three months take out 1/4 the
amount of debt and in those three years
and nine months that I have after that
boot camp and I say ok I compare that to
the four years I'm going to spend in
school I think I can be at the point
where perhaps I'm still earning money
and I'm saving money you're making money
why the other person is taking out debt
and going to school and you're actually
working in the field via internships and
and climb your way up and jump jobs and
keep moving up right my first real job
are still my first relevant experience
was $12 an hour two hours away doing an
internship at a web design shop did that
freelance moved into you know
technical documentation a software
company then I got my full stack roll
now I'm moving on to my next role
starting on Monday so it is it is
possible it's a lot of hard work but
there's a reason and in I want to say
was stack overflows 2016 developer
survey 90% of developers said that they
were self-taught it's not actually true
in terms of did they go and get a degree
yes about half the developers in that
survey had some sort of technical degree
but why did 90% of those developers say
they were self-taught because that's
what it takes to succeed in this field
is you are going to have to be able to
self teach yourself the whole your whole
career especially especially especially
especially when you were just breaking
in because you need to be better than
everybody else to to grow your career to
be able to be more marketable and
especially if you don't have the degree
right so it's not the only path it's
probably the safest path especially if
you're if you're on the if you're if
you're on the younger side right and you
you have you have a a more traditional
look I probably if I was going home and
I have to worry about rent and I have to
worry about food and bills and I was
living at home I might I would say I
probably had a better chance of
finishing my degree just because there's
less stress in my life and things are
easier my point being that if you have
other responsibilities in life it may
not be a practical thing but in terms of
just pure numbers talking about cs
degree it is one of the best degrees you
can get it has one of the highest
starting salaries it has one of the
highest growth rates it has a large
amount of jobs and it has one of the
highest pace
pay ceilings that you can get and one of
the great things about it is that pay
can skyrocket depending on how good of a
developer you are and it gives you the
skills to make money on your own there
there's not a lot of degrees out there
that make it as easy to learn ski
that you can build a web application
make money it gives you live very
technical skills that you can freelance
from any point in the world the whole
digital Nomad lifestyle right huh and
it's one it's it's just one of those
great degrees that adds to that so
generally speaking yes you should get a
CS degree but it's not the only path
there are others self-taught it's
definitely one pull yourself up grind it
out boot camp and you're gonna have to
be self-taught one way or the other I
shirt you whether you get a degree or
not and continue on and your education
is usually going to continue on your
dime or another time one of the things
that that I've talked about is you can
always go to a boot camp start working
and then go back to school part-time if
you really feel like you need that to
pad your resume or to even break into
the field now the the reason I suggest
that is because some employers will
actually pay for your education they
will pay a significant portion or all to
get you to stick around the average
employee in in this in this region in
the top tech companies stays at them you
know I'm talking like the top ten or
fifteen stays at a company for like a
year and a half or one point two years
and I'm sure there's stress and
everything like that but they want to
keep employees and employers job
nowadays is you find competent people
and keep those competent people and if
you're competent and you work hard
they're going to want to keep you which
is why another thing you can do is find
the employer that will pay for that at
the company that you want to stick
around for for awhile so that's my
thoughts on should you get a CS degree
from at least as uh I try to give a very
unbiased approach to it I know I I know
anytime that you are a dropout
even though I think I have a you know
going to the end of my junior year I
have a pretty open understanding of what
entails in a CS degree people are still
just gonna tell it say in the comment
section that I'm a bitter dropout and I
couldn't cut it and everything like that
so the only I could do about that but I
hope I was able to give a a fair
accurate
statement asked you why you should get
us yes degree and why you shouldn't if
that isn't necessarily the best path for
you because at the end of the day guys
you have to be you have to do what's
best for yourself blaze your own path in
any way you can and that even goes in
into you know this so thank you for
watching the video don't forget to
comment like subscribe and share support
me on patreon all that good stuff
and let me know what your thoughts are
you know maybe maybe you guys think I'm
completely dead wrong and they self
Stotts the only way I don't know this is
I tried to base my stuff more are
statistical experience as well so thanks
for watching guys I'll see you in the
next video bye hey guys thanks for
watching the video if you happen to be
looking for a boot camp I couldn't
recommend dev Mountain any higher they
also include housing with their tuition
so you can get up and go and get started
right away thanks again for watching and
I'll see you guys in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
