showed you how to basically do a quick
count down for the accession timing now
what we're gonna do is we're actually
going to transition to the break time so
what happens once our countdown timer
ends and we have nothing for the break
time so luckily a lot of its stuffs very
similar so we're gonna go ahead and
actually we'll start fresh let's start
fresh
so similar to how this timer went if our
count is equal to zero this is going to
be where it's going to tell the computer
hey this is you need to trigger the
break time function so here within our
count equal to zero we're gonna say look
we need to create a variable here that
we're gonna call start right and we're
going to set this equal to the set
interval it's a function that we make a
callback function we create a call break
timer and we're gonna run that every
thousand seconds now let's go to the top
create a global variable here oh we
already did call break time look at us
we're on top of it
and what we're gonna do is we're gonna
going to go ahead and call that function
so let's go ahead and create it so we're
gonna create a function called break
timer
I want to create so here we go outside
of the timer function the function break
timer can look almost identical to what
we just did in break timer now within
here we're going to target the time type
to change the HTML so remember how we
let's change this to say session time
all we want to do is change it to break
time so that the user knows if they're
on break or not so we play the sound and
instantly we want to say look HTML
change this to break time nice now the
next thing we want to do is show the
break number because remember the break
number may be different than the session
that may be different than the session
number and so that's why we have two
different values so we're gonna bring
that back we're gonna say look show us
the break num again so remember we hid
that so we're saying bring it back show
it to us
and on that point now that we're done
with our num we can go ahead and hide it
in here so we'll go ahead and target it
because we don't want that zero hanging
around messing up our styling and
formatting them just looking kind of
awkward it doesn't know when it needs to
go home so we're telling you go home so
let's go ahead and hide the num so we're
setting up a little bit of just a little
bit of formatting more or less when you
really think about it now what do we
want to do here basically exactly what
we did did before we want to take our
break time I believe us and we won a -
set break time we call - break time -
one we're gonna throw a little bit of
logic here it says if break time is
exactly equal to zero meaning we're done
go ahead and clear that interval like we
did before basically saying look stop
counting down stop running the set
interval function it doesn't know how to
do that without you telling it to do it
so we did so break
something's wrong
sorry I'm just looking I know
something's wrong here I think I may
have to throw this in my timer function
which I may not have done yeah whoops so
we need this to be in the same scope
that's what we're trying to do here just
go ahead and just throw this in ours
there we go
so our start break is in the correct
location everything is working
everything everybody's happening so our
break timer here little space so we're
gonna show the break now we're gonna -
it I think this is a good point to go
ahead and check make sure everything is
working like it's supposed to so we're
gonna really add five seconds we're
gonna start it so there's our session
time counting down so when that hits
zero it should switch to break time play
our sound and they start counting down
from times up so there's a break time
but we didn't add logic toutput our
break time excellent but good so far so
good more or less so there is our logic
we're then going to say look turn your
break time or break no excuse me what's
it look like numb and dot html' great
time save it run it make sure
everything's working
let's go ahead and start it so four
three two one time's up cool so now that
we've done that what we need to
basically do is just do some formatting
we need to clean this up we need to set
our reset button come and we actually
have to set this in minutes and in
seconds the first thing that we can do
is do the reset so in the next video
what we'll do is we'll set up a reset
button so we have the case
okay our breaks finished now what do we
do and then after that we'll do some
formatting and that's pretty much it so
