about how to get started with Arduino
and PI it's something that I've been
interested in we're talking about what
project I'm going to build and how
that's actually gonna help my my
portfolio and how if you're interested
in that field you can get started
relatively quickly cheaply and easily so
before we get started I wanna thank our
sponsor device plus.com this is gonna be
a good portion of the video talking
about why and how I plan on getting
started to learn Arduino and Pi and what
projects I'm going to be working on if
you know if you're not familiar with
that device plus comm they also have a
Japanese website device plus JP for
those of you who are International which
is about half my audience and I think
about seven percent of my audience is
actually Japanese as well so the site is
ran by a semi conductor business ro hm
so you have some engineers that are
creating these very detailed how-to
guides inspirational guides and the
how-to section is what I really like
about the site it's kind of similar to
web development aspect that a lot of
people are like how do I learn web
development and one thing I've been
telling people you know it's a little
more complicating this but build stuff
build stuff build projects build
portfolio items and thing I like about
Raspberry Pi is you can kind of do the
same thing if that's what you're
interested in in your your you know
let's say you're a teenager you're
you're young you're young man young
woman and you want to when you're by the
time you're 18 have a portfolio of stuff
that you can showcase you can definitely
do that by building projects in
raspberry pi similar to how you could do
that by building web applications for
web development and it's really gotten
quite large so originally Raspberry Pi
and Arduino started out only taking a
few languages Python it comes standard
with several now in terms Arduino which
is Python c-sharp C++ scratch Ruby and I
believe Java but now there's additional
ways that you can enable HTML
script jQuery Perl Erlang and I don't
know too much about that just know that
it's possible and it excites me because
some of the projects that I'm looking
forward to I'm going to one I once I do
one of their projects on here through
the how to guys so you can see so it's
pretty cool you could build a you know
Rover vehicle to travel about robotic
arm I I imagine myself at some point
creating like an arm with a laser
pointer and then circling around so my
cats can chase it and whatnot
lots of pretty cool stuff and beginner
guys as well to to get you guys so my
plan is and how I learned is I like to
take one of these more beginner projects
and you can see right here for free apps
every engineering student chef so it
definitely not only are they going to
try and give you you know there's a
little bit of money involved when
talking about hardware but raspberry
PI's and our dueños are very cheap
nowadays and then you can really get
started with just a few dollars to get
you know the bare minimum and go from
there so the way that I'm going to be
using device plus in the future so I'm
actually gonna find a how-to guide
preferably one that has a little bit
more emphasis on connecting to the
internet because that's what how why are
my projects flying good go I'm gonna
build that out and I'll probably do a
video showcasing it or at least
reviewing it or showing off my project
and then when I'm done with that one
project and I feel like I got the hang
of it I'm going to go and I'm going to
build my own project so what am I gonna
build some of you may or may not be
surprised by this but it's gonna be
YouTube related alright so um all my
side projects are YouTube related right
now because that's that's definitely
something I'm very passionate about and
I'm gonna get the skills by going to
device plus comm plugin that sponsor
hard right and then we are going to I'm
going to build two things probably this
is the first one but what I want to do
and I thought this is kind of a simple
but fun sort of project is I want to get
a red light bulb that every time I gain
a subscriber and you'll know this
through the YouTube API right so I'd
have to connect the YouTube API to it
somehow I mean I've done that on
my my website coding tutorial 360 comm
where it displays my most recent video
it updates my total views the total
videos all the stats that I want to
display so I'm gonna do something
similar except now I'm gonna connect it
to hardware and what's gonna happen is
every time I gain a subscriber I just
want to flash for like five seconds
that's project 1 and I think a pretty
reasonable project like it and I'll
probably just put it in my office a cool
little thing that I've built that it's
kind of like you know that is
interesting and unique right I think
that I think similar to how a lot of how
I say a lot of what gets you hired as a
developer is being unique I think the
same can go for getting getting started
in a more Hardware specific role that
uses raspberry PI's and things like that
and so that's project number one the
second project which is a little more
costly is I want to take one of my old
computer monitors I may have to get a TV
I'm not this is all hypothetical but I
imagine both of these are accomplishable
I want to take a old old monitor I have
and I want to put music connected to a
Raspberry Pi and whenever I get a new
comment I want that to be the number one
thing on the screen like just it display
that one comment on the screen that's
how that's those are my two projects I'm
pretty excited about it and I think it'd
be a cool thing to add to the office
write something that's unique to me that
I built still has a little bit to do
with web dev but now is diving into the
hardware like and that nephilim thinks
when you want to go into a different
direction than you're accustomed to it's
okay to ease yourself in yeah you know
build something that you're you're going
to enjoy making because the hardest
thing is to force yourself to do
something you don't enjoy so find a way
to take a new material in this case for
me working with Raspberry Pi and going
about building something that you're
gonna be excited about that's going to
be fun and that you're like that you
it's funny a smile on your face and that
kind of checks all the boxes for me but
first I gotta make sure I get started
with a how-to guide through on device
plus because
don't really know where to go right this
isn't my field of expertise is something
I've always been interested in and I've
done a couple I've had a couple sponsors
in the past who have sent me like kits
little Raspberry Pi kits where I build
like a a mood light in something along
those lines our like a fan and you know
it it detects the temperature of the
room and if it's if it's there it starts
shooting in the wind so I've had a lot
of things like that I've been putting in
videos out on them yet but I've built a
couple of these things in the past and
so it's something that has been
interested to me but I've never actually
built my own thing right I've never
actually said okay I you know in in free
code camper in my channels example you
see me build a weather application and
you build that same weather application
I've done that now what I now what I
need to do is I need to go the next
level I need to build my own application
from scratch using the skills that I've
kind of put it all together right I have
the tools let's see if I actually know
how to use the tools rather than
following a set of instructions and
that's really how you learn which is why
I really would recommend following some
how-to guides because they give you an
instance of hell ok this is an example
of how you might build something and
let's see if you can kind of understand
where their thought process is coming
from and how you're gonna implement that
in the future for yourself and how and
you know maybe you don't maybe you
struggle a little bit it's far the
learning process struggling hardware
software it's alright because you're
gonna be learning what not to do it's
just as important as what to do so I'm
pretty excited about it I'm interested
in what some of your guys's projects are
if you want to share them in the
description below I'd love to if any are
really super cool I'll definitely make
sure to give you guys some shout outs
and but definitely check out device plus
comm they have a bunch of how-to guides
by very good I mean they're
semiconductor business that's pretty
that's pretty impressive right like that
is your business it's it's pretty much
as technical as you can get right
software and technology it's not it's
it's impressive to me anyhow because I I
I'm a livery limited person in hardware
right I understand software I can barely
get my printer to work all right so it's
it's impress it's very impressive
to me so definitely go over device plus
com
give them some love thank you so much
for watching the video guys I'm excited
I can't wait to show you my projects
which will probably be in about two to
three months I have a lot of side
projects right now but I'm excited to to
showcase that maybe I'll try to get done
in two months at least the light bulb
one I think I can get that one going
pretty quickly and hopefully by then
you'll have some projects to show me and
show everybody else so thank you for
watching don't forget like share
subscribe to support me on patreon all
that good stuff guys I will see you in
the next video and thank you just want
to thank one more time device plus
column for sponsoring this video there's
not a lot of sponsored videos I do on
this channel so I try to choose them
carefully and it's really cool if they
decided to put the money up to do that
so I really hope if you're interested in
some how-to guides on our dueña or pi
you check them out thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
