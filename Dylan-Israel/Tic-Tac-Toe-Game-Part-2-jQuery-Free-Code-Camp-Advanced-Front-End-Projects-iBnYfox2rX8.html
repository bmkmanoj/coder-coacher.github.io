backing free code camp build a
JavaScript calculator last time we did a
live the HTML a little bit of the setup
and we're gonna dive right back in and
finish this bad boy out so the first
thing that we're gonna do is actually
jump right back into the HTML and kind
of make it a little more known which
turn you start with now by default we
set it up as turn X and then computer
turn o so we're gonna stick with the
convention all we have to do is take
this BTN primary on turnout I'm gonna
put it to secondary to basically set it
so that you can whichever one you have
clicked it's the one that you're gonna
be using here so you'll see right here
turn X is Auto selected and that's the
one that's gonna be up the one that's
down are turned off like so so let's do
that we just did that real quick now we
are going to do a lot of weird logic
that I took that I've kind of
embarrassed to show but it kind of works
so we'll go with it
first thing we're gonna do is something
that's pretty straightforward we're
actually going to redo it create a reset
function so let's go ahead and do that
we're just gonna call a function here
and we're gonna call it a reset the
reason we need a reset is whenever you
change your turn we don't want people
changing their turns in between stuff so
we're just gonna take our turns array
and reset it equal to the original right
here we're also gonna reset this count
variable that I'll explain why this even
exists later on so a set count is equal
to zero and then we're gonna change the
text of all our tic-tac-toe spots back
to what it is so we're going to target
the class set the text back to the
hashtags and then we're going to take
our game on true variable which is
another thing that we use here to keep
track of the computer turn and see if
who has oops who has won and who has
lost so let's now that we have that out
of the way let me go
up to my notes over here we can go ahead
and do this do this to this to this
they look at turn swapping out nope my
my bad we have to actually go ahead and
call the reset function here so I'll
call reset not on not on the click turn
but when we swapped classes here on both
of these so we call a reset here when we
switch to turn zero right or no then we
call a reset here the only switch to
turn X it's gonna save that and you'll
see right here now we switch turns L
reset switch back it'll reset cool so
that's good to go we have our turn out
click function done we have our turn
next click function we have the player
turn or the tick click function done
let's go ahead and jump up to our player
turn so we we omitted some code here
because we were just trying to it's
trying to follow this a little bit more
logically how I actually did it
in order so last time we said last time
what we did was we got the value that
was in here we then checked to make sure
it wasn't taken if it if it uh if it
wasn't we then added that turn to our
array now we're gonna take a up top here
we're gonna go ahead and create this VAR
count variable so VAR count and we're
gonna set it equal to zero this is going
to be used later on to keep track of the
player and the computer turns so that
the computer doesn't go on indefinitely
I had this I had a wall loop issue and
this is what this is for keeps track of
computers turn so No indefinite so no
loop no loop there we go
let's not showcase my spelling here now
in here we're gonna go ahead and jump
back into the players turn where are we
players turn like so we're just going to
increment that count
we're basically keeping track of how
many turns have taken place that's what
that count is so there can be a maximum
of nine turns now what we want to do
next is set the remember the game on
variable that's to see if we're still
playing if nobody won so we're gonna go
to the win condition right now we're
gonna have a win condition this is gonna
be a function that's gonna check to see
if anybody want and it's gonna take in
two parameters it's going to take in our
turns array which is all the positions
and what's their X's and O's and then
our current turn so if we want to check
if they won this Turner not so we're
gonna create a function called win
condition this is gonna have a lot of
code in it but it's pretty simple logic
if you've ever played tic-tac-toe so
function win condition and it's going to
take in our turn array all right turns
array and then our current turn remember
you can rename these parameters whatever
you want and we're gonna give an example
here of the very first one there's gonna
be a lot of if and a lot of else if
statements this first one let's go ahead
and paste in here we'll explain what's
going on
so if turn arrays 0 remember each one of
these represents 0 1 2 drops down 3 4 5
drops down 5 or excuse me 6 7 8 so if
turn 0 is here and then turn 1 is here
and turn 2 is equal to equal to current
turn is then gonna pop up here and say
player X so who's ever turn it was that
wins 1 the
row across zero one in two spots we're
gonna reset our game on here
remember this keeps track of who won
we're gonna set that equal to true the
reason for this is a break a while loop
and a check we're gonna do some checking
in here and then we're gonna reset the
values alert the the player one and
we're gonna basically do that for all of
the values across and so I'm gonna just
copy and paste in a whole bunch of else
if statements here and then a final else
to say game on is false which basically
tells the computer that it can take its
turn since we did not just win I'm gonna
copy and paste this in here so you see
we have our if turn I'm just gonna open
this up a little bit we have our if turn
and then we're gonna have a whole mess
of other things here the logic is pretty
much the same so we had the first one
was left right and you'll see that our
current turn this it right now we're
just comparing the player turn goes way
I'm gonna put the computer turn logic
but we're gonna be able to recall this
function and it's gonna say the current
turn whatever player is currently won
now if you want to say computer you
could probably pass in a third function
and do something like that but I kind of
did the bare minimum for this one this
is two four six so this would be two
four six so across and we check for all
the various things and we put in some
alerts here mainly to help and then
finally down here if none of these are
correct then we set game on equal to
false meaning that the game continues on
at which point we then queue the
computers turn so right here we set the
win condition remember that's what calls
that we call that win condition function
so that's our win condition function
we're done with that now but now in our
player's turn function we run this if
the player doesn't win so we're sort of
if statement says look if that player
didn't win and get that means game on is
equal equal to false we want to run our
computer turn
function and then after that grant we
haven't written computer 10th turn
function yet we want to run the win
condition function that takes in our
current turns array and then takes in
the computers turn which was either an X
or no so we're gonna go ahead and write
our computer turn function now which is
a lot of logic as well a lot of a lot of
logic in this one I think I could have
done this a little bit better and my in
my in my this is not something one of my
proudest moments but a little bit
confusing but uh it works it's one of
those boys it it's works don't change
 I don't care if we could do it
better it works computers turn so we're
creating a computer turned computers
turn function now we are going to create
a variable here that's going to be used
to break the wall loop essentially and
then so that's is our VAR taken we set
that equal to false now we're gonna do a
while loop because the computer is gonna
choose a a choose a spot at random and
it may be it may be um it may be taken
so we don't want to negate its turn so
that's why we use a while loop and we're
gonna say taken is equally little false
so let's choose there's two um
parameters to continue this while loop
so while taken is exactly equal to false
and count which implements every single
time a player takes a turn is not equal
to five so player will have five turns
I'll go one two three four five and then
break the reason for that is the player
will indefinitely if they're all nine
spaces are taken the computer will keep
on trying to find a move that it won't
be able to actually put anywhere because
all nine spaces are taken and thus
creating an infinite loop and this was
how I solved this issue so we're
guessing not equally go to five do our
while loop now what we're gonna do next
is generate the computer's random turn
so generate computers random turn we
save our computers move and we're gonna
set this equal to a random variable so
Matt Lohr use the math dot random
because we're working between 0 to night
we're gonna type it by 10 then we're
gonna drop all the decimal places so
we're gonna call to fixed on it and that
will be our computers move the next
thing we're gonna do is we're just gonna
create a move variable that is going to
output that onto the correct spot so
we're gonna target this like so and
we're gonna put we're gonna do an if
statement excuse me
we're gonna create the variable that's
going to get the value for where that
square is so if it generates a 0 it's
gonna get the value of the text that's
in here we're gonna set this equal to a
variable and again similar that we did
the players here when your fashioned the
hash tag and then we're gonna pass in
the computers move basically we're
getting the ID then we're gonna get the
text that's in that ID and if it's a
hash tag so if that move is exactly
equal to the hash tag we're gonna allow
it to make it and then we're gonna set
our takin spot equal to true and that
way it doesn't continue to go on it'll
break the loop and then every time this
runs it will reset right here so all we
have to do now is get the text from that
block or set the text for that block
rather so we're gonna use the selector
like so we're going to pass in the hash
tag we're gonna pass in
the computers turn and then we're gonna
call the dot text on it and excuse me
we're gonna call that text which is
gonna then set it to the computer's turn
and then finally we're gonna go ahead
and add that value into the turns array
so we're going to take Computers move
which is remember a number right here
the number that we generated we're gonna
set that index and we set it equal to
computers turn the whether they're XOR
is zero and now that we have that I
believe we are actually done and let's
jump out to the players turn make sure I
finish that up you'll see right here we
call the computers turn if the player
didn't win and then we check to see if
the computer won so let's save this and
hope that I did not forget anything so
the player starts out we're gonna start
out as turn Oh
and unfortunately the computer did not
go so Dylan has to go find out why let's
go ahead and look at our logic oh this
is computer turn change that to
computers turn let's go and try this one
more time that's still into it
interesting interesting
that's actually meant to be computer
turn from what I can tell on my code
here so it one second guys as we all
know sometimes we make a little mistake
sir so how I like to disclose all the
stuff this absolutely unrelated the tick
the function the reset players turn
we're gonna look at this first do a
little bit debugging we check to see if
the spots taken if not we go ahead and
increment actually let's start from the
top that'll be easier we set a default
turn we then check our array we set the
computers to a default we then set a
count equal to zero here we have our
game on equal to false turn X you don't
need that either you don't need that
either computers turn let's jump down to
here this needs to be a computer turn
and we have our VAR takin value equal to
false and we have a while loop that says
well-taken is equal so false and count
is not equal equal to five we want to
generate a random move from the computer
we then want to add that I see what we
did here this is computer stirring this
needs to be computers move oh we got
these excuse me we got this part wrong
Computers turn needs to be computers
move remember we're actually passing in
the ID everything should be good to go
now so you see the player is going the
computer is going player is going why
didn't the player just win right there
all right boys twenty minutes later we
found our air
what is this this says win condition
right here for the players turn this
says coalition
there's our syntax there hey Nick it
ain't a coding tutorials 360 GOG without
a syntax that you know say so let's go
ahead and see if we can get that and
there we go play Rose wins we're done
thank God not my best project in all
honesty guys but I hope it helps you at
the very least get some logic down if
you clean this up make it a little more
complicated you can definitely do this
in a better way and a little more
stylish I look forward to seeing your
guys's videos on this for me I really
enjoyed it the yeah what is it
going on here
this is buggy as all hell
oh I see what happened we need to set
this to false that's why it continues on
you should after one beat go reset and
you reset here there we go
I should reset just fine player goes
there we go so yeah make sure you said
game on equal to false um my bad there I
gotta change that oh yeah guys I hope
you found this helpful
I enjoyed doing it as as not the
cleanest thing every day but the logic
is there work it out work the kinks out
on your own make it a little more
advanced make it much prettier and it
should be a pretty good project for your
portfolio so as always guys thanks for
