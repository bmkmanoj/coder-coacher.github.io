pretty in-demand topic right now as to
why some coding boot camps are closing
if you haven't been following along with
this recently the iron yard closed as
well as dev bootcamp some of these sort
of founders in the industry someone even
told me a coders foundry but I haven't
seen any articles about that so I don't
know if that's true but so we're going
to focus mainly on on the iron yard and
on coder on the other one all right so
what what they I want to say is that
they're not going to tell you why they
close so a lot of what I'm going to say
is what my personal feelings and and and
just sort of a kind of understanding of
the market and first and foremost I I
think a lot of these schools were just
trying to do good things and I think
they did a lot right so apparently iron
ore has been around for years you can
read this right here talks about how
they're basically this is their last
cohort for whatever the campuses are and
I think they had like 14 locations so
they had a lot of locations which I
think might have been one of the reasons
they failed to be honest so you can see
these are all their location was at 3 +
12 15 locations so all in pretty big
cities Atlanta Austin Dallas Nashville
Las Vegas Indianapolis Tampa Bay that's
that's the one I go to all the time and
I go to meetups at the iron so holds
kind of a special place in my heart and
I'm sad to see it go but I think what
you're seeing right now in terms of
these couple boot camps closing is a
combination a few things I think one
some bad business practices and you say
well what are you talking about well I
can only speak to the Tampa Bay location
but a lot of these are big cities and at
least in the Tampa Bay they put it right
in downtown now if anyone knows anything
about rent you're an overhead for the
size of boot camp if for right
is massive if you put it in downtown
versus out of downtown right and so you
have this massive amount of rent you
have to pay and that has to come off the
top right so that would probably my
first criticism of this from a business
model of if you're going to have a boot
camp doesn't need to be in downtown pull
it out to City and throw it in the
middle door one thing I think Deb
Mountain does very well is they have a
very beautiful campus that I saw and it
was in Provo Utah now if they wanted to
take the iron yard miss ivy of it they
would put in downtown Salt Lake City and
have the rent be two three times as much
but other than that I want to say I want
to talk about the sort of industries
been changing a little bit and a couple
of these schools haven't been changing
with it I think I think a lot they went
down the wrong path that I see a lot of
colors programs go down which is they
think people are here to get educated
and in reality what they're here to do
is get skills to get a job and there is
a difference and sometimes and I'm not
saying this is specific about the I
hereby I'm saying in general I think
you're going to see some other boot
camps closing down as well because
they're not willing to change their
curriculum because that's hard man you
got my new teachers
you got to remarket it you got to resell
it in here you're willing to you're
you're you have to it's another leap of
faith right and as I've seen boot camp
still teaching Ruby on Rails and there's
something wrong with learning Ruby on
Rails there is a job market free room
area but as JavaScript's been going up
like this Ruby and rails has been going
down like this and their JavaScript has
passed it an amount of jobs and it being
in demand and that's really your core
market here is going and gaining the
skills to not only be a developer but be
a developer that can get hired quickly a
lot of a lot of people go to boot camps
they are college grads who have a degree
in uselessness most of the time right so
then no disrespect right or just
somebody is trying to get their their
their life together and and they just
want to make they just want to change
your life right they want to make more
money they want to be able help insure
they want to do good things and they
want to get not only educated they want
to get educated something that's going
to get them a job and so you have a lot
of boot camps out there there your
teaching skill set yeah there's a job
market but is it the job market that's
going to get you in the door at the
fastest and make you a good amount of
money and some of these boot camps
aren't willing to adjust their their
curriculum all that much and kind of the
third and final factor for me anyhow and
I I wish this wasn't the case I think it
might be is that you have colleges
getting into the coding boot camp space
now at one time I looked at potentially
when I I'm going back to finish up my CS
degree for instance online but before
when I was deciding that if there are
act I considered perhaps going to a
coding boot camp to fill in some of
these self-taught issues you know just
filling some of the gaps right and get
something on the education aspect on the
resume and I decided against it but I
learned that a lot of colleges in the
area state colleges universities they
are actually creating their own boot
camps usually a little bit longer
usually on the six-month and after about
the same price about eight to twelve
thousand dollars depending on where
you're going and they're teaching
similar things and I think that's
attracting a lot more people that maybe
with two three four years ago they
didn't have an option they said I want
to learn something new and learn
in-demand skills and the college that
they went to wasn't teaching that and so
they had to go that they had to take a
little bit it's a little bit more of a
gamble right you know a lot of a lot of
people think code of coding boot camp
says a little bit risky kind of a
for-profit money grab sort of thing
that's that's kind of the negative
aspect of it but that's what a lot of
people CMS and I'm not saying that's
correct actually thing is it's not true
at all but when you have something like
a institution that is a you know an
accredited institution and a respected
institution a lot of students might
think it has more validity in six months
you have twice as long to learn so
going in three months and and it's not
as intense and and you might you know
for some people that might work better
but I think I think oh those sort of
three factors of maybe being new to the
market and oh and not necessarily
understanding that you have to keep your
costs low and it's just all hypothetical
right that's just what my personal
belief is and I'd love to know what your
guyses are as well I know that I believe
I was at the iron yard or deaf boot camp
got bought out and then someone closed
that the owners closed them down
probably because they were either making
no money or they just didn't want to
continue it on whatever it may be but I
don't think what I'm trying to say is I
don't think this is going to be isolated
case guys I think what you're going to
see is some some of them the worst ones
that are out there that are teaching
outdated stuff or maybe not even
outdated just stuff that hat there's a
market for that like there's a in the
Ruby on girls they're developers out
there and you can't be we're talking
about generality so I don't think I
cannot going to be a Ruby on Rails
developer what but what I am saying is
that bootcamp stuff to understand who
their core audience is and if people who
want jobs that's what it is they want
jobs they want them now you'll do a
three months bootcamp because you want
to job four years later right you do a
three months bootcamp because you want a
job two weeks after you get done with
that bootcamp and you know keep grinding
it out maybe longer than that but you
guys get the idea and then you have all
these colleges coming into the mix it's
a little bit crazy and I think that
might be some of the things I've led to
these campuses closing I think there's
going to be a few more now one one thing
I can't say if you guys are looking for
a boot camp as you know I am sponsored
by dev Mountain but one one thing I want
to say I don't want this to be taken as
me on the iron yard because
that's not really what it is it could
have just been a bad cohort but I did go
to a graduation day of the iron yard to
see I wanted to see because I've seen a
couple project from Deb mountain and
I've seen a couple from other places and
I have to say that and you could include
a link to the two most recent ones these
are two students from
a mountain that reached out to me it's
not like like deaf Mountain sent me the
best of their students these are two
that that one I actually tutored before
he went into the boot camp and I
showcased their projects in the
beginning about two or three of them and
they made impressive projects I made a
copy of code pin they made a copy of
Google sheets and then they made a copy
of the Nike website there were great
websites or functional they were fluent
everything about it was beautiful I
can't say the same about the iron yard
for the graduation class I went to and I
was really stunned because I had always
been a big fan of boot camps and seen
mat engineers troops from his dev
Mountain projects they were really well
done as well all three of them even
though even though the api's all got
closed down now he doesn't have any
project but um but um they were
beautiful they were well done they were
they I would say of about 20 grads I was
impressed by got to and coincidentally
those were two guys who at CS degrees
they were two guys who wanted to get
some more skills and maybe enjoyed the
education aspect and took the program
the other eighteen or so really had very
unimpressive projects and I'll just talk
about visually the ideas so more
creative but just implemented poorly and
as it really is really sad to see and I
I don't know if maybe there's just a bad
location bad cohort it happens right
every every cohort sipper you have a
good ones you have a bad one but if
you're looking for a quality one I
really couldn't recommend that mountain
more they are expanding they just opened
up a new one in Phoenix I've had the
luxury of traveling the Provo Utah to
see the campus in person which isn't in
downtown Salt Lake City or anything like
that so they're keeping their cost low
which is why they can provide free
housing so that you can immerse yourself
in there with a bunch of students but so
if you think about going to a boot camp
my suggestions to you is to do your
research make sure the skills they are
teaching are in demand and
compare it a lot of times just
unfortunate because you're you're not
coming from a software background right
if you were you weren't we going to a
boot camp right you may not know that
Ruby on Rails has jobs have been going
down in JavaScript Redmayne going up and
the boot camp you've been checking out
is a little bit too lazy update their
curriculum or whatever it may be or you
meet them even give you an option and
they know no options if you don't under
if you're going to boot camp just give
them good curriculum but uh I'm sad to
see him go all the same man cuz I think
it's all good stuff I mean they were
putting on meetups all the time and I
was going to one a month and and they're
all everyone who worked there was very
nice and cordial and I can't say
anything bad about them and all of the
the location was beautiful as well so
I'm sorry to hear that that the iron
yard is closing I'm sorry to hear that
for the students that are in there as
well because that's got to be really
sort of you really have to be and it'll
feel a little bit shitty to know that
you just puckered up ten eleven thousand
dollars and knowing that while knowing
that hey in a month this place is going
to be closed down I'm not going to be
able to probably reach out and get any
career support I'm not going to be able
to go back and go mingle with these
these old teachers and ask you know them
to review my resume and things like that
so I feel sorry for them
and I don't know if maybe they offered
some of them a partial discount or
anything like that but oh they are
including career support good for that
look at that good for that good for them
I like that man that was that was what I
was feeling bad for but hopefully
hopefully this is real correction or not
just like send us an email they're going
to have someone in India or that
responded back to an email about it but
I'm sure they're gonna do it itself but
I'm sorry to see them go I think there's
a lot of coding boot camps out there you
just got do your research and find the
one that works for you I know that I I
know that I can confidently recommend
having met the people who run run Devon
behind the scenes and all that sir so I
hear
recommend it but as always guys my
girlfriend is home now so it's time to
wrap this video up because she needs to
see the love of her life I will see you
guys the next video the the giveaway
will giveaway course I'm I don't have my
list in front of me but it'll be so sort
of react or ion of course use the
keyword for everyone for the homies the
iron yard that's the keyword I'll see
you guys next time join the Facebook
group and patreon by hey guys thanks for
watching the video especially thanks to
our sponsors dev Mountain if you look
for a coding boot camp where tuition and
housing is included definitely check
them out appreciate it and I'll see you
guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
