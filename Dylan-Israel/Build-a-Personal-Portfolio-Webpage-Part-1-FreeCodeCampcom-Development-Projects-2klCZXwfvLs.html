the basic algorithm scripting you can
see I kind of jumped a little bit here
so we're going to start working on these
zip lines these zip lines are going to
be at least this first one we're going
to build a personal portfolio web page
you have a lot of stuff going on here it
kind of give you some blanket
instructions but if you're like me you
kind of just skip to the point you get
the point of it we are recreating this
site so the way I'm going to do it
personally as I'm going to break this
video up in about five sections so we're
going to start here we're going to start
here at menu so we're just going to talk
about what it is we're doing in this
video on the menu so we're going to be
using bootstrap so use of become will
become familiar with bootstrap as we do
this and also well so the first one will
be the menu then we'll have this we'll
have you know this first page well the
second video third video will be this
page fourth video will be this page and
maybe we'll just Fitz video this or
we'll turn it to the fourth so about
four or five quick videos so you're
going to be need to go over to code
pentaiah and create a account it's free
it comes up with three paid options and
then small font down at the bottom
there's a free version so don't be
tricked so in this case this is we're
going to be adding our CSS they have a
nice little quick add thing here for
bootstrap so go ahead and add that in
there so we wanted to have a menu so I'm
going to literally be making this as we
we go along so you can see exactly what
I made so you can't style it differently
you just kind of want to have the same
functionality so in my case I knew that
I wanted to have a certain font ahead of
time so I picked that up off of google
fonts
I highly suggest you you do that they're
all free Ellie and I'll show you exactly
I do it so the one I'm doing is kind of
a popular one called lobster you'll
either love it or hate it most of the
time so all you have to do for this
because I'm going to be using this whole
page it's insert the the link that they
asked here so this will now display my
font in lobster if I if I give it a
class saying that so also because we're
working in bootstrap we need to declare
a div here div class equal to I believe
it's fluid container no container -
fluid container - fluid this is just
going to make it so that our grid system
works one we're going to use it and
don't forget to close this as well and I
forget the body so let's go inside or
outside of this so I'm going to say that
it goes on the inside so ah let's not
worry about the body right now so how do
we create that cool tab it's like that
cool menu system so they actually
bootstrap has a cool little menu
built-in called pills
so essentially pills are the those type
of line tabs that we are looking at and
when you hover over them they kind of
create a button sort of look to it so
the way that you would declare that is
you would say look we're going to start
use the class nav and we're going to use
specifically the class nav pills as well
so it's just a styled unordered list
that's built in to bootstrap and so just
like anything else we're going to add a
little an li and close an ally and then
here we're going to put the nhf because
we're going to be linking them so AF and
we can just set this equal to a pound
sign for now and and then we want to
close our a and let's say that the first
name was for that example was was on
there so we'll have Dillon
see is real cool and now when you see
you can see right here when we hover
over you don't see it because it's by
default it's probably white so okay
let's style that now so uh actually why
don't we why don't we make all our list
objects first so just go ahead and copy
and paste your code here's if you if
you're not understanding it type it out
or you're going to think you might have
trouble messing up with the list objects
but I think everyone at this time should
we kind of understand what's going on so
we're going to have Dylan see Israel and
we're going to have Dennis Lee is there
I'm Dylan C is Abdullah see Israel so
what are we going to have for me
personally I'm going to have an about Me
section who doesn't like talking about
themselves
uh slight easier to talk about yourself
than write about yourself it's writing
it's like oh man it's paying the ass are
you I want a portfolio for you know
potential potential clients or employers
I want a contact me I want oh I also
want to reference my YouTube so you know
put it all on one site so we'll have
this cutting tutorial oops toriel's 360
and then we'll have
our last one was a contact mate that's
what was okay so cool so we have all our
stuff here we didn't get it style yet so
we put in that's probably a good place
to start so we can say right here let's
define a class and we'll say it's equal
to actually let's just work with none
nav - pills because that's already in
there and then I recognise it so we want
to have to add it we're just going to
slightly change it and we're going to
say color actually we're going to say
font - family and if this doesn't work
well I think I might have to apply to
the anchor tag but we'll say font -
family and we'll say Lobster and there
it is so there's our lobster so that
worked just fine it you can see a change
or font this is going to be kind of big
so we want our maybe the font - size and
if I remember correctly we can do it
like this 2.0 m there we go so we just
want it to point two times to size so
you don't really want to hard-code stuff
anymore nowadays I mean you can we could
do like 30 PX we also could do something
with a grid and all that sort of stuff
and we probably should but I remember
correctly I think pills might have it
built in I'm not sure though so anyhow
let's not worry about the grid system
quite yet we're just getting started
with the menu here so we're just going
to say that looks a little too big let's
try 1.7 cool hi that looks a little bit
better and then we want to have a
background - color we want to set up -
black so these are the color schemes I'm
going with and we can just kind of set
the
what is is this the body let me see here
I just so it's not converting the whole
line there so we're just gonna say body
back on background I should color black
I just wanna see if that comes up ok
cool says it's the background so we'll
do it like that and that will that will
work but we'll have to figure out
something later on for our for our
images because we don't want the black
along the side but this for now we'll do
it
so but now we want to float these four
right because this was on the side and
this one wasn't so how can we do that
so same thing it's there's actually a
pull right class in a Nam in bootstrap
so we're going to give each one of these
classes except this first one I'm
starting to edit so I'm going to set
class is equal to and then it's just
pull that's right and exceeds right
there I think if I remember correctly
you're going to I'm going to have to
rearrange this so that it does in the
order I want so class equals pull -
right and then we'll set class equals
here
pull - right
we'll set class Eagles here - class
equals - right and since we're working
them on this apparently it pulls them
right in order so this one's first it
pulls that one to the right so let's see
if we can fix that because I didn't want
that it doesn't matter for now I can we
can always go back and change that so
the body here is is has a little bit of
padding and it's we're sending this part
to black but uh we actually just want
this background to be white and we want
to set this up to succeed here so how
are we going to get this to the edge so
I think this container fluid let's see
if this is changing it yeah it was a
container fluid so we'll come back to
that and fix that eventually well right
now uh so we have our menu so let's go
ahead and save this and settings we'll
just put you to zip 1 save that and that
was pretty quick so let me take a brief
moment here and then we'll continue on
and just do the first page thanks for
watching the video don't forget to Like
