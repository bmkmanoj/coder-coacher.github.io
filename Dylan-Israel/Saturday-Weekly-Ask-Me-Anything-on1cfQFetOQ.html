we are live where's my chat though we
should have a chat over here
my strange well the very least forgot
you YouTube
alright gentlemen and ladies I am
killing some time why I am copying over
some files for something that I'm
working on and it's gonna take an hour
so I figured this was a good time to do
our weekly live stream how is everybody
doing so if you're new to the channel
every Saturday I do a hour plus
livestream answering your questions
basically just trying to help you out
give a little bit of mentorian a little
bit of advice I do offer mentoring for
$90 an hour
usually one hour increments what a lot
of times people you know like I have one
somebody asked me hey can you help me
prepare for a job interview okay you
know if you want a one-on-one thing so
not everyone has money like that right
like most people don't so I try to do it
do these on a group level every every
Saturday and here we are I also do one
of these every new thousand subscribers
so you'll get a little bit of a double
dose of uh of me you get an update on
how quick the hair is growing back um
well yeah
so today seemed an appropriate time in
the day to do this so what have I been
up to since last you seen me I haven't
been doing as many live streams I have
been studying angular for I feel pretty
good about it I might do some projects
and it pretty soon
I might tell you in my first course in
angular for just some projects of
testing all the basic stuff you need to
know when getting started I've also been
working on how to build a coding Channel
course actually have some videos filmed
where in the entry I have the syllabus
pretty much done I want to say it's 85%
there and there's about 15% I need to
ask and for the future of the chat if
you have a question or a problem just
say it
you don't need to say I need to ask you
something just say it and you'll get an
answer my friend so that's what I've
been working on obviously I have a
full-time job also so lose that picking
up a little bit of contracting work it's
not going too well so far because I'm
having having some issues with the
environment and getting the the backend
to routes to properly connect so that's
that's kind of what I'm what I've been
working on and the reason I'm doing the
contracting work is not because my work
doesn't pay me very well they pay me
excellently
it's just that I'm actually trying to
buy a investment property a home I'm
trying to buy my first home which is
kind of I'll live in the back house and
ran out the front house or vice versa so
we've been looking at homes with
duplexes our home duplexes or single
homes with backhouses depending on
zoning and stuff there is a difference
but that's kind of what we're looking
for how much money do I make on YouTube
right now
monthly it depends if we count if we
count the mentor ships if we count the
affiliate links if we count the the ad
revenue all that together I usually am
up a little bit over a thousand dollars
a month on average what JavaScript's do
books do I recommend none I think you
should just do video courses and you'll
be much more successful you stuck
between learning CodeIgniter for work
and react yes do you think bouncing
between both is a good idea should I
drop my person onto
until I get a CI or CL what CL I don't
know what CL is but I do think that once
you are where you need to be in terms of
your job for instance I've been studying
angular for because that's what my work
I do at work and and so um when I feel
comfortable with that and I'm almost
there I would say I will probably start
studying other things that are on my
work related but so once let's say you
can check off imagine you have us you
need this for this job you already have
the job but you need this for the job
and you need to be out of production
level I would say stop studying those to
move on to other things once you are not
that you can't not that you can't OH
CCI code at night until you could
igniter uh I would say I like balancing
multiple stacks if you talk if you look
up the video I said what I learned in my
first year as a developer you'll see
that I learned stuff at work I learn
yourself outside of work now I focused
on work at first because I needed to be
able to do my job in that I went in
different direction I want to ask if I
have to finish free code camp what
should I do next to get job ready you
should build personal projects about
side projects things like that new to
development we build in angularjs and
dotnet on the back I'm focused on the
front-end currently but my job wants to
be learned c-sharp what does your PhD
sharpen a there's more C sharp and
dotnet jobs than there is no jobs and
PHP jobs and I think it's an excellent
thing to learn it's something I'll be
picking up and you can make a lot of
good money with C sharp and net so
that's that's my stance on it side
projects video was good thanks hey
you're welcome and I tried to come up
with this me I wanted 50 but I got to 29
and I was trying not to give specific
examples of more general ideas on how
you could how you could could go about
is April going to finish 108th coding
chunks she's not she did 30 days
and then I cancelled it because I
couldn't take it anymore it's affecting
me not that I don't love spending time
with you baby but uh I mean you guys
hear me I'm studying I have my channel I
have my job and then I also am building
courses and eventually I'll continue on
with the book I started so um it's one
of those things where I ended it for
because it was taken so much out of me
and then she started to learn project
management and she stuck the thing is
this guys I don't care if April learns
to code
I just want April to continue growing
and increase her income and continue
learning it doesn't really matter what
she learns as long as she's keeps on
growing as an individual in the skill
set so are you gonna code some
blockchain stuff I've been thinking
about it don't don't think I haven't it
is something that is on the agenda
there's a lot on the agenda but it's not
something out of the realm of
possibility I guess I should say now I
have to become more familiar about what
that entails and go from there about to
transition from angularjs to angular 4
what is your advice in the transition
most important thing to focus on ok so
this is a really good question and it's
such a good question that I'm going to
answer it right now and then I'm gonna
film the video about it so thank you for
that um so I'm just writing my notes
down so that's so my current role that I
got interviewed for I had a phone
interview technically interview I had
you know and then I had a take home
project and I did my take home project
in angularjs now I was under the
impression that I would be working in
angularjs and down the road
we would transition to angular 4 or
whatever iteration there on of angular
that was not the case now which is great
because I always wanted I want to
transition that way anyhow so as
somebody who's gone through that and
I've been at my current role for a month
which is kind of crazy because it feels
like yesterday so what I what I did was
I used a course and I followed the
course and I worked out every single day
but but it's one of those things where
you you need to put in a daily grind
understand that it some things will
carry over very the hardest part
okay let's start fresh so the hardest
part in the transition is just
understanding what everything does and
how it works and what I mean by that is
that there's now a lot of terminology
like imports providers services
controllers that if you're not if you
use angular ui-router some of those
concepts carried over the module files
the these components if you are working
in the latest version of angularjs or
the most recent versions I should say so
my thing for you is get a course just
get introduced to these concepts and
then build something because I had a
great project at work that really taught
me what I needed to build out and it got
me very familiar with this so much so
that we could serve a project right now
and get going and I feel pretty
comfortable with it now and a lot of its
just repetition but there is a lot of
terminology that's gonna throw you for a
loop
as well as how things connect that's
really what it is and if you're a little
familiar with ui-router it's not as back
as I take some of the ideas that were
there and then they they apply them to
angular for what language pays the most
probably Scala or Java spring some Java
frameworks are some of the highest but I
would worry less about that
if you ever code in Java and Scala
you'll know why they paid the most hey
nobody wants to
this um God how long is this file
taking all right we are at so I'm just
checking to update on something okay
cool this will be done in 15 minutes
nice are you my parents aren't
supporting me with my major for computer
science I'm trying to get into web
development and into college right now
by sucks make sure I don't study
something your parents disagree with
well um I can definitely understand
parents not agreeing with their children
why they don't understand you asked a
degree studying computer science is
beyond me it's one of those situations
where it is probably objectively the
best degree you could get in terms of
college if that's what you're looking to
do and and the thing about it is is if
you look at if we were just looking at
the US Labor Bureau statistics the job
growth the salary and the amount of jobs
which are really the three things you
should look for when you're looking to
get a degree as well as you know break
into an industry all those are in the
top one or two percent of all degrees
that are that are coming that exist and
you can't do better than you just can't
so Owens salary as well so I don't know
why they disagree with that I'd have to
have more details but that's kind of the
the main thing is your parents are just
wrong
and so it's hard it's hard to as it as
the Chuck cuz two-year parents you will
always be a Chava I'll be 30 and 11 days
and I will always be a child to my
parents right not that I'm not
responsible but I always be their child
and they they will always think they
know what's best for me and as as their
son and as their child it's it's one of
those moments where sometimes you have
to as an adult say you know what I love
you all very much
but I actually know what's best for me
and what you're telling me is just wrong
and I even I let's concede that it's all
coming from a place of love and I like
to understand that and they're just
worried about your well-being there's a
lot of things that happen in life that
as your parents they don't want you to
take any sort of risks anything new and
concepts they don't fully understand
right like no matter how hard I try to
explain to my mother that I don't make
websites if she's talking to her friends
and they asked what her son does she
says he makes websites because it's a
lot more complicated than that but it's
not factually incorrect but what I'm
trying to say is that there there comes
a stage in life where as Anna as a as a
young adult and I don't consider myself
a young adult I think I'm just an adult
now but I'm saying like maybe 25 and
younger you might be considered a young
adult but as a young adult you have to
sort of make that decision
where you're gonna say you know you know
you're wrong I'm right and there may be
consequences right if you're living at
home and they're paying for your CS
degree you may all of a sudden have
student loans now and things like that
so they do have some power over you but
what I what I am saying is that there's
an adult decision that can be made I
said look I need to look out for myself
because the advice that you're giving me
even though it's coming from a place of
support is actually gonna put me off in
a worse place than before a lot of video
/ courses are focused on creating from
scratch but I am finding my job isn't
necessarily a lot of that job is
changing current code finding about
address or resource for these uh not
specifically for finding books I mean
you could watch like how to use more
development tools and things like that
and learn more about the chrome
debugging environment that's set up
there and and how to become a very
debugger by using those tools in terms
of updating current code I think you're
probably going to need to look into
refactoring specifically and seeing
seeing how to refactor and some
suggestions about that because it sounds
like what you're doing are minor minor
code base changes and and refactoring of
existing code how do I get a Deb job
I've done a video about that
it's called top five things to get a job
in web development it's probably in my
last 20 videos you should be able to
find it and I look really crazy I got
like this so look for that when you see
this that's the video shout outs from
the Philippines shout outs to our boy
Byron Alfonso from the Philippines right
now what do you make if not websites I
make web applications okay it's just
it's not so this is a thing it's not
that it's factually incorrect right but
like I think to most people like my mom
thinking I'm making like these
mom-and-pop sort of you know gas station
websites just sort of thing when in
reality you're building very complex web
applications that that that can do a lot
more than just display static data you
know you're building a dynamic front-end
back in crud functionality api's so it's
not that it's incorrect it's just it's
sort of like it's it's sort of like if
you were the vice president
of a school and and you know which is
pretty you know our vice principal of a
school and they basically just said that
you were a assistant teacher if that
meant is that makes sense like it's not
that it's incorrect even if you are
assisting as a teacher but you're doing
a lot more than that entails I and maybe
that's not a perfect example but that
that's just kind of how I see it
well flavor monster this is just the uh
none shame to be drinking these but I
have a lot of work to do today and
tomorrow this is the unsweetened one
please tell me something about DevOps
how can I start that from scratch you
should get your own server start a
hosting company with your friends and
learn how to deploy code get familiar
with Jenkins and just learn all the
DevOps tools really just gonna need to
have to get familiar with the plain
items and databases have you been in
position where you couldn't solve
problem absolutely what do you recommend
if you hit the wall keep on chipping
away at it and then take a break when
you're out about to cry and when you're
about to cry maybe come back to it go to
another problem if you can't go to
another problem ask for help talk to a
senior developer talk to talk to a
friend do research on Stack Overflow do
research on YouTube it depends on the
issue right but try and train and go
from there if you had to choose one
which one would you pick Cristiano
Ronaldo or leo messi so I don't watch
soccer I recognize the names but I
really couldn't care less about either
one of them they both they both if I'm
Cesar they both get in the get some get
some League of Legends players in here
to fight to the death sort of thing and
your career
company do you get given wireframes and
mock-ups first from the design team at
the beginning of a new project or you
start coding straight into the browser
so if you're coding into the browser
you're a gangster but just little me I
used to text out here like a like a
scrub but uh I can't I don't really feel
comfortable talking about my work
processes for the most part because it's
not it's not something that most company
places once you talk about how they run
their business I will say that that it
varies by organization and depending on
what the actual task is so if you're
building a if you're building something
from scratch that's actually its own
application even it's part of a
application it's like its own sub
application most of the time you're
going to need wireframes to save time
and you may you may build those out
yourself you may have somebody else an
architect even a design team build them
out a project manager business analyst
it depends on the organization now at
other times you may just beginning a
minor feature request that would say
something like hey it might have a user
stories like as a user I want to give a
description about this movie field and
so like based off something small like
that you can kind of summarize that all
you're really going to need is the text
area and you probably already have some
sort of form set up that you're gonna
input in there so it kind of depends on
what the case is but there's is there's
no real need for a you there's no real
need for someone to go and make a mock
up to that at the end of day you could
probably print that page out and be like
hey I'm gonna put it here is that cool
or you put it there and they say I don't
like it there
copy paste it right here all right cool
we're good so it depends on what the
situation is but on larger applet larger
features larger applications you're
definitely going to need wire friends
but on updates future requests depending
on that it's uh you know it just kind of
depends
I've been wanting to learn how to code
in program but don't don't know where to
start learning at what language to start
learning I'm interested be a software
engineer well a dark it kind of depends
on what you want to do man do you want
to do web development do you want to do
mobile development do you want to do
databases do you want to do desktop
applications now I always recommend
JavaScript the reason for that is due to
frameworks you can do all those and you
can kind of run your own website at the
process so JavaScript your wits with
frameworks you can do all that sort of
stuff but guide depends what you want to
do man should I buy my own hosting
server use github pages or Heroku for my
portfolio I want to practice deploying
as well as using Jenkins - Travis what
would you recommend I'd recommend taking
about - 300 bucks buying your own little
server and having at your house so that
you can work on it learn the hardware
it's just as important as working with
the software for that and learn how to
deploy on there it'd be an interesting
project for you and it'd be a good
portfolio item and if you get a couple
friends on there who are hosting
websites for 10 20 dollars a month or
whatever it is whatever makes sense for
you you could save a few bucks or make a
few bucks and you you know you never
know what it may lead to but that would
be my advice what resources would you
recommend for people trying to learn
nodejs and react I would recommend a
couple of the following I would start by
doing a one to two hour tutorial on
YouTube I would then buy a course on
udemy and then I would build my own
project after I completed the course I
would work on that course every single
day for about an hour a day on the low
end what research should I use to learn
programming them and thanks for the
advice it all depends Man udemy YouTube
coke atom e free code camp it kind of
depends on what you're looking to do and
what it is that you're trying to
accomplish right so if you're looking to
learn about databases free code camp
isn't all that great if you're learning
and look about JavaScript
and react and all these other JavaScript
frameworks that it its supports you know
it is much more recommended for that a
lot of times people are weren't so
worried about what to use to learn that
they never get started on learning this
may surprise some of you but the course
that I'm taking angular for is the first
course I'll ever complete outside of
college and I've never taken to udemy
course I've never done any of that I
simply have been self teaching myself
through YouTube and my own personal
projects and websites like free code
camp for the last two and a half years
but I having taken a a course in and
working through it and I'm like 95%
there I have 5% left I would I would
recommend it I think I I think I missed
out on some things by not doing it
sooner what's going on David if you're
interested in web development design
there's I mean web development is
probably the area that has the most the
most amount of
tutorials just by the nature of the web
but there's a ton on udemy a free code
camps a great place to get started so
YouTube is the same thing with YouTube
but the kind of web developers naturally
use computers on the energy use internet
products such as YouTube more often I
would say then probably you know highest
developer for that matter so maybe
something considered there after a full
day's work how do you set aside time for
learning I have a family I'm having
trouble finding time well I couldn't
really tell you about having a family
man I've put off having a family
for quite some time partially because I
knew financially and mentally and
emotionally I'm not ready so I don't I
don't know I can't really tell you a lot
of times people make that decision
before they're ready so I don't know if
this was your case or not but I'm a big
believer that if you don't have your
career together and this isn't to pick
on you this is just sort of my harsh
stance because I I this you're a good
example right now if why I believe this
is that I have just recently started
getting last couple years getting my
life together really and the idea that
if I had children when I didn't have my
life together or I had responsibilities
that could not be ignored and children
are one of them that I would then be
unable to spend the time studying and
learning and bettering my life and
saving the money to buy my first house
and and all that sort of stuff that that
is one of the reasons I didn't start a
family and that I am not suited to have
a family because I'm not there yet
because I understand the time commitment
that it that it would take and the
energy commitment so to answer question
I have no idea how you how you
essentially go from having a family and
managing that because they're there
what's important to them is also
important to you so it's easy for me
right I don't have any kids
I have no bills outside of my rent like
I have no monthly bills and so I don't
have to spend any money on anything but
myself in April and rent and why were
able to save money I in terms of a time
commitment I don't have anything besides
rent so I don't have any debt and in
terms of like a time debt I don't have
anything because I don't have children
so it's it's uh I'm able to focus on
YouTube I'm able to take a course I'm
able to study I'm able to build a course
all that sort of stuff now if I had one
kid probably two hours
gone two kids three hours a day gone
three kids maybe five hours because like
I don't really know but so I can't
really tell you that because I've never
been in that situation and I understand
even having not been in that situation
that they are a priority and so I don't
want to say I don't have sympathy
because everyone everyone's trying to
take their own path but you have to
understand that when you had children
and a family that that you gave up a
certain part of your life and this is
even and I say this April gets angry at
me because I spent so much time working
and doing YouTube and all this that I
don't spend enough time with her this is
a common thing in the house common thing
we debate about and it's it's not
something that's going away so I can
only imagine with children I I just wish
you the best of luck man up but you're
gonna have to figure something out but I
can't tell you the secret because I
don't know what it is yeah
the only udemy course that I'm currently
taking is ain't the angular for front to
back by traversing media I'll do a video
reviewing it
where should I learn to code for free
free code camp when should I start
supplies jobs as a developer when you
have a portfolio you have a portfolio
site you have a LinkedIn you have a
ghetto that's looking good and when you
open a text editor you know how to get
started on a project and don't freeze up
and vomit into a trash can bro how would
you convince a business over to switch
over its physical server to Amazon
server less service I would probably go
about the uptime and showcase Amazon's
up times first
so the uptime benefit analysis as well
as the cost benefit analysis to showcase
that that's what would be what I would
be doing how
much you set it aside for learning each
day I don't necessarily set a set amount
of time and it depends what you call
learning I cook I'm more I'm more
focused on being productive than
actually learning right so I would say
that I between between YouTube between
working on courses between studying I
probably spend on a weekday about three
hours a day working on stuff every
morning I wake up I spent about an hour
plus and then when I get home I spend
about two hours and then the weekends I
I don't spend more than about six hours
a day working on things so it just kind
of depends but that's not all learning
that's that's working on things that
make me productive for the future that
could be side projects it could be
learning something new it could be
working on YouTube it could be working
on the course working on the book
working on the podcast it just depends
but so that's kind of where all that
falls into now it's all gonna help my
career but yeah javascript semicolon to
not semicolon to semicolon I think I
think there's a big part of being able
to say to the end of a statement I
understand that a lot of times we have
this very varied that's what I'm looking
for varied we like our dynamic nice in
JavaScript but recently we have had
things like typescript that have come in
and and given a little bit of order and
so that's why I think things being a
little bit stricter in JavaScript would
be better than not where can I learn no
Jason and YouTube on YouTube I know that
traversÃ©e media has a couple nodejs
courses I watched one is pretty good I
got my first job and it has been awesome
so far one month in devs are telling me
that job hopping is the important
aspects have you found this to be true
it can be depending on how much your
Salik starting salary is I would say
that by and large it is something that
you should do most workplaces aren't
very good in the world so you got a kind
of job hot
you'll get statistically speaking you're
more likely and make more money if your
job pop that so that's a fact my goal is
not to job hop right now but I
understand why people do how do I get
freelance work you can start applying
for gigs on up work so you can start
applying for jobs that are looking for a
temporary contract employees how many
portfolio projects before applying to
your first junior developer job can
depends man I think one is enough if
it's a good portfolio project it's a
unique project so the amount of projects
that always matter it's the project
themselves how much time did it take you
to learn all this technologies I've
learned this last two summers I'm laying
the basics in front end I want to jump
to back and I don't know man I'm always
learning
what about webdev work in the automation
field I have no idea who won the fifth
freenode Express MongoDB dev to
deployment course I don't remember I'd
have to go look it up what are some
things I can do to add to my portfolio I
don't know I'd have to see your
portfolio oftentimes there's quite a bit
a lot of people have a really really bad
portfolios and bad websites and bad
resumes bad linkedin's
all these sorts of things these are like
the number one things that when I mentor
people we start off there because those
are the things that they can by the end
of our our mentoring they can go have a
list of here's you know 50 pieces of
advice on how you can improve what you
have and then instantly when you should
apply a week later you're at a 75%
better chance of getting a call back
have there been any damaged areas to
Sarah Kane not that I've really seen
you've seen a couple like mobile homes
who've had like half their roof rip not
ripped off but not too bad not not
really anything do you focus on sites
such as Co worse I've used code fights
in the past when I when I was going to
be applying for roles and accepting
roles and I use that as a way to prep
for algorithms I'll sit down now guys
you know tired
what core concepts you need to master
PHP I think you just need about 20 years
of working with PHP PHP is a very
strange language because they make a
function for everything you will always
be learning PHP so there's PHP
developers who have been working in that
for 20 years and they come across
functions they had no idea even existed
so it's just friends I'm working with my
school website and WordPress shaoling no
js' or just continue with WordPress and
later on switches back in language you
should definitely never do WordPress if
you do WordPress you're gonna get
pigeonholed as a wordpress developer
make less money long term well Josh I
would say for you start a project man I
just did a video talking about 29 side
project ideas go watch that kits
inspiration build something based off
that that you're passionate about and
continue it on
whoo you got two cats in my feet and
their bite in on my toes
you tried code five saying am i asking
yes it's a it's one the harder ones I
think I've done ninety or no no over
nine a think I have 95 algorithms on
code fights I was thinking about but so
I put up about 45 videos and they got
like 150 or 200 views apiece nobody want
anything to do with it but it is what it
is
a few frustrations I've experienced as a
developer in a corporate situation
I can answer that one just because you
don't know what company I'm talking
about I will say this as any individual
working for a medium small medium
company is that depending on the size of
the company sometimes people don't
respect the sort of hierarchy of things
and doesn't really bother me until I get
put into an uncomfortable situation
where sometimes you'll have the CEO or
your boss's boss's boss come directly to
you and and they'll they'll come and
they'll say hey can you do this for me
and then I'll and you say yes because
they're the CEO and then you go
and you are taken off the task at hand
and then your boss goes and they usually
understand but it's uncomfortable
situation to be in where you're like
okay well you kind of skipped over like
four people I I guess what I'm trying to
say is that that would be one
uncomfortable situation that I've been
in in the past I didn't really
appreciate I'm I'm really a pretty
mellow dude and anything goes with me
but I could tell you that that is one of
the things where a super hands-on owner
or super hands-on boss like a boss of
boss of a boss haha
might get on someone who's a little less
mellow then
me about these things one other thing
that I can say is that oftentimes when
you have those hands on owners and those
stakeholders all the so they may want
something and you'll have put your heart
and soul into it for two weeks and then
instantly I call it the shiny object
effect where they have this
oh well drop everything for the shiny
object over here that we just saw and so
like I really don't like the shiny
object effect again I don't really care
as a as a developer it's my job to build
them something that they can use for the
business but it's not a good feeling
when you're just sort of gained drag
from this to this this without ever
actually getting to finish the project
that you wanted to finish or they had to
finish what is your opinion CMS like
Joomla or WordPress stay away they're
great if you just want to easy website
to maintain but as a developer you
shouldn't go anywhere near them did you
get your glasses after you started your
career is unreal or is it unrelated to
the long staring series my vision
actually isn't that bad it's only my my
left eye my right eye has perfect vision
but I've had the glasses for about five
years I've been staring at computer
screens and just TVs all my life just
there gaming and everything I think it's
just but they've been wearing down so is
there something easier than code fights
that you could recommend free code camp
algorithms what steps I take to learn
new technology I'll usually watch a
YouTube tutorial if I feel like I can
build a project after watching that said
tutorial I will and now learn the
documentation I saw like hey I wonder if
I wonder if I can do this with note I
wonder if I can do this with JavaScript
or angular or whatever it is and if I if
I can't if I don't feel like you know I
don't really get it I might rewatch it
one time and if I still don't get I'll
go get a course and go through there but
usually it's watch something build a
project am I currently learning
blockchain no but it's
the back burner of ideas I want to by
the end of 2019 have have started
building something in blockchain so it's
not this years ago because we're almost
done with the year but by the end by the
end of next year it's one of my new
year's resolutions in your opinion what
separates it Jude junior to senior dev
well it kind of pens traditionally
speaking it's job title and years of
experience I am if we wanted to be
generous could say that I have two years
of experience realistically it's one
plus so I would say five years plus
makes you senior developer in terms of
what their roles that differs oftentimes
you're there to help the junior
developers to answer questions to mentor
to make them better developers I don't
consider myself a senior developer I
just consider myself a developer I'll
say Jason here's got a question
did I try out the slide no not yet um
that's funny you remember that Jordan
I'm a 36 year old trucker I work 50
hours a week I make about twelve hundred
a week before taxes that's not about it
but you're working 50 hours a week so
you make 40 a month after taxes you
probably clear about 3600 I taught
taught myself HTML CSS JavaScript
angular react node NPM get c-sharp I
work right now I'll work I I think it
says I'm I work on an app by myself how
do I get jr. MIT offer supply vigorously
all the time with the excellent resume
an excellent LinkedIn and the excellent
github and excellent side projects to
show your passion
Elesha
yes it is start applying yeah and I mean
so so here's the thing guys it's like
worst case scenario when you apply for
jobs and you don't get one is you still
don't have a job you started out without
a job and you still don't have a job so
let's take let's just I mean let's just
think about it for a second right so a
lot of us are very worried like hey am i
ready to apply honestly just everyday
fill out 20 apps every day spend an hour
fill out 20 apps on zip recruiter and
linkedin and go at it and then study on
top of that and go from that it's it's
one of those things that even if you
start just getting calls they don't go
anywhere at least you can understand
they say and ask the class the right
question say all right sir
you know I sound like we're not going to
be moving forward what would what what
would it be that I could have that would
make you interested in can it just so
that I can know what to learn so just so
that I know how I can improve on my
phone conversation skills how I can
improve my resume what were the things
that you're looking for that I don't
have you can have those conversations
with the recruiters with the hiring
managers with people who may be your
future boss and they say you know what
we see that you've been studying a
c-sharp but you don't really have
anything to show for it and you don't
have any dotnet if you had something in
there okay well now you know what you
got to work on the next month it's it's
one it's one of those things where
sometimes you just have to sometimes you
just have to go and and go
and go and get it set up and and and try
and move forward where you'll learn from
each experience you'll learn that hey
you know ok I I you know maybe I'm not
ready now but let's continue on just
because you weren't ready for that job
wasn't that you weren't ready for any
job you know there's been plenty of
roles that even as a working developer
people didn't want hire me because I was
too junior for what they wanted right
they wanted a super senior dev on a
super super junior salary and that's
okay they're not going to get it but
that it's not something that I would
want anyhow boy I guess what I'm trying
to say is that it's never too early to
start applying for jobs as long as
you're continuing to grow eventually
you'll grow into the role and that just
means that you have to every week every
two weeks update your resume update your
LinkedIn to be current with where your
skillset is in that moment I'm working
as a programmer internship any tips yes
work hard work very hard ask how you can
improve ask what you're doing wrong I
think that's a crucial thing so that you
can show that you're eager as well as
you can become the candidate that they
want they want to you to become so they
will give you a job make a video I'm
making Chrome extensions actually I'm
going to so enjoy that
so by the way guys if you haven't
already please to join our Facebook
group codec and caffeine and if you want
to support me on patreon as well that's
that's greatly appreciated I don't need
your money if you're struggling or
anything like that but April and I are
trying to buy our first home together
and that helps us so that we can save
more money and that pays for things like
the webcams the monitors the monthly
Adobe subscription cost those
 are so expensive and and
other things so how's the wireframes
video been made no David it has no it's
on the list I'm sorry man I've I've been
so sort of it's been so crazy with with
everything and I wanted to get
up-to-date at my my work but it will be
man just keep bugging me I eventually
I'll do it as well as github I
eventually want to do like a colt steel
web development boot camp my own version
breaking everything down and going from
there we'll see them and it's is that's
a lot of work how's my job going
excellent man I I'm super happy with it
did I quit my job no no I I have a a new
job I'm just saying if you want to
support me financially you can on
patreon I just don't want people to
think that I'm starving or hungry or
anything because that's that's not the
case we're actually saving money to buy
a house and and some of those things
where every little bit helps
so Jacob Leatherwood you're welcome to
share your LinkedIn in the Facebook
group we have around 4,000 members if
you want to connect with people how many
domains you know and I feel like a to
buy domain for every single project I
have I mean if your projects are
actually real projects that makes sense
if they're just sort of portfolio
projects or fun little things I don't
think you need to do that I own about
five domains but only about two of them
are hosted or one of them actually so
stood at this time
I've been more in the business world our
cover letters used in the IT world I
know portfolios are super important
I mean cover cover letters are are
important it's better to have one than
not to have one but it is not going to
make or break you most of the time so
I'd encourage you to have a general
cover letter that maybe you swap out a
few key words a few names few addresses
all that sort of thing for the places
that you're interested in but they
aren't they aren't always the most
important but it's better to have one
than not it does nothing but help you I
guess is what I'm trying to say
portfolios are important personal
websites are important to get hubs are
important linkedin's are important would
you recommend the cold steel of course
to a beginner and can make portfolio off
that knowledge I'm sure it covers so
much that you should for sure could all
right guys I have to get back to work my
file got done transferring about 30
minutes ago I have to actually do some
contract work to help buy this house I'm
trying to say and what what have you
been doing lately roadside projects that
we don't know if I'll I'll answer this
and I'll leave you with my final
thoughts I am building a course on
Chrome extensions just five little
projects that you can build to kind of
teach you a little bit of the ins and
the outs of Chrome extensions so I
already have one one course video filmed
it's just a fun little project where
anytime you have a JavaScript air it
injects a little jiff into your debugger
console so that's probably something
that uh that you don't know about that's
kind of cool I guess so
so if you're new the last years I like
to leave you on a little bit of a final
thought a little bit more of a serious
note something to reflect upon and with
this talk about cover letters with this
talk about with this talk about you know
playing two jobs too early I just want
to take a moment to remind people that
oftentimes we already know the answer to
these questions like should you have a
cover letter yes
but are they super important you may not
know that but should you have one yes of
course it does nothing but help you
write you know there's no reason that it
would hurt you should you apply for jobs
before you're ready yes well what
happens if you're not nothing
you just get you still don't have a job
and a lot of times people get so worked
up on what to study where to go what
direction they need to be headed in that
they never actually head in that
direction that's that's my main concern
a lot of times is you know when when
people are like is this a good course
it's like the course is eleven dollars
just buy it you see it has 50,000
reviews giving a 4.9 out of five and
instead you're worried about that point
one people of the 50,000 who dated that
course because they hate everything
right and so my advice to you is to take
a moment to think about why you are
asking these these questions at times
and instead of spending that time and
energy you have sort of this energy
trapped in your brain worrying about
things and is worrying about is a cover
letter important worrying about you know
is it too early to apply for jobs as if
that really has an impact right worrying
about is this course that's already
highly rated a good course
and what I would say is stop worrying
just do it find out and even if it's not
the best course in the world and even if
your cover letter didn't help you that
much and even if you're only getting
calls back and no jobs even if the on
the low end like things went as bad as
you thought they were gonna go you're
still gonna have grown as a developer
and now you'll have those answers so you
won't be worrying about things that
don't really matter so my might my thing
do you guys is don't worry about these
things
find out go get your a lot of it's just
common sense and you just got to believe
that you're not wasting time and a lot
of people times people are wasting so
much time worrying about wasting time
that if they just went took the course
or they just went built the cover letter
they just went started filling out job
apps they'd learn these things and not
have to ask people questions about them
so I just want I just want everyone to
have a little bit more understanding of
what they're capable of and actually go
out there and experience what they're
trying to accomplish instead of just
trying to get someone to tell you that
there's no risk and it's gonna be okay
so and I mean that goes for the little
things as well as the big things a lot
of times it's just your mental energy is
trapped worrying stop worrying and just
do it so you know guys I appreciate
y'all for those of you who are looking
for jobs writing cover letters all that
sort of stuff you you get there men so
that's why thank you so much for
watching this is our Saturday weekly
live stream and we do these every
