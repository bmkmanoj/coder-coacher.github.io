and free code camp doing bonfire sorted
Union a quick shout-out to our sponsor
Mentors free eat mentors for edu at Evo
studio or clerical stem course startup
in a tech blog so great little resource
to check out but let's go ahead and dive
right in so what is it that we're
actually trying to do in this bonfire
sorted Union so what we're trying to do
is take in two or more arrays and then
return a single array of unique values
for instance if it was if it was just
one three to five to one four it would
go one two three four five
it would include all of them and there
would be no duplicates of any kind and
the reason it gets a little tricky is
because we're actually going to be
taking in multiple arrays with one
function so we're gonna have to use
something called the arguments object
and the arguments object is similar to
an array except it's not an array but
has some properties of an array and that
in itself will allow us to do this while
not having to know that there's only
that there's always going to be three
arrays in here so how did I do this so
the first thing I always do is I create
a place holder a place holder right just
because I find that easiest when not
knowing if I'm actually going to have to
modify the original array so we're
always going to have at least one array
and in this case I'm just gonna just
make a copy of it in my placeholder here
so the next thing we need to do is
iterate through our arguments object so
the reason we're going to do that is the
arguments object is going to store all
of the arrays in itself so if we were to
actually go here and say arguments dot
length
what's actually going to return is three
in this case because there's one two
three arrays so visualize that now if we
were gonna say arguments two and then
arguments one that's going to return
back one right here cool so think of it
as a two-tiered array in which this one
is which one of these we're choosing in
the second array is the actual
individual component of our choice so
that's how you kind of want to think of
it and to do that we're going to need to
create a double for loop the first one
is going to iterate through our it's
going to iterate through the first the
first very the first parameter meaning
the array so we're just gonna go ahead
and do of our eyes lessons a for
variable I equal to zero against that I
is less than our arguments dot length I
plus plus and then we're going to need
to iterate again another for loop except
now this for loop is going to iterate
through the specific specific data
within each array we're gonna say bar j
is equal to 0 while J is less than
arguments I so each one of the specific
array we're working on dot length j plus
plus and now here so if you're able to
figure out how the arguments work here
everything else is kind of a review now
in here we need an if statement to check
if our current placeholder our current
placeholder array actually contains the
the item that were we're iterating so
we're gonna iterate through all the
values we're gonna say hey check this
placeholder array and see if the array
item that we're checking is contained
within it and the way we would do
so we're gonna say if the placeholder
dot index off so if you remember index
of will actually check the array to see
if it can return a number if it returns
negative one it means that the value is
not contained within the array the index
of the array that we're checking so
we're gonna say our arguments the
current array were on I plus the current
value that we're checking of that
current array and we're gonna say if it
is equal exactly equal to negative one
meaning that if index of returns a
negative one it is not contained within
placeholder we then want to add it to
our placeholder array and that that
should be fairly simple so it was just a
placeholder to push and then we're gonna
add the current value that we're on here
of arguments I and J and then because I
set a placeholder to the value here we
are just gonna set R 1 is equal to our
placeholder and I believe that should be
it so let's run it make sure I didn't
make any typos good so now let's go
ahead and go over the code one time as
we've as we put in our documentation
this is very important just because just
because later on you're gonna actually
be going back and looking at this and
it's really gonna be quite helpful so
this uh is we're gonna create a
duplicate array from original original
array this iterates
iterates iterates oops sorry my typing
is really bad there it's through the
length of argument of arguments iterates
through current index value of arguments
and then here we check if placeholder
check if array contains the value of
arguments returned and what we'll do
another comment down below returns
negative one if it does not and then
finally add it to the end of the
placeholder array and last but not least
just a little note right here it says
set original array equal to altered
array so I hope you guys found this
helpful
the main thing is to kind of get from
this is how arguments work arguments has
a dot length function and I believe a
collie function that we didn't use in
this case I don't even remember what it
does and one one one more that they just
have said don't even use it it doesn't
make sense for current documentation but
it's really important to check out this
obviously I didn't use dot the rate
reduce in this case I just iterated
through twice and saw oh man this is
this is more this is how I know how to
do it so this is how I'm going to do it
eventually if I have to use dot reduce
I'm sure I will there's probably a
better way of doing it but as always
guys thanks for watching and I hope to
see you in the next video don't forget

sponsor one more time at edu studio org
thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
