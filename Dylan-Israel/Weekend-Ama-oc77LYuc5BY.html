earlier with my film not quite sure why
well so unfortunately I had some
internet issues when I tried to do my
weekend livestream early earlier on
Saturday so I figured I'd try my phone
out to see this being better and do it
again you look like a zombie this is
what you look like when you put in 12
hour days coding on the weekend so I
would say I look pretty good um yeah so
I don't want to be at the computer I've
been looking at the screen forever so I
figured why not do a little livestream
on the phone switch it up a little bit
but yeah so I like to do these every
weekend answer questions take questions
well sorry it's been a it's been an
interesting week almost done with the
main material for my second course learn
angular by projects part two which is a
more angular this will actually include
some MongoDB node and Express that's
what I've been working on all weekend
and last weekend a little bit of the
weekdays got the Christmas set up
oh so it's very bad connection when I
come to the living room so I stick in
the sick in the office but yeah so I've
been working on some things how's
everyone doing I am I'm my 90-day review
on Monday or Tuesday please assist note
our PHP which is better for the backend
well uh what do you want to do what is
your goal there's a lot of PHP fans
because there's a lot of jobs in PHP but
honestly a
I'm much better at front-end than I am
back in but I use node because I find it
quick and efficient but it depends on
what what's the market in your area but
I would recommend node for entry-level
developers / PHP no one filament even
though there's probably less jobs in
reality
you have to
I mean really so here's the thing is
really once you expose yourself to a
back-end technology and like sort of
what the main premise is how to handle
responses and requests and parse data
send data route data you can then apply
that to whatever you want
backing backtick is more for conceptual
thing than it is anything else but
that's just I mean I guess this is just
my opinion at this point
come come outside this everyone is
learning to code so I think more people
are learning to code but I think you are
pretty far off saying that everyone is
learning to code because there are so
many people who are not learning to code
and need to be make sure to leave the
chat up for back end are we talking
about data structures rowdy locking the
mic oh sorry guys what are we doing
today
just taking questions I wanted to do a
week of my stream that actually keep up
like I normally do so should I go to
Niagara Falls today with my family yes
what a web posting no use I just use
GoDaddy there's a lot of there's a lot
of it's a lot of hosting out there I've
never really had to worry about where
and what and a lot of people that's one
of those things that I don't have any
reason unless I'm launching a production
application to actually spend time
investigating and something that just
doesn't need to require any mental
energy so yeah I might save 90 cents or
three dollars a month but
got him looking pale man looking pale
and crusty I only have left the house
- like short trips uh I mean this is my
house I can give a tour but uh my
workplace I can't all right I'll give
you a tour the internet might break out
for some reason the router is not
working too well so this is the office
this is where the magic happens
we've got the lights over here got a
little bit of padding on the got a green
screen a little bit more padding over
here big ol white board over here for
when I'm white boarding stuff out
probably about five feet got a bathroom
a guest room so that kind of april's
office washer and dryer area first time
I ever owned a washer and dryer I was
actually a really proud moment for me I
haven't had a washer and dryer in a unit
four years uh we got the TV had some
youtube on Christmas set up anniversary
gift for April a little massage chair um
dining area it's just a little gym area
the kitchen doesn't do crazy in here got
some cool posters on here some
JavaScript posters so another bathroom
little like closet area like where's to
the bedroom with the kitties huh
that's it nothing crazy huh so typical
apartment more room than we need pity on
tree house I mean I'm sure they have
lots of great videos but I haven't
I used it one time and I stoop broke to
pay $40 a month how important is it to
master vanilla Jay asked before learning
a framework so what I would say about
this I said this in my most recent video
is to UM one I would spend time so
vanilla J's but knit the butt so the
vanilla in vanilla Jas refers to Dom
manipulation specifically in JavaScript
and most of 90% of that statement is
true is hope
well just say it as an absolute but
that's really whatever first year is
manipulating the Dom in JavaScript now
by and large frameworks will do that for
you and most jobs you're going to be
using a framework it's very rare fruit
for most workplaces for you to be
writing vanilla JavaScript now you
should be aware of certain things and
you'll pick certain things up but I
don't think it's that important I think
you need to understand JavaScript you
know what a rake methods are how to use
them what functions are available to you
obviously all the standards off the
if-else if-else switch statements
while loops for loops I think you have
to have that on lock hundred percent but
the Dom manipulation in vanilla
JavaScript I'm not not convinced that
it's important for you to know what's
the best path to follow to become a full
stack web developer uh I mean there's
not a standard path it's really just
make projects and code everyday and
continue grinding right you have to
really dive in deep in my opinion of
let's go to meetups let's let's let's
build projects let's launch websites
let's having it a good github of
LinkedIn and just sort of love it that's
my opinion on it there's a lot of people
who don't love it
do I think algorithms have helped me
become a better developer so when I was
doing the code fights I think it helps
me solve algorithms better but I also
think it did help me become a better
developer so I found myself being being
more comfortable with the array methods
that are in there and forcing myself to
understand the documentation can you do
a video on the setup tour I talked about
this my office I think I already have a
video up there on my channel it's called
office chores
nothing really has changed too much and
we just walked through it real quick
so I did the Udacity react now degree
program and finish it cuz I got a job in
angular and I had to start studying
angular and I lost my interest in react
but um I really did like their program I
have two videos on it and I would highly
recommend it is an algorithm a function
or something more the way that he's
using the algorithm is sort of your
write a function to solve a purpose so a
very very basic algorithm in computer
science would be
when you're solving this is hey I need
you to I have a input of two strings
that I want you to parse numbers out and
only add the numbers and ignore the
characters then you parse it and then
you would add the numbers together that
makes any sense is it worth getting a
bachelor's in computer science while
part time while working as a web
developer it really depends I am going
back to school just because I found a
program that I really like and I think
it will help me down the road I make a
decent amount of money already for where
I am in my career but I'm more so just
doing it to plan for the future but
really expensive what your goal is if
your goal is just to be a developer as a
junior developer and go to senior
developer already working that sounds
like a already on your path I am more so
I prefer to be much more prepared and
the weakest area in Excel I'm excelling
in every aspect of being a developer
except the traditional education aspect
I'm passionate I have projects I'm
gaining experience that's one of the
weaker ants but I have experience out
and it's growing every year right I'm in
the field and I'm going to just go fill
that one thing I have I have a great
side project that I'm working on I have
multiple side projects for that matter
so for me I'm just tying up a weak link
but it but but it's also depends on how
much money you want to make what your
personal life style is I don't have any
kids most people who are like 30 which
is my age have children and it makes it
a little harder to go back to school or
they don't want to do online I'm doing
online at seven thousand dollars for the
year and there's a good chance I can
finish within a year but it's also up to
you to make sure that you get paid for
going and getting your bachelor's and
job hopping if you have to or you know
demanding a larger raise when your
review comes they're out so
how do you say so motivating you work
extremely hard sometimes as a developer
I start feeling like I'll never get over
the hump I mean I have my days man um
it's I have my days where I don't feel I
was just Sean April yesterday I started
feeling like a loser again recently it's
just a moment but uh you're just
frustration was kicking in of personal
things in my life and so when that
happens you have two things so I had
that this is so to answer your question
yesterday I was basically talking with
April telling about my frustrations
about how I feel I feel like a loser I
can't accomplish what I want to and then
I went back to work because it's like
what's not gonna help is me not grinding
it out so it's okay to have those
frustrations and to to be unhappy with
where you're at I think I think that's
it you know no one has smile on their
face 100% of the time I don't think
maybe it's just me but when you uh when
you it's okay to express the
frustrations and to say like I don't
want to code 100% of the time I don't
you know I'm burnt out or whatever but
how do you overcome it you just for me I
just go and do it I don't care if I
don't want to I do I just go and do it
because I know I know I know I will I
will thank myself later on so how do you
maintain good health mental and physical
well my physical health I need to go get
my hand checked out I've been waiting
till April gets the job to get Ostrom I
own that but mental health I think it's
just about being happy at where you're
at and what you're doing and continually
working to move forward and then justice
or your health in general eating and
healthy it's probably the best advice
and exercise something I'm not doing to
Rihanna
but the thing when it comes to your
mental health making sure that you're
not part of the 70% that are unhappy
with where they work and going from
there I think that's probably the
biggest thing that most people could do
some comments about Jays future I don't
really know to be honest I haven't
really thought about it too much it'll
be interesting to see if you takes off I
know a lot of people are hailing it as
the latest and the greatest so well that
would be my interest to see if you takes
off and if node as a back end continues
to grow best sites for free projects to
practice the best free project for you
to practice are your own you could do
free code camp they have projects but I
highly encourage you the ones that are
going to impact you're going to learn
the most and impress employers the most
are the ones that you are building on
your own that you guys you have an idea
and you want to build it
do you have any automate ideas um I mean
on I'm a friend and developer so you
can't automate components you build
components with the idea that you're
gonna use them in other applications and
then import them it's not exactly
automation but DevOps does a lot of
automating so that's another thing that
you could look into about deploying your
code and what do you think a p1x cheese
get job ready guide really necessary you
just look like it's going to a whole lot
more time to finish compared to free
code camps curriculum I have been I'm
not familiar with that but uh I'll try
and make a mental note to check it out
and maybe talk about it
God look at all those cords man
how can how can you get accredited
through a coding online I talking about
like a credit degree or what are you
talking about I mean there's a bunch of
online accredited colleges Western
Governors University is uh this one
if you're talking about like getting
certified in JavaScript and things like
that will you ever go back to finish
your degree yeah I'm actually just at my
transcripts in for a software
engineering degree through Western
Governors University I will have there
be starting January 1st or February 1st
depending on when my transcripts from
the other school of those arrive is it
necessary to have a deep knowledge of
any technology that we learn uh it
depends on where you're at in your
career and what it is that you're doing
I'm of the belief that 90% of the time
you use about 10% of the language so you
shouldn't understand that 10% pretty
well well you just got to be able to
reference back to what you see well fund
am I using the galaxy s7 edge piece of
 uh let me recommend it
in fact I won't this is my second galaxy
and I don't think I don't think I'll
I'll do again what's the 10% JavaScript
when making websites just knowing the
basic array methods and string methods
would probably be if I do and then of
course the if you know control flow and
all the standard stuff that goes into
any language but yeah
it's a nano degree courses accredited
now respected I don't think anyone so
most people won't know what your nano
degree is but but it's up to you to so
it's about the skills you gain not to be
favored so this is this is a strange
thing because traditional education is
about the piece of paper and not the
skills you can't gain any so in these
certificate programs like the Udacity
nano degree 90 percent of employers
aren't gonna have any idea what it is
it's up to you to explain it and impress
them with it as well as gain the skills
doing X amount of assignments during the
program
Emily Happ are you happy with where you
are in your career I am in the best spot
financially and career-wise I have ever
been in my life
I am happy but I am NOT content I am
part of the reason I just want to do
better I think I can do better and I'm
working hard to do better if that
answers your question
how big sure your portfolio be if you
have one impressive project that's
enough it's about having impressive
projects not the amount of projects but
if you wanted me to throw a number on it
I would say three is that is a healthy
amount how did you grow so fast as a
developer you know I don't feel like I
did um but I mean I could tell you just
right so here's the thing is uh about
three years ago I told a broad is gonna
work every day for about five years
maybe with two and a half years ago and
I have and that was very helpful so I've
worked almost every single day outside
of work where they'd be on YouTube
whether it be going to meetups whether
it be doing tutorials courses studying
whatever it is every single day - about
two or three times we've gone on
vacation I've come home or woken up
early and work towards that goal and and
it's it's been what has made me most
successful in recent times I guess what
is your definition of doing better right
as of right now uh I mean financially I
could do better
I'm compensated very well but who
doesn't want more money in terms of
title I could do better I want to get
senior on my title in terms of
promotions who doesn't want to be like a
lead or something like that so it's all
it's all relative about what it is right
and what what's doing better but those
are so very very financial oriented
goals which is where I'm at right now in
life
why did you choose the code if not
coding did you have any other life
choices I start coding as hobby
um when I was in school I was bouncing
around College for about six years and I
had I guess that four years four to five
years at this point and I just had my
general ed done but I kept on switching
majors and my father was like yo man you
got a yes start a bachelor's program you
can't jump around anymore
it's okay and so I just did some basic
research about what the best job market
is where all the what so I the three
things that I preached about high
salaries amount to jobs and job growth
and everything led me into computer
science which led me to coding and I
didn't really I enjoyed it while I was
in the program but I didn't fall in love
with it like I am now until I dropped
out of college and found what the
bellman consider making some videos in
angular yeah I mean I'm I just released
a three-hour course on angular and I'm
working on if you see on the back screen
there a full stack mean application
that's an angular almost done with it
too it's I've put in so much work
yesterday and I'm kind of burnt out
today so I I probably coated 10 plus
hours yesterday I was I was going at it
so today that's kind of need a break I
think I already put in an hour and a
half today working on it probably has to
finish the first rendition of this
project about another three hours of
work and then I have to record the
videos I then have to wireframes I have
to wireframes and then have to come up
with features and bug fixes and then
have to do refactoring on the project
and I then have to upload all that sort
of stuff so it's fun don't get me wrong
I have no complaints I enjoy it all but
uh it is a it is something that is a
process for sure
actually think this project came out
really good got that naked use yeah they
were on set normally I want to buy this
a naked juice you looking for any coders
first of sponsorships nice look up look
how good I looked at this
when will I propose to April when we buy
our first house
their second house maybe yeah this is
interesting so I've had a couple of
people asked me if I'm going to continue
with YouTube I think a lot of developer
channel ZAR leaving because of all the
stuff going on with the YouTube ad
pocalypse and which is part of the
reason I started doing courses and I
have some clothes coming out pretty soon
that are pretty sick so hopefully you
guys like that yeah they've even started
to monetize in my videos so I don't but
I don't blame them for asking the
question but uh it's unfortunate what I
ever moved to another platform like
steamin I could do some Co Co uploads on
on those platforms but honestly there's
not really apply there's not a real
contender yet for this stuff it's not
really something to take over so I don't
know I don't know it's something I'm
going to be thinking about because I'm
doing a lot more live streams that I
delete them I take them down and I may
just go and start doing live coding on
Twitch and and leave them up there so
that's something that is definitely a
possibility also on Twitch they're much
more of a donations tip sort of I think
they're called Cheers even there they're
much more of a a where we're cool with
giving content creators money which is
not something that's really part of
YouTube's culture so there's that aspect
as well although lately lately you guys
are pulling out the money I am I don't
know I don't know if everyone got their
Christmas bonuses or what but you guys
have been very supportive lately and I
want to thank everybody for that support
I think I've gotten in the last month
more donations than I got in the last
year and a half so I appreciate that
very much going back to school and I'm
sure had to have everything else it's
it's it helps
how long should a very junior deaf study
slash prepare for a technical interview
it depends what you mean like do you
already have the interview like is the
interview lined up and it says hey your
interviews in five days you should study
all five days or are you just saying hey
I'm starting apply for to work how how
much should I prepare for say hi so when
I saw no interview lined up so when I
was a I'll give you my example when I
was applying after my first year of
experience at my previous job which was
about six months ago three months before
I start my current job I decided that I
was going to leave my workplace because
it wasn't gonna work out long term and
so so what I did was I studied every
single day for over a three-month period
doing algorithms doing projects gaining
skillsets so I started preparing every
day from the moment I started hiring I
started doing interviews until I got a
job so that would be my advice just if
you're looking for work you should be
preparing for technical interviews and
preparing for interviews in general how
do you manage back pain while coding for
a long long hours I haven't had that
issue how far in calculus did you go
when you were in school I had three
calculus courses I don't remember like
what the levels autumn or yeah there's a
I had I think stats was what I took to
get into to transfer and then I had
College Algebra I also had trigonometry
geometry three calculus is at a said
dynamic mathematics no that doesn't
sound right eight a sort of
out-of-the-box math class as well it was
really useless
do you know any typical interview
questions just use some Google searches
on about whatever at the top of the
companyÃ­s and then also about also
about the what do you call it a stupid
thing what the company it is but also
about the subjects the main subject like
say it's an overall you should do
difficult interview questions for a node
developer so no self-worth
yeah I have a video about how to prepare
for technical interviews ask some great
resources in it I would suggest checking
it out how am i spending the holidays
well my girlfriend is unemployed
we are saving for a house and I'm going
back to college so we are going to be
staying at home and doing nothing
because money is tight if I'm going to
be able to buy a house and go back to
school why my girlfriend is unemployed I
need to just sort of relax yeah but just
stay at home
we'll watch so every every every
Christmas I watch home alone - sometimes
home alone one and home alone - but so
will at least watch home alone to just
hang out it's just the two of us here we
don't know anybody else
so we'll just hang out I did pick her up
a small Christmas present am I going to
coat on the side to make oh it's on line
so I'll be I'll still have my full-time
job yeah and it's at your own pace my
pace I'm hoping to pick up very frappe
idli to graduate early but yes it's at
your own pace so you can you can sort
I'm looking for still working everything
so I'll be working my job I want to
interfere at all have you ever been to
Europe one time for about three days I
went to Brussels I went with the
engineer truth he was out there
traveling Europe for like three months
and I met him out there I bought his
ticket that was on sale it was like 250
bucks round trip or something stupidly
cheap and then I flew out and we just
hung out for a bit and it's dope
I almost have all my hair back from with
that portable barber cut it off I'm just
looking at it right now I would love to
go to Australia vez it's expensive to
fly out there I've looked into it
yeah I remember Matt some girl invited
him down to Australia on some trip and
he looked into it was like two grand to
fly down to Australia so I don't know
that's about
you stink hey buddy you don't say hi say
hi
a little Bugatti
I have invested a little bit into
Bitcoin yes
bloody restate come here you don't have
thick Oh
I'm gonna check holding my phone sorry
guys
I have no idea how I haven't bought
Bitcoin cash so I couldn't tell you
I can't wait till these braces are off
just didn't come with the Bitcoin it
depends that when you got your Bitcoin
if you're there for the split it also
depends on what exchange you're using so
coin base has everyone's Bitcoin cash
wouldn't be including to cash split
never gave it to anybody
yeah the mustache is gone
a little more mustachio
oh yeah your exchange probably took it
you think bitcoins gonna go over to go
to 1 million per coin that'd be nice
it's going pretty crazy right now
it feels like it's jumping a couple
thousand a week right now who knows
what's gonna happen
so how do you get the split or it's
impossible I couldn't tell you it
I kind of believe we're gonna see so I
know like bitcoins future is launching
but uh yeah I tend to believe that we're
we're gonna be in a once that once the
traditional markets entry it which is
just starting it will go up by how much
who knows 100 fold is a bold prediction
wonderful it would be worth a million
dollars oh yes your exchange took it you
have to email them but technically the
exchanges own the addresses are not
yours so whatever you do with that
that's my understanding of it and you
know
yeah it's it's on its way to being the
to beam a
when Amazon starts taking Bitcoin it's
game over for a regular money
I know overstock just started taking
Bitcoin I mean they're no Amazon but
square cash I don't know if it happened
yet but they're gonna let you start to
send and receive Bitcoin on the square
cash out so it's it's it's working its
way
yeah it's a good industry get into if
you're looking for something other than
web development start going look
researching blockchain flawed money in
it it's a talk about a rapidly expanding
field I obviously think like coin will
be easier for Amazon to use a Bitcoin
yeah that's that's probably so I've kind
of a stance on crypto currencies is that
there's going to be three main crypto
currencies categories there's going to
be the store value in category similar
to gold which is what bitcoin is there
because you can't really do transactions
with its to the transaction cost is too
much and it's too slow there's the lay
let's actually have an online currency
that's the that's the what do you call
it
litecoin something fast low transaction
cost and then there's the super
anonymous currency to do shady stuff and
that's like Manero
I don't know I couldn't tell you Mandela
factors have to do some research on it
uh I haven't followed that story so the
San Francisco verdict on the guy who
killed the young girl I haven't heard I
haven't heard about that news it took me
one year to get good at javascript smart
dumb or average I don't know just be
happy or good a good JavaScript now I
don't know what this is meant to be it's
meant to be an a nama I talked about
software and coding to answer questions
to provide mentorship and to help out
but somehow we went down the Bitcoin
path for the last 20 minutes
ha pls I'd have to I'd have to go more
into it but sounds kind of
sounds like I would need to dive into a
little bit more but I'd find it hard to
believe that they let a guilty guy go
he's barely guilty um dry reading and
books like any other than coarsely so
solder in any books for software
occasionally occasionally I will read a
software but the last book I read though
was about a year ago as ready player one
is a stressful of being a web developer
like do you get any free time or do you
constantly have to keep up with the to
date with the new tech well I'm
constantly keeping up to date with the
new tech because I'm trying to get
better and it's a stressful being a
developer only if your job is stressful
what I mean by that is it depends on the
company so 70% of people hate their job
that's a combination of not making
enough money working in a bad
environment so I'd encourage you to
leave if you're in that in situation and
go to a less stressful environment
I guess what I'm trying to say is more
depends on the in place of employment
than the job type
and you cut these sideburns too long
are there any environments willing to
hire people basis basic HTML and CSS
skills and develop them to be friended
developers you might be able to get an
internship and get lucky but you're
gonna have a hard hard shot I would say
it's not it's not impossible it are are
you going against the odds yes I
encourage people start applying all the
time and just learn from your interviews
and see what happens what if you had a
really labor-intensive job and your boss
wasn't too bad that would still be
pretty hard yeah if you're if they if
you're being overworked it's just as but
you have a super nice boss it's just as
bad just being under work or and having
a awful boss so
do you think learning frameworks like
angular will be easier you're really
good with the millage s or is basic just
enough to start getting started with the
angular react slush - I think basic J s
I don't know as I mentioned you don't
need to you don't need to worry about
the Dom manipulation aspect as much you
should have the language should have the
language down - the Dom manipulation
what if I'm 40 years old and came out of
school for fit been at school for 15
years can I be an intern anybody could
be an intern why not you don't think
they're gonna hire interns just cuz
you're older this I mean they won't hire
you as an intern I'm sick with the
political environment within the
industry how do you cope with it not
giving a honestly we don't talk
about that sort of stuff at my work
places I've ever worked at and it might
be a little different
SF because it's it's a very Californian
generals very liberal and I say that if
somebody lived in California for 29
years
so says
it is definitely one of those things
where if someone's constantly ironing
your face I could see how it could be
obnoxious by if have been in that
situation honestly I really don't care
too much about politics because it's
like I'm actually trying to do things
that are gonna affect me and I don't
have time to get up set about things I
have no control over you know what I
have control over I have control over
getting me a better job if I choose to
or getting promoted making more money
because I can study I can make myself
more valuable I can get a degree I could
I could become better JavaScript I could
become better at angular I could build I
could become learn skills such as
back-end development these are all
things that are within my control
focusing mental energy and time and
money in some cases on worrying about
politics within the industry not
something I can control
I might be able to give my two cents
because I have a platform right you know
at some point if my channel ever gets
large enough maybe I'll have a voice
within the industry and I can comment on
that right now that's not the case at
all right you know we have 23 people in
here we don't have 2,300 or 23,000
developers in here but I try to control
the things that I can and the other
things I don't really let them bother me
what are some good beginner projects for
JavaScript I don't know what are your
interests build something build
something that you're interested in
that's usually what my advice is start a
long term side project and go from there
how to interview for a junior full stack
developer position this week will have
an answer most likely tomorrow most like
the interview went very well hope it all
works out good luck man I know I know
it's always exciting when you're like
dude I think I nailed it maybe they'll
actually call me back and get that first
roll
choose to you
what was my first project my first real
one was my youtube channel let's see I
think it was probably the quote
generator on free code camp do i do any
exercises so i did for a while then I
stopped because winter came but I used
to swim every day I did for like 4
months while I was down here and I loved
it and I kind of have been thinking
about trying to do it again so if you
happen to have a pool in your complex or
your house it's just our swimming laps
you ain't got a beat you know
Michael Phelps up in it I do like three
so
what's your experiences Freeland
freelancing what would you recommend
learning to freelance I would recommend
that you go and get a job first before
trying to freelance once you get five up
five years of experience then start
freelancing and contract work that's
what I would recommend no no I'm
actually swimming a real pool none of
those swamps and lakes I'm trying to not
get caught with them Gators is it common
to steal code from other people in the
web dev industry no you should not
Oh what what is going on
look guys who thinks out worried there
for a moment guys yeah did I finish the
free code camp challenges I did the
front end and I did half of the back end
I took about nine months when I first
started out what should we try doing up
work never uh I don't know I've thought
about maybe picking up some front-end
work on up work to pay for school with
Sai projects I don't know I thought it
might be fun but honestly I probably
would get paid less than I make hourly
and I want to get paid more than make
hourly
well see I might I might get around to
doing it one day just to see what I can
actually get
yeah it's I mean it's hard to compete
when with people are living in you know
third world countries but honestly I've
done freelance work in the past and on
just through like friends and Craigslist
this is years ago like two years ago but
I asked about freelancing because I
cannot move I can't move why can't you
move now I'll decide if you can't move
because most people say that and chances
are they can well it's such a little
thing you say it's lavender I also use
some experiment you can move if you buy
a house you can rent your house out bad
excuse you'd sell your house
there's no reason you can't move you
don't want to move okay
every decision you have has consequences
last week we did a live stream and the
guy said they can't get a job and then
he says that he wanted to stay in his
city and he's turned down six jobs out
of the state because they were out of
this out of his city and not necessarily
on the perfect stack you wanted Oregon
some things that I do at work that ain't
no have much experience in testing
writing unit tests would probably be the
number one thing you gotta convince her
man my girlfriend didn't want to move
when we came out here either also a lot
of developers husbands because men it's
90 percent man I was just saying
husband's but lie developers they leave
their families in other states in the
house live and go take a job elsewhere
consider that yeah when I started
applying out of state and I was
employing to a limited area all of a
sudden I starting any calls so are you
talking about moving to California no I
wouldn't I've lived in California my
moving back
hey man you gotta convince you got it I
mean leave honestly just leave if you
have to and say look go I'll fly home
every three months you got to get that
experience
nothing nothing I've been told is is
anything that asks you why you can't
move it's why you don't want to move or
why it's hard to move you have a house
you can see the great thing about the
internet you see you still make a house
payment in another state another great
thing is you could write you can get a
job in another state live in that state
fly back to see the family in the state
I don't know man I understand you
experienced over everything hey love
don't pay the bills baby all right so
I'm just telling you
loving gonna pay the rent love ain't
gonna pay the mortgage love's not gonna
pay the health insurance so throw that
out there
Wallace you should apply places not like
moving then apply places
I guess a few more questions then I'm
gonna call it a day I think I'm gonna
actually go swimming if it's hot you've
inspired me
when will you be back and do this do
what what are we doing
I started out as a front-end developer
at 50k haven't got a raise in two years
is this normal
no it's not but that's your own fault to
be honest so if you don't get a raise at
your first year you should your
responsibility as an employee is to
leave that job for more money elsewhere
because they will pay you it now think
about it this way you went from zero
experience to one year experience you
have now proves that you have what you
your at least at the very least more
experience on your resume and you have a
company that doesn't value you so
another reason to leave you should go
and jump a job to 60k get 10k raise live
stream so I do I do them every Saturday
usually today Sunday obviously but every
weekend I do a live stream I also do a
live stream every thousand subscriber so
same time it's random I leave them up on
the channel though they usually won't
they they usually won't have a they
usually won't have a um like a thumbnail
so you'll know it's a live stream that
way so I made a few mistakes I have a
felony on my record for distribution of
marijuana I'm really worried about being
denied web dev jobs because of it
thoughts uh yeah I mean it's it's a
realistic possibility I would say so
Kyle my advice say I was interviewing
somebody my advice would be you're going
to have an interview process and you're
going to some companies most companies
will do a background check for you my
advice as an employee what I would do if
I was in your situation and as if I was
an employer what I would want to hear is
is I would actually bring it up in the
interview very under your own terms say
you're on the second part of the
interview it's going very well ask them
what the next steps are and they say you
know they they essentially say what
those are they say okay well you know if
we like you this and that we're gonna
send you over a contract and then maybe
you'll have to take a drug test or you
also have to do a background check I
would say when that that that leads you
to in there I would explain my situation
I would say you know I just want to I
don't want anything to shock you but a
few years back about five years back I
made I have um a marijuana conviction on
my my my past I've I've that part of my
life is done and over but I just don't
want it to shock you and disqualify me
or anything I'd I would I would bring it
up on my own terms that's what I'm
trying to say
the env LS bring some brings up a good
point is that if you can somehow get it
reduced or get it off the record it's
worth the money to do so worth the money
and time you solved your problem after
three days what did it end up being KC
nested object the classic it's always
easy once you realize what the issue is
how old am I I'm 30 years old
yeah I mean here's the thing is like
it's not the end-all be-all sort of
thing and damn you look young as
good Chuck
it's the braces man will come off I'll
look I'll look like an adult again but
yeah I I think that's probably the best
bet just and that I mean the easy way to
to go about it is just to ask how the
interview process normally goes so that
you're aware and when you feel like it's
a good time to explain your situation in
person if you can I would practice what
you're going to say but it's definitely
it's definitely going to have some
implications but I think you already
knew that right it's not a good thing
right so here's the thing there's things
that are only good and there's things
that are only bad having a good LinkedIn
does nothing but help you having a nice
resume does nothing but helped you
having a personal portfolio does nothing
but help you having a drug conviction
does nothing but hurt you and in the
worst case scenario right so there's
things that are neutral and bad neutral
and good and then there's goes in either
direction so you just gotta kind of try
to handle it the best you don't be
unrealistic that yeah it will it cost
you some jobs yeah probably but last I
checked you only needed one I wanna say
tell the recruiter the recruiter
I'm talking about the actual company
that's going to give you a back give you
a job yeah I don't care about recruiters
recruiters are skin peddlers as as Chris
Hawks is the
I mean it would also I would say that it
also this particular offense if you're
in California may not be as big of a
deal to some employers since it's now
legal there all right guys um dad watch
sports only MMA emailed you a few months
back but I got my first show a
congratulations
all right guys I'm gonna go swim some
laps I think if it's not too cold out
and then I'm gonna go back to finish
that project right there so I can
release another course almost over this
pretty pretty fun I will see you guys
next time
as always I do these live streams every
thousand today is our weekend livestream
which go here answer some questions we
kind of shoot the and then we do a
bonus live stream every thousand
subscribers so keep an eye out for that
see you next time
oh you know what I normally tried to do
final thoughts that's one thing that I
try to do with these live streams is I
want to leave you with a little bit of
some final thoughts I think I think the
conversation about past and being honest
just what we're going to talk about
right now as I as I leave so as we were
talking about gentleman's who's past
with the pot conviction well we're
really talking about on how to handle
that is to be about honesty and being
upfront and I talk all the time about
having good communication skills as a
developer and it's just as important as
an individual and as a someone
job-seeking so when you find yourself in
situations in life where we've you've
made a mistake
I'm in that same position and numerous
things and for a very long time I felt
very uncomfortable talking about
dropping out of college and things like
that but especially you know you're
going in to interviews and things like
that and you don't have a degree and
they ask you know why'd you drop out and
it's just really uncomfortable for me
it's different than the situation but
the overlying theme here is practice
what you're going to say and try to
understand why you do things and how
you've changed but more so than anything
else when you are communicating that
message to anybody in life just try to
do it in an honest fashion and I think
that will be what's most helpful in life
when I got interviewed numerous times
and I got asked almost I would say in
the five in-person interviews that I
have
four of them asked me why I dropped out
of school my response was I hated it if
it's the truth response I hated being a
student and being in the CS program and
a lot of them could understand could
relate and they they could appreciate
the honesty so I hope that whatever it
is that you're trying to do that you
share it in a honest way whether it's a
mistake whether it's something that
you're self-conscious about but I think
honesty is the best path for almost
everything in life so I'll leave you
with that it's my final thought I
appreciate you all don't forget to
