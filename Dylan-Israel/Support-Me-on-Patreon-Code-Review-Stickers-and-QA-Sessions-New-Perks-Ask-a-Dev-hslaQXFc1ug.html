lot of Chris Hawkes videos I actually
watch all his videos but his most recent
videos was talking about how YouTube was
basically ruining his channel and like
making it hard for him to be himself and
it kind of brought up the importance of
monetizing your channel in outside of
YouTube right maybe using YouTube as a
platform to gain an audience and then
monetizing it elsewhere so that you can
still be yourself and still put good
content out while not having to worry
about the ad dollars not coming in now I
haven't necessarily been affected by
this yet but it's one of those things
won't be proactive about so what I've
decided to do is revamp my patreon page
and I've added a lot of cool things on
here that I think is gonna add a lot of
value and I hope if you guys are
interested and you want to help me out
so that I can continue to put out great
content or what I think is very content
some of you may be but I could keep on
doing what I love to do so I hope you
guys enjoy these perks and in the
comment section below
you know this is all kind of a work in
progress but in the comments section
below if you think that there is
something that I could add to here that
would make you come on the patreon train
it's you know definitely let me know
because I'm very open to how I can
improve this and these are just a few of
the ideas that I've been able to
implement I think it would be remiss of
me not to take this opportunity to think
the patreon subscribers have been with
me
James Jeff Walker Bennett Adler Timothy
singleton or hi Jason Jason Williamson
Williams rather Sir Francis Scott me own
Barry black Jordan Tekken Berg sorry man
I probably butchered name Nicholas oh my
goodness the midship Geils blanchard and
long pay qui min it has been so amazing
I mean you can see that James here has
been supporting me for so long at $10 a
month which
really nice of him and just as something
I didn't put this in there but one of
the things that I've been lucky enough
to have happen is that I can get courses
on occasion from other content creators
one of the most recent ones is
traversée media and so he's given me a
couple he gave me ten of his angular for
course and ten of his his boot shot for
course and I've gave away eight of them
on the channel and I gave one to James
as well because I do think that at some
point you should be rewarded for sick
and there's rewards in here but uh if I
can I get additional courses through
sponsors and things like that I will
definitely give them to my patreon
subscribers as well as to the channel
right but that's just one thing I wanted
to mention before we kind of jumped into
everything because I'm $130 in total at
the end of day so he's been donating $10
a month for 13 months strong baby so uh
thank you James and thank you to
everybody else in there
so as you can see here I've uh eleven
people that are supporting me and again
thank you you know from their feedback
and other feedback from live streams and
things like that I've come up with a set
of tears I think will will help here now
the for a dollars not much I can do
others and say thank you it is
appreciated and to the five patrons are
doing it thank you so much so if that's
something you're comfortable doing I
awesome and I hope you continue to do it
and if you're interested you can you can
support there as well
at five dollars a month I have now
including custom content just for the
patrons so this is stuff like some more
controversial topics so one of the
reasons I'm putting it there is as an
employee I can't necessarily put
something out public that's a little bit
controversial because I have to maintain
my image and things like that
from a professional standpoint but in a
closed environment maybe some of those
topics that you know they're not really
that bad but he's on the side of let's
just make sure you guys get to see those
and trust me I have about five or six
videos on the backlog that will slowly
be released that uh you know shouldn't
should never actually go out in its
public some of the
outtakes uh not everything is gold that
goes out right there's a lot of silver
that although maybe educational didn't
make the cut a little bit of
behind-the-scenes I'm gonna film a you
know how what is my work process how you
know maybe an office thing of you know
how how this all comes together today in
the homie tier is what we're calling
that at eight dollars a month I thank
you in the description of every video
for as long as you're at that point as
well as a link to your Twitter or your
website or whatever it is that you want
to promote we're go ahead and put that
in the description for you and then at
ten dollars a month let me go ahead and
change this you get I might mind the way
you're getting all this and in different
and continuing on right so you get the
eight and ten dollars I'm gonna send you
two of these these are I love it filters
out the green these are the coding
tutorials 360 sticker laptop stickers
I'm happy to send you more than two so
if you're there for a second month you
want two more all you gotta do is ping
me and I'll send you two more and two
more the next month right usually people
just ask for the two and that's fine but
I'm happy to send it to you that I've I
made a thousand of these I paid for for
them so that I can't send them to you
guys at $20 a month this is one of the
feedback and I'm only gonna do ten of
these because uh at most if I it might
even drop down to five to be honest
because it's it's going to be very time
consuming and I want to make sure that I
provide the valley for it so uh
mentorian slash custom video a lot of a
lot of people message me with questions
and I have to politely decline that I
just don't have the time to answer them
because I get three or four new people
every day
add me on Facebook and message me and
and want my advice and my opinion about
things and I just can't do that but if
you are interested in that and you want
a little bit of mentoring or a little
bit of guidance that's what this cheers
for so you will have the ability you
will get my answers right you will get
my my time so that I can't answer that
and if you prefer and you think it'd be
more beneficial I can actually record a
video and I'll put it out on the chain
about the subject matter and maybe other
people can watch it as well so let's say
that you wanted to say you just asked me
should you learn JavaScript in 2018
that's you want to know my opinion about
that I would film a video so you know
what I don't need it to be one-on-one if
just film a video about it and put it on
your channel and be happy with that
you'll have that ability as well if not
we can answer over email and things like
that and messages and the the newest
cheer code review I think this is a
really cool one a little bit pricey am I
only doing it for three people right now
this is the this is a $30 a month I'm
only taking three people because of how
time-consuming it's going to be but I'm
going to code review this is something
that you do quite often in web
development and I encourage you to start
now is say you're working on a project
and you want to know how can I improve
this project how can I I go from okay
code to better code to greater code how
can I react to this how can I make the
UI look better well you're gonna have
two opportunities every month where you
can send me your current project that
you're working on I'll review it you can
set it over code pin if it's just a
front-end project or github if I need to
install something and I'll download it
I'll view it and then I'll actually give
you feedback and we can do this one of
two ways we can do it over the phone
excuse me over it like Skype and or I
can actually just send you a outline
document back I think it's really cool
because getting getting a developer to
code review your code it's really really
hard right so basically it's $15 each
review which is which I want one of the
reason I just make it $15 for a single
code review is I think there's benefit
to not only reviewing your code one time
seeing the iteration and then two weeks
later sending it back with the
additional changes as well as the new
features they're reviewing it again I
think you get more value out of that but
this is what I have for the patreon I'm
looking I'm hoping that you guys take
advantage of this as well as help me out
and I have some goals and stuff like
that you know one thing that I would
like like to start doing is blogging so
if
if I'm able to hit $250 per month which
is a ton I think the most in the highest
I've ever got is like 65 bucks or $75
for a single month and they dropped back
down to about where it's at about 40
which is really cool by the way cuz I
spent about fifty to sixty dollars a
month on tools for YouTube and like
websites and it this pays for it and
helps and so that's really appreciated
but if I'm able to get to that first
goal I'll start doing a monthly blog
related around coding YouTube and diving
in that way I've really enjoyed riding a
nice to be a staff writer at a data
center and in high school I was in the
journalism class I don't think it's a
club at that point it's a class so it's
been a very nice passion for my and it
encouraged putting out and I'm gonna
rework these goals I'm just curious what
I put in here
Oh hackathon vlog I'll go to I have five
hundred dollars a month I could do a
hackathon and all of long the entire
experience or livestream the entire
experience I forgot about that would be
fun one I might do that anyhow but you
know guys so that's my that's my patreon
page if you want to help me out and you
want to support the channel and you want
to get any of these benefits are very
attractive to you or if you think
there's additional benefits that I can
add to make it more attractive to you
because I'm open to ideas as long as I
think it will be helpful and I can
provide value as well let's get value
right let me know in the comments below
