be doing a quick little video on how to
redirect a site so we're gonna be doing
it right now with a link to redirect
using my referral code from way up I
talked about in the last video but way
ups basically a place for college
students and call out recent college
grads where they you have to have an edu
email to sign up and all the part-time
jobs the freelance work full-time jobs
well volunteer work I'm sure is on there
a bunch of great assets to really get
that experience make some money when
you're a current college student or a
recent grad so it's definitely a great
way to get your hands dirty a lot of
people are always asking how to get
freelance work how to get part-time work
way up comes the biggest resource for
college students looking for that so
let's kind of show how to do it
a redirect link cuz that's what I was
going to do for myself right now so I
can put it all by you too
in the interests of just full on
disclosure so what we're gonna basically
gonna say is is HTTP quibbling and
that's gonna refresh to this URL here
now this content is a delay so a zero
would be an immediate redirect we're
gonna go ahead and just put five on it
so that you can see that it's actually
gonna redirect to where we want it to go
so where do we want it to go we want it
to go to
ww-why up comm slash refer slash coding
tutorials let's go ahead and save it
it's in our way up dot HTML I'm gonna
hover over this for a second so you can
kind of see if you really zoom in in the
video that were actually it's not
hard-coded we're gonna go ahead and just
click this it's gonna open to a blank
page remember there's nothing in here in
about five seconds it's going to
redirect to where we want it to go to so
nice so now what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to upload this on my personal site
so that might and then I'm gonna get it
approved through there and everything
should go pretty smoothly but that's how
