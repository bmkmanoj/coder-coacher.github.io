interview coming up we're going to be
talking with Andy and Dominic who are
two dead Mountain grads one local
business we actually have their project
so you're looking at one in the
background right now I'm going to go
through before we start we talked about
a lot of good things and in all fairness
like I am sponsored by dead mountain but
I don't think that affected the
interview at all I asked what was the
best part it was the worst part I want
to really give you guys a clear
understanding of what Death Mountain has
to offer before we do that I'm going to
show off the three projects that dominic
and Andy sent me so you guys can kind of
see this first one no it's not Nike it's
clone nike.com
and so uh what's cool about this one is
they actually went and they built this
in ionic if I remember correctly and
it's a copy of Nikes website and you can
kind of go through and see what what
it's all about see their product line
like you can see it's very clean but
probably better than I could make it and
I'm not touching ionic I'd have to learn
ionic light it's a very clean website in
portfolio your portfolio when you're
trying to get a junior level job is
really what you're going to need to get
started the next project they did they
called uh I'm going to get that Dominic
made this called Dom pin as you've seen
in numerous projects that I've made
making code pins and things like that
it's a cone code pin Cologne where he
went and cloned a very interactive
website for you know code pin and then
the final one that was a group project
they made a Google Doc site and these
are at all by the way these aren't like
websites or actual web applications so
everything works on here and all that
sort of stuff so they've been making
lots of very clean very cool websites
but as always guys thank you for
watching the video look forward to a
very in-depth and fun because I keep my
interviews pretty casual interview about
dev Mountain and reviewing dead mountain
coding boot camp I thanks for watching
guys so let's jump into it so recently
both of you were in the dev Mountain was
a full stack development program in in
and what at what court I would city we
were out and Provo and yeah we were
doing a full stack of web or told we can
mrsa of course nice now how long ago did
you both graduate it was pretty recently
right three weeks ago three weeks ago
how how has been what it was since
graduating because my career I've never
gone to a boot camp but I imagine both
you are proactively continuing and
looking for work and studying is that
something that you're both doing right
now
definitely yeah a lot good I got it was
the other I like that yeah but uh so a
while back I did hey I was doing some
research about boot camps and I wanted
to specifically see because I had very
positive opinion I think people who
really work hard can excel at it and the
people that I've seen that we're talking
negatively about boot camps for some
reason thought that when the boot camp
came to an end they were done and they
were and they were like ready to go but
which you can't be ready but like you
have two I think software you continue
your education for like twenty thirty
years so if you think it's over I secure
thirty months you're going to have an
issue yeah um
yeah the thing about that is uh yeah
like a sizing like your other videos
it is a job in itself to get a job but
um yeah definitely a challenge being is
very like there's all been job so what
so have by the way we have a somebody in
chat Gabriel a boy who is a dev Mountain
graduate from Provo specifically Provo
as well got their job had a month of
graduating I have you guys started
looking for work and if so how is that
going for you I've been thrown out a lot
of applications hitting up people on
LinkedIn let's try to connect with
people and definitely applying to a
crept on jobs
so I haven't heard anything too great
yet but I mean it's a process you know
getting a job in itself yeah for me yeah
I got offered a job to work at it coding
boot camp at my university as a either
an instructor or a teacher aide but I
saw I'm not really decided on that I
also that that's interesting because
that's like a a dream job of mine I
haven't talked about that too much but
uh one of the reasons I'm going back to
finish up my bachelor's is because I
would like to be a teacher and something
like that one day that's pretty awesome
so I I do have a weird feeling about
going to boot camps that are ran by
universities specifically because I feel
like I feel like their obligation is to
fix their computer science program so
that information and technologies
programs and not just try to get people
to spend four years and forty thousand
dollars and then another three to six
months and ten thousand dollars on top
of it so what is what do you guys know
that you recent graduate what what would
be some advice for people maybe
considering going to a boot camp like
Deb Mount I would say is do a lot of
Precourt a lot of pre course working you
get there don't be afraid to ask
questions don't be afraid to like make a
little group I guess what I feel like me
and him did really well in the cohort
those who made like a little study group
to like every day after we were
finishing up in class we don't go out to
eat or whatever afterwards and then we
would study up together build apps
little to-do lists whatever I feel like
that was the most beneficial thing that
we did um yeah I agree
just uh yeah just do a lot of practice
it's going to take a lot of time it's
gonna be really frustrating but in the
end it it's all gonna be worth it now do
you think because I one of the things
one of the reasons I really like that
mountain is because they offer the
housing and you're working you're living
with other people in the cohorts do you
think that is a beneficial aspect to
a deaf man has a specific bootcamp and
does that help facilitate the hey we're
all kind of in the same group let's
study let's work on our projects
together oh yeah I was that was huge
literally every single day after the
cohort we would be sitting down studying
until like 1:00 2:00 o'clock in the
morning and then getting up early
together and going right back click
doing it again
I thought that was like the whole
immersive part that you guys are all in
it together and it's like it's really a
boot camp just like military and it was
just yeah the only issue that I have
looked like the housing is that they
need to like pair up people who are in
like the same cohort and like the same
housing just because like usually there
will be a higher cohort rooming with
them like a lower cohort you name it
they're like in the same they call just
like we're together in time while doing
the same courses and stuff I didn't know
that I assumed that they they were all
in the same sort of path or at a point
in time in the program no no at all so
what did you guys and I'm glad you
brought up a moment ago about preparing
for a boot camp because uh the the worst
thing that you can do is go into a boot
camp unprepared because I really think
in that period of time you get out of it
what you put into it so you're going to
be putting in those 80 hour weeks but
you also should be putting in like three
to six months of prep work to go into
there so you can build the best projects
and learn the the more in-depth things
what did you guys do to prepare for
death now I did freako camp
okay I did probably from the beginning
all the way up to what I think it's like
the advanced projects and algorithms I
did probably up to there and then once I
got to there I kind of started making my
own little to-do apps and stuff and then
I went to the cohort yeah I did the
exact same thing
well I start with like coke Adam II and
I wasn't really like I mean it was good
but it was a lot hand-holding and then I
moved to a frico camp and then from
there just watch
like tutorial videos and then yeah
that's the best way to preferably kappa
just practicing practice yeah it's uh
it's all it's always interesting to go
from hey I'm just basically copying code
on code Kadim II and regurgitating it to
how do I actually create something from
scratch I think it's probably when
people start becoming a developer when
they can figure that out what was uh
what was was there like an aha moment
for you guys where you started feeling
like it was clicking like here's like
okay I actually know what it's like I
haven't figured it all out but I know
that I can figure it out I'd say when I
built the weather app on free code camp
that's when I said I can't really
started clicking for me like you're
talking about pre coursework not in the
cohort right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
definitely the web app cause like I was
actually hitting an API I was grabbing
some data and then I was throwing it up
on the screen and that's one like things
were like wow it's like alright
something's actually happening here this
is more than just you know I'm just
throwing like HTML templates on the
screen yeah I feel the exact same way I
seems like he's starting like api's and
start doing it like by yourself like
making those API calls that means like
you really understand it and you just
like mess around the data using like
your own algorithmic skills that you
learned now uh what would be the list
we'll do the best that we'll do the
worst aspect I always think it's uh and
so what was the best part of dev
Mountain for you guys yes like what
would you say was it something in their
program they excelled at or something
that they did surprisingly well or that
you were like this is if you were if you
were trying to sell me on dev Mountain
for instance what would be the one of
the Highlands I really like the mentors
I thought that was really interesting
because it's basically like having like
the best kids from like the last
previous classes what mentors are if you
haven't heard of what their mentor thing
is so what a mentor is basically the
cohort before whoever liked the best
kids
whatever get offered to be like kind of
like a TAS or a teacher in the next
cohort and with those guys in there
I feel like you're like best friends
kind of with the kids it's like the best
in the class you can go up to them you
can hit them with questions and felt
like intimidated because like the
teacher or anything it's just like a kid
that just graduated before you so
they're like they're very knowledgeable
and I thought that was like one of the
best parts it's like you just kind of
hit up this guy and be like hey you know
I'm having problems with this API I
can't figure out how to displays
correctly can you help me out I thought
that was really helpful yeah I think my
favorite part was like the struggle
because a boot camp is like extremely
hard like they move so all the first two
reads was like pretty slow because we're
learning like basically HTML CSS but we
start moving it's like there and like
other frameworks you're like struggling
like with the other students then you
like build like a stronger bond to each
other and then are no and then again
it's just like really sad when you like
say five everyone I don't know that's my
favorite part doesn't struggle really
sure I can appreciate that
that's uh that's that's one of the the
interesting one things that intrigues me
too
like I I have no need to go to boot camp
but I want to go to a boot camp because
of our - like this one I want to dive
into the like let's just code 80 to 100
hours a week and everything else
like that I I really want to go to one
eventually so alright let's go on the
other side of the coin because there's
always even though I think that
mountains very great great program and I
think they're doing great things and
what would be one area that you think
they could probably improve upon I think
they can make the pre-course work a bit
harder and make it a little tougher for
kids because there are definitely some
kids in our cohort that shouldn't have
been there
like there's there are some kids that
just like they should have studied a lot
more I think before they came in because
like they were kind of some kids would
slow down the class because they just
they weren't you know that they were
yeah you know to me like they're asking
like what's a for-loop in like second
week and I was just like I come on man
like you gotta had jizz on some kind of
pre coursework here like you don't just
do that
I said they could have make that better
I feel like those are the type of
individuals who probably aren't
successful in boot camps because they
think that they're just going to go they
got the checkmark and now they're going
to go and get a job well while in
reality it doesn't necessarily work like
that is it prepares you if you're
prepared like it is EDI I know when I to
talk about that specific thing I went to
the iron area which is a boot camp in
Florida and on the East Coast but I was
there for something and there is a guy
in a cohort there and the it was like
Friday and on Monday they were supposed
to start react and I learned this after
helping him with a for loop for some
first generating like a random number
basically so play not nothing super
complex and I was like you're starting
react on Monday and you don't understand
where this so in that category you don't
prepare yourself it's going to be very
hard for you to excel at 100%
what about you and you always one area
that you think that perhaps they could
improve upon hmm I wish when I came
there they updated their curriculum to
more like modern framework that everyone
like that every other company is using
just cuz like we when they're studying
angler for like what like three weeks or
two weeks and who searched for two or
three wishes and the jobs and Utah uh
when I'm Domon by other friends that
went to the job fair there every one of
the job fair was only asking for react
and all we knew was angler we're just
like pros antler but yeah I wish they
just up there at their curriculum which
I mean they did now they didn't now it
is hard to keep up with the web dead
thing I'm like I'm sure building a
curriculum tough but still yeah I would
say the same with
what Andy just said - because but right
now I got finally react to be a little
bit easier there's not many people
nowadays that know gay now
so three learning angularjs are you
learning angular 2 plus just angular one
boy one far oh yeah yeah that that's a
little bit rough because I'm an
angularjs developer at work and I
recently started studying angular 2 I
can understand why they not teaching
angular 2 because it's a it's a hard
thing to grasp but uh I like angular 2
it I've been planar I think I graduated
I reacted so much better that I want to
I actually make ads of it it makes a lot
of sense now if we get to Redux now do
you feel for now having gone through a
program and worked with a framework like
angular would you say that you both are
prepared to go in learn react on your
own with you know additional resources
and stuff like that oh definitely
definitely I've got at least got put in
time I mean particularly uh I kind of
picked angular 2 and Thai script that's
what I'm learning right now instead of
kind of going a little bit harder and
react I mean I've done some react stuff
but I don't like angular beds and react
to be honest so that's just kind of wrap
go into is like angular 2 and typescript
yeah I touched on or in the bootcamp we
touched on react for about like two days
and I don't I really enjoy react on how
like the components work and yeah it's a
really fun framework to work with even
though like the learning curve is that
the learning curve is like really high
up there yes
it's an interesting place for frameworks
right now because I I'm in the process
of trying to add angular 4 and react and
more cool and I I what I've discovered
is that I can only at at this point in
time I need to choose one that and I
can't do both at the same time so I put
dome into angular for at but I've spent
probably about two weeks on each or a
week on one and two weeks on react and
what I what I basically discovered is
that those specific
frameworks are
so are actively evolving - they're very
quickly that it's going to be almost
impossible that I think that by the time
the three months is up I feel like
there's gonna be a new version of
angular out and a new version of react
yes but if you're able to if you're able
to get those skills and build projects
in it and it sounds like that's what you
guys are doing I would imagine you're
not going to have any problem lending a
job do I say the same thing it's like
any other two plus or react I see a lot
of react for ducks react native sorry
are you doing touch kick - I'm curious
so I started with angular two last two
days literally okay but I'm doing it in
typescript I'm working I have like
another one the last section of the
angular for a theorem for four point two
right now and I'm doing it in typescript
I don't fully understand typescript yet
like I understand it because of in the
sense of defining objects but because
I'm using their QuickStart guide I need
to essentially build my own project so
after today I'm sorry I'm gonna start
building some YouTube YouTube tools that
I want to build as a project and add
that to my portfolio using angular for
so that's the game plan and when I do
that I was before I start that I'll take
a like a watch a one-hour typescript
video and get going cuz there's not that
much to learn with types of your
messages about understanding the setup
for it and how to get going yeah I
really like the intellisense thing
though like on your editor have you seen
any videos about that kind of like if
you are like merge a fought like import
file into another file it'll just give
you like a list of all that files like
so you start typing and just kind of
like toggle down to whatever file you
want to import it and it does that with
the functions whenever you make a
function you want to input in the
function into a new file and start
typing just comes right up on the screen
that's like my favorite part about such
good yeah it's uh and it goes kind of
good the talking about types trick is it
kind of goes to the just adding to a
little bit of a difficulty with like as
if angular 2 plus wasn't going to be
hard enough let's just add in sort of a
new barrier of entry but at the same
if you're able to master you know
angular2 and react and all these
libraries that you know there's a reason
that you know you can graduate free 3
month boot camp and then go and get a
job for six-figure sometimes it's
because you go and you gain the art
skills that they want for sure yeah
there was there's a as one kid in my
class that he just killed it throughout
the entire cohort man the kid had a job
for weed and we're finished
yeah a I'd offers crime in the dorm and
he was he just murdered it yeah and I
bet he's like 15 like I know the older
side I was like nah I I just I always
feel like those guys to kill it I like
we've been Conan since they're like five
and then you're over there like oh man I
got like children that are older than
you like who's going on here you know
who's weird on the people like the
friends that we made in the boot camp
like barely had any coding spirits and
at the end they were they like I guess
their brains got it and they just
understood how like data flow works
between api's and I don't know it was
crazy
like I was teaching this guy how to do
angular and then now he's like way
better than the at is are not so I was
pretty impressive how many hours a week
were you guys putting in because
sometimes people think that they're
going to go in there and put in you know
30 hours a week and it's those are the
people are unsuccessful realistically
how many hours were you actually
studying and working and going class all
right so what every day you're there
from 9:00 to 5:00 and then I say we
would go home we take a break for a
couple hours like probably two three
hours we just chill out
yeah and then we start coding again and
probably like nine o'clock yeah we were
up pretty late everyday probably not the
best idea but whatever so we so we
started coding again at probably nine
and then probably coding to like one or
two in the morning again so what is that
twenty-four
five hours a day times five times a week
25 plus another weekend do either
weakest we went hard oh yeah we can yeah
we really hard on the weekend I think
Sunday I think I put in the most daily
hours for that Sunday mm-hmm
as just thousands about a week we're
kind of just running it out say you want
to put it like on top of your course
work another 50 hours per week I would
say so moving moving forward with you
guys being recent grads what is the game
plan what what do you what do you guys
what what is the game plan to go from a
grad to is it to land that internship
and then see where you're at is it to
just try and go for that full-time
salary role what what how what is the
game plan on how do you both plan on
executing so is what I'm cavalry yeah
going are you go okay
so Dan plan is try to get what you can
encode it as in like so for me I had an
option to be a teacher aide or an
instructor at a coding bootcamp so I am
going to take the jobs just so I have
experience with it and then find a real
job while I'm you know teaching kids how
to code I think that's a good choice
because I think so as you're doing that
you'll you'll get much better just
regurgitating the content but it also
gives you time to better your skill set
build up a portfolio and learn new
things so I think it's probably a great
choice right I'm going straight to the
job I have I applied for a couple
internships but I wouldn't be as happy
if I got an internship I would much
rather just get a job right off the bat
but I mean I'm just I apply apply no
it's not easy
yeah I hear you I know when before I
landed uh my current role and I had a
little bit experience but nothing as the
developer and yeah I probably filled out
500 applications and got calls back on
maybe 10 20 damn okay I'm like 35 let me
know yeah
yeah I was I was falling okay I was
willing to relocate so I don't know if
you guys are willing to relocate that so
I think that's an option that that
really except that helps you in the long
run because you're open to more jobs and
you're playing in regions that perhaps
have less competition which was what
ended up being my strength is I was able
to once I started applying outside of
the Los Angeles area
I started getting called backs left and
right and I probably filled out I would
say 25 apps today and and so I don't
know if but my suggestion is if you are
open to relocating you may land that job
much sooner than then you would expect
true Mac I just got a new apartment so
I'm not trying to business minimum if
I'm not trying to relocate clear are ya
any questions for people and chef let's
start typing them out
Oh anything I don't think you guys
wanted to to share about your experience
that we didn't cover something now hmm
make projects before you go there don't
don't just do tutorials don't just look
at the tutorial and watch the tutorial
code like don't just like watch people
code like legit make like if you're
watching like so if you're watching
doing make a weather app you make a
weather app as he's making the weather
app I don't just sit there and just like
oh I listen API oh that's interesting
no code with it you know what I mean I
think that was that's a huge thing when
you Chandler yeah
yeah just make projects I know that's
like a repeated thing to say but it
works you learn a lot by make your own
projects you know it also on that
sentiment it's one of the number one
things I tell people to not only will it
you help not only will you learn but in
terms of being practical of getting
hired all you have to show on your
resume at the end of the day is what
you've built to prove that you're a
developer right because you have to
resume experience you can't like no one
paid you for years to do this so what
what you can do is say hey look at what
I built these are the skills I have so
it's a great thing in a more practical
sense as well all right what now what
did you what concepts did you learn at
the boot camp and a lot of this stuff
you can learn online through resources
but was there a specific concept that
you were glad you had an instructor for
that that maybe you thought you know it
meant if this guy wasn't here this girl
wasn't here this would be a grind to
learn say note a notes notes have
difficulty addressed note was part of
the hardest thing also react to but yet
with an instructor for no they explained
it so well that yeah it just it works
out click note alright I think so I
think that's pretty much it is there any
any places I don't know if you guys are
doing any social media self or have any
projects you want to promote penguin
house design
well what's payment house design alright
so when we were wearing a cohort
together we got that we made like a
pretty solid friend group with like four
kids and we're just like seeing if we
could take it somewhere you know Chuck's
just are like a little freelancing
business something we thought that'd be
pretty dope but we're we're to try to
find some leads but I know haven't
gotten a lot too many calls back yet but
we actually set up we had a meeting with
the guy in the whole nine yards we just
we've got to give him the son contract
start working but we thought it's kind
of like a dream avoid like a far-fetched
dream but I think we could do it hey I
encourage everyone chase their dreams
man I know a lot of people get into
software because they're attracted to
the digital nomad lifestyle sort of
thing and that's the dream in itself so
I hope that works out for you yeah it's
kind of like a fun guy thing we're doing
yeah hopefully
we'll make it alright well good luck to
you guys I know I know it's uh you're
out there looking and improving and it
sounds like you're doing all the right
things so I want thank you for for
reaching out and being able to talk
about your experience at does not sure
about I guess Pat McMahon I figured well
guys and good luck okay alright guys so
that was our interview with with our two
deaf mountain grats we covered a lot of
stuff and it sounds like one is
graduating and is graduating and going
to be an instructor at a coding bootcamp
and Dominic is still looking for work I
I imagine he seems to be doing all the
right things I would imagine that he
will be probably successful I mind you
it's only been three weeks since he's
graduated so I would imagine if he's
getting calls back even though they're
few and he's only filled out 35 apps
they will continue to roll in and he
will continue to get better and move
forward so it's only a matter of time
but as always guys thank you so much for
watching don't forget to join our
Facebook group Co tech and caffeine and
if you want to support me you can
attention comm / connect artists 360 I
hope you also motivated LPL today
