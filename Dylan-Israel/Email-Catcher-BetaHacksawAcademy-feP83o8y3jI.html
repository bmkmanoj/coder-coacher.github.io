back in beta hacksaw Academy one project
that really caught my eye was this email
catcher the reason it caught my eye was
this is some functionality that i'm
going to add to my website coding
tutorials 360.com in the future I'm just
keep tracking email so I thought hey
let's dive in here and see what's going
on here so the first section is
submitting an email form just going to
go into a little bit of detail here this
is our example that we're going to be
working with now in robot form robot
squirrels all right let's see if this
will take us to what we're actually
building so we're basically going to add
this and then it's going to sound like
go to a database so let's go ahead and
do this first section real quick so
you're going to want to have basic HTML
knowledge is what the base the first
page here was saying so the form element
the form element it's a form using a
channel quite a bit method here is post
basically to send data let's go ahead
and copy this over and the action here
it's already include that it's your
endpoint essentially or your API so like
when you send data you have a location
it's going to send similar when you get
data you put in the URL same thing with
our action here so let's go ahead and
where do we cell phone ago enter the
following code into the joint list
inputs so we're gonna go ahead and put
this in here let's go to rerun this
don't force anything we haven't put
anything in there now if we're going to
get input from something we need
something to do it the format should
think of it it's like a form div almost
at which when you finally do submit it
that that's where the inputs are Ganga
so what is it that we want to add we
want to add an input an input is
basically a text box so if you remember
earlier we have the text box that's
basically what it is
and the placeholder is the default value
it goes away you see when I put
something in there the class this is a
CSS thing name this is to use it later
if we need to target it but let's go
ahead and copy this CSS so I'll do a
quick rundown of what the CSS actually
does so border that's going to be the
border around this background dash color
RGB a so red green blue and then opacity
I forget alpha alpha is what it is so to
make it slightly see through as we have
here we have border radius to make the
corners curved a little bit a little bit
of padding so that everything is not
stretched together the color of the font
which is white as you can see and then
we have the font size and then the width
of the box that's basically what's going
on there in the padding excuse me um
allergies man so to change the colors of
the cs CSS file so a lot of times you
want things to be noticeable when you
change it or they also want to outline
of none right here so let's go ahead and
copy that excuse me sorry guys um so
we're gonna put that in our input email
selector here sorry go ahead and throw
that in there add the outline so you see
how it's not highlighted anymore when we
do that line none oh my goodness ah what
is going on hope I'm not getting sick so
we have this input email and then the
focus property right so when you
basically click this or your focus on it
your mouse is interacting with it do
some stuff to it so let's go and add
that as well and we're gonna add a
border and we're gonna add a background
color so see now it lights up right whew
give me a sneezing video or something so
basically what we're doing is we're
making that when we select this it
changed the styling of it that's all
that's going on
here and then we can add a transition
property to the email input selector
just so that things look like they're
going a little a little bit smoother and
this is oh my god I was going on so
you'll see that it takes half a second
or so to transition that's all alright
so now we want to go ahead and create a
notify me button now remember how we had
this method post we need something to
send that so let's go ahead and copy
this into here real quick explain what's
going on before I sneeze one more time
oh my god um so we have our CSS class
then we have a type submit this is
basically going to send the data we have
in our form right here which is notify
me right now it's going to send it to
our endpoint oh man uh so we're gonna
add some styling here let's see here so
a lot it right a boat and you'll see we
get this nice little see-through button
again it's similar styling as before
because we wanted to link up nicely
we've added a background color gray a
little bit see-through some font size so
its meshes very nice that's good styling
to have in general is say if you're
going to have two things that are
similar if this one is input in this is
the sudden it but you want them to look
like look like look like so next what
we're going to add is our pseudo class
here hover which we did before before we
did aw focus hover is slightly different
it's where when you hover over it right
so you see now when we click on this
this is focus when we hover over this a
button there's nothing to input right
for a button so you want to hover over
it to show that it's got no it's really
happened here is we just increase the
background color so that it's not as
see-through that's all I'm going to do
the active
this is another thing so you can have
multiple pseudo classes on here so we
have active and we're just going to add
a little bit of a box shadow so it's a
little hard to see but basically so you
see that we got our realm but when we
click this c1 if I hold down may be hard
to see in the video it adds a little bit
of a shadow it's a box shadow it's like
a 3d effect almost so you did that and
so now when we submit the form we're
gonna it's going to go ahead and send
our data so right now yeah we didn't get
a success because we haven't set it up
yet problem you know and they want us to
it but that's what we'll be covering in
the next video really things to take
away from this is that the form the
method is post or get depending on what
you're trying to do in our example we're
trying to send data center emails to
this action or the endpoint here we have
an input which is the data we haven't
actually done anything with this yet and
then we have a button to send it so the
type submit tells this method to go
ahead and run at this location but as
