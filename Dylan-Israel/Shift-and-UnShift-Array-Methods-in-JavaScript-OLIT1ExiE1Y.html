be going over the shift method with
dealing erase and unshipped method and
how to use them so that when you're
trying to solve you problems it'll be a
little bit easier so let's get started
alright guys so let's go ahead and get
started with the shift and unshift so if
you're not familiar with what shift does
let's start off by creating a basic
array of numbers we'll just go 1 2 3 so
we'll create a alright alright this will
be equal to 1 2 3 so shift is a built-in
method that allows us to remove the
first element of our array and not only
does it do that it actually will shift
index spots on the other ones so if we
were to call on this one we'll call
array dot shift what would now be the
output of the array or what the array
would contain rather would be the
numbers 2 &amp;amp; 3 1 would have been deleted
from it and the index values for this
would now be 0 &amp;amp; 1 so everything would
have shifted to the left 1 so what about
unshipped how does unshifted dealing
with unshifted shift is the exact
opposite it is a matter of shifting on
shifting is the word they use but I'm
still shifting if you look at me a new
spot in our array so in this case we're
actually going to put a number back into
the array starting at the first value
and then it will then shift it all the
others to the right so let's go ahead
and call our right dot on shift and
we'll just go ahead and put the number
11 in there for whatever reason and then
now what's going to happen is our output
would be 11 2 3 and the index locations
would still be 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 so you'll notice
that this 0 now is 1
and this one index spot is now 2 because
we have unshifted it so that's basically
I've shift and unshift works and keep in
mind that when you're doing this since
you can also store it in variables for
any reason that you may need it with
solving your problems so hope you guys
found this helpful
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
