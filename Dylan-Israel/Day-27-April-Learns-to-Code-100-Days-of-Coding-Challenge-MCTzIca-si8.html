Oh
just a little different
hmm PACA see yeah we're about to a
procedure in session in a second in
about 20 minutes but I just want to log
on I don't know man I've tried so the
thing right now with me at least is I'm
trying to build a ton of content because
nights off and welcome in welcome
welcome so try to build a lot of content
right now that I plan on releasing on
YouTube I also plan on releasing on on
that's part of my course in a certain
way or another I'm not quite sure I've
been working out how I might release the
content on YouTube and how I might do
the same thing on the course so I'm
fully figured it out but here we are
studying and doing it and all that sort
of stuff
I was everybody done today also I have
you here if there's any topic so I've
been stockpiling topics to talk about
those you watch my videos I've been
doing a lot of these sort of advice
oriented advice oriented videos where I
like to go in and talk about life
experience and things like that
that I think will benefit you but I
always am curious what people would want
me to talk about so I've been stock
finding that we're going to course on
networking and system matter that's good
man that's the thing guys as long as
every day or every other day for those
of you people are a little less
motivated you're working towards
something I think I think that will be
exactly what you need to do who probably
is a lot of people don't work towards
something the guy not about you man but
like when I decided to three years ago
that is going to work towards a certain
goal and I was going to kind of start
taking my own advice I I don't know if
I've ever been happier as I say it's
easy
a lot of things aren't easy but a lot of
things are hard but you really do need
to work towards something on the daily
thing we have to think we're going to
change this just ring a big deal
what's every single day working every
single day Lucar
ohh ooh gah ARMA armor gone apologetics
what if I butchered that man trying my
best here
I managed to new level dope that's the
thing like I talked about my goals and
my dreams maybe I should do a video
about that Oh
slate
I think a lot of people need to have
them and unfortunately a lot of people
aren't I don't know what they should be
or not explain Paul Stanley have a good
one man you have a good night to Luger
like uber but God
Oh
should a piece my scab just hang it on
right now boys my finger yeah I think
it's a good thing but as I say so I
haven't been releasing too many videos
of those because we're moving in 10 days
and I have a whole new office setup and
a green screen and all this sort of
stuff and I really want to take up the
production quality a bit

stay on there I had a band a to cover
this up before we continue on sorry
about this guys
here's a question for you guys um I
would like an answer for this because I
don't I don't know what the answer is
one of my goals speaking of goals is I
am I am
I'm always looking for ways to improve
my channel
unfortunately I make so little money
that I can't put a ton of production
quality into it from YouTube and so I I
just try to give personality I guess I
shot I tried to give you me and it
smells raw and unfiltered way possible
but for me I ramble and I reiterate and
so some for some that might be if we
were to talk about goals and dreams and
stuff like that for me that's a 20
minute video for others in maybe 5
minutes because they're going to say hey
these are step 1 step 2 step 3 but I
like to sort of paint the picture along
the way of why that's my goal in dreams
and how I hope to accomplish them and
not so cut and paste what what do you
guys prefer do you guys prefer that I
kind of cut down the time and have these
sort of shorter videos I'm just curious
anyhow uh and children have got n pieces
of candy they want you as much as I can
but you shot unless you get exactly the
same amount of candy as the other cha
okay so the children
this child was candy
so 10 pieces we nine two pieces we - all
right so what we'll do here is we'll say
var and e equals M divided by n and then
we'll go ahead and share is it float not
that round I thank you so I'm looking
for um but up because i i i I personally
think the number one way to because if
the other day what you really are trying
to build is so sort of subscriber fan
base you're trying to build someone who
wants to see you succeed and who at the
end of the day wants wants that person
to that they want that once the the
YouTuber to not only put out the content
that they're putting out but also put it
out in their own way and for me it's
always painting a big picture that's why
when I talk about these things like 20
minute videos 10 minute videos because I
I think the I think the most disservice
a lot of people get and sometimes you
can give people a good advice or bad
advice and they just won't take it I
think the biggest of service is giving
advice and not explaining it
as well as they down here the game plan
was to divide this then around it and
then times it I think that was what I
was trying to do here
so 10 children 5 candies Oh figure has
this backwards no no so 5 candies
anything under 15 minutes should be good
that's the thing man that is I always
kind of envision these sort of like
that's why the interviews are like an
hour long because III envision them more
as podcasts and these being a short
little 20 minute podcast about whatever
so I don't know what I don't know
oh I didn't mean to do Matt that round I
meant to do math dog floor there we go
got a chance to work in the training
site trainee side of what
got a chance to work in the tree in the
training site would it show up further
for the course a little bit confusing
what you're asking Jordan so see here
so your friend advised you see new
performance in those 50 likes day during
city you knows a little hard well it may
probably is your shyness you're afraid
you'll end up blocking the view even if
only for a couple of seconds all the
people should be I'm Ewing in your
column to get encouraged recited
calculate a number of each people and
see if you can possibly make it to exit
without disturbing too many people given
the total rows and columns in the
theater and the wrong column you're
sitting and return the number where
people sit strictly behind you and in
your column to the left
for cause
what the is this asking
alright so half the problem with these
algorithms is sometimes it's like what
are you asking just tell me
explain to me what is going on here
we have the number of columns and number
rows all right and we're in row five
three okay
and we're saying
how many people are behind us
all right let's but I think we have to
look at the calculator I'm sorry put
this together I just gotta figure out
forget the pseudocode for a second I
have to see if I understand I just
changed a simple math so 11 so you guys
just a little bit 11 here and so we're
in wrote actually we'll start with the
row so here we have we're in Row 3 we're
going to go one two one two three one
two three
call five one two three four five
all right
now we're saying
so there's a difference of eight times a
difference of eleven but in reality
you're probably counting your other row
so what's up plus eight okay I see how
they got to 96
waffle strings how's it going um so okay
I kind of understand what they're asking
now um so lugar our McGann do you
recommend live-streaming coding sessions
kind of like you're doing does this help
you brighten up since coding can be such
a lonely experience um I don't know man
I only did it after I started working as
a developer and it's because I'm really
pushing myself and I code pretty much
every day at work and I code pretty much
every day after work and every day on
the weekends and I don't know man I its
distract lately but this way is am i
doing better code because you guys are
here probably not but am i coding
because you're here yes um so if it gets
you to code more do it that would be
that would be my response for that um
how don't I get burnt out um there's
been times where I get burnt out meetups
are great as well you are I am they're
better for networking I would say
anything else um how did I get burnt out
I I'm very aware when I do get burnt out
or I'm getting burnt out and I have to I
have to pace myself I don't know man I
liquid this way I'm more worried about
being homeless than I am um getting
burnt out so it's just like if you look
at it like that you just put power
through it a decade gets just to work on
the training course I the coders course
yeah I so this is part of it right now
like you guys see me work on this sort
of stuff I'm going to be doing these
algorithms to promote it and whatnot but
um I'm not recording any of the like
introductory sections of JavaScript HTML
CSS jQuery angular all that sort of
stuff and the projects for that yet
until I move because I have the group um
when I move I'll have a slightly bigger
office and on top of it what I'll be
doing is what I'll be doing is I'll set
the green screen up it's not even going
to be a green screen I'm actually going
to I ordered some special paint going to
paint the the wall green I got some desk
attachments so I can get four monitors
on here I have some some other things as
well power strip connectors and and cord
so I'm gonna say I'm setting up my whole
office and I got three new lights for
the lights and we're also going to get a
4k webcam for it so I'm kind of waiting
so that until I can have a because I
want if I'm making the core so it's
going to be a 4k I got the 4k monitors
now but I want the green screen and when
I tried to set up the the actual screen
it said the
the wall it wasn't coming out as great
as I wanted it to so what we're doing
right now is kind of like a lot of prep
work um in the last week I've solved
I know 15 16 algorithms and we're
continuing on that trend I'm debating
how I want to do this I the heart see
here here's thing guys is I'm trying to
decide how to teach people to get better
at algorithms and I think the only thing
you can do really is I mean you can tell
them a couple things like you know you
look back there
we got whiteboards and stuff like that
you draw it out visualize it look up
documentation but I think the best thing
that you could do is really have
somebody sit you down explain to you the
problem see them draw it out and then
and then fully understand the solution
as it's typed out and so I'll be using
and and the reason I'm using sites like
like code fights is one because when you
do if I were to create a problem an
algorithm myself I think it would take a
lot more time but also because there's
so many crazy use cases in here I think
it'll be much more convincing instead of
just hard coding things and so it makes
it a little bit harder it's easier for
you to follow along you can go on here
and so there's gonna be things like that
in here and how I'm going to use code
fights into that I don't know yet I'm
playing with this idea of doing every
other on here or maybe doing the first
section or two on YouTube and then but
that's only one part of the course so I
may just release all of it and just use
those promotional material for my course
policy but right now it's just prep work
I there's a lot of prep work going in
you know creating resources digital
whiteboard yet so there's pins you can
get where you essentially concede on
your screen you're drawing out notes and
things and like a like a digital
whiteboard and that's going to be
something that I'll be using for the
course as well
anyhow right new pseudocode and stuff
like that okay so I think I understood
what was being asked here so first we
have to find out do you think it's
better than code horse so the reason
let's get a code words real quick um the
reason that I decided to stick with code
fights is pretty pretty straightforward
I think there's so much going on with I
think there's a little bit too much
going on with code Wars I don't really
like the layout for one I think it's
kind of overly overly complex second
second
there's so many of these things that I
think I think what it will happen I
think is that it may be hard like if I'm
going to put something out onto YouTube
for instance I need there to be a clear
path so that like free code camps great
you have the path you have the videos
each section code Wars doesn't really
feel like that but here you see you have
a couple and so I'll have the arcade
path and microwork anon intro and now
I'm doing a core just because arcades
starting to get hard so I'm just kind of
switching it up because I've been doing
this for a week get a little burnt out
for Alyssa 200 big I keep going what
program do you use to make streaming
video layout like this I use a
combination of OBS and restream restream
for the chat and to stream on twitch and
YouTube at the same time all this or so
so now all we're doing here um so let's
a bar called if equals and calls
oh and we'll save if he goes and goes
and then we'll say
old if I think I think I have to think
what I have to do here is a add one so I
did to get my 96 so here we have 88 so
doesn't matter which only at one two I
guess
yes it does maybe just call
there we go
here's a question for you guys asked
friend of mine how much money she's
making as a developer and she didn't
feel comfortable telling me is that
strange am i strange for asking is that
strange that she doesn't feel
comfortable for me telling me
potato chips what's going on
four plus four equals eight all day baby
all day
but this let me lit so I get what you're
saying Ryan but as someone who as
someone who helped tutor her for that
role and as somebody who is in the same
industry so to ask a professional say
hey in case I were to ever go back down
to Los Angeles what does an angular
developer get paid and also I think it's
better to talk about these things openly
but
I got all the sample tests on make
consecutive array to challenge but I
could only get three out of five of the
hidden tests I don't know come on in
baby are you ready
you got a blank on
we can take the camera down take the
camera down take it down I can't take
this one down this one
I can't see is well they can see us here
I'm just sayin on the on the screen I
think damn so what I don't think that I
were on no no no no like the webcam
isn't on the page you see selects see if
I were to add it back
alright so 30 minutes so we got our to
go okay cool um so do you think here's a
question for you before we get started
here remember how I was tutoring not
tutoring but I was giving a rundown to
my friend in LA over angular the other
night when we came back from the
hackathon she got the job um and I I
said nice Congrats what what are you
getting paid is that a weird question at
cuz like to me I wanted to know I say
cool what's an angularjs developer going
for in LA and like what what do you get
like what are you getting paid so I can
just have a reference I'm always curious
when people are getting paid cuz that
would use that door I said well she said
back to me um she said something like I
really want to tell you question mark oh
my god I shouldn't want to say I think
that maybe there's a few social markers
to that one she could
in an environment we're talking about
your money is acceptable like where
where I come from my family you don't
talk about money you don't bring it up
nothing like you don't even touch the
stuff
so that could be it or - um if I had
asked it could have been in a different
circumstance because I'm in her shoes um
or it's like if a guy asked me how much
I'd make I'd be like but you saw it's
also on a random it I literally spent
and I was kind of true because like
let's say if one of my guy friends asked
me oh how much you make and I'd be like
I don't know like 24 like if you asked
me hey hey Dylan can you help me prepare
for this angularjs interview and then
you say oh I you text someone you say oh
I got the job yeah it's maybe it could
be what world is saying like three it's
not so much any of those factors other
than that person is just being
completely weird about it so I mean it
could be a number of factors and if you
wanted to know the truth you would just
have to ask or just be like hey is that
like a personal thing or no I don't care
I just wanna know if that's cuz i-i've
very openly talked about money and I
know and it's so weird for me but
I think it's very empowering I think a
lot of people have issues with money I
think it is I also agree I think it what
the problem is is it helped me a lot
with hearing you talk about money so
much and talk about like our past and
how much we're making is embarrassing
like hearing it it's embarrassing but at
the same time I I'm telling myself but
it's okay because it's just money and
that shouldn't be a secret and I
shouldn't feel ashamed for myself for
that or even brain even if I was making
like one hundred and fifty thousand and
you talked about that I would still feel
that inch of shame like you just don't
talk about it period but I mean that's
just from my past so I mean I understand
where you're coming from and I
absolutely agree so I don't think that
it should be something that people are
afraid to talk about I think it should
be something that we
about more because money is definitely
an issue in our society currently yeah I
don't know I always this first thing I
talk about with recruiters they ask that
is actually now the first thing I talk
about when I'm in interviewing like I
make it a point to it for it to be
either my first second or third question
just because you have really instilled
in me and inspired me to be able to talk
about those things but prior to you I
would never talk about it I would just
accept whatever it was that they would
give me and I would accept that and if I
wanted a raise I would strive to show
them that I deserved a raise but never
ask for a raise yeah and but this is
activist world Zia saying people having
issues with money hurts everybody and if
it's used specifically because your boss
isn't going to give you a $10,000 raise
just because you work harder most of the
time you're going to have to go and
you're gonna have to ask and explain and
you feel comfortable talking about money
which is why we're recruiters they ask
me because they asked me saying what is
your salary expectations $10,000 more
than makin now this is why you know Plus
anyhow so that's off topic sort of it's
important because you're gonna you're
going to be up in that grind so for some
reason we're dropping frames or internet
sensation I got a no-brainer that's
better at where we're going um you could
just tell her they hate what I'm not
telling her I said I told that all I
text her back I don't know she's I said
hey I was just curious what you're
making yeah but you should just say my
girlfriend is going into that category
and I would really want to give her a
respectable you know area to shoot for
or not even that but the thing is is
like it's important I think it is
important to know how
she's making because even she could she
could me you know you could tell her and
be like hey well you know you're doing
that you should try for this much or so
before we get started I'll ask joggins
Matt Matt SiC says hey done which
JavaScript design patterns do you use so
with the development that I use at work
we don't really worry about design too
much the reason for it is we are
building software for government
agencies so they have to be ik9
compatible which eliminates a lot of
stuff it eliminates es6 eliminates a lot
of cs3 and so in terms of design we
literally are just using bootstrap and
it's it's very annulled
it's very cut and dry it's not the
prettiest thing because it can't be the
prettiest thing I guess is what I'm
trying to say Oh BAM let's let's get
started so what did you do today I can
tell you that I am an expert in writing
alerts yeah and I brushed up on my
variable skills okay so what is a light
dude an alert calls a can either like
bring up a pop box where you have like
where you've written in the parenthesis
what you wanted to say or you can call a
variable and have it print out the
string or whatever the value is good um
let's talk let's do a quick verbal
review
um and let me so variables how would we
create a variable I would hold on a sec
hey Livy I totally agree being around my
boyfriend has helped me to be much more
direct with communication than how I
used to be and I didn't really know that
I was like that till I hung around Dylan
he's like why are you like that and it's
like wow I cannot believe how different
I am in my communication without even
realizing it so I agree it does throw
people off and I get reactions both for
men and women like whoa like you are
very direct and I like that and it's
crazy that people like that but we're
not raised like that really so anyways
that what I thought that was good say um
where is a create a variable create a
variable bar my pet camel face equals
cat in parentheses are in quotes and you
would end that with a big one John
Dean's going to start 108 challenge now
as I finished my degrees crazy how much
more I enjoyed Cody went out of a
college environment I'm with you man I
hated college I think about it going
back all the time but also at the same
time not when he's from the money I
remember how miserable I was throughout
all of it so yeah I definitely enjoyed
software development and web development
and all that much more once I was out so
I encourage you to start your side
project a big side project with the goal
of making money with it um so I am okay
so let's continue on with our algorithm
scripting
this time we're actually going to swap
seats okay
so you're gonna take the keyboard I'm
gonna stand up and you are going to
aisle all any questions you have feel
free to you're gonna stand agree you're
gonna sit right here I I'll go crazy if
I just sit so I'm gonna be right here
yeah you want the good chair all right
so my hanging up Lina swing good so
you're going what we're going to do is
start with the we've done the first
three algorithms you're going to see if
you can resolve them okay on your own
okay try to try to narrate your thought
process if you can because it will help
you retain it and help people who are
watching understand as well and if you
have a thought process that's incorrect
I will correct you okay that's gonna be
difficult
okay after you write a line of code
explain why you wrote that line of code
okay I can do that
[Laughter]
when I is equal to Celsius
five plus 32 okay
for return paranoid / - okay
that should be written
okay now explain what you did and why um
okay so for converting Fahrenheit to
Celsius it says that your function is
convert - and your parameter your
Celsius so inside of your block your
function block you have your variable
Fahrenheit that they've already put in
there for you and you have to say that
this Fahrenheit is equal to the
parameter argument of the convert to 30
degrees Celsius in order for that to be
run correctly or to be fahrenheits
like degree or answer it would have to
be the Celsius plus the was I called
math that would go along with changing
the parameter or argument the argument
not war the argument to the correct
Fahrenheit degree okay that's very long
word in answer it seems like you know
what you're talking about actual else
move on to the next one close your eyes
real quick so I think I have to reset it
okay
I don't get your dirty earth on my face
so let's continue on with this next
algorithm okay pull a reverse the
provided string of this one you may need
to turn the string into an array before
you can reverse it oh I hate this one
no result your result must be a string
remarried to use are you good okay
hey ma'am
I hate this one we return straight
okay
so I think that hold on okay let's see
if I create a variable
new typing with that Thanks
I hope I can do this before I know uh I
just I feel so off today okay
why do I want to write bar why do I want
to give a variable to this variable I
gave a variable I already have an
argument a string I need to write this
string backwards I need it to be an
array oh maybe that's why I need to make
a variable okay um is it still now
that's right
oops
we can't heart cut this oh right okay so
now that I have an array how do I get
closer variable so what are you trying
to do here well I am now trying to
access my array backwards so I have to
access my array backwards so I can do a
for loop
okay I got a right the iterator solace
I'm gonna stop you
cuz the what you're doing right now
doesn't make much sense with putting
your string into an array why are you
putting in your string into an array
because as I can you need to turn the
string into an array not add the string
to an array oh do you remember how to do
that no okay so you need to go
documentation hunting so you need to
type in how to turn a string
into an array JavaScript you know find
an example and look through the
documentation
what's moon typing uh I think they meant
no one typing question work uh okay
let's see far string are you far are you
doing today that does let's see it
string dot split no I really doesn't
make any sense so I would advise you to
follow w3 schools most of the time when
you're getting started
yeah but it's not doing what I asked
look at it no I don't want to that's you
should look at it
right now scroll down see if there is an
example try it for yourself click the
try it for yourself
all right now
this is a click try it click the button
display the array value can see the code
off to the side so you know it's using
split function we've never used this
live function we have use the split
function we've used it on this one what
yeah we have not said dot split a
hundred and twenty percent no no you
know how all this on video all right no
way
I only this
are you gonna marry what just sit like
controlling you're in the wrong thing
now right here go to the mat that's like
reverse tree
well sorry first a string
theory of your cash fresh fish
very easily
which is so rewrite this function said
do the setup again read by him why did
you delete all of it because that was or
something else you're randomly hitting
ctrl Z so now mess with the page but
before you even do that you need to
understand the split function actually I
click reso that's better idea I don't
even so you're doing you wait what
you're doing right now it's the number
one thing that happens for people who
don't understand how to do research
you're looking for something and you're
not even reading what it does like you
did not even read we we googled how to
turn a string into an array the number
one result you didn't spend 30 seconds
looking at what it even says it does in
30 seconds
so what does it do did you read it well
I didn't understand what I read your eat
 I didn't read it
so what's this a this blunt method is
you to split a string into an array of
sub strings and returns the new array so
what does that mean it splits my strain
okay so when we go to test it out now
let's so our string is what are you
doing today and we click try it to see
the result you see it returns as a comb
with all of it broken up and we're
splitting it by certain values right
here in this case it's a space I want to
see the video because I do not remember
using split dot split no way
okay maybe we maybe we do something else
but I'm pretty sure really we did not
okay well it doesn't matter but you want
your new Tanya we dated aren't me trying
to recall kind of me up all right
let's listen to what I am saying right
now you need to read the page and you
need to ask the right questions so if
you don't know how to say tell you in
here they literally tell you in here do
you need to turn the string into an
array before you can reverse it
we found a page that tells us exactly
how to do this and you have to go
through the documentation and find yeah
I know how to do research somebody
yeah your mom is not working too hard
to do the research though you're saying
you better watch it yourself yeah
and you
au
all right so your goal tomorrow is not
to actually do your book what I want you
to do is watch Derek's bonus
one-and-a-half hour video on JavaScript
a lot of issues yeah yeah yes and then
side to do me I don't know who that is
can you send me the video yes absolutely
I'm not that'll be your homework for
tomorrow all you gotta do is watch it
and absorbed it
hmm
ooh
thank you for that note John I'm just
gonna let her find it through the
documentation but all right you will
help from chat okay you may need to turn
the string Anton right before you can
reverse it
your streamis result must be a string
remember to use
we get stuck that right here I'm good
well since I feel like we haven't used
dot splits dot string slit how am I
supposed to get into this art not
so-called
array but array well you don't have to
do it as an array what you can do is you
have do you know that you can target a
single character of a string yeah so
that's what I was trying to do
originally okay well you can do that by
if you were to say if you were to say
STR 0 what would it SGR bracket 0 what
would it this one English so knowing
that we can target individual indexes
and we want to do though know when we
run our code again again matters how
might we go ahead so figure out a way of
doing that with if you don't want to use
this split go ahead and delete it
comment it out well okay I would like to
know how to use a split if that's
conventional
work is zero
I don't want it's connected to it woody
what are you doing with you I was
entering into the room to do what and it
looks like your hard-coding something no
I am definitely not doing that remember
it's not just hello we're trying to
solve we're trying to solve it want to
reverse all words
oh so me Orlin oh yeah wait a crazy cat
I think I mom I think I'm doing this
wrong Donna
dude that's wrong because no far I and
if I is less than string I I will put it
into a string
well it
uh okay let's see that's not right goes
Annette okay so I need somewhere to
store this
so it's got to be in the function so so
far
damn it
I forget if I need to put a number
so confuse yes sure I don't fully
understand how you keep on forgetting
how a for loop is set up because I never
worked with them that long okay all
right so what kind of what sounds are
disappointed what is the value of I
right now there is no value to I right
now so it's undefined
how was I'm fine gonna help us it's not
because you know what I'm still thinking
through this okay Jesus
on day 25 you guys do the algorithm that
you don't use the string dot slip moving
so the next part is a statement right
yeah so I is less than in this case
hello yes
I is less 0 is less than hello so we're
going when you say it like that I feel
like know what it that's because if it
starts to zero well remember our fourth
of all we want to do is put a statement
that says how many times it's run so how
many times is our our for loop need to
run less than the string or the string
equals the string right equals the
string no no no 0 is less than hello
does that sound right
zero less my string
remember the string is hello what is it
that we want to do we want to say I is
less than hello I thought we did I is
less than hello what is what is less
than addition when would we be able to
stretch if we had zero when we - hello
does that make sense in - in the world
of mathematics probably not
no no not probably not it doesn't make
sense so when we say one number is less
than a string that doesn't make sense I
darling no that's not right
you start yeah I'm figuring this out
okay criticizing me every step that I
don't forget it
oh yeah trying to amer it yeah hammering
anything in you're not letting me brain
think about it you're not letting my
brain get to the point where it gets to
say oh I'm wrong I'm missing something
I'm still thinking through this I made
me thinking different from you I logic
may be backwards but I can end up at the
same damn thing okay
how many ways can you code this Dylan
how many ways can you solve an algorithm
Dylan many different ways is the answer
Jesus he's nice at bye
[Laughter]
okay
so what was the goal for your for loop
you haven't set up properly but why did
you set it up because I'm going to enter
into the string and I need to know how
many things are in the string so my code
says okay while my string dot length is
whatever my argument is I know CRO it I
get defensive and I have to remember
that I do that so I need to calm myself
down um okay so I'm saying in my string
whatever my dot length is of my string
my eye will run so then my four lip will
know how many times it needs to run and
then I have a variable up here store to
store my string so that my inside my
block here where I write my code I will
go into the string of its dot length and
I will write it backwards okay sounds
like a solid plan
so how are you going to get the how you
gonna get all the values and put it in
in your string to be rivers yeah so I'm
I'm trying to figure that out right now
see right now I'm going in it's coming
in so how do we hold on hold on I mean
I'm not thinking as fast as you wanted
to I get it please
curve it just give me a second okay
little add to it I said
I
what am i adding I am adding backers
dream + I or is it string dot life
backward what am I trying to access in
my backwards trying to add to my burial
I feel like
I feel like it's my drawing not okay
variable I equals zero okay
because we're starting at zero that's a
thing do I want to start at Sarah home I
supposed to coin
I guess I'm dinner you looking at a few
how do you help okay okay so I okay I
know that I need to store things into my
string but I cannot remember if it is
string that length that I am taking it
from or is it the string dot length all
that's doing is returning the length of
the string okay so you want to add it it
looks like you want to add to the
backward string
now what are we trying to get how do we
access a single character from a string
oh yeah okay we can access it just like
we would in a right index yeah okay
that helped okay
I don't feel like this is gonna get it
backwards though it's not it's going to
actually what you have setup right now
it's just gonna call hello yes good very
turn that well and you may need to
actually set your backward trim from
undefined to something else what do you
think you would set it to um just a
regular string just that good now it's
up to you to figure out how one might
take your setup either change your for
loop or a change what's in your for loop
to reverse the string that's what it is
hey kill ease
okay okay so remember there's plenty of
ways to to write for them you can go
forward or backwards a bunch of far I
- why
that does not look great
I got an infidel lip going on oh that's
nice
mr. coding God should code some bots to
complement April during her tasks I
almost I have an infinite a loop in here
I almost crashed your browser so locate
your logic yeah I'm missing something
right here oh I is equal to zero yeah
so zero is less than this length of the
string is that true minus one so what's
the strength at length minus one is what
it's in the hello case it's four ran and
then every iteration we subtract one
from the loop right yeah so then
negative one is the next iteration for I
it's negative one less than four yeah
next iteration negative two is negative
two less affordable I don't really
understand what you're saying - Mary no
I'm trying to explain to you why you
have an infinite loop because your
statement I read there's something wrong
with your for loop setup
okay but I need to change this and I
don't know what I need to change it
so I think about what each numbers are
what they're supposed to do so what's
the game plan here it's to get the last
to create over string right so how do we
target the end value though how do we
target the oh it's the last value right
yeah and then we want to start that we
want that to be in our reverse during
the first value yeah so how do we do
that yeah so look at our four is equal
to zero
yeah I'm saying why 0 is greater than
string length minus one subtract one now
is zero ever greater this string got
length minus one yes no because the
length of our strength minus 1 is 4 is 0
ever greater than 4 now so our for loop
instead of running in an infinite loop
just never runs so okay so god what is I
need to be then um well if we want to
start off by the last letter right yeah
is that what you're trying to do yeah
you want to get the last letter how are
we going to start I don't be acting like
you don't know what I'm trying to do I
can't tell you what to do so in this
case if we wanted to access the 0 how
would we get remember we're getting it
in here by passing in I and
when it needs to be string length
No maybe I'm putting that in the wrong
spot
hey burning my brain
burning something
oh he's burning something hey oh my god
you might want to turn the fan on it's
really smoky
let's see
for VAR i equals I'm sorry guys I'm I'm
trying to get my brain to work okay so
far ie needs to get to my last letter
how I get that I get that highway what I
mean I mean I is greater than I don't
know understand this middle part here
okay I is greater than streamed out
length minus one so we want to start by
putting in the very last character right
so how do i how do I get that how would
I call that well how are you how do you
get the length of a string taut length
alright and length is always one more
than an index value right then the index
values because we start at zero so what
we set our eye to knowing that
I dot length i dot late no no it would
just be dot length no can you say that
again so to access the last value of
hello
that o would be for mb str bracket for
but I'm not trying too hard code it
correct now how do we get the entire
length of the string string dot length
okay which is what what's the length of
the string four no five it's fine okay
now how do we get the last index
and adding length of stream what's the
last index value of the string no
there's five values but we start on the
zero index so how do we get the last and
how do we go from five to four
Riaan insulin yeah so knowing that what
would we if we want to start off our
first make our first value the last
value does that make sense
no it doesn't know really that's the
last value isn't it when we target
what's the length of the string let's
just do the math length of string is
five we minus 1 that's 4 and then we
take string bracket 4 and what is that
yeah all right and when we say that's
our first iteration what is our first
it's zero and then so on and so forth
okay all right so look at your for loop
does it make sense
so our eye starts off at four just more
ever greater than four it's the same
now
you might be right John but I learned
how to use backward for loops and it
just seems like the most we're gonna
love here try and solve the algorithms
ever she wants it's more I would like to
know how to use the string dot split
though yes Milo stop eating why is he
trying to eat that crazy cat that cat oh
my goodness
oh I'm missing the letter you're missing
everything yeah it's not gone backwards
your loop doesn't work so what's the
value of I when we start what's the
value of high when we start now you know
Mark's not negative 4 is 4 ok now is for
every ever greater than 4 no ok
so and we want a decrement backwards so
how would we fix our statement to be
true okay that's about it so 4 it would
be greater than or equal but that would
only run once right because then with 3
ever be greater than or equal 4
so figure out how you can fix your
statement
this is all I got all right time to pull
out the whiteboard I don't know a camera
but you got to understand basic math
right now I understand bismuth I don't
understand basic math and this form
I know so we're going to draw it out
we're going to draw each iteration you
send off to the camera the side of the
camera view you're clearly struggling
with see what values are getting
constant we're
my look at out of the way buddy alright
so here we go
so we have a for loop I'm not going to
put what's in it
one day John thanks mark you know that
you have something here here we don't
know what goes here yet okay we have our
eye starts off at the length of the
string minus one right STR dot length
minus one so each iteration we want to
go downwards
we're let's make an assumption that it
runs for the whole point of the string
and of the word hello first iteration it
gets vo which would be 4 so index 4 is
equal to 0 index 3 is equal to out index
2 is equal to L index 1 is equal to e
index 0 is equal to H and then somehow
our statement kicks it off and then ends
it so we know that we need an eye right
here and we have to have greater than
less than some sort of symbol for the
statement to be true to make sense for
the iterations to run
okay so if I is greater than stream this
is our I value each one of the uses of
our hot you already got that right in
here this is all right now we need to
create a statement that somehow iterates
to zero when I is zero dense and when I
is for it starts and it runs for all of
them so what is I when we start know
what is I for good so we need to go from
the start of the string which in this
case is for to the industry in this case
is zero how do we do that what is the
statement that makes that make sense
is string dot length minus 1 what is
string dot length for right five so then
we're going to run and think of where we
need to get we start here we're starting
at four and we have to go down to zero
if we're seen if I is greater than five
how do we ever get to one two three four
and zero we don't right
remember we're going downwards with AI
minus minus
so it's turning up
okay so
is 4 which is 0 how do I get it to go
down so while I is 4 and my string
length is always 5 string that length is
always 5 so each one of these I
interations is going from 4 to 3 to 2 to
1
yeah that's not what I'm having trouble
with and having trouble with
understanding how I need to set
remember your each one of these is going
down with I - - so it has to be true for
0 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4
yeah date the big basic man what is I
when we start horn good I minus minus 3i
minus minus 2i minus minus I minus -
yeah we're done but it doesn't stop with
will with your statement right and I so
I'm trying to come up with so
so is greater than zero
does that work
let's check
what's the value of our first iteration
or ban Gerry equal to zero so it'll run
zero what's the value of three you got
it all right now go ahead and test your
code out make sure you're right all
right go ahead and test thank you honey
thank you forever to get their equal to
zero
I know I just don't know if 25 days is
like a legit place to be at 27 days so
why is it wrong
while I is greater or equal to zero what
are you actually returning
are you turning backwards tree yeah No
good one
I don't know
now I'm going to show you before we wrap
up let me show Juicy's I'm going to show
you some string functions and array
functions that you could solve this
alright so I forgot that we were
supposed to do this but I just wanted to
go over some array functions with you so
string dot split bar array the phone
line my array is equal to STR dot split
and so what we're splitting it on this
takes in a parameter this is a string
function it turns a string into an array
if you do it like that it breaks it up
into words right it splits it where this
is true so if it's broken up into words
or spaces right if we want individual
characters if we want individual
characters there'd be no space right
that means everyone murder him
daddy's sick of your man yes yeah
um so I was looking a little more
aggressive than anything else
I just been building up for about 27
days of him knocking over my
webcam uh okay so so we have string got
split if you think sorry all
right so we're splitting this up into a
character so in the example of hello
what my array is my array is actually
equal to an array with the words H with
characters e hello what it's printing
out no that's not it something anything
out that's the value of my array this is
what's in my array right now okay so
with no space in between your quotes yes
there is a difference there between us
space and narrow space yes so if we had
if we had a space and let's say it was
hello world would actually be in my
array myarray in that case would be
equal to
my array would be equal equal to hello
world
so you're basically setting up what what
what the case is where you're splitting
the string up oh so if there's no space
then it separates each individual yes
it's splitting it on the character level
and if we put a comma like that it split
it up on Comm XS so we're saying how to
split up our stream so in this case
we're splitting our string into an array
now there's a function hold a reverse in
here let me show you ready
reverse JavaScript so the reverse method
in JavaScript will do it in w3schools so
you can actually see what their first
method does is an array function that
reverses the order of things so take
this example here we have banana orange
apple and mango once we call reverse on
it it's mango apple orange banana
everything's been reversed all the
values have been reversed so when we say
my array dot reverse the value of my
array now
is equal to an array with o l l
II H but we don't want to return an
array right we want it to return back as
a string so this is what split does this
is a string function this is a ray
function because now it's in a Ray cool
so the next thing that we want to do is
we want to put it back together we want
to put it back together add the string
the way to do create a variable to store
it as a string no not necessarily
so we'll say my Ray and we're going to
use the join function and what the joint
function does is it takes those array
values and it joins it back together no
strings so split splits the string
you're supposed to go over John restrict
turns because I don't even know that
these exist functions yes
methods or functions yeah and so now
when we join it what my array is equal
to still longer array but but that
doesn't matter it's just a naming
convention so my array is actually equal
to Oh
oh so only return my array we run our
tests no I think I might have to store
this in a variable our word equals
return word there we go sorry so this
changes the array all this does is it
joins it together so in this case we
could say word or making them as
separate I'm putting them together again
so these are the tools so in this case
we have to assign the value this
actually changes the original array so
we don't have to here this is just
taking what's in there and joining it if
you have an array a value sorting so
this in this case we're overriding the
value but it's all the same but these
are some JavaScript these are some some
JavaScript string and JavaScript array
functions so tomorrow what we'll do is
we'll go over some string ones and we
will introduce you to them I don't
expect you to memorize them but we will
introduce you to them and then when the
time comes and you continue on the
algorithms and things like that how do
you have flash which is why we're going
to amass a new link right now you're
going to watch tomorrow
you're going to watch tomorrow learning
JavaScript to 1v is our 40 minutes long
Oh Lord a Dalton my
send it to messenger
oh I'll also go over any any methods or
functions we'll scan over and pretty
quickly
all right so now you have the link good
okay so any any questions before we wrap
up the strength milah stop breaking
things man
keep jumping um okay so you got a rough
day today but these will get easier you
were able to get the the Celsius and
Fahrenheit fairly quickly my biggest
gripe with you is that you didn't read
the documentation and that you I think
you're expecting to be able to store
these numbers in your head and not go
lying by evaluating your code you're not
trying to find your bugs point yeah
which is a hard skill to have so the
best advice I can give you is when you
when your stuff isn't working to
actually check each piece line by line
and see if it makes sense like when when
when your code says four is less than
four does that make try to evaluate what
you're trying to do I can't wait till I
get my cords all set up I have to worry
about this so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
