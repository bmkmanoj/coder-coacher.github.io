and a somewhat related topic of scope
creeps while we'll be talking about
today so what it is why it exists the
awful impact it has on you as a
developer and some of the real-world
consequences of how it just will make
your life uh turley awful at times but
it is worth mentioning just because it
is such a a rampant problem in
development are you thinking about
creeping into a coding boot camp is a
coding boot camp in your scope might I
recommend dev Mountain coding boot camp
they have four separate locations Provo
Utah I've just actually seen that campus
in person it's absolutely beautiful the
houses that comes with tuition for free
is within walking distance and then of
course Dallas Texas Salt Lake City in
Phoenix Arizona check them out at dev
mound com all right so I definitely
didn't paint a very good picture of
scope creep that's because it's not a
good thing it's a bad thing
scope creep is when somewhere in the
process requirements are not gathered
properly bad communication happens and
essentially new features need to be
built that weren't part of the original
project right there's a lot of problems
with this for one typically you'll start
hearing this just key word in
development and I never really noticed
it till a developer co-worker of mine
mentioned it to me well can't we just do
this can't we just add this can't we
just just just so start you'll start
hearing that just word and sometimes
that scope creep when they just want you
to build new features the problem with
that is a lot of times just when the
project's supposed to be do well we
assumed we have this right so
assumptions were made bad communication
so now you have to build these new
projects which required developers to
work longer hours and more hours which
is not something I want or I think is an
acceptable thing to do I believe in
you've heard me talk about in the past
about game day showing up every once
every couple months when you need to put
extra hours in but that's pretty much it
it's supposed to be the the outlier not
the norm right so scope creep crates
that crates as longer hours a lot so
what is it caused by well you really
have to understand the point of sort of
the roles on your team so every
workplace will be different but when you
work once you get to maybe a larger
company you're gonna have maybe
dedicated teams or you're gonna have a
software team in general you're gonna be
working with a lot of different people
you're not just going to be working with
developers you might also have a QA
someone who does you know Quality
Assurance for your projects and then
you're also going to have a business
analyst someone's whose job is to go and
gather those requirements so whose job
is to go and and make sure that we're
delivering what the business needs and
going get those features going get the
scope of the project at at a very early
level and then you have the project
manager whose job it really is to make
sure that we're on track to deliver what
it is we need as well as communicate to
the stakeholders communicate to the
product owner whoever it may be what it
is that we're building where we're at if
we're gonna make our deadline all that
stuff so that's what's the reason I set
that up is and by the way the project
manager and business analyst sometimes
those roles will overlap sometimes
they'll be one role they tend to be a a
role in which there is some overlap so
we're saying okay well why did you say
all that dealing well scope creep
happens because as the developer most of
the time you aren't getting you aren't
going and getting your own reports
you're just building what you're told to
build you can have questions ask
questions go from there but someone
that's someone else
jump so it's usually up to the project
manager up to the VA to go and get those
things and they can only do so much
really I look at the the project manager
and the VA has a wall right this is the
wall between you and the people who want
you to get something done a week ago
part of a p.m. and Behe's role is to get
yelled at as far as I'm concerned it is
their role to get yelled at so that the
developers don't get yelled at and quit
right gonna get another job tomorrow as
a developer right that's I some of you
maybe think I'm joking but I actually
think this is part of partial reality so
one of the reasons I stretch stress
communication is in every role you need
good communication scope creep happens
partially because there's bad
communication and even even as a
developer you can help protect yourself
against scope creep where you say hey I
see these requirements for this project
there are three things that I'm almost
positive if the company is going to want
and that are pretty much standard for
any rollout can you please go back to
them suggest these items see if they
want that because I I just see this
being you know a week before we deliver
the project you know so there that wall
there that buffer to go in and most of
time get the requirements but as a
developer you also have the ability to
protect yourself against scope creep to
a degree right we can only do so much
but it's a it's very interesting worlds
where sometimes you can even make those
suggestions and say no we don't want
anything three months later you know we
were thinking about it we know this is
supposed to go out on Monday but can we
just get this feature in there can we
just give it and it's a it's a it's an
awful part of of development and it's
it's somewhat related to technical debt
right so technical debt is often it's
created for a lot of reasons bad
developers it's created for projects
being rushed and scope creep leads to
projects being rushed because it's
oftentimes hey we want this new stuff
but we don't have enough time
for you to actually build it because we
want to delay our deadline and whatever
it is
so can you add it in and/or it's not so
much a question
it is add this in period or exclamation
definitely not a question mark add this
in and in order to make those deadlines
at times you gotta cut corners a little
bit and write spaghetti code sometimes
not cuz you want to my hope is that no
developer wants to write spaghetti code
but because in order to do what is
needed good code takes a good amount of
time bad code takes a little amount of
time right even if it works
so you get put in these situations with
technical debt you scope creep helps
create technical debt rather where now
you get the feature done but you've also
contaminated the code you've made it
harder to read you you have made it so
you've maybe implement it in a way
that's not dynamic where maybe we're
gonna for repeat our logic somewhere so
you have these situations that happen
quite frequently and they're there
they're directly correlated but scope
creep is an unfortunate thing that I
don't know how how we don't have it I
don't know how as a as a developer to
eliminate it completely I know that you
as a developer calf communication you
can look at a project and say look
they're gonna want this please go back
but you can only push so hard
also III don't have a good answer on how
to eliminate it completely I would like
to live in a world in which you have
developers be business analysts and
project managers but the the harsh
reality is that will never happen there
are some companies that will hire PMS
nba's to be who are former developers
and they pay quite well for those
because they know they're getting
developers to do it and there's a lot of
benefit that go with it when you've
architected projects and you've written
code
and you've built out features and you
have experience doing all this sort of
stuff in my opinion you're much more
valuable than a a project manager or ba
who hasn't because you can you can give
realistic expectations and you can
gather requirements from a developer
standpoint as well as communicate to the
developers how that happens but that's
that's a fancy round that's very rare oh
that that's gonna be the norm partially
because they're having such a hard time
feeling develop URLs probably senior
developer roles I know a bunch of
juniors yes firing tree give me a job do
you have a hard time it's very hard to
find experienced developers that's what
I'm trying to say but yeah I don't have
a good answer for how to solve scope
creep other than better communication
perhaps I and I I don't even know if a
developer would do a better job I would
like to think so I've had to gather
requirements before as a technology
trainer which was kind of a be a sort of
role mix with the PM mix with the
technical it was it was one of those
roles so I did a lot but I never felt
like gathering requirements was that
hard it might have been just because I I
was a developer it's not to disrespect
anyone who's a BA or anything like that
I understand everyone's job has parts
that are here there that are you know
you can't really know everyone's
struggle in their job until you've
worked their job but in my experience I
never I never had any issues with scope
creep but then again I was only doing it
for nine months but yeah so that's a
little bit about scope creep it's really
just an issue where you gotta build
features last minute because someone
who's above you says you have to back
communication can lead to it bad
gathering of requirements and really the
only things you can do to push back or
maybe communicate better ask for the
features that you think they're gonna
want and need and go from there what are
you guys are suggestions on how to solve
the scope creep I'd love to know I don't
have any great ones it's a it's a
rampant problem
scope Reese one of those things
are you talking about well how can we
fix this and you talked about it and
nothing ever changes and nothing ever
gets different because all the business
a lot of times cares about is they got
it done all right I got my feature I
don't give a shit if they had to work
extra business that's quarter four in
America so if you have any suggestions
leave them in the comments below I'd
love for you to share them with me as
well as everyone else don't forget to
comment like subscribe share support me
on patreon all that good stuff I'll see
you next time bye remember guys scope
creep is bad
look creeping on your girlfriend hey
girl how you doing okay quick link to
our sponsor device plus calm few guys
are interested in Arduino and the
internet of things such as a raspberry
PI's might I recommend checking them out
device plus comm if you click the link
in the top corner it'll take you to a
really cool thing it's an intro beginner
level tutorial of how to build a
tripwire using Arduino check it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
