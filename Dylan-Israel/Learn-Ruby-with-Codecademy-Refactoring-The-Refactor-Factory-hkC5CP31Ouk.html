of the refactoring category we're going
to be sharing that refactor factory so
says we're going to fix some of the
existing code this is a module will
cover these I guess as well as what a
this is at the end lesson so unless n is
a integer turn in all right let's let's
say you instrument see what's going on
here alright so to be or not to be first
up on line fourteen primary is value by
using the dot null which returns true if
a value is nail and false otherwise all
right now factor the code on line
fourteen to use conditional assignment
to set primer a 22 gray instead of using
an if statement
alright so
alright remember the conditional
assignment where operator works like
this and it equals some value so it's
saying to do
oh let's say I have an infinite loop
what's 45
alright so we're let's reset the code
here minus 14 so we're saying that we
need to switch this so answer
instead of using a statement I guess
when we did that already uh okay so we
are the same em we set it to harder i
omit needless words unless on Line six
and if effective code and energy single
line if statements and ever do this if
this is true okay so we want n must be
true aurenna must be an integer if true
alright
so unless oh let me show you some less
oops my bad so we want to do the action
first just put plus false and then we'll
say puts now say puts all right believe
that should work there we go so we're
saying let's just switch out the F and
unless a lot less code we lost about
three forces of code in that little
section so we had about eight lines of
code we got down to two plus is more
find an unnecessary return keyword and
remove it okay so BAM I should be it so
alright the rubios loop replace the for
loop with a called two times so let's
find the for loop
and times do we have to do it too after
that it doesn't look right
all right side at times let's see my
code should look a little bit like this
so I'm not times here and we can get rid
of that end because good
alright let's see here let's reset the
code so we need to change it to the dot
ties so this is actually let's pull up
the Q&amp;amp;A forum because I believe I may be
just forgetting how to do the time so
that's five seven
so let's see how this guy does it blah
blah blah blah prime equals prime new
setup yeah Franklin's prime do the end
times this and end okay yes we can take
that out cool so I guess we need to get
rid of the other statement in there for
the variable I had the final push Christ
call a dogfish with the listen listen so
this is just a simple syntax thing so
cool Aaron to badge 50 points in one day
I don't know what these points me I
might just have to do it's here your
license or something have no idea so
nice work um if you remember the Cash
Money symbol verbose equals now online
once loudest use the old style prime new
from ruby 1.8 without the interpreter
yelling at us okay
and then prime not instance so this is a
1.9 class makes the rate automatically
ok so I'm going to share as always kind
of just syntax one pretty quick only
seven things here nothing too bad and
let's see what we're doing next blocked
prox and lamb does so I look forward to
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
