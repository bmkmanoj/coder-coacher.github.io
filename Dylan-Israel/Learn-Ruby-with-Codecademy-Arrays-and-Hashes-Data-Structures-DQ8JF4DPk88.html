structures now in in this next section
so we will be creating arrays so we're
going to declare a variable called by
right and set it equal to an array of
our choice so my write equals and we'll
just go ahead and do up one and two
because it's simple and that should be
good enough I'm sorry a wanting to
access their a by index so remember all
array start at zero not one so alright
there's a lot of text going on here
let's just scan it see if we need
anything else it kind of see kind of
show you this is our right and this is
the index value use square bracket
notation to print the third value of
demo our a print sand level I'm not
really sure what that means like
recommendation but I'm guessing that's
what they want so the third value would
be raining next to go
all right arrays of non-number create a
new array make it an array of string so
called string underscore array and it's
going to be equal same thing except now
we will do doing sea
Dylan mr. cool why cool all right can
you guess what the two-dimensional array
would like if we print it out all right
so the next thing we have in this
two-dimensional array is just
two-dimensional just like it's four
dimensional so looks like it's going to
print out us four by four zeros that's
it one two three four arrays can go up
to any size to create a multiple
multi-dimensional array you just need
brackets within the brackets to end it
and then it's just like it's an array of
an array
yes that's the easiest way to do it but
you'll just get better you see on this
practice all right we're going to create
our own 2d array two dimensional array
online understory to be your sport array
I'll set this equal to
I will say first thing first one college
with three and some very hot and I
believe I may have to do I don't that
worked I just think I might have to
practice around everybody guess not so
there are two arrays it does it for us
so perhaps let's let's see it's doing it
for us I feel like I actually need them
that that's just an oversight okay so it
works in the other here I'm not sure if
it will work typically
all right now we're going to be using
hashes
all right so in this case we have a key
value a key which is in this case name
age and hungry and then we have a result
value so if this is a door or this is
the key to the door to the answer key to
the door to the answer key the side key
to the door to the answer all right so
in this case it should print Eric 26 and
true all right cool so we'll probably
not do that right now
I use hash new to create a new hash
called pets okay so in this case we'll
say
and make sure to capitalize it or else
it won't work
apparently I had a pet to your pets hash
so we created our pets it's kind of like
we're creating an array against Souls
like pets so let's say pets dealing
people's cats cuz I love cats
all right so next thing
all right so it wants us to print it out
so we're going to abuse boots boots has
power and all the value Dylan I should
print out cats there it is
great introduction of Federation all
right so once this is check that look
over this so let's take let's work our
way through it so Milhouse Ralph Nelson
and Otto just a simple array of strings
we have a rate eight
no no array of hashes with hash a bunch
of hashes here so this is the key
homework to the door dad
all right so it goes through the whole
family and friends dot each x puts so
this is going to print out France and
this is going to
printout I'm gonna guess in this case X
is the hash and Y is the value so this
should print out Homer space Homer : dad
and if you can see up here when we're
calling dad large opponent okay makes
sense so we're gonna iterate over a race
here because this numbers dot each so in
our case I think we just said each then
we're gonna call something that puts out
all right all right so we're going to
say which is each X is usually this they
use something very similar element
elements not a bad thing but but I just
prefer I
I guess I should work
Ashville language is wrong alright so it
puts it out in order and there's a ruby
that we're working on right now so now
we have to iterate over a
multi-dimensional array all right
so iterate the done each element in the
SRA still a study call the elements of
sub array
I'm not sure if they mainly silvery
alright so so okay so it wants to nested
silver is so I'm guessing silver is just
built in to select the next level so
next so s is going to be the outward
array if that makes sense on subarray
going to thinner so so already got each
and to create some variable is what I
like to use that's that is going to end
here that's going to here all right
let's see if that works also see puts
ham swiss turkey cheddar s beautiful
okay cool like that so go over this
array this is what's going on here it
goes over this alright right here this
calls that and then it does each one of
those in this sub array then goes or so
it does this big one first and then it
does each one of these okay alright so
looks like we're going to be using
hashes
all right so in this case one sees our
secret Marvel identities and DC identify
each and then does it do ya do
then we need to clear something and
we'll say in this case we'll do
something a little more fun I guess
superhero huh full name all right
no we just print it out counterintuitive
all night all right yeah we'll put it ,
and don't forget to and the Bua loop
should work looks like your I'm printing
each colon separated key value i'm
selling aren't you all right so they
didn't like i put a comment that why i
don't know but uh that you could see it
and just you get a feel for some of
these things it was picking up a comma
instead of : i think so
there you go Wonder Woman alright next
section create your own
multi-dimensional array called my rate
editor all right
that people to play three one two three
that won't do great work on five just
using it some that overlap a little just
cuz it should and don't forget your
commas in between so that's our three
dimension all right I create a hash pull
my hash in the other so my - give it at
least one key value
all right we'll do 27 let's do that
ma'am
so there's that and last but not least
of our data structure we want to iterate
through I so lunch order each do and
then we'll say I we can just do will do
something standard lunch and then we
want it to but watch and then we need to
end it so let's see
looks like I did not print anything
constantly so second example
so yeah lunch and order dot each oh
there's no do here here we go
so this is getting our hash values
all right I had to guess all right so we
actually just want
I just take a hand here you should print
out that's the awful end obviously if I
was doing this right be able to ice up
you want to get the value from lunch
underscore order and then we want to put
I say let's take a hand they may want to
do some if-else statements but I think
there's probably something that's a
little bit simpler than that
so go to the forums
ah okay that seems name food so that is
our key that gives us the value and then
we want to put food there we go
okay today we're going to share what
we're working on close it and take a
look at our next section so we will be
building a histogram be honest with you
ought to top my head I do not remember
what a histogram is so but looking at
this it looks like it might be so sort
of who knows but yes the next section
will be creating histograms and data
structures and meat data structures meat
iteration
