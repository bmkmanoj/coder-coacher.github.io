mistake this actually gets the heading
data one zero and the link here actually
is data three zero so I made a mistake
there on my end so just be aware of that
so all I did was come these out so we
can reference to it what we want to do
now is just concatenate or get our turn
and to be able to prepend it upon our UL
that we maimed output so I believe thus
you should be so much familiar with this
so basically we're just gonna target it
target output out our output ID and
we're gonna say dot prepend and what
we're gonna do here is output our data
1-0 so let's go save that and put in a
little world and when you submit it we
should get our hello world cool
so it's outputting correctly now what
what do we need to do next well let's go
ahead and declare it as a list item so
that week because what we want to do is
prepend it as a listen and Ally so how
can we do that it's like we have a
little bit of syntax problem so let's
just start fresh we'll create our for
loop here create our count variable I
say while I is less than data one dot
length
I plus plus throw it in here all we have
to do is change this so it iterates
through the array with whatever current
count we're on let's go ahead and type
into a world submit it and there it is
and that is the bulk of our code
everything after this point minus one
one little bug and we'll go we'll show
that off in a second
we will be able to I do with styling
so we have our ever output we have our
URL we have our heading whatever
description okay so what's the bug I'm
talking about when salt when working on
this let's go ahead and choose a second
word we can instead of hello world we'll
say goodbye now when we submit it you'll
notice that it pretends on top of it but
it doesn't actually delete the
information so what we can do to fix
that is above the for loop outside the
for loop but within the the success
function all we can do all we need to do
is make sure to wipe out the content
that's in there so we're gonna basically
just replace it with blank content so
HTML and character space so now when we
save it will still display what we're
searching cuz we're displaying it before
we display the results he's using the
jQuery but when we do hello world like
so it displays but now when we do
goodbye it will only display goodbye no
hello world so definitely just something
has to be trouble troubleshoot yes
you're doing but as always guys thanks
