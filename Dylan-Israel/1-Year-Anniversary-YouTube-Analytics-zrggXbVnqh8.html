year since I've put up my very first
coke atom a ruby video I thought it'd be
pretty cool if I kind of went over some
of my analytics and what my audience is
comprised of and just all that sort of
stuff now kind of showcasing what is
going on with the channel as well so
let's go ahead and take a look at the
first two things so at the beginning of
my first video I remember counting
gaining 0 to 1 subs every other day
luckily we've grown a little bit so
that's pretty cool right now I'm getting
about 650 subs every month every 28 days
100,000 minutes watch 37,000 views a
month and we're growing by about 15 to
20 percent compared to the last 28 days
so hopefully that that trend continues
on cuz I was kind of stagnant for a
little bit cruising around 500
subscribers another cool thing about in
the audience is that currently about 85
percent of it is male 15 percent female
on average I get that it's programming
but in the future I'm going to be
reaching out to those female viewers and
try to capture a little bit of that
audience and devote some time and energy
they're really making sure that we're
treating both genders fairly as well as
just kind of expanding the content one
of the cool things that I learned from
the analytics is that of all the videos
I've done my Python code CAD me videos
have been dominating my views this is
partly because Python it's the most
taught programming language in public
schools I would imagine
I'm guessing another cool thing is that
recently my free code camp project
videos have now crept into my monthly
top 10 videos so it really shows you
that free code camp is really becoming a
great go-to source for JavaScript and
jQuery and just learning web development
as a whole as well as just expanding
greatly because it's such a great
resource
well the cool things that I learned
about Analects is how many likes my
videos get now I have a ton of videos up
it's about 225 videos and I'm putting up
videos every other day almost there put
that in perspective we're not even at a
year we're at about 11 and a half months
and there's 225 videos so it's almost a
video a day but um right now I'm getting
about 400 likes a month now I have no
idea what that means in terms of
analytics maybe it plays a factor maybe
it doesn't but I really do appreciate it
and if you like the video go ahead and
like and share it in it's really helpful
a few less things one of the cool things
that I really like is I got my first
patreon subscriber for four dollars a
month I want to thank anybody who takes
the time to either donate
obviously watching liking subscribing
sharing that's all really cool too but
to just deliver the cold hard cash in
support of the YouTube dream is really
really cool but hopefully we'll be able
to do this video in a year and I'll be
like tiptoeing around this bitch with a
hundred thousand subs the life will be
good but as always guys I do really
appreciate you watching and subscribing
and I hope to I hope you continue on
going down your developer path and I
hope my videos help that helped the
process because it helps me to make up
so see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
