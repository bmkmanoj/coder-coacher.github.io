about your health as a developer and it
sounds a little kind of stranger thing
will you know what we're not like heavy
lifting 50 pound bags of cement or
anything like that so why are we talking
about this what is was well sitting is
actually really bad for you especially
for long periods of time and so I've
been a developer about 10 months now and
before that I worked a desk job at a
software company for about nine months
it's the first time I've ever had a job
in which the majority of the job I am
sitting down the majority of the job I'm
not really moving or doing anything
physical and for the last six months I
haven't been been exercising really and
part of that is you know hand injuries
and whatnot
but part of its also just not putting a
value of importance on it like I should
so um recently I had to go to the
chiropractor because I had back pain
lower back pain and it's directly caused
by me sitting down too much and part of
it is the the your your hips
tighten up by the lack of movement right
you're not bobbing and weaving anymore
you just kind of chill and sit in and
chillin right and so I had to go to the
chiropractor I didn't helped a lot I got
like a Groupon and you know it's like
three visits for like 45 bucks and I
have two more to go and my back already
feels much better and I forget what he
said there's a technical term for a
pinched nerve that he had mentioned but
it's all from the tightness in my legs
and the tightness specifically in my my
hamstrings and my joints are my inner
inner thighs and so part of the things
that you should be doing as you work
these developer jobs is one you need to
be kind of going on walks constantly
about every hour if you can right I
probably do it once I read three you
know I go into work I walk down to get a
banana at the grocery store I
you know lunch I walk around for lunch I
don't just eat in the building I then
you know midday I go grab like a hot dog
on the street corner though I'm not
doing that anymore because I'm trying to
get a little healthier so I'm going to
go walk and get an apple or something
but that's what that that's even doing
something like that that wasn't enough
so one thing that I do in my my personal
life is I have my standing desk which
we're on right now it's automated goes
up and down now if you can't afford an
automated one because they aren't cheap
right I think I spent $400 on this there
are standing desks that are much cheaper
young standing that's new for about 100
bucks 350 and maybe you can find one
even cheaper than that on Craigslist or
something like that but the reason that
you know standing desk is you know you
can kind of bob and weave back and forth
you can kind of stretch out it's a
little more time Green yeah but it's
tiring because you're actually doing
something so it's one thing that you can
do but definitely be aware of it because
it is it is something that I don't think
people put enough emphasis on is their
health as a developer because we're not
meant to be sitting in chairs even a
comfy one alright last year's pretty
comfy where that's not what we're meant
for as in terms of like our body design
and so we have to really take care of
ourselves in that fashion or us like I'm
not kidding I've been I've had back pain
for three weeks non-stop and it's much
it's still here even after my visit but
things that I've been doing I've been
trying to solve this issue about my
health as a developer I can't lift right
now cuz I think I fractured my hand I'm
getting that checked out which are the
parties I have been working out and so
what have I been doing I've been
swimming so if you have a pool in your
apartment complex or at your house you
know that's one thing that's pretty easy
where you can start off doing 15-20
minutes a day
which is what I do for the last 10 days
I've been swimming for about 15 minutes
and uh you know it's probably the most I
get out of the house be honest with you
because it's like to work I like going
to Walmart to pick up
and IKEA but that's one thing I've also
started jogging around the complex any
kind of sucks because my back is what's
fascinating at the time quite a bit but
that's another thing I've been I guess
the point I'm trying to communicate is
there's a bunch of ways that you can't
continue to exercise and be be in shape
and be fit but it's up to you to to
consciously and actively make that
decision to do such things you're not
just going to be able to just hope that
things get better you have to act
actively go and do it kind of like
learning code right and I'm just going
to learn code if you don't code and all
the time right so it's just actively
kind of think about what it is that you
want to do and do it before it gets
worse the sciatica that's what it's
called sciatica so when I went to the
chiropractor he said how long has this
been going on I said three weeks it's
like it's really good that you came to
me in three weeks it's a longer that you
wait to solve these issues the longer
the treatment is and the more the more
there's more time-consuming and the more
difficult it becomes to making sure that
that you aren't that your work we're
solving this all the same and so you
know sciatica is nothing big it's a
pinched nerve but a lot of this stuff
can get worse and I feel myself getting
up from chairs and my late my thighs are
tightening things like that so I'm doing
stretches at home every night before bed
I'm stretching I would be doing yoga
once my hand gets healed but all the
hand sense and everything so we active
with your health as a developer and as
someone who's not I'm not like a
heavyset dude by any means I'm six-foot
I weigh 180 hundred eighty-five pounds
and I'm having I'm having issues I've
been pretty active my whole life in
terms of going the gym for the most part
in occasional snowboard trip and stuff
like that I would be worried if I went
snowboarding right now that I may not
come back in one piece and that's not
okay so especially as we get older I
don't 29 years old I'm getting a little
bit older probably pretty young compared
to most people Sanders but
but it's only the more that you don't
worry about your health while you're
younger the worse the repercussions are
going to be when you're older and that's
when you don't want that right so like
when you're younger you can kind of give
a about whatever is you're young
and things will kind of fall into place
and you'll you'll bounce back
not so much every year you're getting
closer to that hey it's harder to bounce
back and so if you're if you're sitting
now for several hours at a time start
thinking about how you start think about
how you need to how you need what what
out how you're going to counteract that
inactivity
and a couple different ways are eating
healthy and exercising but I'll just say
I'm going to eat healthy I'm going to
exercise that that's that's the problem
with goals is you need to you need to
sit okay so that's your over overview
that's your goal but how are you going
to accomplish that goal
and until you do that you're not going
to do it for me I said I'm going to
start jog and start swimming and after
my my hand gets fixed and I get checked
out in about a week I'm going to
re-enroll in yoga when I can so these
are things that I'm going to actively be
doing and it's not just like okay I'm
not exercise and eat healthy now that's
not good enough
how are you going to accomplish that
pickles for all goals as well so
definitely just be aware that that you
sitting at a desk is really bad for you
and you need to be counteracting that
night I have it I haven't and I've been
suffering the consequences for it now
and I'm trying to play catch-up
luckily I'm still fairly young that I
can write so I'm doing my stretching and
all everything I mentioned but I be
aware that even if you're younger than
me older than me you should definitely
be listening is so if you're younger
than me though and your thing off volume
is this old 29 year old is sixteen years
there's a grandfather over
here I'll need to listen to my hips are
fine but uh what I'm trying to say guys
is just be aware that you do need you
only have one body right and you need to
take care of it and sometimes I know I
ignored my body in the in the goal of
being a developer and trying to
work really hard and if there's ways
that you can sort of counteract that
through exercise and eating start
implementing it now rather than later
that's the point of this video but as
always guys I love to hear your points
of view about this stuff what are you
doing as developers to counteract that

staying motivated working hard and that
you're not getting back issues like my
old ass hey guys thanks for watching the
video especially thanks to our sponsors
