something a little bit different where
ever you talking about acronyms
specifically once in web development
right
what are xx ones that I find that I I
use or I find that are common enough
that you probably should know so we're
gonna go over those right now are you
thinking about sliding into the DM of
dev Mountain are you are you thinking
about maybe going to a BC boot camp
might I recommend dev mountain coding
boot camp not only do they have Quality
Assurance web development mobile
development but they got much more than
that
on top of it all they have to ition
including your housing so you can get up
and go this moment
check them out dev mountain comm yeah so
why are we going over acronyms in in
programming well a couple of reasons one
you're gonna see these quite a bit and
it sucks to me that guy he's smiling and
nodding like you know what's going on
yeah and then you're like what the hell
is crud yeah especially when you're
getting started
you haven't sort of worked these into
your vocabulary and you're just a new
developer or it's just subjects you
haven't touched touched on all right
even if you're a senior dev there are
some crud some some acronyms that you
may not be familiar with and there's a
ton we're gonna go over twenty or so I
could probably do five five videos like
this if I wanted to but these are the
ones that I like I use and I think are
important so let's go ahead number one
crud I think I already said it right
what is crud crud is create read update
delete now what does that mean in its
context essentially it's referring to a
tool that at an application where you
can create data in the database get data
from the database that's the read update
data to a database and delete data from
database it's kind of an admin tool at
the end of the day or just the
functionality the crud functionality so
you know depending on if you're on the
back end or front-end but that's really
what it is
ability to create read after gently spa
not the jacuzzi
not the jacuzzi but a single page
application really referring to
technology like angular where the page
should never actually reloads you're on
that one page and you're just sort of
changing the way that looks saving
reload time and just having really a
single page at the end of the day so
Ajax stands for and you know it's funny
huh but when I mate when I was making
this list sometimes I've been saying
these acronyms for so long that I
actually forgot what the actual
definition was so Ajax asynchronous
JavaScript and XML it's essentially the
ability to go and you know do HTTP calls
at the end of the day that's really it
so that was one that I was like what is
Ajax mean again and so uh the DRI
principle what is dry don't repeat
yourself what does that mean does it
mean if someone doesn't hear you do not
speak up no but it does mean that when
you are modeling out your applications
when you are building them out that what
you want to do is you want to build it
in such a way that if you can inject it
elsewhere
you don't have to rewrite your code if
you can use it elsewhere you're not to
rewrite your code so it's really
creating the functionality of having to
only do something once won't getting as
much value out of it as you can so CLI a
command line interface
so you've heard me talk about the
angular CLI where we can use it to get
up and going there are a bunch of CLI
tools so that's one you may not be
familiar with I was already a developer
when I didn't know this next one what
it's not like oh it's a it's not like
these are bro mind-blowing concepts a
lot of times it's just like I never
looked it up API I didn't know until I
was already working as a developer what
API actually stood for and it stands for
application programming interface and
API is essentially just a third party
application that gives you access to
their data and and some functionality an
example would be the YouTube API where I
pull down my subscribers dynamically and
so it's always updating on my website
right CDN content delivery network this
is really nothing more than the a server
that's giving you files right so if
you've ever had to use bootstrap and you
didn't want to download it or install it
locally you can go and use the CDN which
will host those files there for you
which is kind of cool right kind of nice
CMS content management system that's
things like WordPress where you know
WordPress is probably the most popular
CMS out there where it allows us to
easily update our web pages to easily
update the content to manage the content
you can have CMS's on top of custom web
applications for certain aspects as well
but that's the related CMS's Dom do em
not the dude from fast and furious 19 or
whatever they're on now the document
object model this is essentially the way
the the stand the internet standard for
how the web page should be if it's kind
of very basic way of putting it so when
you're working in all these different
browsers they should adhere to the Dom
which is going to a lot which is going
allow you as a developer to know that
certain aspects exist and how to target
those so it's it's a lot more detailed
than that but that's that's a very brief
understanding of it
so yes Eckman script so if you see es
you might see es in place of js4
javascript but es Ekman script is the
technical name and the organization that
updates javascript that's all I got for
that one all right I II is to may
surprise you but the letters ie don't
stand for an eye wording e where it
actually is moving on
IIF II immediately invoked function
expression this is a JavaScript term I'm
not quite sure if this is
used in other languages but this is
essentially a function that you write in
your code where it gets called at
runtime when the document loads
immediately immediately in the sense
that you don't need to call it it's
already set up to always call and so you
might use this for a variety reason this
may be to initialize some values you
might use it to to kick off some sort of
counter you might there's a ton of
different reasons but essentially it's a
way of writing a function that will
allow you to have it go on
load JSON JavaScript object notation
JSON is a is a good one if you're not
familiar to JSON essentially is how we
send our data to and from write we send
a string of five JavaScript object
that's really what JSON is it's a
stringify JavaScript object that we then
turn into an object and then sometimes
we turn the object back into a string
and send it back to the database reason
for that is it's easier to store the
data it's more cost-effective I have no
doubt to just in a string than the send
a full object so you have all this sort
of very practical reasons why we use
JSON so it seems to be the standard so
the mean slash Myrna I want to keep this
as one but the Mongo these are
essentially web stacks full stacks web
sacks and JavaScript in Emme VN pretty
soon with the way view is growing so so
you have MongoDB as the M Express is the
e which is a sort of a back-end
framework if you won't think of that
that's used with node which is what the
N is and then the a our V is a angular
react or view so these are just a full
stack Java Script stacks that you're
gonna be using or that you could be
using down the road oh my goodness
model-view-controller all right this is
the MVC I'm so I I gave it away before I
said the letters I blame the Cal MVC
this is the this is a lot of how web
applications nowadays are organized you
have your model which is or your data
structure you have your view which is
the way that it looks and then you have
the controller which handles the logic
between the model and the view and you
know sends data to and from basically
and does all the logic so it's it's a
it's just a way of essentially
programming web applications
architecting it out ok opie
object-oriented programming something a
lot of web devs who may just be getting
started and weren't in a traditional
computer science program may not have
been exposed to although it's not a
super complex concept in my opinion it
is so a different way of thinking so
object-oriented programming essentially
means that you're building out your
classes which and you're doing you're
building classes and constructors and
it's a different way of programming in
terms of how you model your code as well
we have org it's almost a way of
organizing your code although a lot I
think a lot of people would disagree
with me but you treat things as objects
right take my cat might be out of the
might inherit from the class biological
animal and it may have its own unique
properties such as legs and whiskers and
then it might have functions such as
meow and am i taking a property and so
you start treating it and then you
create an instance of cat and then you
can keep creating that and it almost
works with the DRI principle as well
where you don't want to pre repeat
yourself because I have three cats why
would I write three three different cat
functions right different cat classes or
objects anyhow we've spent enough time
on this one a ski was a ski I didn't
know what a ski stood for a matter of
fact I didn't even know that it was an
acronym till I did some research about
things I should do a ski is the American
Standard Code for information
interchange now you know if you knew
that one you're like I don't believe
don't believe you but if you did in the
comments you can say you did well
believe you but uh ask you at the end of
day is a way to numerically keep track
of characters and create a standard that
will work anywhere in the world in
theory although the American Standard in
America we have our own standards which
is why we're only only people not on
metric - maybe one of their country but
that's that's not a carrier they're FTB
FTP File Transfer Protocol is basically
just the ability to send files to and
from file servers and and other
applications all you guy knows it's you
send files and you get files that's
pretty much a SDK software development
kit this is software that will help
allow you to use their other software or
maybe just the software itself but
that's that's really I say best yeah
you'll use it for various software
applications as you're moving on as
you're expanding it could be writing you
know the SDK for c-sharp
for some library or whatever it may be
it could be anything and finally last
but not least because we could be doing
this all day uit user acceptance tests
is this one that I didn't know until my
recent job because I never had to have
anything use UI T before cuz I was just
doing the UI T I realized so UI T
essentially means that after you get
done building your what you think is the
the project what you think is the
feature it goes off to a higher power of
to be and they say that is right Dylan
often not they say that's all right
Dylan how can we fix this to make it
good Dylan so it's basically says you
just send up to the perixx devii to say
hey is this what you wanted that's
that's it and if it is you be a pass UI
T if it's not it comes back and then you
make some changes so I hope you guys
found this helpful small that's fun try
to keep it a little you know we're
learning here we got to keep it a little
spicy so I will see you guys next I
don't forget to comment like subscribe
