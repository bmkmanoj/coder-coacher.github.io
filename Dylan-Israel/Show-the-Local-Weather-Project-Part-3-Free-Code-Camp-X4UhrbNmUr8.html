we were talking about how to concatenate
a string the reason why the string we
have in there currently will bring up
some city called shins we choose ng and
this isn't our current geo location so
what we have to do is just concatenate
the string in here so that these values
right here the latitude and the
longitude aren't hard-coded in that will
allow us to get the user's geolocation
and then we'll be able to do some things
with that because who cares about the
weather on the other side of the world
in this example we just care about
what's going on in our lives so do you
make note that if you put a space this
will affect weight what's what will
happen to you I just learned that the
hard way
so check you know don't don't do it that
way all right then we're going to delete
the longitude here okay and you'll
notice that I have console dot log down
below here where it's going to be
printing out the city and the API so
let's see here go ahead and save this
and made a print no all right so let's
try this let's put in the okay here it
is so this is what my Korean geolocation
so let's go ahead and see if it worked
if I can select it alright so just a
little browser and you'll notice that
the longitude and the latitude is say my
living Glendale I don't even know where
Glendale is and it's not where I live I
kind of do right around yeah
so I was expecting to say la I live in
LA technically but so it's pretty it's
pretty accurate I just never go to
Glendale
alright so cool so you'll see that now
it's actually pulling our geo data and
we can do some stuff with it so what are
we gonna do next so there's a couple
things now that we have everything
working the next things that we're gonna
do is we're gonna actually get the
temperature get the wind speed you get
the city name and everything else and
then we're gonna start styling it and
then we'll get into the more complex
stuff of how to switch out the
backgrounds so this is how you catenate
the string with your geolocation as
always guys thanks for watching see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
