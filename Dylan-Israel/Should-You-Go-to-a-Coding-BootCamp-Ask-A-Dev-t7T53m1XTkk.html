you should go to a coding bootcamp and
if you decide to I can make sure that
you're prepared and also make sure that
you avoid the cliche mistakes that a lot
of entry levels of l pers make to make
sure that you hit the ground running and
land that junior role as soon as
possible before we get started since I
know a lot of people go to boot camps to
get a break into the field maybe they
already have a degree and they're
looking to or their current student and
they're looking to transition to
something else because college isn't
working out for them I want to do a
quick shout out to way up there'll be a
link in the description that you can
click I'll get like 75 cents if you sign
up the entire site is free that's not
like a paid site basically what they do
is they help recent graduates or current
students you have to have a dot edu
email so it's it's pretty much for
previous college students or current
college students that they help them get
entry-level jobs and internships that's
their whole goal is to get entry-level
jobs and internships I know a lot of
people going to boot camps are are
interested in that and maybe you had
ache you were in college and you're you
might have a edu email so check this out
so I have always been very Pro bootcamp
mainly because from although I've never
attended a boot camp it has been what I
would want to go to you know college
wasn't something that I really enjoyed
and I ended up going down the
self-taught route which has its own
challenges and I think I would have
overcame a lot of things quicker if I
went to boot camp now with that fastness
also would have came dead a lot dead
probably about ten thousand dollars on
the low end of debt but I would have
probably became a developer quicker than
I than I did so from a from a my
experience standpoint I've gone to
several introduction days one at code
Smith wanted one at coding dojo I've
also been sponsored in the past by dev
Mountain
and coincidentally I've went to their
Provo Utah headquarters or not
headquarters there their building where
that they do their cohorts and I've
interviewed about 10 different
developers from various boot camps I
have a podcast that I'm doing with a
hack reactor grad Nicholas Mendoza and
I've done research about boot camps and
my good friend Matt Tran from engineered
truth he he went to that mountain as
well and we've talked extensively about
that so I'm I would say that as someone
who's never gone to boot camp I think I
have a pretty good understanding based
off of my interactions I interviewed
somebody yesterday about their boot camp
experience for instance so I have a and
I oh and I work with I've worked with
several developers who have gone to boot
camps and aren't traditional CS grads
now before I start this I kind of wanted
to say that just kind of give some some
backstory as a working developer who has
worked with boot camp grads and and can
see that the the very talent from a boot
camp it's just that it varies greatly
and I would say that if you wanted the
easiest barrier of entry you know the US
Bureau of Labor Statistics will show you
that the entry-level
experience for a software developer is a
bachelor's degree so everyone's
situation is different but in terms of
getting started in the industry a
bachelor's in computer science will
probably be the best thing for you but I
I I can tell you that I hated college
and I understand that's not something
for everybody and and so a boot camp may
be a good decision so who should go to a
boot camp who shouldn't right well I
will tell you who shouldn't from a very
practical standpoint of if you already
have a degree even if it's a liberal
arts degree even if it's in literally
underwater basket-weaving you have a
degree and that's almost good enough to
have a check mark some of the best
developers if you remember a while back
I had a PHP developer
on my channel and he was an old
co-worker of mine from a couple years
back and his degree he's a senior
developer now his degree is in US
history or history but it's a history
degree completely unrelated software and
then he went and taught himself skills
and probably at some point you realized
that he didn't want to be broke all his
life working in history right there's
not probably too many high paying jobs
for a history degree no disrespect to
those of you who are history majors or
anything like that just an objective
standpoint and then Whitney taught
himself this you know I've a lot of
times people are very concerned about
going and getting that CS degree and
it's good if you don't have a degree if
you already have a bachelor's I think
you're better served learning skills on
your own building a portfolio and really
considering going to a boot camp if
that's something that you're willing to
take out the money to do I think it's
probably a pretty good investment cuz
you already have your bachelor's and now
what you really need are your skills
because working in software as well most
things where you need you need to have
skills that a lot of other other career
paths don't have a lot of things don't a
lot of a lot of careers don't
necessarily have technical skills that
are very very hard a lot of times it's
you kind of do the same thing every day
and maybe after a month maybe after two
maybe even after three you're even if
you weren't that great you're pretty
much gotten 90% of it down doesn't work
like that in software you really have to
continue learning continue grinding and
continue to evolve and real quick I must
show this one little segment of a survey
from Stack Overflow
this is a quarter but the segment's
taking a stack overflows 2017 survey of
which 90% of developers that were
surveyed I believe it was about 50,000
or so people answered the survey on
their site can consider themselves
self-taught you know and are self-taught
it's one of the major ways they've
learned rather and the reason for the
is because of the industry that we are
in and a lot of people and I bring this
up because a boot camp for people is not
the end-all be-all no matter if you have
a bachelor's degree and you just want to
pick up something else or if you are you
straight out of high school say look
that's just going into boot camp yeah I
just want something I want to fill in
the gaps of my knowledge I want to get
go going it's a great opportunity and
you can always go back to school and
maybe if you've already put your foot in
the industry you might even be able to
get some employers to pay for it right
I've had managers who you know their
previous employers or their current
employers have paid for their their
bachelor's or their master's or various
certifications because I want to keep
you around as a developer like the
average developers there for 18 months
on average so if they're able to pay for
your bachelor's or your master's and
that's the you're basically guaranteeing
that hey this guy's not go anywhere for
four or five years so there's always
that option but in terms of how to
prepare for a boot camp I have always
had this stance and this comes from
talking with people who are in in boot
camps that and every every boot camps
different right so the barrier of entry
in certain boot camps is much harder or
less it depends on the barrier of entry
per boot camp so hack reactor is
probably the most most renowned coding
boot camp that there is and I forget the
exact statistic but I think it said
something like they accept like 3
percent of the applicants so if you're
accepting 3 percent of the applicants
everybody's going to be amazing
you filtered out 97% and the 2-pack
reactor grads that I've met are
brilliant but when you have other boot
camps that are taking in 50% of
applicants naturally or more right or
just say hey cut the check baby and
you're in and it's not really on the
bootcamp that's really on the individual
of not being prepared but
you have that you will have those
bootcamp grads who aren't going to be up
up to snuff if you will that's such a
bad saying up to snuff I don't even know
where that came from
yeah but they aren't going to be where
they need to be and there's a couple of
reasons for that that I think anyhow
where a lot of people are 70% of people
hate their jobs I've quoted this stat
numerous times but basically seven out
of ten people don't like the job that
they're in the other don't make enough
money it's not challenging enough
there's no passion in it they don't
enjoy it and it makes a missed rule so
you have something like a boot camp that
in if you just kind of played the cold
hard facts of three months $10,000 but
look at how high these incomes are and
look at this in-demand skill set that
you could go something from you know and
let's talk about Nicholas vanozza who I
do my podcast with who was a chef to now
making six figures after a three-month
boot camp online through hack reactor
and it's just continuing to grow and
develop and just you know completely
transformed his life so you have success
stories like this and then people say
you know what this is for me right
without ever having any real experience
in coding and say I don't know that this
is for me and like the good example that
I give is I did I did some research
about I want to know why people who've
gone to boot camps don't like wouldn't
recommend boot camps right and because
there is for every person that says that
you know they had a great experience
instead of a lot there's probably a
person or two that that says it was
awful experience and they didn't you
know get anything out of it and some are
some are very funny a very nice
gentleman posted a video on youtube
about you know when I signed up for this
I knew I wanted a change in direction
and like it was a good opportunity but I
didn't realize I didn't realize that I
would be sitting down and looking at
computer screens all day encoding all
right so that's not on the bootcamp now
there are a few a few things that are on
the bouquet and the reason I bring
enough
I think is funny but uh the point the
point of that being is that that
gentleman was woefully unprepared for
the boot camp and probably just got
accepted because he willing to spend the
money now you could say oh well you know
it's up to the boot camp to to filter
these people out and make sure that they
have some skill going into a boot camp I
tend to agree but at the end the day
they're business right
much like much like college the barrier
of entry is very low and they'll still
take your checks all right
so same thing with boot camp but so I
don't really fault them for that you you
do need to your research I know a lot of
people know a lot of videos I watched
where people the people who I find to be
unsuccessful in boot camps are those who
do not prepare I recommend and I've
talked to people who've attended boot
camps and landed roles successfully that
that you should be studying
if the boot camps three months you
should be studying six months before the
boot camp and don't be one of those
people who who says you know what I'm
just going to two weeks from now I hate
my job
two weeks from now boot camp starts
let's go don't be that guy you really
need to be prepared you you should in
theory and this is gonna seem very
counterintuitive but you shouldn't
Theory already know how to code before
you go into a boot camp a boot camps job
isn't really to teach you how to code
it's to give you the skills that are in
demand make you a better coder I'm not
saying you gotta be you know a junior
developer level but you should know what
a for-loop is you know there there are
the there are those examples of people
the people who are successful boot camps
took the time to prepare and study I
went to the iron yard about a year ago
as my first time I went to a meet-up in
st. Petersburg when I got down here I
was like cool it was like an open code
thing and they had some of their their
cohorts some of the the members there
that were attending and the next week
they were starting to react and I was
talking with this guy and I was
whiteboarding some stuff out and he was
clearly lost and nothing look I'm not
trying to pick on the sky or anything
but the point I'm trying to bring up
is that he was struggling with a for
loop in the next it was that Friday and
on Monday he was supposed to be starting
react this is clearly a gentleman who
took no time to prepare for the bootcamp
and wanted to transition for um I
believe he was in a design role before
it's been it's been a while but but my
point being is that that he's not going
to be somebody who's going to succeed
and I ended up going to to their
graduation I did not see him there I
don't know if he dropped out or or what
happened but you need to prepare for for
boot camps and you need to understand
that you're not gonna learn everything
in three months you're not and the
reason that 90% of the developer said
that they're self-taught is because they
vents continuing to continually teaching
themselves things year after year after
year and a lot of the people like who
posted videos on on YouTube that I've
you know our anti boot camp they'll tell
you that yeah I don't study every day or
yeah I kind of graduate and I don't want
to go into because I don't even know
that they like it right and that's part
of why you need to study beforehand you
may in that three to six month study
period figure out you know what I
understand that this is a high paying
career I understand that it's an
in-demand skill set this just something
for me I you know I've been miserable at
my last job I don't need to be miserable
at my next job and invest time and
energy and money into it and that's okay
right so that's also part of the process
is you need to find out is this even for
you is this something that you want to
do so there are those people who go to
the boot camp and they just think look
I'm just gonna get a certificate it'll
land me a job in blah blah blah I know I
know Matt and I got a few good laughs at
one of the grads from dev Mountain who
was playing like League of Legends
during the boot camp like during the day
just on campus and playing video games
and instead of working on his projects
can do better and it'd be one thing if
you use like a coding guy but this guy
you know barely had anything going for
him through his projects and whatnot for
it from what I've been told
but don't be one of those people
so if you are considering going to a
boot camp my sort of round and summarize
this up if you already have a degree you
probably don't need to go back for a CS
degree if anything I would say just
study prepare go the self-taught route
because you're gonna need to learn how
to teach yourself anyhow in this field
it's one of its one of the one of those
skills that in today's world it used to
be you go you get your degree
and then go to work it's not like that
anymore right you go maybe you get a
degree let's say you do you get a degree
you go to work and then you continue
your learning on your own time you
continue your learning and and continue
to develop and and it's a it's a it's a
different world and it especially goes
for software development so I hope you
guys are preparing if you do consider
going to a boot camp I tend to be very
pro boot camp but also I want to make it
very clear that you need to prepare
three to six months beforehand you need
to work your ass off during the boot
camp some people think oh well you know
they really don't put in 60 to 80 hours
no they do and you should so if you
think you're just gonna go in there for
40 hours a week just just know you
really it's immersive it's called a boot
camp for a reason right so you need to
dive all in and then when you graduate
you need to start hitting those job apps
but you also need to continue studying
studying studying studying because
you're not gonna pick up everything in
three months and I I look you can pick
up some things you know I can pick up
everything and you're gonna need to
continue that and you're going to need
to do things like you know make your
portfolio site make a make a side
project all the stuff that I harp on
time and time again go to you're gonna
still need to go to meetups you're gonna
need to gain new skills so if you are
considering boot camp keep all that in
mind and I encourage you to watch some
of the other boot camp grads as well as
the current boot camp
videos that I have on my channel to see
what other people who are actually in
the program say these just my thoughts I
