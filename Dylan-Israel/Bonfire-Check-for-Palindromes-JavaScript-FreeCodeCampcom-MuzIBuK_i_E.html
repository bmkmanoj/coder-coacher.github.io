camp we're working on getting our free
developer certificate we're in basic
algorithm scripting check from
palindromes as you can see here I
already did it I reset it and I think
that's just a better way to go for these
that are gonna be a little bit more
complex so even though these videos are
gonna be relatively short I'll explain
as I go so what a palindrome is is
simply a word that is spelt backwards
and for its racecar as an example they
give and they they suggest using string
dot replace and a string to lowercase so
because they didn't bring up regular
expressions which would be how you
normally would probably do something
like this because what's gonna happen is
we're gonna need to sort through our
strings just so that we take out all the
special characters and stuff like that
all we want is basically numbers and
letters so the best way to start it is
you can see we're passing some stuff
right now buts so for instance I is
returning true everything's returning
true so first thing we need to do is
we're taking in a string parameter and
because it's case sensitive the the
easiest thing to do is just reset the
string to be lowercase so now it's let's
go let's return STR every time so we can
see what's going on here we'll just put
this as I it should all return oops
dot to lowercase it should all return so
now it's returning lowercase school so
we know that's working so what else do
we need to do so we're gonna need an if
statement and we're gonna need a couple
variables in this case we want to what
everyone do we want a cait we're gonna
have a new word we're gonna save our
copy is equal to STR so we're just
creating a secondary string and then
we're going to replace
a few things so in this case we're just
gonna should return true so we're gonna
say if copy is equal to our current
string return true this is exactly equal
or chunchu and else return false well
right now we're not gonna reinvest so
this should return true cool because
these are obviously same but we're not
we're still not a compliment
Shane much so race car is equal to race
car okay that make sense but we want to
then we have to reverse the words so
that's really what we're gonna do for
copy so what we're gonna do is say we
want to split the word where for every
character that's why there's no space
hearing it's better use single quotes
and then we want to reverse the word
reverse the character array so what's
going on is we're splitting every
character into a every character of the
string into a character array we're
reversing the values of each one of
those characters so they all switch
spots and then we're gonna join them
back together so that with no spacing in
between so now let's see if that works
so in this case it still doesn't return
true because we're not we haven't got
rid of the spaces yet so this is a like
I said there's a better way to do this
and how I did it
just because regular expressions will
probably use significantly less data so
let's go ahead we have to alter our
original string and we're gonna do that
with a for loop so we're gonna say for I
r VAR I so we're gonna create our I is
equal to zero start at zero and we're
going to say why I is less than our
original string dot length so the total
length of the string we want to add one
each iteration so the first thing that
would probably be the easiest is let's
remove all the spaces so our race car
passes so we're gonna say SG r is equal
to s qi r dot replace ant poops sorry
not for place and what are we replacing
we're replacing spaces so what we want
to do is that and what we want to
replace it with no spaces so this should
let our racecar pass so see now it
returned race car so if let's just go
ahead and cut this out and you can see
that it's gonna when we put race car
it's gonna combine the word race car and
flip it in this case it doesn't flip but
you wouldn't be able to tell either way
so cool so that's why that's working so
what else so we can add an else
statement here that says else return
false but we'll just put this in here
and we'll comment this out for now
because we want to see if it doesn't
return true we want to see what it's
returning so cool so not a pounder I'm
sure to return false so in this case a
man a plan a Canal Panama so when we
remove so you can see that it's kind of
working it's reversing things but it's
not it's not removing the commas and
though the we're checking for that so
what what can we do
first thing exactly like removing the
spaces so let's go ahead and do STR dot
equals STR so our string is equal to our
string we're placing the commas oh and
use single quotes
it's the JavaScript convention and we're
not gonna replace them with anything so
we just want to remove it so cool so you
can see we've removed all the commas so
what next we have a period there so we
want to do STR is equal to SC r dot
replace and same thing we're going to
remove a period now the reason I did a
for loop is for whatever reason when I
was doing this is it kept on only
replacing one so that then the for loop
I don't know if that's how
that's supposed to work but hey we'll
see what happens so you know we're
replacing the period and now it returns
true nice so what else do we have left
for true so you can see right here this
is the one where you're like oh man this
is like we kind of use regular
expressions so when we put this in we're
gonna have to replace a whole lot of
stuff without using regular expressions
because all we want to compare in this
one is essentially the numbers more or
less oops so you see right here there's
a couple things with that we we would
have to remove for this to work the
first thing could be this slash so let's
go ahead and remove the slash we say SG
r equals STR dot replace the slash with
that that you see right there so the
slash is removed and what else just the
underscore and the dash and everything
should be good to go although we may
have to I'm not sure what's considered
special characters and what's not I know
everything from 1 to 0 is considered a
special character so you may have to
remove all those as well
granted it's looks like a lot of
needless work but in this case we are
simply checking for the zeros more or
less at least that's how I understand it
so you can see right here we remove that
and let's go ahead and copy this one
more time and then we can replace this
with a dash and we still have all these
special characters so this is what we're
still trying to get rid of and again
this is why I suggest maybe just doing
the the regular expressions but they
don't bring that up so we're using
string dot replace
and we'll go ahead and do this and we'll
replace it again with nothing so we
round that cool and then I'm gonna go
ahead and copy this and we'll just
change the order at which this is going
um excuse me cool
so we basically removed all the things I
remember special characters are kind of
I believe one through zero or that whole
top line of your keyboard but a : I
don't believe is considered special
characters it's part of a regular
character I guess so it looks like all
our true statements are working so now
when we let's get rid of to returning a
string let's just check our quick false
false false false oh cool take it out
and let's put our else statement back in
here now that we're done checking
palindrome and let's clean our code up a
little bit here we'll run it and it
looks like everything works and as
always we are going to put some comments
in here just so that when we look back
at it we can see what's going on here
and we'll say change string to lower
case so no case sensitive issues and
this may seem like oh man this is all
like obviously but when you haven't
looked at your code for six months or
whatnot you'll appreciate this so loop
to replace special characters without
using regular expressions
and here we create a copy of our string
and reverse it and the rest of this is
pretty intuitive and we could it looks
like it wants just so by default it
returns false cool so I'm just making
sure it works in the next challenge
free code camp here yeah let's see what
we're gonna be doing we are going to
find the largest the longest word in a
string so it's just well probably it
looks like we're using da split and dot
length so I'll see you guys in the next
video and as always questions comments
concerns and anything constructive is
always appreciated thanks for watching
the video don't forget to Like and
subscribe that helps me out a ton and I
appreciate all the comments that I get
and all the questions I get in the
comments and I'm happy to answer them so
keep them coming and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
