going to be doing learning UJS part
three build a angularjs wikipedia api
now let's take a quick look at what
we're gonna be building you'll see right
here we're gonna have our a little bit
of selfless promo here
but we're also gonna have this link
right here that's gonna search a random
Wikipedia article we just used an image
to do so we're also going to be able to
search in the Wikipedia thing here and
go ahead and click search and then
you'll see you'll get a link from the
API that we're then going to be able to
go and pull up this this Wikipedia page
as well as a paragraph description and
we're just gonna separate it with the
horizontal rule so not a lot of styling
but we're gonna be using the wikipedia
API in this one we're gonna be doing it
in angularjs if you're interested in
doing in jQuery I have other videos
doing that as well
but right now let's go ahead and get
started by creating a new pin first
thing that we're gonna need to do here
is for me I'm gonna go ahead and go into
settings real quick and go to behavior
and then we want to turn off auto
updating just gives us a little bit of a
headache and then we're gonna attach the
library in this in this video we are
going to be using angular so in our
JavaScript and we're also going to be
using in our CSS a little bit of
bootstrap so let's go ahead and add
those to everything right now and we'll
get started I'd like to get started by
getting our app going so first thing we
need to do is create our application
we're gonna do this by create a variable
called app we're gonna set this equal to
angular dot module and then we're gonna
name our application in here this week
II app is the name of the app when we
call it in our HTML we're going to not
call app we're going to call wiki app so
now that we've done that we've a
stanchion this variable which is
our application in here this would be
where our dependencies go and this in
this example we don't have any
dependencies we still have to include
this empty array if you had some
additional dependencies you could of
course included there now we're gonna go
ahead and create a controller to do that
we're gonna call our app and our
JavaScript app and I say dot controller
and then we're gonna name our controller
similar to how we named our wiki app
except it's gonna be we key ctrl for
controller and then in here we're gonna
take a we're gonna have a function
that's gonna take in a variable called
scope this is what's gonna bind our data
which we should our this should be
somewhat review but I'm gonna be going
over it as we as we continue on and
we're also going to be passing in this
HTTP which should also be review
parameter which will allow us to do our
get API calls in this example we did we
didn't we did our API calls a little bit
differently so don't don't get too
confused about that but let's go ahead
and finish up our setup here cool so if
you've watched some of my videos some of
the reasons one of the things I like to
do personally is I like to go ahead and
I'd like to create a variable called VM
and set that equal to our scope object
just to make things a little bit better
and shorthand when we're doing angular
it saves us a little bit of typing room
you don't have to do this if you just
want to do scope or if this is confusing
anyway for you now the next thing we're
gonna do now that we've set up the
basics of it and we can go ahead and
what I like to do to make sure I didn't
make any syntax errors in code pen or
anything like that I'll just create a
simple variable we'll call VM test I'll
set this equal to works this is what I
like to do when I'm studying in my app
just make sure I don't before I hit the
ground running everything's good to go
right now we're not doing anything with
our data so don't really sweat it
so in our HTML we're just gonna create a
body tag here and in our body tag we're
going to fine our application the way
that we do that is with the ng app
directive and we're going to set it
equal to our we key app the same name
that
in here in our angular module so you
know vici - or vici app excuse me this
is basically gonna be the scope of where
our application is gonna run now let's
go ahead and do that now we need to
define the scope of where controller is
going to run in our example I only have
one controller but you can have multiple
controllers in our app so we're gonna go
ahead and do this with ng - controller
and we're gonna name the controller here
so in here it was we named it we key
ctrl now that we have that setup we have
everything we have - this this line 4
and 5 is the basics of what you need to
set up your angular application and this
is a good place to test to see if our
data is working so we're gonna our VM
duck test we're just gonna go ahead and
console dot log test and I'll constable
log it but output it and when we run it
you'll see that right here it's small
but we have the word works that means
our angular app is set up our data
binding is working properly and
everything is good to go so what we're
gonna do next is we can go ahead and get
rid of this variable now if you want to
do it the same way instead of actually
if you remember correctly I'm just go
ahead and pull up the file real quick in
our application when I did this I put
angularjs Wikipedia API free code camp
intermediate for any projects and I did
this YouTube API section so the only
thing that's gonna be different is you
can go ahead and put by you know your
name we're gonna go ahead and just
continue to make the same thing as me
because I want people to find this and
then go to my channel so uh that's the
way we're gonna do it that way but uh
basically uh you should just put by your
name by your LinkedIn or whatever it is
that you want to promote yourself now to
get started there's a couple things that
we should do first we should get rid of
this test values now that we know
everything's working the next thing that
we can do is we can go ahead and create
our header so the way I did it was I had
an h1 tag where we put in angularjs with
P API and I created a object here now
you could you could hard code this in
there I don't like to do it
because I find it a little bit easier
just to find the object but it really is
just up to you how you prefer to do this
and how you prefer to organize your code
I think it's a little easier to organize
our code this way so we're gonna have
this key value project pair here and
we're just gonna pass an angular J s
Wikipedia API and then we're gonna pass
in another thing that we're gonna put
site you can name these whatever you
want I just named it site I try to name
things to be as intuitive as possible
this is gonna be our free code camp
going foot - intermediate front and
projects and then for me I have now this
is would be where you it's going to
close that this would be excuse me where
you would set up your your name in my
example I'm going to be doing my channel
so you do my name we're gonna do my
channel so just so I follow my code so I
don't make any hair salon the way and
then in this example we have youtube.com
slash coding tutorials 360 now this is
typically how I if I know the data
before hand if I know the the content
that I'm going to be outputting I always
will do it in this fashion I'll just
kind of get this static what I call
static data out stuff that's not gonna
change for the most part and then I'll
have my channel URL which is going to be
the past in later on for the ng href so
we're having youtube.com slash coding
tutorials 360 cool so we have this
header info in our controller like so
and now what we're gonna do is we're
gonna go over here and just start
connecting the data now that we have it
set up so in our h1 we are going to call
header and photo project header info dot
project and then we're gonna do the same
thing in an h3 tag it's gonna close this
now not close it keep it a little bit
open I had our info dot
let's go to h3 first so have h3 now that
we have that we're gonna go ahead and
create a header info site and then we'll
we'll go ahead and test that as well
it's gonna run this cool so you see all
our stuffs connecting now I try to
include a different library or a
different different skill sets in each
one of these and so one thing that I'm
going to include is font awesomes icons
if you're not familiar with fun awesome
hee-hee I don't know if it's a team or
one guy but basically makes hundreds of
icons and they're there you wildly use
around the web and it's something you
should probably get comfortable with
using this open source circuit of stuff
and you can buy enterprise applications
you just had a successful Kickstarter
for font awesome five that raised like
seven hundred thousand dollars you know
god bless him and the in the open source
community and things like that but so
I'm gonna introduce you to font awesome
real quick but before we do that we're
gonna go ahead and create a anchor tag
and this we're going to href where you
use ng atria the reason you use ng href
is so that it loads this in time if you
have a lot of angular and your
applications loading longer it may take
a second for this to load and someone
may click this before it does so we're
just holding off on that basically it's
a little more complicated than that but
that's really the basics of what you
need to know and we want it to open a
new page so we're gonna set it equal to
target is equal to blank now once we
have that going we're gonna go ahead in
our anchor tag we're gonna wrap this
with an h2 because we want our content
to be larger now we haven't put that
content in there yet but we will shortly
it's going to save that now to use font
awesome you're going to need to go ahead
and import a few things you're gonna
copy this so I'll show this on the
screen just for a moment but actually
I'll put it in the in the video as well
so you're going to go into your header
section now if you're doing this in text
section this is being your head section
but we just need to connect our font
awesome Dodman CSS file which is in
version 4.7 oh so this is the old
version he just got the kick starter
when this video is going to come out for
I think he might have a week to go for
fun awesome five but now that we have
that going we have oo also we have a
spelling syntax mistake here but now
that we've imported our font awesome
we're gonna have to connect a icon the
way that the icons work there's a couple
different ways so a couple different
things you need to know it's all pretty
pretty intuitive so you're gonna have
this eye class and then not Li just I so
this is where your icon goes you don't
actually need to put anything in here
what you need to do is pass a class
that's going to be equal to fall so it's
always the faust answer font awesome and
then the name of the class in our
example a beef ah - YouTube - play and
let's go ahead a real quick and give
this guy some love and go to just type
in font awesome real quick so you can
see all the great icons that they have
and the guy has released a ton of stuff
and so let's go icons so 675 on icons
and font awesome
I believe there's even a free code camp
one now so there's free code camps the
newest one so you know anyone anyone who
supports free code camp is a friend of
mine and you can see they have
everything calendars bull's eye bugs so
you can use this for a lot of things and
that's why I really wanted to include it
as kind of you know the small additional
library to get familiar with so in here
we include faut Ashbaugh - youtube -
play and then because we're gonna do
some CSS later I'm gonna go ahead and
apply this You Tube icon now this isn't
you don't need to do this for fun
awesome this is something that we're
going to do in our own CSS but now when
we run it we have our icon let's go
ahead and pass in our channel info at
this point
put a space because we wanted to just
look a little bit nicer and here we have
our header info dot my channel are you
in your case maybe your LinkedIn or your
your portfolio and you'll see right here
we have our little link here this is
looking a little blue we don't really
like that we want it to really kind of
be that YouTube red and we don't have to
get too complicated with the actual red
there's a lot of stuff that we can do
for that but for the time being we can
just go ahead and pass in YouTube
actually I was like a specific offset of
red my understanding is I looked it up
one time when I did my portfolio I'm not
too anal about these certain things but
there we go it just looks a little bit
it's still gonna connect because we
wanted to but we'll have it there so we
have a are heading going right now not a
whole bunch of craziness now the next
section we're going to continue on with
adding our image so just as a reminder
because we've been going about 15 20
minutes you'll see we're gonna add this
image and we're connected to open up the
random API so let's go ahead and
continue on with that at this point we
will let's go ahead and jump on down now
the API to open up a random link is
pretty straightforward and has already
been included and the if you were doing
this through free code camp or if you're
not this is the API here so we're going
to in here in our in our angular
application we're going to create some
data binding and we're just going to
call this random link and this is going
to be the link that when we go to it
will take us to a random English link by
English I mean the English version of
Wikipedia API and this is it right here
you can pause the video and copy it but
it's n dot wikipedia.org slash wiki
slash special : a random and so when we
as we showed earlier in the video take
us to a random link now what we want to
do here is we want to go ahead
and create our image ID so we're gonna
pass in an image we're gonna give it an
ID to style later and we're just gonna
call this week e and then we're gonna
give it a source the source is where the
image comes from this was an image I
just got off of the internet so find any
image that you think is relevant pass it
in there let's go ahead and save this
real quick
and because image tags don't in html5
don't have a closing bracket we don't
have to include that so there's our
image tag not linked to anything yet but
what we want to do is we want to wrap it
in an anchor tag real quick now we're
gonna pass an ng - H ref here and then
we're going to on top of it we are going
to pass in our random link similar to
not similar exactly how we pass in my
channel info earlier swimmer pass in
random link the only difference is it's
not part of a parameter object it's just
its own variable so now i and you know
optional thing to do target equals to
blank i look this is something i
generally like to do save that now we
can run it it's always good to test
these little things as you go forward
and you'll see that now everything is
working we're at this random link page
now the next thing that we need to do is
we actually have to go ahead and create
a search bar now we're using bootstrap
which has a grid column system to get
started let's go ahead and create a a
container class so we have this body
this div here and the container we'll
bring everything in from the edges we
don't have we don't necessarily want
everything to touch and we're gonna add
a class called text center so container
and then we're gonna add this class text
- Center we're just gonna Center our
text now let's save that and run it and
now everything's looking a little
cleaner we're not gonna I usually don't
worry about too much CSS but sometimes
when you're doing your code it really
does help to format this piece by piece
just so things are organized so it
doesn't look super messy and it makes
you feel like you actually got
 done which is equally important you
know so you don't want to feel like you
didn't have anything get anything done
now that's centered I feel like I did
some stuff right now but uh so the next
thing we're gonna do is we're gonna
create a search bar real quick and in
our search bar we're gonna do it right
below here we're going to use the div
the row column system now if you're not
familiar with bootstrap in the row
column system basically you have a row
you know it goes left or right and then
you set up how many columns in that row
it's gonna take up bootstrap uses 12 so
if I wanted to have this search be half
of the screen and the or the search
button and then the search input it'd be
called - medium - 6 there's different
sizes for this based on pixels we just
do medium to get the point across and
then you would have half and half what
we want to do is actually just because
the search button is gonna be rather
small we're gonna have the column take
up 11 out of the 12 and then the search
button take up 1 so let's start that you
can go ahead and create this div class
set it equal to a row now you don't have
to do this but uh this is just something
that I will help you organize your code
a little bit and it's a little intro to
the basic bootstrap now chances are that
if you're doing angularjs you probably
have had some experience with HTML and
so this is mainly review but if it's not
um you know let's just continue on Oh
what was I doing here before I got lost
all right so we're creating it now we're
gonna create our div that is going to
have call - MD - 11 and as I said
earlier we're gonna go ahead and pass in
our input so we're gonna have this input
class with a class form control which is
just a bootstrap class which will impair
it some stuff some styling and all that
sort of stuff don't think too much about
it and then we're gonna have an NG model
so the reason so our NG model is how we
store data from the from the HTML
similar to how we have this random link
this is how we're gonna connect our HTML
to our random link for instance or our
in our in our as we go on our search
term so we're data binding works two
ways it's two-way binding currently
we've only been doing it one way we've
been doing it from the JavaScript to the
HTML now if we want to do from the HTML
to the JavaScript we need to use ng
model and that's what we're gonna do
right now so it's basically saying look
this variable is equal to this in the
JavaScript and we need to change that
value and that's what we're going to be
doing with our ng model right now so
we're gonna set up an NG model that's
going to be equal to search term this
would be equivalent to our VM search
term or our scope da search term so
we're gonna do this and then what else
did I have here we're gonna go ahead and
set a placeholder placeholder he's
certain nice it makes it look clean in
our input it's basically just gonna be
some some greyed out text that's gonna
make it look fancy like we know what
we're doing
and then we can go ahead and do some
other stuff in a second now let's go
ahead and run this make sure we have
some stuff that's working so you'll see
we have our placeholder this is taking
up 11 as this nice blur effect blurs
when it has something selected now that
we've done that let's go ahead and
create our search button our search
button is going to allow us to run the
function that's gonna do the API call
that's going to load all of this out now
we can do that right here
just below it and remember how we set up
this div to take up 11 rows we're gonna
go ahead and set the same thing for for
the button to only take up the remaining
one so do that and then we're gonna just
create an anchor tag so a href we're
gonna set this equal to
actually no HRF excuse me okay and in
here we're gonna use a bootstrap class
to style the button so that because
again this is just an anchor tag but we
want it to look a little bit nice like a
button so
use this BTN BTN primary we're also
gonna set the ID later on for search
that will you will use style it and then
we are going to actually that's it so
let's go ahead and put in here search
run this make sure our hTML is looking
pretty nice pretty fancy Oh
so this is now is it because I'm zoomed
in or let's see what the problem is so
we have this diff call md-11 trying to
see what the issue is so there's
something going on here where our stuff
isn't being put over nicely now let me
look at my code real quick make sure I
didn't mess up anything so we have this
and tidy our HTML a little bit so this
div goes here this div goes here and
this div goes here this div is
controller so div class is equal to row
I not import bootstrap I did all right
let's not worry about that too much when
we get back to why this isn't working
properly later on I actually don't do
anything with this search this is a
mistake in my code that I need to take
out which I'll do it out of my Korean
one and in our hash tag okay so let's
not worry too much about this search not
working we'll figure that out in a
little bit now before we move on we can
go ahead and we go I haven't styled up a
little bit before we do the HTML just
get get all that done now I just
assigned a simple background to our to
our body so we're just gonna say look to
contact the body and we have a
background image I should say so
background - image and we're gonna pass
in the URL for where that background
image is located again I just took this
from the internet so sorry if I'm
spamming your site it's gone
that make sure everything looks clean so
we don't want it necessarily to repeat
like that so there's a couple things
that we can do we can for one we can go
ahead and set on background I kind of
just like the simple one time but
everything is up to you this is just
some simple CSS so we can do background
- repeat and then no-repeat let's go and
run that and you'll see that that isn't
moving at all so but I actually isn't
repeating at all but I actually want it
to stay in the same place I don't want
it to move up and down like that
again just a preference same thing so
the way that we can do that is we can
use the background - attachment and we
can use fixed and let's go to save that
and run this and then cool so you see
how now the Wikipedia background isn't
moving at all now the next thing I want
to do is I don't want to use this little
font I'm gonna use lobster font you can
go ahead and get this font off of or any
font from Google's free API we're gonna
be throwing this into the header section
like we did with the font awesome stuff
save that and now we want to assign the
font which is going to be font - family
and because this is a third party font
or not a browser font we're go ahead and
just we need to use the quotes here use
lobster save it and now run it and this
should apply lobster to everything in
our body so it's looking a little
cleaner it doesn't actually do anything
yet but it's looking a little cleaner
but it's fun so next thing we want to do
is we want to go ahead and change the
background color of this wiki it doesn't
really stand out very well with this
with this white background so we're
gonna change the image a little bit so
let's go ahead and target that remember
we use the wiki ID for that and we're
gonna go ahead and I set a background -
color and we will set that - I guess
this color whatever I don't know how I
even came about this color so let's go
ahead and run that you're not gonna see
anything right now because it's oh we
will actually
so you'll see how these I don't
necessarily like the square so I want it
to be curved I thinking we were gonna
have a background on this but I guess I
was wrong
so we're gonna do border radius border
radius is how you're gonna curve the
corners now I believe that 50% it
actually becomes a circle if I remember
correctly if you want to do something
like that so that that's the background
though not the image but we actually
that's way too much we just want do 25
px to curb the corners or whatever you
think looks good so those are curved
corners but it's touching our search
input bar we don't really want that to
happen so we can do margin - bottom and
we'll go ahead and put 25 px it's gonna
run that and you'll see now it's lifted
up off the bottom the tops all right
nothing to really worry about there and
I don't think one second guys I'm
testing something in my other coat
because I have this line of code I don't
think actually does anything yeah so
alright cool let me go and take that out
it's funny my Regency sinks it's like I
get it to work and I was like cool it
works everything else so I don't
actually go back and look through here
but as I do them now I find like oh I
don't actually need this line i I just
display inline code but you know um now
that we're going through here one quick
thing that we can do is we can see do I
even want to do it I was gonna say we
can find out why our code isn't lining
up correctly but I think we can worry
about that in a little bit this really
should be Danish mongkhon so let's see
what happens when we set this equal to
six since see if that actually won't do
it differently
oh I see what's going on
so naturally I made a mistake so we need
to close our div right here we never did
now we may have one extra div tag and
we'll have to fix that later on which it
looks like we do so it's going to close
this div and then we need to remove one
of these dues as well so a simple
nesting issue now when we run this so
this needs to go back to one and then
the other one needs to go back to 11
it's funny how these little things
always bug you it's like we're doing
this complex a complex what we're doing
the angular it's like lisent this
centered properly okay so now our app
looks great it looks decent for the time
we've put into it I should say and now
when we type in hello and we search
nothing happens so let's go ahead and
change that and this is a pretty pretty
easy as far as things go
in seconds as my injury loop okay so
what I'm going to do right here is I'm
going to create a span right below that
is going to so right below this div
we're gonna have this is where our
content is going to go out the way that
we're gonna do this is we're gonna load
our div with some data or load our array
with some data and then we're gonna
enter repeat that data out in a certain
way so we're just going to create a
simple div close the div so I don't
makes a mistake and then in here we're
gonna go ahead and you don't need this
span really we could probably just put
in the div but since I likes falling the
same example as I did before we'll go
ahead and do this so ng-repeat is
basically says repeat every item in an
array now we're gonna have this info in
search term r0 now I'm gonna show you
what this means right now so this is uh
we're not doing anything this with this
yet but the way that we end up getting
our URL is first let's do our API call
let's set up our API call before I kind
of dive into this now we used to in the
last one we did a HTTP GET as a way of
doing that now because of the way that
the the wikipedia API is written it gets
a little complicated with that and we're
gonna do a traditional HTTP call to get
it to work the way that we do that is a
HTTP and then we're gonna pass in some
parameters and then the first thing that
we're gonna pass in is the URL this is
going to be the URL that we're gonna
need to get this to work now the first
part is this section here go ahead and
pass this in like so
so what's happening here is we're
basically setting we're saying look
what's the action the actions open
search and the open search basically
means you're gonna run a search and
search here we're setting what are we
running a search on and this is where
we're gonna pass in the plus V MDOT
search term now if I remember correctly
if I did the same thing so remember our
ng model here is actually the value that
were is in our input box so it's going
to concatenate that with whatever is in
our input box so that's what the search
term is and then we're going to add this
plus and we're going to add I mean
actually gonna call it up
copy it over so I don't make any any
mistakes so I'm gonna copy this over and
we're gonna add at format meaning we
want a JSON object so the format of the
data we're gonna get back is JSON and
the callback is going to be JSON
underscore callback now that's going to
be our URL but that's not the only thing
that we need to do we need to set up the
method to be a JSON P this is basically
why we have to do it as a in this
fashion rather than the simple HTTP GET
we've done in the past because it
requires a few more inputs than the
other one doesn't now on success meaning
that everything passed we're gonna pass
in a function that takes a response or a
but you know this could be your data
response this is a traditional way of
doing it and then we're gonna do
something with that data now right now
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
create an array up here remember how we
created this array right here search
term R now I think before we do that we
should console dot log out our URL to
make sure that it works now if it costs
dot logs and success
it means it's successfully ran and we
should be able to console log our URL
out it's just gonna get this actually we
may have to do it right here
actually uh let's console about log our
response and let's go ahead and run this
will pull up the console app in a second
so we'll type in hello and then we'll
search and now when we go to our console
you'll see we have all this data here
I'm not searched undefined so so what's
funny is this this ran right now but our
VM search term referred to undefined and
Sega didn't actually get our search term
which is interesting so let's go ahead
and see why that would be ngmodel is
equal to search term VM dog search term
undefined Jesus Christ you never you
never do this right the first time man
all right so let's go to our G model
search and your VM
 around by an undefined keys
ah so I see I see what happened so
remember how I said we're going to run
that we're in click search and it was
going to run
we haven't actually set this up to our
ng-click excuse me so I made I made a
little bit of a I goofed a little bit
here guys so um I forgot to set soo so
when we run this we're gonna it's going
to run undefined because it immediately
runs it right now
so what we actually need to do sorry
about this guys this is all correct so
far we need to set up this VM dot search
we key and we're going to set this equal
to a function and we're just gonna throw
everything we had in here into this
function we don't want this to run
automatically and that's what was going
on there how's the hell is going on okay
so let's go ahead and save that and now
let's clear the console want to make
sure everything's working alright I'm
gonna run that and you'll see now when
it refreshes nothing runs in here now
what we're going to use is the ng-click
directive on our search button remember
how we have our our search button where
is that right here so when this is
clicked we want it to go ahead and call
our search wiki now we're making the
assumption that of course it's going to
have something in there and it's going
to be able to search for it so we're not
gonna write any logic so if it's
undefined not to search for it or
anything like that we don't care about
that so it's going to run this and now
when we search we type in hello and we
click search pull this up and it did not
work why did it not work go back to my
code and it's because I I forgot to put
the brackets because there's a function
by this time I guarantee with about 50%
assurance that it's gonna run alright so
there we go so we have this object here
that's going to run very nicely so let's
go ahead and see if we can if we can
console dot log this here there's I want
to console a lot yes I'm gonna work
console dot log search vici dot zero now
I'll be very surprised that this works I
don't think we can do this within it
just a few things I want to test real
quick yeah okay forget that I just
wanted to copy over the URL so you guys
could see it but easy enough what we'll
do is uh I want to explain how we're
gonna set up our ng-repeat so we just
copy this over we're gonna go into a
actually before we do this we're gonna
get out this search term and the plus
and we're going to take out that and
we're gonna take out that and we're just
going to pass in the word hello right
here hello and now we'll have a working
API I think so we can see our data
object remember our JSON object so this
is what we're actually getting back from
our API call you'll see this is our
search term and then on index 0 our
index index 0 or index no excuse me
index 1 then the nested index we have
our titles than index 2 and then our
nested index the index through our
eunuch index 0 1 0 1 these are all index
0 and then nested indexes oh it'll make
a little sense it's a weird way of doing
this in all honesty it could have been
done a little bit cleaner but it's not
too bad so this is what our data objects
going to be so now all we have to do is
in our ng-repeat we're actually not
repeating anything yet because we
haven't added anything
to our array what we're gonna do is
we're gonna do VM dot search term R did
I already create that up here nope so
let's go ahead and do that so we're
gonna do V m dot search term R and we're
gonna set that equal to an empty array
this is gonna be the array right here
and then we're gonna search term r dot
push and what do we want to push we want
to go ahead and push response and then
index one which will be the titles and
then we want to go ahead and push index
two which will be the descriptions and
then we want to go ahead and push the
links to those articles which will be
the links now what are we gonna output
in our span here now we just have to
style it accordingly how we want the
data to come out we'll do an anchor tag
because remember we have to link all
this and the way I did it was I just
linked the whole thing basically or I
linked the title so we're gonna do an
anchor tag with the ng href when I set
this equal to search term
I don't even use an info University I
feel something very strange right here
so search term r2 it's not the way we
should be doing this we should actually
be using info but because of the way
that the JSON object was set up I did it
a little differently so we're gonna be
passing in the index value so remember
how we knew what index we were on this
is something built into this is a
parameter or a property of ng-repeat
is you can let the ng-repeat keep track
of the index and we're going to iterate
through each instance and index which is
10 so it's gonna go ten times and it's
gonna go index so this is index zero get
that first one get that second one get
that third one and that's all we're
doing here so don't be too too confused
by that it's just gonna keep track of
what index we're on and then that will
be our anchor tag the next thing we want
to do is create an h1 and remember real
quick remember that this was will put
title just so cuz it got it gets a
little confusing with the way they do
the JSON call back or the JSON data so I
know I did when I when I try to explain
this right now and when I did this
originally so it goes title then
description and then article link
so when we're hard-coding in these these
this - remember this - is the article
link right here because it goes index 0
1 &amp;amp; 2 that we're pushing to our search
term array even though it says response
3 its response - in the JSON object so
it can get a little confusing which is
why I'm putting those comments in there
right now now I pass it in this index
just to keep track we want to be able to
see what index were on or we want it to
appear like a list but because indexes
always start with 0 we want it to
actually we want to put plus 1 so it
starts with one goes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 because each one of our spots has ten
values and then we're gonna go ahead and
pass in the info of that item which is
the array value in our instance does
that make sense so we're gonna pass it
an info and then let's go ahead and save
this and run it so we can see before we
pass in the description so type in hello
we will search here and you'll see now
we have all the titles that are linked
in our object so in our array so this
one is the index which we added one two
so it doesn't start at zero and goes
down all the way to ten now the next
thing is we just have to go ahead and
add the descriptions and a little bit of
styling so we did a h1 and then we did
it follow it up with an h2 and our H -
we're going to go ahead and pass in the
search term r1 which remember is right
here the description response - or the
second item all these numbers kind of
offset by one are a little bit confusing
for me so I apologize if I sound like
I'm going over things a couple times I
just wanna make sure everyone kinda is
getting how the object is set up or the
array is set up because I know when I
did this I was a little bit confused and
then we're gonna go into the index so
there's array 1 has three indexes index
0 is our title and then that's a - it
has it those are our titles which has an
array in there of 10 titles
then you go to index 2 or index 1 rather
which is a description which then has an
array of the descriptions in there which
has ten descriptions and then finally
index 2 our third item has an array in
it of 10 links that's what's going on
right here
so now when we run this and then we want
to pull put in an HR here which is a
horizontal rule just to kind of break it
up a little bit for styling and then we
type in hello and we do our search will
have our descriptions and everything I
actually don't want the links to be like
that as to blue for me so I made a
little mistake we actually want to cut
this out of the anchor tag and we want
to change our HR if you look at our HR s
here you'll see that it's not too
noticeable I wanted mine to be a little
bit more noticeable to really showcase
how it was broken up the way that we can
style our HR is pretty simple we can
just chart since there's only one HR we
can just target the entire thing let's
say look set the border of it and we
want to do five pixels we want it to be
solid and we want it to be black you
style it however you want
I just wanted mine to be a little bit
more noticeable and then here we go
finally hello search and now we have our
links probably one last thing of setting
this equal to target equals the blink
target equal to I'm kind of neurotic
about this target equal to blank saying
I just realized right now because I do
this all the time like it always seems
to make sense to me but uh all right
guys so we did hello and now you'll see
we did a we have our links we have we
kept track of them using the index
property of ng ng repeat and then we
need to kind of style it through so that

take away from this hopefully by now
you're you understand ad ba data-binding
goes two ways you can also use how to
set up you know ng app engine controller
all that sort of stuff you learned a
little bit about maybe bootstrap we
introduced you to font awesome which
will be crucial in building your own
websites ng hrf we used before we used
it again now we use the wrote column
system for bootstrap we also use ng
model which you should have be somewhat
familiar with we talked about
placeholders which is a basic HTML we
use ng click and then we iterated
through a very pain in the ass array
object here but more than anything else
what you really need to understand is
there's multiple ways sometimes to do
these API calls and just to get
comfortable with understanding that
based on how the API is set up you may
have to you know do a JSON P call
because of the security settings of the
API there's nothing that you can
basically do about it but I hope you
