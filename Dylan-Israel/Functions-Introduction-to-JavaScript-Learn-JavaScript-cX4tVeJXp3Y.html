in code Academy we are doing
introduction to JavaScript and we are on
the functions and scope section
functions so let's go ahead and jump
right in what is a function if you're
not familiar with what a function is
it's basically a reusable piece of code
so if we wanted to console dot log hello
my name is John we could save it I don't
function and then just call that
function whenever we would need it to
work so let's just go ahead and copy and
paste this into here so here's our
function we denote it say hello then the
brackets and then the code within it and
then we can go ahead and call that
function
sorry guys one second we can go ahead
and call that function by simply calling
say hello
dusk is a bit of a mess right now
hi uh so we call the function name in
the function let's go ahead and make a
new function so we're gonna create a
function called
make pizza and within its scope here or
within it within it we're gonna
console.log some stuff what is it that
we're gonna be logging it's gonna be
pizza pizza and again remember that
we're gonna be using the forward slash
pizza is done let's let's eat and then
we want to go ahead to call that
function so that it runs cuz if you
write a function like this it's not
gonna actually do anything until we call
it now that we've called it you'll see
up here that it's running just fine
so you can also add parameters as you'll
see right here now a parameter is
basically information that you're gonna
pass in to that function so that the
function can run correctly you'll see
right here it's passing in a first name
parameter which you can put into it when
you call the function and then they'll
output a more dynamic dynamic thing
because it's taking in items and doing
stuff with that so in our example here
we're gonna add a parameter called
topping topping will be inherited from
the function call so that we'll know
what top what to do with it and then we
can go ahead and just add plus topping
here and then we'll say extra cheese
gonna run that
and you'll see right here pizza's done
let's eat extra cheese so now it's more
dynamic because we're passing in a
parameter that we'll use within the
function so you can pass it in multiple
multiple parameters and of different
types so pass in a second parameter we
would just put a comma and then we would
name that parameter in this example it's
gonna be crust type and as we all know
the best crust is the stuffed crust so
that is exactly what we're gonna put in
here it's about the only thing that's
good for pizza hutt god
hashtag no pizza at sponsorships I
suppose let's go ahead and add this in
here as well we go ahead and put crust
type so let's eat extra cheese stuffed
crust granted this doesn't look very
nice but it's it's more so showcasing
that everything is working as it should
interesting
maybe they wanted it a certain way let's
see if this fixes it I'm not sure why it
it's not working let's go ahead and do
that I think I think I just want to
display a certain way this looks better
there we go
I think they wanted us to have multiple
strings in between everything that's all
as long as you understand the that fact
that you can add in multiple parameters
to these functions that's really what
you need to get away from this lesson
again it's just a data that we're
passing in when we make the call and
then doing something with that data
you can also and he also create a
variable that will store the value of a
function that you can use that variable
later on so instead of console about
logging this we're gonna create a
variable called so we're gonna save hard
make pizza is equal to a function now we
are gonna go ahead and get rid of this
name and instead what we want to do is
we want to return this
and because it's a variable we need to
close it like so and then settled upon
we should take the two parameters
talking to crust type I said a place to
the return statement it's gonna run this
real quick make sure we're we're doing
everything correctly so basically we're
creating a variable that's storing a
function in it and then we're gonna do
something with the data that's within
that variable on the next line outside
of the function create a variable called
custom pizza so we're gonna create a
variable here called custom pizza we're
sitting equal to a function call of make
pizza so because it's a function we're
going to note it right here even though
it's a variable starting a function we
still do this to call it and then we
want to pass in two parameters again so
topping we will put this time am and
this time
thin thin and now when we go ahead and
run this make pizza although I think we
may have to console that log this out if
we want to see the value
oh yeah just making sure we're getting
everything going here this is really
gone absolutely slow so we're taking a
variable that's storing all that's
storing the string now with the
parameters that we've provided and now
we're gonna just go ahead and console
log out because as of right now all
we're returning as a string we're not
actually returning any output so now
when we run this you'll see that we get
our output this thing cross pizzas ham
done let's eat now there's a variety of
reasons why you might do this
you may just need the data so that you
can can store it in something it may be
easier to handle that way it really just
depends it's a little bit of preference
as well but that is functions what did
we learn in this we learned the what a
function is function is basically
something that stores some code that you
can reuse
you can also functions also take in
parameters which is data that you'll use
within the function and then we learned
that we can store a very store function
in a variable and then do some stuff
with that as well and we also learned
that you can return data in a function
instead of just running the code so
oftentimes to create functions that
maybe just need to get a number to be
used in another function so you would
return that data and you can use the
return like this and you could use it in
a traditional function as well so I hope
