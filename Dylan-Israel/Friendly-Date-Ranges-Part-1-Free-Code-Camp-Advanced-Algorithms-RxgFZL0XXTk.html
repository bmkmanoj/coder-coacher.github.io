in make friendly dates or friendly date
ranges this is actually going to be
split up into probably two or three
videos just because it's such a long
tiring process explaining the code just
because there's so many steps so first
what we're basically trying to do is be
able to get in a date and have it return
a certain way based on what's going on
so in this first one is within the same
month so you'll notice it returns July
first and then forth now there's a
couple different ways that we can go
about doing this the way I did it was I
split it up into an array to start each
one of these so I'd have a bar date one
which would be our first date is equal
to our are 0 dot split excuse me not
split so we're splitting it on the
dashes I notice that they all taking
bashes so it's a good it's okay to do
that we're going to go ahead and create
date to here and we're gonna split that
as well
and we're gonna we're going to put
comments in and we're gonna explain as
we go so split array into year and then
I believe it goes year month and day
alright cool so that's what we're doing
here let's check as we go so we'll go
ahead and return date one and we run it
you'll see that it's been split up cool
there's a the next sort of thing that we
should do is we're actually going to
we're gonna eventually pass get the
month a name so 01 would return January
so we're going to create a month name
variable so store name of months so
we're just going to create a variable
called a month name call it everyone and
it's going to contain all of the month
names so that's going to be January and
so forth so just to save myself a little
bit time I'm gonna go ahead and copy and
paste in my month names real quick cool
so what do we do from here well
depending on there's a couple things one
is that we can't necessarily pass in our
month name without changing it because
when we use a very high guys for this
all right so let's go when we return
date 1 / date one index 1 our month of 7
so we're actually later going to pass
this variable in to a into a function
that we're going to called a change and
we actually have to truncate that zero
the way that we can do that is we can go
ahead and run this number function on it
we'll break it down to an energy level
and then you go see right there so we're
just going to go ahead and reset those
values for a later date right now we can
go ahead and do it in two rooms for
months so we're going to go ahead and
set date one we're going to set the
month of day 1 equal to number day 1 and
we're going to actually minus 1 from
this because we want the month to course
I'd with the index value so seven is
actually in dec six so that's what we're
missing one we're going to go ahead and
do the same for date two okay your state
one so let's go ahead and return if we
return date one it should now come back
as seven day is not defined
nope day 1 and a 2 there we go so see
now we're getting our six so now when we
want to actually log out the correct
month based off that input we have our
our months uh array we just have to
input it there and that's going to give
us our correct month of July is the
seventh month perfect now in this first
one you'll this first check off now that
we have our kind of a little bit of it
started let's get this first check mark
make friendly dates takes in an array
both in July in the first part of the
array only passes in the month in the
day and changes adds the first to the
fourth or whatever it may be and then
only for the second every second index
index one passes in the day sits in the
same month so it looks like we're going
to be outputting an array might as well
create an array array to return so we're
gonna call this bar date array we'll
just set it to an empty one so we want
the month easy enough and we want to
write here return date array at some
point we're going to do some logic so we
want to return date array now date array
is unique in the fact that the months
are equal so maybe we should do an if
statement for that so we can say if date
one index 1 is equal exactly equal to
date to index one we want to return this
specific time because if you remember
there's a whole bunch of case statements
so we're definitely gonna need some ish
statements so a good place to start so
right here we can go ahead and take our
date array and start pushing things to
it before we return it so how do what do
we need to push to it we need to push
the months name
and we have to concatenate this so let's
just make sure our month name is working
so we can go ahead and push a month name
and then right here we'll go ahead and
put date 11 let's make sure date array
is working so should return july let's
see where where is our hair o our area
is right here there we go so we return
July perfect now we have to do this
first now there's a couple different
ways you can do this i just created a
nested function right here called a
change now we're just going to do one
case but case by case and will edit the
code as we go along they'll make much
more sense than just this is what I did
for this and then you have to I think if
we go case-by-case so we're gonna set if
statement up here that says if day is
exactly equal to one we want to do some
stuff so if it's the little one we're
only testing for the first case we want
to return the day well returned a plus
concatenate it with f st so day one is
first day two is second now right here
let's go ahead and before we do anything
so we have this so now we need to
concatenate a space here so we're
following the format here and then we
want to return our day change passing in
the date one
a cold day one and then day was we went
what year month day too and don't forget
we're gonna because they could have the
number on it as well we're a zero on it
we're going to run the number function
on that here and probably actually it'd
be better to do this like above so we
could do date 1 and x 2 equals 2 and
number this will probably just help keep
our code a little bit cleaner we're not
minus in anything here we're just simply
returning it to day one
there's that so we just want to go ahead
and do this let's go ahead and run our
code and see if it's working properly so
we have our July first okay we're
halfway there for this first check off
now all we have to do is add already
data rate up push and in here we're
going to do the same thing month oh
excuse me not for this one we're only
returning the day so we want to call our
day change function and then we want to
pass in date to index to our day now the
only thing here is we haven't written
logic to concatenate that yet so we did
if day is equal to one this so let's go
ahead and do an else statement we can
always change this later it just turns
out that we wouldn't we won't need to so
day is plus the concatenation of th so
if it's essentially at the other day is
there's more THS than anything else so
we would wrote logic for everything else
and left an else statement for the
flight 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th so right here
we have days equal to 1 and then we
return th so let's go ahead and run it
and see if everything's going well so we
got our 0 forth now that's my fault I've
heard I should have changed both values
as we were going along so this is a just
because of the 04 date that's input so
we're just going to go ahead and do
exactly what we did before with number
and there you go there is our first
check mark now this is already at 11
minutes so I i'll do a part 2 we'll
start checking the rest of these off I
hope this helps you guys get started
