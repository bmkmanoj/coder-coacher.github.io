on our web developer skills today
specifically skills that I've do with
HTML and CSS these sections are a little
bit harder the make a website projects
you're going to learn a lot of cool
stuff a lot of codes already gonna be
there so you're gonna need to be
familiar with HTML and CSS so if you
haven't if you're not up to par on that
go ahead and check out their HTML CSS a
whole playlist going through everything
single video so you can make the same
errors that I made but you could avoid
that and watch the playlist and see what
I I did and see how I fix whatever
mistakes I was doing so in this case
we're gonna be doing a project uh that's
I I took a sneak peek at it so we're
gonna be doing a navigation menu a
background image we're gonna make button
for this first section and like I said
this is a harder section it says
beginner but if you don't it doesn't
really hold your hand like the other
ones do so if you're not familiar with
some terminology and what it's asking
you're really going to struggle a little
bit and so this is what it's this is
essentially what its gonna look like
we're gonna customize it this is the end
meal and all it is is some CSS
they've already provided it here and
they set up the index dot HTML and we're
gonna be making our own so let's take a
look at our current version so go ahead
and take this HTTP HTTP localhost 8080 R
so you can see this is what we have so
far they provided us to CSS they provide
you a little bit of styling a little bit
of text and now we have to add on to it
in our own fashion so it's one in this
first section it's asking us to change
the background color of the header to
dark gray so there's a couple things we
can do here you could just do it do it
this way
background - color and this is probably
the way my my work would not have me do
it they want everything to be in the CS
the CSS folder so let's go ahead save
that refresh let's see if that worked so
I don't believe that work did it so and
instead let's go ahead and try and let's
cut this out save it
refresh it makes make sure all right so
that didn't work so we're gonna go to
style so styles that we're gonna go to
what was it Heather oh they don't have
it in there that's interesting so let's
do this
let's just do color and we'll set it
equal to so it's gonna say that I see if
that work didn't work let's see if we
lose the quotes as that would do it I
don't think we're it should all right so
somehow we're having an issue here I it
really should be background color
background color
okay so let's see what we're doing
around here I don't believe you should
matter if we check that so we're gonna
just type it in let's let's do our
little Google search background is
background okay
so I think what they want us to do is to
change the CSS so it's gonna cut that
out of there
we're going to go to our Styles here and
then styles we're going to create a
header I believe they've already named
the class so actually this is a class
we're not creating class we're changing
a a element so in this case we want to
set our background color and we want it
to be dark gray which is three three
three three three
don't forget your semicolon save it go
to our index refresh this there might be
something overriding it and the CSS but
I believe that's correct so for now
we're going to leave that alone take one
more quick look at this make sure yeah
so uh we should be good here of the
header to dark gray okay I think we're
doing everything right it might just be
that uh this is white and there's no
thing we can do about it right now
oh there's probably nothing in our
header that's probably what it is so
let's see here in the header navigation
at four main menu items so here's our UL
class nav all we're going to do is at
four list items so work or excuse me
about
we're gonna work we're gonna add steam
and we're gonna add the last one which
is contact all right
there's navigation I have four men you
might as well working display the items
on one line using appropriate CSS
property so let's see so we're gonna
save that let's see what it looks like
it should just be at the top right now
that's weird
they should be displaying that
all right so
we're looking for a header the nav and I
don't remember the property so we'll say
same line below same same line Li look
at good old Stack Overflow
display:inline that's what it is okay
cool so I'm back to it and and here it
is display:inline that should save it
we're still having an issue here let's
see if this will reset it still not
resetting we're continuing on but I
believe that should be correct I think
it's not displaying it because maybe
it's cached I'm not quite sure to be
honest with you but at the very least we
should be seeing text so that's that's
why I'm not too worried about it's
probably just something to do with their
mobile OS right now all right change the
background image for the jumbotron
section so we're gonna goes Jumbotron
and background - damage is how you set
this we're going to use a URL so make
sure you have you are you don't just try
and put the link it won't work so I
actually pulled one up already unsplash
comm has free if you ever are looking
for some images to use in your
own website everything on this site is
copyright free they upload about 10 high
quality pictures a day they say all of
them are really good so it's been it
refreshes ok so that's working might be
a little too big for the site but at
this time we'll leave it alone
this worries me okay
change the background every edge off
feel free easier on the English let's
just use the image they use just for the
sake of making our lives a little bit
easier that way we can compare it to the
fun on so let's see what's going on so
let's save that refresh
okay cool enough set the width
in equal to and so the width equal to
400 this might distort it actually not
mind it will distort it but we're gonna
cut out that height right now save it
let's see what happens
fresh high effect 800 and hopefully
we'll have the with label it for now
refresh it yeah it's taking a second
update
okay I don't worry about that somehow
their local hosts around a little slow
looks like okay so we don't had to add
the image cheese macaroni Mitchell just
put check for that the main section add
a link this is get started so let's look
for our main section here's our main oh
there it is
about work team in contact the reason
it's not showing up is our background
color it's not great so it's actually
there that's why so we're gonna bring go
back and look at our background color
should be working them all right oh uh
maybe I should add a link that says get
started okay so you want to add a link
this is get started all right so just a
just random something I know that could
get started
okay and we're gonna say the class class
is equal to they already have it defined
class BTN - made by - mate it's going to
save that refresh this so those are get
started alright this is still not moving
oh I see what I did wrong
all right so height when you do this
make sure you put in pixels how much I
believe that might have been why that
didn't research right there you go so it
looks a little bit better
we are Broadway get started cool so you
have to put the PX in there I'm not sure
what the default is you could use a
percentage also like let's try 50% I see
what it looks like but you have to put
some sort of unit of measurement alright
maybe that won't I don't know why they
didn't work I should have worked but uh
you know back to 800 pixels save it are
fresh okay so go we styled it with our
dark crater dark gray button in the
supporting section so here's our
supporting add three links that say
learn more all right so say H rent and
we're gonna put it equal to an empty
link from now it's gonna say learn more
okay we're going to copy that three
times all right
and we want them to be buttons as well
so let's make them a button button and
we'll just go ahead and override these
you'll see me before we go ahead and
style it let's go ahead and refresh our
page and see what's going on so learn
more and learn more learn more cool
okay so do class supporting button all
right so here's what we want to do so
we're gonna go look for supporting do
they have a button so our then button
Ally all right so they wanted these to
be list objects so we need to create a a
ul let's go ahead spread out our code a
little bit alright so so you will and
then we'll have slash Ella and let's
just go ahead and place our other two
and then don't forget to put B slash you
go save enjoy fresh to see what's going
on should be like looks like a little
list item alright everything looks good
and now we want to style them with white
buttons so where is our support button
li alright so we
want some of my buttons it's great
borders alright so let's do border
I believe it's border color save that
it's gonna refresh you it looks like
white should work see you fresh okay so
that got rid of the Li so it's changing
the color of the AL I mean what we
really want is the button so okay we'll
do it like this oh we're going to reset
that to leave this alone and we're going
to say in the supporting class so it's
supporting for the buttons we want the
color the border - color to be three
three three three three
so you that let's see if this changed
the styling a little bit okay so there's
our grey borders and we're going to say
the color is white and you can just say
white White's of pre-built one in let's
try this
let's go ahead and look at we're really
learning more okay so I think they want
the background color to be white so
let's see if that works
so let's go to our localhost 8080
alright there we go so there's our
background color white and for the time
being it's not asking us to do anything
with the font so let's see you add three
links check check check and the last
thing we have to fix is for some reason
our background color is not working so
let's go ahead and there's our header I
created the header it's didn't work
there like this should we'll leave that
there for now let's go to our index
header so do class header and we'll say
background color equals save that see if
that works
so our background color is not working
this is a main issue and it needs to be
this color so I'm going to delete this
your plate because that's not working it
should be I think save it gonna refresh
real quick this is not working as well
we should kind of guess and check here
all right so one more time background
background - color
change the background color the header
the dark Gray's its color so it's your
body let's see I really do believe this
should work so I'm a little confused
background - color space
okay
so let's say that believe we're still
having an issue with the background
color so let's look at our get started
here if we were because that's the color
you want it to be get started is in BTN
May
background - color count 3 3 3
alright so we're literally going to copy
and paste this at save okay so it did
not work here so we're going to inspect
this element it's a good way to check so
you like something here this is the UL
class nav this is the header
all right so one cool thing you can do
here is not shiver do it you can I
believe you can edit in here and see
what it would look like and we're gonna
say background - color maples I didn't
work okay
so anyhow forget that but you can that's
definitely the now or the header area so
it's asking us to change the header it's
dark grey that's not working is the nav
let's try it just changing the nav for
the time bein save
so that kind of worked but not really so
let's try it with 100% so that way it
goes across the full page no that didn't
work out there you know what I'm
retarded the header
I was thinking head the header is it
defined class there we go there we go
silly mistake um but let's just review
real quick what it was that we needed to
work on here this is what we wanted it
to look like very nice image you know
the height is 800 pixels and goes full
width now let's go ahead and look at
ours we're still working on it but you
can see that you know we got some work
to do we have our you know these aren't
links yet the font hasn't been
customized we have our buttons that
eventually will go underneath here what
we're getting that so in this section I
I think we did a pretty good job still
have a few things we want to do but at
least we're able to figure out our
mistakes in a relatively short manner
let's see what's going on the next
section next is called innovation cloud
so it looks like we're gonna be making a
similar similar page you know some
buttons so CSS a little bit of hovering
over images breaking it up in this and
the parts so that'll be the next section
that we do in our web developer skills
I'll see you guys next video thanks for
watching
