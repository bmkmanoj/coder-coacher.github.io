gentlemen because I encourage women to
code as much as men even though some
people think by me saying guys I'm not
including them I totally am not so if
you're one of those people don't worry
about it alright guys we are back in
code fights that supposed to be a joke
guys have fun with coding so here we are
make a race executive - what this
algorithm is asking is hey we have an
array with some numbers in it and what
we are trying to do is find out how many
values are missing in it to iterate
upwards so in this case two three six
and eight the numbers that are missing
from the lowest number to the largest
number are 4 5 &amp;amp; 7 in there so one more
than the other a couple things that
we're getting in here is it's a array of
distinct meaning that we don't have to
worry about numbers that are duplicates
in the array and so how do we get
started well the first part that I like
to do or that I would do is I would find
the mid number and the max number and I
would also sort the numbers in order so
that's that's what we're going to do and
to help facilitate with the min and the
max as well as iterating upwards for
those numbers to find out those spots so
the way that we can do that is we can
take our statues array and we just sort
it the way that you the sort is a
function and we'll do this via 6 with
some arrow functions and we'll pass in a
parameter a comma B and then what we do
is we say return a minus B and this will
actually sort it numerically and before
we move forward we will return our
statues array and we run our test you'll
see right here we have 2 3 6 &amp;amp; 8 so now
it's sorted there's a couple different
sorts if you wanted to sort this from
highest to lowest you would do B - a
and if you want to look know more about
you know all the other sorts that that
all the ways that you can sort and this
is just one way by the way you just go
and check out the documentation now
because we've sorted it we already know
what the min number is going to be it's
going to be the first index NRA so we
can to create this variable min and
we'll set it equal to index zero of the
array and because we've also sorted it
we already know what the max number is
it's going to be the last number in the
array and so we'll say statues and then
that choose dot length minus one so we
have the mid number we have the max
number very cool now all we have left to
do is to create a count variable because
remember we're not actually returning
four or five and seven what we're
returning is how many times how many
numbers are missing in this case four
five and seven so we're returning the
number three so let's go ahead and
create a count variable as well
initialize it to zero because if there
are no numbers missing we should return
zero and instead of returning statues we
want to return this count and then we
have a for loop now if you got this far
the for loop probably will be pretty
intuitive we want to start off at the
event we don't want start off at zero
because we're checking the numbers
between the mid number and the max
number at each and then each number in
between so we're going to start off by
setting I to the mint and then we're
saying while I is less than our max
number so in this case while two is less
than eight go ahead and add one to two
and see if three is in the array and the
way that we can do that is a have an if
statement and we can say look statues
our original array dot index of I the
number we're checking in this case we'll
say it's three if it's equal equal to
negative one meaning that it's not
contained within our original array go
ahead and add one to count
and that should be it let's go ahead and
run our test and whoops what happened
there it seemed accidents out there when
I hit smooth aim it hit submit to pass
all the tests but again what we are
trying to do here was we sorted the
array numerically from lowest to highest
that's what this does
we then because we've sorted it found
the min value and the max value and
created a count variable to store how
many changes need to need to happen to
work for what we're trying to do and
then we just iterate through the for
loop starting from the min number all
the way to the max counting how many
numbers are missing and returning that
value so a lot of stuff going on there
in terms of the story variables and
whatnot
and you don't necessarily have to sort
variables you could actually pass them
in here if you wanted I just like I
think it's one much more clear when we
sort of name these variables during
these videos and everything but that's
always guys thank you so much for
watching don't forget to join our
Facebook group code tech and caffeine
and if you want to support me you can at
patreon.com slash code tutorials 360 I
will see you guys in the next video
thank you so much
hey guys thanks for watching the video
special thanks to our sponsors dev
Mountain if you look for a coding boot
camp where tuition and housing is
included definitely check them out
appreciate it I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
