of the ways that I when I was getting
started became a better developer
specifically with HTML and CSS I think
it's one of the things that sometimes we
kind of take for granted and we're so
focused on the JavaScript aspect you're
better at JavaScript based off this
technique as well but with the HTML and
CSS I feel like sometimes it gets a
little bit overlooked and then you find
yourself with zero design skills zero
templating skills and today we're gonna
be talking about how I kind of took my
my front-end skills to the next level so
one of the ways that I decided that I
was going to get better and I found it
really helpful when working with HTML
CSS even JavaScript depending on the
template but I would actually go and get
a template in this case our sponsor
today is template monster.com they were
lucky enough to give me the ax voor
template that I chose I really liked it
I thought it was a great example and the
reason that I say okay well why would we
rebuild templates well one you get to
see a production level application and
you get to be exposed to a lot of new
things maybe in this case we're gonna
dive into the source code is this a
little bit just to give some examples
but if you actually go to my website
coding tutorials 360 com that's actually
the what I did there was I took this raw
HTML CSS and template and then I added
angularjs to it and a couple angularjs
plugins such as like a image slider and
I hooked it up with the YouTube API but
basically I took this this stuff and I
swapped in my own assets and everything
and I was able to learn a lot by seeing
somebody who is much better at HTML and
CSS then I was and and try to understand
what does this do what does that do I
start breaking out piece by piece and at
the end of it I had a wonderful
portfolio item now template monster.com
has a ton of different portfolios that
you could look at or anything else
anything for WordPress themes - joomla
templates in our case what I'm really
talking about here the html5 website
templates and they can cover a bunch of
things so if you're looking at a
portfolio site up today
it's a great resource for you to look or
anything else maybe you have a business
and you don't necessarily have the time
to code out your own website you know
you're just like okay well or you're
running some other aspect of it this is
a great resource for you to check out
and I just say when I was setting up an
account I had a question here with the
customer service and they answered me
back almost immediately and it was it
was a great experience in that aspect
but it's go ahead and look through here
so this is a very clean very nice site
has a nice nice side scroll aspect going
on here
lovely loading icon' all things that
you'd want to maybe integrate into your
application you see are very cool
portfolio set up here a lot of cool
things so animations that you can learn
just by going through it newsletter all
that sort of stuff
a very nice template very nice website
all things considered for a low price of
$60 you get this whole thing you could
swap it out and I'm sure maybe I can
talk them into giving maybe a promo code
we'll see check out the description
under that we'll see what we can work
with but you get an idea so let's
actually dive into the code because that
that's really what I care about right
that it's beautiful website but what can
we learn from it right how can we use it
we obviously we can look at and tell
there's there's benefits right we can
get up we can go ahead and swap in our
own Instagram photos swap in our own
headings and we could be up and running
today with a beautiful fully responsive
website that we can see on our phone how
great it's gonna look it's really a nice
aspect of it too you can kind of see
okay well what is it gonna look like
this is I like that it's in a phone I
like this it's a very nice oh look at
that is there hovering in CSS am I am I
go crazy that's I don't think hovering
works in mobile I wonder I wonder if
it's just a shoe I wonder if it converts
the hand that's very interesting
question that's it that's another aspect
what you see is very clean mobile
so let's actually open up I have the
template right here opened up and you'll
see a lot of stuff going on here see a
little bit of PHP so you might be
exposed to a few things some things
beyond your skill set but that's okay
it's actually one of the cooler things
about diving into a template and trying
to make
maybe add your own content for one
you're gonna learn a lot or even trying
to duplicate it that was something that
I did early on where I would take this
template and I would say okay here's the
here's the home page or here's the
contact page I want to make it look
identical and I would play around with
the CSS I play around with the HTML the
JavaScript it was a really good way for
me to learn and I was exposed to so much
and so let's go ahead and and open up
ass asset so start seeing CSS so you can
see here that they're using bootstrap
3.35 and it looks like for the most part
it's just added in here you'll see like
the first thing I see is what is this
what is what is was abbr
underscore title you're like okay what
does that mean when there's a title in
the brackets here or what are these
pseudo classes right here with active
and hover and what does it mean so
you're already we're getting exposed to
something so if you're probably a little
bit fresh too - CSS you know your your
this is this is some nice CSS is what
I'm trying to saying you're gonna be
exposed to things that maybe you're not
gonna see as often you're not gonna see
in a CSS tutorial here or there and then
they have of course the theme and it's
all very it's broken out very well
that's what all this is basically inline
documentation here or in the project
documentation to kind of break things
out I've worked with templates before in
a professional setting as well and it's
it's not beyond the realm of possibility
that you may actually just buy a
template and then add your own to handle
a very beautiful front end and then
handle the the more logic aspects that's
specific you see your fonts here oh oh
apparently we won't display because it's
binary okay fair enough fair enough
images you kind of see some images Oh
placeholder images so placeholder images
are something that I have and I've used
in the past and applications just so
that we can know look let's go here
you can see a lot of cool stuff you can
see Jade if you've never been
experienced - Jade you may not even know
what Jade is formally known as pug or
maybe known as pug now I always get
backwards but it is a essentially an
HTML template
language so that like what's happening
here is that this is basically a div
that has a column and then we're
indenting then this is nested in here
with another div that's a blog post this
is an anchor tag with an HRA and it it
all renders out as HTML pages
essentially but there it's a Jade
templating language you can see you can
go in here check out a footer look up a
little bit of animations and you you
know with jump down the JavaScript see
what's going on here and you can see
very quickly how much you'll learn
just diving through and trying to
recreate this and it's ok you know you
may not know everything right I I I'm
gonna not know a lot of stuff that's
just in this template I'm a you know a
salaried working developer so don't be
intimidated by but it's one of the
cooler aspects of how you can go and
learn a lot by just having a template
you can also of course use the template
and teach yourself ton of interesting
things in the process so I just wanted
to share that with you it is something
that I have done in the past and I think
it's a great resource for you to kind of
be able to have source code have a great
portfolio or a great website whatever it
is you're trying to do and then also
learn and be exposed to a lot of things
that maybe you you don't have the you
didn't know even existed or that you
wanted Claire how does how is it
actually used in a real world
application I think you could get that
out of checking out some some templates
and and reworking them on your own as
well as just using them in your own
personal projects or businesses so I
want to thank template monster.com again
