we're doing the bonfire section basic of
basic algorithm scripting and today
we're gonna be doing chunky monkey this
was one that kind of took me a second to
wrap my mind around as maybe once I
actually got the solution it wasn't too
bad so what we're trying to do here is
we're gonna take in an array in our
chunk function we are of letters of
characters and then we're saying we
don't we want to break them up into
multiple arrays we want to break it up
into arrays based on the size in this
case - so ABCD - should return a B and C
D so the first thing I always do is
create kind of a temporary array or an
empty array because I know I'm gonna
need one typically at some point so I
usually just call it holder array and
call whatever you want whatever makes
sense to you
so what what it wants us to do is push
it this is a suggestion the push
function pushes it or adds it to the to
the array so what are we going to do for
that so in my case I did a count so I
created a simple count and and I set it
equal to zero because we're always going
to be starting at zero when we're adding
to it so we then want to if you remember
back we use slice also so there's a
couple ways we can to do this the
simplest way for me was to do a while
loop and what we wanted to do is just
say while our count while zero is less
than our original raise length because
we do have to iterate through the whole
array so that's a good way to start so
and excuse me we want to while that's
happening we want to push on the hold
our hold our array we want to push the
valley
out but we also are going to need to use
slice so let's go ahead and do holder
array dot push so we're gonna add to the
add to our empty holder array our
current array but not the whole thing we
want to slice it up a bit so where do we
want to slice want a slice from where
our count currently is and all the way
to where our count is plus size size if
you remember is the parameter we get in
here
so slice from zero to two and then you
know it's gonna reset it there and then
we'll keep you don't just do it again so
and again and again and again and at the
end we have to return return the holder
array so we take this out change this to
holder array and when we run it oh well
they what did I do wrong with my example
code here so oh this is our double are
doubling its holder array dot push and
we want to slice our array start it
start at our count and it go up to
whatever our size is
let me see here I have a my example code
here this is a good good example of
debugging so here's what I originally
solved oh I already see it so I'm single
myself where we increment and count so
here we have to reset count every time
so we're actually sight so otherwise we
just would have an infinite loop because
walnut doesn't auto increment so we're
resetting count right here saying count
is equal to count plus size and there's
a you know we could do it like this to
count is equal to so we'll just put
count plus size and then we should be
able to do count equals count plus size
and that should work the same and there
you go so as always let's go ahead and
create some comments here so we can go
back so empty array we will add values
to so we we use this too far while loop
while loop counter and also also index
counter so we're using this too no sorry
we're using this to increment counter
and we're using this to increment the
number size here so that we continue to
increase so
so what we want to do here so where
while loop so this is probably the most
advanced piece of code add to holder
array values between current index and
size and increase count so that is
chunky monkey for you in its finest so
just go over create an empty array we
can create a count variable for our kind
of for our while loop and we're saying
while this is still equal to zero less
than less than the length of our
original array we want to add to our new
array a value that starts at zero in
this case and then it's increment all
the way up to two and then we're just
slicing those arrays and adding them to
the new hold array so here get two
values from the zero and one position
here get two values from one and from
two and three position get two values
from the five and six position and add
it so we're adding an array every time
with this slice method so that was a
free code camp bonfire chunky monkey and
I'll see you guys in the next video
thanks for watching the video don't
forget to Like and subscribe that helps
me out a ton and I appreciate all the
comments that I get and all the
questions I get in the comments and I'm
happy to answer them so keep them coming
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
