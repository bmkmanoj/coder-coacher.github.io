keep me in here where are you actually
in freak ok are you doing freak ok i am
i met the projects the friend developer
projects alright
you are at the basic front of projects
so you're really in tribute page right
now yeah but I wouldn't really call it a
tribute page I didn't know who to
tribute my page to yep that's good
this is very strange that jQuery stuff
first on here yeah because they even cuz
in the first project that they're asking
you
they're not even asking you to use any
of the jQuery the CSS they're just
asking you to use HTML we're just fine
it's just that it's just so much easier
to like lay out a page with jQuery
I love jQuery as of right now jQuery is
like yes I can do everything but tables
too often and encoding hi guys so uh
alright so today is what I titled this
is April learns to code well last time I
put the girlfriend you like that yeah
even you don't like that you tried to
call me the girlfriend the other day and
it felt weird do you okay what would you
like me to put nothing just-just-just I
can put future baby mama oh my god no
hot tip yeah it's a secret
all right so guys uh today is an one
thing that's been going on tribute to
Dylan so loser you don't know this is
April my wonderful girlfriend
for a while April for a while I would
say what about three weeks not even kind
of slowly studying code three weeks a
month yeah okay so a month so for a
month April has been studying web
development a little bit on code CAD me
but now on free code campus a little bit
a lot look at the first like month was
code Academy and then I hop on to free
code camp which is set up in my opinion
much different I have a lot to say on
that but yeah anyways I started on free
code camp jumped over I mean I started
on code Academy and then jumped over the
free code camp sorry so yeah so yes so
someone someone a couple days ago before
I had my surgery asked in the one of my
live streams if there were going to be
any last troops coming up and there are
there actually are a hundred technically
a hundred and one days if we count
today's live stream and you'll be seeing
a live stream daily for about an hour so
hot she can't keep her hands off so
today we're just kind of announcing what
what the game plan is anyhow guys is
every day for a hundred days April's
gonna be studying about three hours a
day is an estimate on her own and she's
working through a freak okay if she just
got to the day giving idea where she's
at
she's at the basic the basic project
section of the front-end part of free
code camp where you're building a
tribute page and I was kind of looking
over her shoulder seemed that she was
doing it's just actually I'm I'm
actually I'm actually pretty impressed
that she's able to do it what
so what we're gonna be doing is she's
gonna be studying about two three hours
of her own and then that was a
compliment it's hard to learn to code Oh
surprise she was able to do it
anyhow so um now that she's kind of been
sticking with it for about a month we're
taking it kind of to the next level and
what I mean by that is every day she's
going to spend about three hours on her
own and then I'm going to she's gonna
take notes of what she doesn't
understand and then we're gonna start a
live stream where I answer these
questions and you know I can guessing we
there won't be an hour of questions a
lot of times there'll be small notes and
things like that or things that need to
be elaborated on and then we will
continue through whatever free code camp
materials she's currently on until she
has finished the front end certificate
now what is the the goal at the end of
the day is my hands all right man it's
actually my so he threw out his
medication for the pain so it's gonna be
fun yeah I didn't like the way he's
making me feel so I got rid of it and I
don't have the self-control not to take
it so I just flushed it down the toilet
yeah he called me like I flushed it down
the toilet I was like anyhow
so for the next hundred days I'm going
to bet help tutoring April and I figured
that since we're gonna do it we could
livestream try have a little bit of fun
with it involve her a little bit into my
my life right of coding and YouTube and
what I think from the Watchers point of
view I think the
interesting aspect is even though the
goals are gonna be small in the
beginning for me towards the back end of
these hundred days I'm actually going to
start looking into getting internships
and we can talk about you know stuff
like where did I go to look for that
internship how did the internship
interview go so I'll be definitely later
on down the road be putting myself out
there and then hopefully I'll either
have an internship or a paid internship
or better yet a job so yeah I mean
that's that's part of our goal is to
train because I'm so passionate with
what about software it'd be nice to have
her with this well it's kind of I you
know April sees the type of money
floating around in software I'm
extremely jealous of how much she makes
and so between that and like the ease of
looking for work once you have some
experience my goal at an end of these
hundred days is to get April into
basically start your career in web
development and that's a rough estimate
but I'm hoping in a hundred days from
now that she'll be done with the free
code camp certificate after the 12
projects issue my wife knows she's my
girlfriend
commitment I've committed to a hundred
days of tutoring which is better than
marriage some might not say um thank you
price for the support I'm not starting
with exactly zero experience I remember
my first computer as a kid I remember
doing HTML coding in high school and
then when I got in college I did a lot
of graphic design and putting those on
websites as well so not coming from zero
experience that I'm not coming from like
a background of knowledge because I
can't recall right now yes she I
for all all relative things is basically
at zero minus a course in college
back in the day in HTML so it's gonna be
it's gonna be a challenge but luckily
she has thank you
Cyprus I think you're gonna save me oh
thank you luckily she has me and you
know just gonna be studying on her own
but I typically some of you guys are
here for my last year's I I won't be
able to live stream for probably about
twenty days maybe maybe ten days I go
and get this checked up on in about ten
eleven days yeah he can't extend his
finger otherwise this will rip the skin
and your voice typing like this at work
like no joke yeah he can't you can't
extend it otherwise it'll rip and then
they gotta go in and do the whole thing
again and that'll cost him another grand
and never never hear the end of that
yeah so those you know no I got surgery
on my finger and the reason that you're
like wow man your fingers wrapped up why
is all this wrapped up because they had
to actually cut the skin out to replace
it over the fingers so yeah they did two
skin grafts and it's in the stitch and I
don't know if you guys know this but
skin grafts are pretty painful you see
okay you have 30 seconds for any
embarrassing questions go
[Laughter]
so I'm hoping that some of my experience
and people who are maybe don't don't
have they interview those on the site
people are looking for internship ideas
or where to find them or how to go about
prepping for the interview or something
like that hopefully I'll be able to you
know aid in those types of things as
well yeah I mean at the end of it what I
would like is to have April in a path
where she one enjoys it right so that's
that's kind of thing is I want it to be
enjoyable and for two I want her to make
lots of money
and I think yeah so she can pay for
trips is that for this trip so um we're
not actually gonna do any tutoring today
today is kind of the announcement video
that's why today's aeronaut day one day
one will be starting tomorrow and we'll
be doing this every day for a hundred
days and then we'll see where we're at
so some days you may see her very angry
with me because I'm going to force her
to be here yeah angry in case you guys
wanted to know what a coding
relationship looks like this will be the
perfect example so even if yeah and he
gets annoyed of me and somehow we're
still together because I'm stacked so
but the point the point being that rain
or shine we're going to be doing this
and I hope that you guys uh so for the
next 20 minutes if you guys want to ask
questions we'll kind of hang out but
that's basically basically the
announcement video of what to look
forward to the next hundred days on the
channel I'll still be releasing my own
videos and things like that and when my
hand heals I'll have more coding but
between the coding at work right now
I don't have it in me for a little bit
yeah so um oh you know what I don't have
any other questions on here my bad let
me throw that shadow so people know what
we're talking about and all this other
jazz so uh James Scott is also starting
his hundred days of coat good for you
man I encourage you to follow along
why are you starting at just out of
curiosity I can show you guys the
project I'm trying to finish up well
jumping tomorrow yeah we're gonna start
where you're at tomorrow assuming you
don't finish it if you do we're gonna
jump on something else like cuz you're
gonna study for two three hours storm
yeah I might finish um if I can figure
out how there's some spacing issues I
need to figure out and that that's the
type of stuff that we're gonna be
talking about when we jump into it and
hopefully I'll have the answer sometimes
I'll show you how I get started
do you know if the algorithm iron meetup
ghosts or JavaScript algorithms I
believe it does
I think are you talking about tomorrow's
meet up the not algorithms but Al Gore
rhythm I like that joke is used our FCC
I did start FCC if you're talking to me
I I'm doing the projects for the
front-end development right now what
language do you plan to use we're gonna
be she's gonna be learning the mean
stack guys mean stack mmm the JavaScript
stack and whatever I said so um yeah she
is on the tribute page right now no no
assembly language bit code by the way
bit code I I saw that you signed up for
the digital marketing course and I
encourage everybody to check it out it
is the other than coding it is it is the
best skill I think you can get and not
of coding soft for everybody so I think
I'll be good
what time will the last year's typically
be somewhere between 6:00 and 7:00
Eastern that that's that's kind of what
I think because I usually get off about
4:00 then we have dinner all that jazz
nice tinker no swimming out the door
so uh I wanna know how you guys got
started let's talk about that um I don't
know where everyone else is that like so
you know who's doing what someone
looking for an internship how far along
are you
well James Scott who I is on the free
cocaine portfolio page which is just one
project above you okay so James
I'm surprised James you're not farther
along I feel like you're in all my live
streams and comment on my videos quite
often but I'm guessing you're probably a
college student doing on the side
computer app wise what's the bare
minimum you need start coding you don't
really need a good computer oh you wanna
see my yeah yeah April's got like the
world's tiniest and worst computer but
that's what she's coding on right there
I bought it off her friend I think for
like $200 I think you gotta charity she
needed the money I was the least getting
a computer out of it unfortunately all
my other laptops like breaking miserably
so I'm using that and I can't well I
could use yours
so rest will case yeah so no excuses if
I could do it on my cell phone I'd
probably do it there because I'm such a
big app user to be honest yeah what one
thing you guys may look forward to is is
I think what's going to happen is I'm
going to actually teach April so one
thing that free code camp doesn't teach
you is angular and since I work YAG rats
we look forward to seeing you tomorrow
hacking it through cause God knows I for
me it's not so much in my understanding
the what I'm terrified of is how hard
it's gonna be to remember all the damn
libraries because that's something
I'm already struggling with so I get the
layout I get all of what Gerry
everything that I've read so far and
it's just scary that I'm gonna have to
remember all this damn dot CSS dot
whatever I have like flashcards start
off a Facebook group for 100 days of
code to me I already have a Facebook
group code tag and caffeine the link is
in the description and what I think I
will do is after we go live when the
video is over I'll post the video in
there like when this video ends I'll go
throw it in there and let people know
that we're gonna be coding for a hundred
days and I hope everyone continues with
it yeah so uh well I'm glad that your
AdWords is going in the well bit code
and James you know what's it think that
the hardest part guys this this is like
I think we're gonna accomplish quite a
bit in a hundred days is the hardest
part is consistency when you're learning
the code it's it's you'll you know
there's gonna be the terminology which
is struggling with remembering because
you're learning all these new words and
you you know even though you're using
them a lot of times you don't fully
understand what they mean or what they
do that's true for me as well but it's
going to be it's gonna be a great and
interesting thing so Russ Wilkie says so
she gets our front end certificate
before the hundred day plans what do you
plan on moving on to well exactly port
you see the the goals over here but um
I'm gonna walk in with like a lot of
cast just be like Robin his face just
like that so but yeah so that will be
moving on to the the back end
certification 100 hours of
I've already done a hundred hours I
think no so Kevin I'm going to be
tutoring for her for a hundred hours
she's going to be spending she's going
to be spending about two to three to
four hours on her own and then when I
come home every day we'll be doing about
an hour live and part of it is to part
of it is to add some fun as well as some
accountability right so yeah so if you
guys you know the accountability is
showing up every day with me for an hour
I mean obviously the other three hours
for studying on your own that's
something that you're gonna have to meet
yourself on and I can understand the
struggle on that because uh you know you
just tell yourself that you don't need
to or you know it's a waste of time or
whatever stupid ass excuse you come up
with and you know I for me I've always
told myself that the first step towards
moving in the right direction is knowing
that's the first step towards moving the
right direction I there's a lot of
that I've come from and you know
sometimes being visited physically
actively taking that step isn't it
always necessary we going to be the
first step that you can take for me the
first step has always been the mental
step thinking about coding thinking
about getting started knowing that
that's the direction I want to get to
and when that starts to become your
thought process taking that you know
coding and taking that action into
creating a FCC v Pro folio like those
for me came after the mental aspect so
if you're struggling physically getting
into it and being consistent maybe you
start being more consistent in your
thought process try that see if you can
get there mentally and then being there
physically for me has always been much
easier oh bit code thank you for the
support man see you see when it blows up
green like that yeah
the good family of five dollars towards
our 4k it's like an icon and then it
actually reads it eating here it goes
I've muted it but if you played the
video back it's pretty cool I'm a pretty
nifty guy no acid jams don't worry about
the job results down the road hell no
you know why because there's no
limited tank I wish y'all would be like
 goal walking to that yeah
that's are watching this video right now
they're like we need to get this crazy
girl the hell out of here I'm excited
finally yeah so ideally what I would
like to happen is you ever thought about
doing shirts yeah I've thought about it
I've always wanted to start our shirt
company always in fact so bad at
checkers so badly to the point where my
mom spent like all her money on this
screen printing thing so I could make my
own t-shirts at home maybe maybe one day
I do have a couple ideas I do have a
couple ideas for like coding coding
shirts and things like that but my goal
is for April to with my one hour so art
the giving idea how much time we're
actually gonna spend is the minimum is
60 minutes and I would imagine the max
would be would be 90 minutes together
and I want her to spend three hours on
her own daily and so let's say on
average is four hours a day and 100 days
less 400 hours which is roughly what the
free code camp certificate should be and
mine it I think I think one hour with
the developer when you're stuck he's
like five hours on your own so I think
me sitting down and helping her through
and elaborating on things that may be
confusing or shouldn't fully understand
Gavin is aren't tips for someone just
learning to code I think you'll see
those tips in the struggles that I'm
gonna have or questions that I may have
or misunderstood that I may have and you
may have the same thing and not even
know it or maybe you guys will have
questions that will kind of clarify what
it is that you know I'm misunderstanding
I mean that's why he's here but you know
it's about the over conversation it's
about learning from each other yeah I so
tips for someone just learning the code
is consist consistency which is one of
the reasons I'm actually like I could
just teach April to code every day for
an hour but I mean there's a couple of
reasons one is I want her to show up and
know that other people are watching and
that other people are making sure that
she is studying and that she's where she
needs to be and by me yeah so like you
know how extremely embarrassed I'm gonna
be if I'm like on the same damn project
for like 10 days hi number one god I'm
good man my dad just got done done
visiting for the weekend yeah pops was
here you've never once called my dad
pops so first time for everything right
now um because of the monkey it reminded
me of the monkeys jumping on the bed one
fell off and then the dr. Seuss book
then it led to the dr. Seuss book which
is hops on pops
that's my god okay I don't know how my
brain works everyone welcome hi baby you
wanna I think we can wrap it up this is
just our introduction of it yeah
so this is just an introduction I was
saying hey we're doing the hundred days
please come and learn something new I
have a good laugh at the ability of us
not killing each other so one thing is
if you do want to follow along don't
forget to
I see him tutor you guys and talk to you
guys and I see I hear him tutoring other
people when he has his tutoring sessions
and I was thinking about this earlier
and I know he's a good tutor I just
think that I hope that ties we'll see
how that goes
I think I'll be more professional since
we'll be being recorded because I
otherwise it would just be like hey girl
I've always wanted a reality TV show so
I'll hit her with the a girl how much
you want to solve this bug just oh yeah
it was I've had better ending out so
this is day zero just a little
announcement video guys having some fun
I'll be leaving these up of course I
hope you guys enjoy it thank you thank
you again to say caught the bug nice not
called the bug we're still deciding your
name there's actually been no name just
alright so this will be April's hundred
days of code we are going the goalies to
two at the end the end of it is to have
her finished a free code confront insert
and hopefully start the back end by the
end of it and get an internship in a
hundred days from now and I hope I hope
at the end of it that she has the skills
to continue on without without this
thing without me without the without any
of this while still having some fun
right I think the hardest part in coding
is not only staying focused but enjoy it
and that's why I kind of do these sort
of you
choose my way of always continuing
coding and this is another way that I
can help April long and enjoy it myself
without getting burnt out by things like
he's gonna experience code and a whole
new world that's probably sound a lot
cooler in your head probably did alright
guys don't forget to join our Facebook
group only posting these videos in there
and it's gonna be fun I think I think
we're really going to enjoy it thank you
again freeways supported the channel
don't forget to join our patreon page
patreon.com/lenguin
I will see you guys tomorrow somewhere
around 6:00 or 7:00 Eastern where we
start date one of April's hundred days
of code go say bye what was that one
coding thing that I had said
what was it come on you remember it say
it I know you said like live long and
prosper
now look long and cook I am an
accent saying okay guys I'll try to
remember next time thanks for showing up
and seeing what the buzz is about and we
will most definitely be seeing you guys
tomorrow and hopefully it'll go just as
smoothly as they did today code
everything that's right yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
