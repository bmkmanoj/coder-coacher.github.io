we are on the pig latin section under
control there are conditionals and
control flow we're gonna be building a
pig latin translator it says here again
i'll be resetting the code as we go here
alright so saving some that there's
nothing to do on this first one so first
we're going to print out pig latin
remind us how to print good enough pig
latin cool next we are going to get some
raw input so do they want to snap
something they want us to name the
variable original and we're gonna set it
equal to raw underscore input and in our
raw input we're going to have a string
it's gonna say enter our word cool click
Save and submit the inputs gonna ask us
for a word and we'll put YouTube why not
this'll be our pig latin
youtubetranslator alright so we have our
input it says add an if statement that
checks the length of the original
alright we're a say if it's greater than
0 so if the len dot original so if the
length of this is greater than 0
it's a colon for that we want to do some
stuff what do we want it to do
the string actually has some characters
print to use word alright so print
original oops nope no brackets I wanted
to print your original and then we're
gonna do else we want it to print empty
all right so welcome to the pig latin
translator and enter a word Pig okay
cool I mean Prince Pig now you used an
ad to add a second condition to your
statement in addition to your existing
check that the string contains
characters should also use its alpha to
make sure that only contains letters if
lint thought original Sirians and zero
and original dot is alpha is alpha
there's equal equal to true
all right I'll do Pig empty did your DS
is alpha let's see if that might be it
check again cool so it's working it
knows it's only let it is alpha if it's
equal to true it means it's only letters
in our string
all right what would you like to print
so this is just saying take a look at
our code before we move on
there's our Pig it should print Pig all
right part two of this so create a
variable called Pyg set Pyg equal to a y
now create a new variable called word
that holds dot lowercase conversion of
original so when I say word equals
original dot lower
curry new variable called first it holds
word zero the first letter of word and
also word first equals word zero did you
create a variable called first
Oh first just first
all right next up create a variable
called new word and set it equal to the
concatenation of word first and Pyg all
right so we have new underscore word and
that's equal to word plus first plus py
g let's see if this works
I think it will Pig all right and now
set the new word equal to the slice from
the first index all the way to the end
new word using alright so you want to
say a new word is equal to 1 colon the
length of new was forward
so what's going on here is we're saying
for a new word so s is our string some
new word is equal to the length one to
the end of new word I think that's
what's going on here yeah so I think
what we need to do here is do it like
this so this is saying go from one to
six a new word and we need a new word
right here because it needs to know what
to do this for so our word just keep
going with pig line seven so we're not
declaring this properly set new word oh
yeah I'm just worried let's try this one
more time
new word is not defined
we're syntax arias I think all right so
that's working so what's going on here
real quick just to read alright we're
resetting new word to be what our new
word value is from the one position to
the end of the string that's why we're
calling a length we could also use a
number there if we wanted to and make
sure your translators working it's
saving some so instead of original we
wanted actually to print new word
okay so that's our new word if for pig
and that's our our big line translator a
little a little bit just messing around
with the slicing of words that's
probably the hardest part of this lesson
but up next we're gonna get more into
the meat and potatoes as they say a
functions you know this is where in my
eyes programming really starts so we'll
be doing functions it looks like we're
going to be messing with taxes and bills
and a little bit of math with it so I
will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
