PHP we are in object-oriented
programming part 1 objects and PHP so
we're going to finally start to use
classes you give our first example here
of a class called person some variables
that we have to define and then this
looks like a constructor and then we
have a greek function then we create it
and then we can go it out so it prints
out a one two three four five let's
let's just go ahead and get started
check so I'm save them submit shape
thing just goes over at classes a little
bit so let's get started art first thing
we need to do is create a class oh
actually first thing we do is add the
PHP tag lines next thing we need to do
is create a person class so we're your
class person and then we need the
brackets and then we need to create two
instances of the person class the
teacher and a student so we are going to
create a feature equals new person and
then we're going to create student
equals new person
and we just created our first two
objects 500 exercises badge cool alright
so now that we have these two we haven't
done anything yet really this is a
little foreign to go ahead and pause the
video and just read the examples i'm
just going to work through it what so um
let's see how we do that so class fruit
apples no fruit not you alright so we
need to add a public these are
parameters i take it public is alive
property to the person class
simple move through
you
it's the person class I thought we were
assigning to teach bus okay so public is
alive when you set that equal to truth
so it's going to be a bully a variable
and add three further public properties
so kind of like declaring variables
except for a class that we can kind of
reuse when we talk about persons in this
case it's the first name and we're not
going to assign any values for this any
default ones all right and see Apple
that's lame All Right see how it's not a
sign neck Teresa just cut them out and
then at the end we want to echo the
value of teachers zombies look so I'm
going to echo out see how they call it
so it looks like they call it like this
so you want to allow variable teacher
pointing to is a lot like Owen believe
that's correct you had the first name
last name and age properties yes I did
let me see if it makes a difference if I
put it like that
alright so let's see what happened here
ah think this needs to be take that we
put in in the class when we actually
need to create outside the class see if
that will fix what we're doing here so
we're going to refresh the page subjects
air on line 15 let's see how they do it
alright so this can't be in there that's
my mistake as well slow let's see
undefined variable is alive like 19
failed air
huh all right so you're struggling here
it shouldn't be empty because it comes
with its set to true so echo teachers is
a live property so we're going to Q&amp;amp;A
forum let's see what's going on here
leave those third
I just wanna force on
what see her
I co-teacher as much
not
all right so it looks like we're doing
everything correctly let's go ahead and
clean up our code a little bit so we
have we're and go step-by-step subclass
person the brackets here is alive is
equal true no parameters for everything
else then student equals new person your
teacher equals in person and echo
teacher is alive then our n PHP
no I'm missing can I
should it be empty this is inherently
true listed earlier
nice let's copy and paste this and see
if it works it should look is alive
let's check one more time for this is
line is alive
Oh
not that worked maybe our syntax is off
somewhere interesting uh I know we are
getting this area oh yeah well we'll
come that in second so in this case we
want to add a constructor to the person
with three parameters first name last
name and age and see how they doin
alright so this is going I believe to go
within the class let's see if there's a
hint here yeah it goes within the class
so in this case we're going to public
pickle line here public underscore
construct now we're going to put the
first name the last name and the age
this what this basically means is that
when we create an instance of a class
sometimes it's going to it's going to it
can accept three of these things out of
talking basically so as in here now we
need to initialize so saying that
setting the variables that are inserted
into essentially and so this all right
yeah I just got equals and this is just
saying this point so this so we'll say
there's a person II didn't give us any
parameters first name
and it's just equal is equal to and
then we say this and then one more time
for age okay so change your teacher
instantiation so here's your teacher to
store the values of Orient comma 1 2 3 4
5 and comma 1 2 3 4 5 except this time
is editor and then for student he wants
us to our own values 17 and then we want
to echo the age on soon will call
student point to page
we forget something I'll public function
looks like it's double underscore there
we go let's just say it's undefined on
there I'm not quite sure what's going on
with that very first page real quick
alright so next thing and what's this do
is call I method read to your clutter a
domestic Greek so below this we're going
to create a public function greet
citizens all right pick any parameters
and then we will say to return the
string hello hello my name is space doll
I'm going to say this a shot oh great
another space dot this match last name
dot space
insulation point then a happy face
semicolon and now we want to call this
new function we created great on the
teacher and student so we're going to
want to echo out um here not great if i
guess i will Nestle out three let's see
if that works well so is an echoing it
out here so our code is working but our
little anything is not
so put it all together all right so
let's start from scratch it looks like
so we first thing first ripped out our
PHP tags or it won't know what the hell
we're talking about next thing we are
going to create a dog class so I
remember correctly it's just glass dog
add a public property so public numb
legs take over for and then we need
public let's see here name doesn't stay
a value okay next thing we need to do is
create a public function the constructor
other constructs which accepts name as
parameter okay and in this message add
some codes all right this I believe
that's correct so far so good now we
want to add a public method to our dog
class called bark so but with public
function bark all we want to add our
class on here we're actually going to do
it in the dog wants oh we were doing
public function bark from here we want
to return woof complex go right now
although we can do it I next we want to
add a public method green so public
function greet with it all i returned i
sentence k name property evaluation so
in this case we're going to i believe
pick the new property i also won't be
able to get to work need to return
excuse me we don't need that we just
needed to return the knees because it's
going to be supplied from the actual
object so we want it to return me
alright and now we need to create two
instances of the dull class and star one
with the name worker alright so yeah
alright so first one is dog 1 equals new
dog and it takes the parameter of Parker
and then God 2 equals new dog it takes
the parameter amigo on that name for dog
and then we want to echo the results so
all right so we want to echo ah God one
dots bark
all 32
oh alright silly me both and then we
need to also call greet method on dark
too
huh I'm fine variable so see if we're
having issue here does it seem should
work just fine oh yeah so this is what
we need
oh let's make sure we're doing this
correctly so we're going to go to the
forum
function me out
huh I think it's just the ID built-in
id8 here that issues with it in fast but
uh all right now we're going to do the
same thing except cat class is time so
cat and in here we're going to have to
public properties so public is a lie and
we're going to set that to true straight
off the bat and then we're going to
create a public numb legs legs and we're
set that equal to four and then we are
going to
and public name here and we're going to
leave that empty we're then going to
create a public yoga class our method
rather function so public function yeah
and here we are going to return you now
yeah and now we are going to create an
instance of cat so all right so we're
going to I guess just will call it cat 1
equal to nu kak and then we're going to
instantiate the name code cat I'm bat
name forecast and then you're going to
echo out at one yeah meow meow yeah
oh we forgot to add a constructor so
public function straw
and we're going to take named Marcus a
name unless you were just sign there we
go all right so just a reviewwrite we
learned classes we learned how to use
the objects which are what we create
from the classes create new objects how
to create classes objects how to add
properties and methods I use
constructors and the keyword new and the
arrow notation I personally like the dot
better but the last thing here is just
echoing out let go now the basis of
object-oriented programming BAM alright
so that was our first section on objects
and PHP not too bad if you've ever
worked with any other coding languages
it seems pretty similar so next up we
will be doing object-oriented
programming at PHP too so looks like
we'll be taking up a notch and working
on it working on the classes a little
bit more see you guys next
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
