I'm on my phone today and normally I do
these subscriber specials every thousand
subscribers and part of it is I like to
try and help that's the way of saying
thank you for people who watch the
channel you know hey you know thank you
for watching to the thousand that are
new when to the in this case twenty
seven thousand that came before so thank
you so much
and so I tried to an hour or so
livestream so if you knew that's what
these are about
today we're actually doing it from the
phone I just have been sitting all day
and it's been a long week so I just
decided to live stream it on the phone
and we actually don't do too many at
night so I feel kind of bad about that
it's about 9 p.m. here so I know I know
about half my audience is in different
time zones and let me actually go move
closer to the Wi-Fi I know like a lot of
my audiences in different time zones and
things like that so I figure let's try
and show a little bit of love for
everybody in a different time zone today
and we do it well we'll do it live in a
different area today so uh how is
everybody doing today I am exhausted to
be honest with you and I hope everybody
is doing well it's been a long week
April got laid off of her job recently
um not just her like basically her
entire work closed up and they're going
out of business so she is cut she has
filed for unemployment today will be
fine financially and things like that so
don't don't worry about that I we've
been saving for a house so that may
delay things a little bit but that's uh
just one little thing going on in my
life
but this isn't necessarily about me I'll
just keep talking about me until you
guys have questions you can see a little
different perspectives today um thank
you Carranza yeah Krantz I know you've
been here for a while Edward as well
David Neal how is everybody doing today
yeah so um I am it's on fire
yo man I bring the fire alright I spit
hot fire FinTech Casey what's gone
but yeah so uh you guys may see a return
of April learns to code I don't know
well we'll see some we'll see something
that we are always together a for life
baby for life alright so
so for buying a house we're actually
looking to buy an investment property
specifically a multi-unit property so
either duplex or house with a back house
or all the things that we're looking at
the real estate market in Florida is
pretty cheap so I'll instantly actually
be paying my mortgage by renting out one
of the units and so I'm not too worried
about it although with April now
collecting unemployment and our lease
isn't actually up for seven months it's
it's probably gonna be one of those
things where we're going to hold off for
a little bit we're actually looking at a
unit tomorrow I'm going through the
pre-approval process all that sort of
stuff but we'll see we'll see where
we're at I guess is what I'm trying to
say hello there I'm taking a PHP course
in college I was wondering if you have
any good suggestions for tutorials help
me get give it to give me a better
interesting although I have not taken it
traversée media has just created a PHP
course I saw it in my feed the other day
and Brad does an excellent job teaching
a lot of the basics so if you're
interested in a PHP course I think he's
probably charging twenty five dollars or
twenty dollars if you go to his channel
traverse media I have no doubt that it's
a quality course and I take care of yeah
what's going on I'm good man just um
we've been saving we've been I have been
busy I you know you start a new job you
study outside of work so that's kind of
what's been going on with me I I've also
been filming videos in the morning and
just I did I was doing some contract
work recently with uh with somebody and
so that took up a little bit of time
I've also been
I don't know I've just been busy man
so I'm trying to film I've only got like
six videos done of about 35 that I need
but I've been working on the how to
create a coding Channel course
so how's April dealing with with the
jobless she seems to be okay she's just
kind of you know she's gonna be able to
get unemployment financially we're fine
she doesn't really like know she get
fired up they bit her work went out of
business because they lost a big
contract and so everybody got laid off
basically and she's doing fine she she's
a looking she's already revamped her
resume she's redoing her LinkedIn all
that good stuff so I yes I did talk
about bit petite in a recent video a lot
of people didn't like that I shared that
high risk investment so everybody has
their own opinion I I thought it was a
fair video I just kind of gave my two
thoughts about it so Florida has a
unique thing
Florida has a unique thing where we're
we're we're essentially they will give
you $7,000 or so if you're unemployed to
pay for certain schools that they've
said it okay to get like certifications
and so that's something that she's
looking into as well they are not giving
withdrawals this morning on on Bitcoin
really I just would true hmm maybe it
wasn't Bitcoin that I got my money
although I've had money with Bitcoin I
have money in aetherium and litecoin so
I could have gotten money from them both
I've did I have to check it out a little
bit
he's ever he's April going to be picking
up a hundred days ago maybe she's
definitely gonna be studying something
proud to take she's kind of handling all
the unemployment paperwork that goes
with it but um yeah just try figuring it
out she found out on Monday luckily I
mean we have always cuz we've been broke
for so long we always now live below our
means so we can live off my income just
fine and we have for about six months
while she wasn't working when she got
down here really all it does is put a
little bit of a damper on our savings
for a house which isn't a big deal but
uh so she's she's looking to transition
careers anyhow which is why she's been
studying project management so hopefully
you know a lot of times you can find you
find a lot of opportunity and
unfortunate things right a lot the
example I give the example I give is
like when you get your heart broken by
some useless woman or man right
oftentimes it sucks in the moment but
later on you find the man
a woman of your dreams what's the
property tax range of the places that
you're at in Florida I'm not really
quite sure we're looking in a 200 to 250
thousand dollar range so I'm not sure
what the property tax range breaks down
to for that well I'll know tomorrow
we're actually looking at a seven it
well combines remind you it's a back
house and a front house it's two hundred
twenty nine thousand it's a seven
bedroom four bath if you add them all
together property and I'm sure we'll
have some info on what the property tax
is on the paper that they'll hand us
when we go and look at it so let's see
here
any tips for a small coding YouTube
channel I start a few months ago I'm
having really tough time getting
audience thumbnails are important I
would also say I would also say that you
need to understand what your content is
and who you're going to sometimes I
watch some channels where people have
their have a very difficult time
explaining I would say make sure the
content that you're delivering is
explained well if you're doing tutorials
that's super important breaking down
things into bite-sized pieces and not
assuming that that you would that
someone should know things that I don't
really think there's any disadvantage to
spending two to three extra seconds
explaining something and it could be
something as easy as every other time
you use map explaining how it's creating
a new array or something like that and
why you're using it in that situation
that might be one thing if you buy a
property would you try to Airbnb it or
straight up rent it out it depends on
the situation but I'm not opposed to
either if we could rent it out
immediately with like a six to 12-month
lease I would pay for the mortgage we
would probably do that just so that we
don't have to hassle with it
that would probably be my preferred way
but also I don't know
I don't know what I don't know what the
Airbnb rental situation is like in
Florida but if it turned out that we
would make more money with Airbnb we
could definitely try that for the first
month or two and then if it turned out
that we're only making like $500 a month
well we could rent it for $1,000 a month
we would probably just go and rent it
and then have somebody stuck in there
what's your opinion on freelancing I'm
not talking about online sites mostly
about getting some local business it's
worth the time no my opinion with
freelancing is that that is something
that doesn't lead to a lot it's better
than nothing right like I've done it in
the past and and I mean it's one way to
build a portfolio in web design it's not
a great way to build a portfolio in web
development what I mean by that is a lot
of times the freelancing stuff that
you're going to get are usually static
sites that are like an auto shop website
where someone can go and in best case
scenario enter contact information
usually it's just a static web site with
something on there it's it's not a
sustainable income most of the time now
the people who are making good money as
contractors or freelancers these are
senior developers and stuff like that so
that would be my advice on that although
as somebody who needed the money and was
learning web development I did that
you're better off taking a low-paying
internship and working your way up or
jumping companies that's truly the best
the best the better advice if you can
but it's it's all it's all relative to
what your situation is and but that's
what I would do I did both turned out so
I'm getting a ramp server and database
going yeah you could try the amp also
that's what I use is leap code supposed
to be so damn hard this stuff is killing
me algorithms traditionally are very
hard for people but I also think they're
very important for your technical
interviews for you to learn a language
to think like a developer that's why I
spent so much time on code fights so I
mean if you're I know leak code is
historically supposed to be very
difficult very hard I could advise to
say maybe try out code fights
although code fights is hard it might be
a little bit easier and if you're
looking for something a little bit
easier than that
you might also want to check out you
might also want to check out free code
camps algorithms on there
but I mean most most rules will ask you
to solve algorithms when you're when
you're getting hired some will have you
solve specific algorithms most will be
almost will be just like problems can
you learn to be good at algorithms
practice man um a lot of its practice I
know that when I looked for work when I
when I knew that I was gonna start
looking for work I started doing code
fights and I spent about two to three
months well maybe not three months two
months to 6 weeks doing algorithms every
single day all in prep for set
interviews and even then I struggled a
little bit on some of them I bombed my
interview that I had at Amazon and all
fairness though an in-person or like
over the phone person interview
algorithm is really stressful and also
it would had a regular expression in it
I don't know regular expressions by
heart and I don't plan on learning
regular expressions by heart even after
this I refused to learn it so do I
understand how they work yes do can I
use a regular expression yes do I know
how to write regular expressions
somewhat but can I solve an algorithm
requires a very detailed regular
expression on the fly no I cannot
but yeah any embarrassing interview
stories um I mean I've had I got
interviewed by code fights I saw that I
was knocking out some algorithms and
they said hey we'd love to interview you
as a potential candidate and maybe we
can get you a job but we interview all
our potential candidates that's why code
fights exists if you don't know they
actually get referral fees and they try
to hire you at companies and whatnot but
you know so I said yeah you know that
sounds dope I've been practicing on this
side I have like ninety algorithms done
at this point you know so they
set up a thing I'm doing it and it's
supposed to be you still some knockout
three in twenty three in an hour so 20
minutes 20 minutes 20 minutes I didn't
finish the first one and it was really
awkward for us bummer for us both I
think I I get really nervous on them but
it just was something it's one of those
ones where I couldn't conceptually grab
the problem
it was a multiple Sudoku problem and it
was one that I had seen was on code
fights and I was deliberately was
avoiding because I didn't really
conceptually understand it and maybe if
I did Sudoku I might have had a better
shot will you upload the other 40
algorithms this is something I've been
debating about and the answer is
probably not at least not on this
channel mainly because they don't get
views and assign it's not really good
for the channel for things that don't
get views I may start a secondary
channel where I upload stuff like that
on so people can see it and I can put it
on my like readme files on the github
and whatnot but I like I uploaded like
50 or 60 of the algorithms and I think
altogether they might have gotten like
5,000 views like a hundred their average
in like a hundred to 200 years no one's
watching them so I mean maybe maybe
uploading them as one of their two
videos might not be bad it's it's
something I've thought about um it's
also been a little bit and although I
usually comment my code it would take me
a second or two to review it we'll see
what was the Amazon interview gauntlet
like so to algorithm for the flat earth
bro why do we need to prove the earth is
flat we already know the truth all right
oh god don't get me started sliding
people you're just sheep man use your
sheep that believes that the the earth
is round because NASA man so uh one
second you guys I get hdmi can't look so
I'm gonna die so uh or uh USB cable so
uh fluff I got distracted by a flight
everything so the interview without with
Amazon I actually have a video about
that and I mean I may release it or not
or not I have to rewatch it I'm a little
hesitant about releasing interviews with
companies just because a lot of
companies don't like you talking about
their interview process but I I filmed a
series about like a bunch of times that
I failed in life and that's one of the
videos um the Amazon interview wasn't
too bad I had so they actually reached
out to me on LinkedIn said hey you seem
like an interesting candidate we'd love
for you to interview with us and I said
that's dope I never thought the day
would come where Amazon would reach out
to me um I said yeah definitely you know
I'm nowhere near Seattle Washington but
I would love to go and that happened and
I talked with with somebody and they
really liked me and I talked with
somebody else so I had two phone calls
they really liked me and then I had a
technical phone interview and that went
okay and then I had a a fourth interview
which involved a little bit of a
technical phone and then an algorithm
and that's when I I crashed and I burned
I didn't hear oh it was pretty evident
that it didn't go well for one and two
it was evident that I wasn't vibing with
the guy that was on the phone at least
that's what how I
felt so if I felt that way I'm sure he
did as well and I don't know what caused
that I don't know if I wasn't serious
enough and he was too serious because
that's what I felt like to me um I don't
normally so godless monkey I don't mind
talking about my work but my work
probably wouldn't appreciate me talking
about their policies and sliding out
something I'm sorry you just have to let
your imagination wander yeah so I mean
don't get me wrong I I am very I was
very proud about about the fact that oh
cool yell I'm being interviewed for
Amazon they even think I could get an
interview but I did crash and burn as a
as a learning experience and I wasn't
that and it wasn't it sucked in the
moment but uh it is what it is right I'm
very happy
oh so now
I want to make internet of things I do
freak of campers there another source
honestly I couldn't tell you is being a
devta day a job that you are always on
the lookout for the next better job so
it sounds like the the question angel
Phineas what you're answering is as a
developer are you always looking to jump
ship and for that that raised and it's
an interesting thing because I'm at the
first company that I really could see I
don't say the first I'm at one of a very
few companies that I could see myself
staying with for a while I love the
people I work with and I I like the
environment and the culture and
everything and it's it's it's excellent
it really is and and if it was a pure
money thing and I give this example when
this comes up cuz I've been I tricked so
I'm getting paid very well let me profit
premise that but there was a company a
large wealth management company that
that is in the financial tech world our
financial world that will offered me a a
role for fifteen thousand dollars more
than I'm actually making now not
everything being equal but we're just
talking about the money right and I
turned it down because I like this
environment better and so a lot of
people a lot of people will take money
over happiness and $15,000 is a
significant amount of money
it's a mortgage payment for a lot of
people but oftentimes people will jump
jobs for $5,000 or whatever it is
$10,000 and there's kind of a limit to
how many times you can do that as a
young man you're still I probably could
do that
as right now but it is something that
people do and there's nothing wrong with
that in my opinion but you have to
understand at some point you're probably
gonna want to move up like like my goal
my goal right now is to be the best
developer I could be and that will make
me more money in the process and my one
of my goals is to be promoted I've never
been promoted at a job and that is a
goal of mine so I'm working hard to to
one day get to a point where I can do
that and that I'm going to strive to
accomplish that but there is something
to be said about jumping jobs because
statistically speaking you probably will
make more money my advice my advice is
you usually should spend about one year
at a job so one year at a job and see
what sort of raise you get see what sort
of promotion you may or may not get and
if it's not what you want and you can
get at least ten thousand dollars more
ten thousand is kind of the the base
jump ship assuming you're not happy at
where you're at
you should definitely start looking
that's my advice if you're not happy
where you're at and you can get $10,000
more jump ship I don't know if that
answers your question
but that's kind of my take on it
so Jacob says I'm having an easy time
getting through algorithms to
understanding the computer logic but I'm
having a hard time figuring out house
how things that that should be simple to
work like my text editor any tips you're
having trouble understanding your text
editor I don't know what do I think
AWS I don't know enough about it but it
seems that it's being used by quite a
few people um so yeah I mean a lot of
times people are jumping ship for for a
couple thousand more dollars so you know
I don't I don't begrudge anyone jumping
ship for more money I think it's
perfectly fine but if it's not for more
money I don't understand it and if it's
if it is for for more money but you're
happy at where you're at I think you can
have a conversation with your current
work hey if you have a good relationship
with your manager be like look man or
ma'am I can get twenty thousand more
dollars on the street I think we should
negotiate my contract it's a hard
conversation to have it's uncomfortable
conversation to have but you drop the
seed and maybe maybe it happens maybe it
doesn't maybe three months from there it
does but if it doesn't happen you can go
and say something like hey it's time to
like like I give you a perfect example
when I was being that when I started as
a technology trainer technical writer at
my two jobs ago two jobs ago
when I took the role during the
interview process in-person interview I
said I I I this sounds like a role I'd
be perfect for and I was if I'm going to
take this role
I really am looking to move into a dev
position so so I I
I told them that 20 minutes after I got
done interview they called they they
made me an offer and I accepted and I I
loved working there but after about six
months of the job I I I did not enjoy
the job anymore because my passion was
in writing code my passion that was what
I was doing and over that process for
the last month for a month five to six I
was really really not liking my job not
because of any people not because of a
bad work environment not because of
compensation although I did make a lot
of money it was because it wasn't what I
wanted to be doing so it took me a month
to gain the courage to go talk to my my
boss who isn't a super he's not
unfriendly he's a very friendly guy but
as you might imagine in tech and
software's sometimes people are very
awkward and it's hard to have those
awkward conversations so I took me a
month to gain the courage to go talk to
him I did I said look this isn't what I
want to be doing I want to be going in
in the front end or QA or wherever
you're I can go and you know he said
that we'd work something out and and all
that sort of stuff and you know so um
fast forward three months later I leave
for a developer role he was upset not at
me but because he wanted to keep me but
unfortunately things didn't move fast
enough for me which gave me a clear
conscience of leaving but I well I guess
why I bring that up is I I say I try to
tell you advice for things that I have
done a lot of times people will give you
advice for that they have no
business giving you advice so I don't
necessarily want to give you advice I
will tell you what I have done I guess
is why I'm trying to say so what
questions were you asked on your first
interview as a developer
um I had so many interviews but a lot of
it was JavaScript questions right
what so you have kind of juice when it
comes to every job interviews different
billing it comes to to to your role
you'll be asked usually it you'll have a
technical phone call where blast you
some questions about whatever it is that
you're interviewing for and kind of get
a role for up feel from you oftentimes
if you did well they'll call you back
and say alright come in for the in
person algorithm challenge or we're
going to send you an algorithm challenge
and you'll do that but it really just
depends man what sort of role you're
going for hello Sam music what's going
on Kevin um I'm trying to think of any
specific questions when I first I
interviewed I know that they were very
intrigued by my passion for developing
and I almost want to say like it they
wanted to see if I was full of or
not because it's like if you looked at
my resume at that time I didn't have a
ton of experience because my first staff
job right I'm going from a technical
writer essentially into a dev role and
on there I have volunteer experience
with code.org I have projects I've built
I have hackathons I've gone to I'm my
YouTube channel and so a lot of my
conversation during the technical phone
calls was about that to find out what
type of developer I am and if I'm
actually interested in this stuff or not
I'm a sexy beast I know baby
uh let's go um well being a freemason
helped me in webdev or any other
organization I have no idea I couldn't
even tell you what a freemason is or
does when did I start coding probably
around 25 I mean I played around a
little bit with HTML CSS house a new job
I love it man I absolutely love it
the Freemasons are like a Lions or
Rotary Club oh so they're kind of a club
organization of some stuff some stuff I
would say that it might help if someone
in there is in the freemason guild their
club and they can kind of talk to you
about that because a lot of it half the
job is knowing technical specifics and
the other half is can we work with this
person
and how is their communication and when
you can connect on something it allows
you to have good communication skills
and then your you know things things go
a lot more smoothly
uh Steve Wozniak is a freemason no maybe
I get on this Freemason hike man
um but yeah I mean organizations in
general aren't bad to have long they're
you know I put on my LinkedIn how is a
member of the Association of Computing
Machinery ACM yeah um how have I ever
seen a bad a shitty develop someone get
fired for being shitty developer I
haven't seen anyone getting someone get
fired but a lot of contract employees
that are there for a year and their
contract was assumed or if six months it
was pretty much presumed that they were
going to renew the contract they don't
because they don't mesh well with the
team or their work isn't very good and
so I've seen quite a few things like
that and the pass happened where they're
not giving the value or they're causing
issues or it's just not a right fit for
whatever reason a lot of this guy's is
you have to be able to work with your
team and sometimes some developers
aren't team players and if you're on a
six-month or your contract even if it's
a five-year project they'll let you go
and look at someone else in there so
I've seen a lot of that I would say that
I haven't seen like salary like a lot of
times the companies will also do
contract to hire man so you'll you'll I
know a lot of roles I interviewed with
would would do contract to hire and
sometimes they'll change it up if they
like you and the role that I originally
interviewed with was contract to hire
and they offered me a salaried role but
a lot of places will will do contract to
hire in hopes to just basically try you
out say hey let's give this guy six
month contract and if it works out we'll
give them a job if not we got six month
and really only got three months because
it took him three months to get off to
date so how good am i at the maps I'm
pretty good at the mattes really for
most for most at least web development
most of the time you just need to have
good algebra skills you need to be able
to understand how to multiply divide
work with fractions follow equations if
you have to write some you know I've had
even though I didn't graduate I did take
three calculus courses a discrete
mathematics course trigonometry course
and geometry course algebra course not
to mention all the maths you do in high
school and community college and stuff
like that
so and physics and all that jazz one of
the reasons I hated hated it hated the
computer science program to be honest
with you but I did take them and it did
pass them but for the most part you just
have to be good at algebra and it's not
too hard
am i worried about jobs being outsourced
to India I am not so a lot of a lot of
companies want to have in-house devs so
that they can build a team and they can
do these small things to build out their
product now this doesn't mean that some
jobs aren't going to be outsourced of
course it is
but a lot I'm not worried about in
slightest to be honest with you have I
looked into upwork.com upwork.com
wouldn't pay me enough for the most part
so a lot of times you're competing with
people and in in in countries where the
cost of living is significantly less
maybe they're charging $10 an hour $20
an hour or $30 an hour which would be
less than I make hourly and that would
mean that I'm not going to so if I if
I'm going to be working outside of work
and I have no problem doing that I did
that recently for a premium at 90 an
hour if I'm going to be doing work out
side to work probably on the low end I
want to get paid twice my hourly rate to
three times my hourly rate unless it's
an easy project so maybe twice the two
and a half so that's what I charge for
my mentoring and things like that and if
I were to go work for upward comm I
probably would be lucky to get my hourly
rate as a developer there is this one
guy who is my new hire group who sucks
at coding that's Manish a group of
people and his team two pair program
with them basically do work without
realizing it
um I can tell you I don't think anybody
would mind me sharing this I could tell
you that a hiring manager and a
technical lead that I have worked with
in the past told me that of a hundred
interviews about 95 don't work out for
junior roles and of that the 95 can't
write a full a basic for loop problem
like if I had to say hey I want you to
add start at zero and print out every
number divisible by five up to a number
write that function and that about nine
out of ten people that that got
interviewed for the role who had prior
development experience also most of the
time couldn't solve that in a white
board interview process and I guess the
reason I bring that up is there there
are people sometimes who slipped through
the cracks who get so accustomed to
using like jQuery or angularjs but
really can't write any code right that
they can write an NG for loop or
ng-repeat but they don't know how to
write a for loop and that's that's
sometimes people get so desperate that
they let those people get through the
cracks I guess
how hard is it to get a CS degree I was
in the best in high school I'm not the
best at math right now I'm in the Marine
Corp so I'll be out in like six months
never done cutting before the codeine
isn't really going to be the hard part
for you I mean it will be up first but a
CS degree is ranked like the second or
third hardest degree to get it's a lot
of math it's a lot of science so it's
hard it's as far as degrees go it's
harder than the average for sure should
I get a degree in computer science yes
it's probably one of the best if not the
first or second best degree you can get
is it true that there are CS graduates
that come out of college that can't code
to save their own life yes it's 100%
true
do you have a six-pack not for about six
years
who the applies for our dev without
knowing how to do for loops people do so
that's how that goes but I mean these
are and I'm not talking about develop
like people who are just straight out of
boot camps or college degrees I'm
talking about people who sometimes
they're coming from QA and they just
don't write code outside of work and so
you throw them in a situation where you
give them a basic algorithm that
involves basically you just iterating
through a for loop and adding a number
together which is a very fair thing to
get and they can't do it so tell people
practice those algorithms man what's
your opinion on places like team tree
house I think it provides a lot of value
for a very low amount of money
but I also think that you'd probably be
better served just spending $40 a month
on udemy for two courses that you
actually want do I consume any no topics
I do I take I take two right now
I take Saran out of it focus factor
which is a brain vitamin pill you can
pick it up at Costco a lot of times and
a 2-pack for like 20 bucks and it'll
last you like six months and I take
focus plus which is a stimulant it's
kind of like a caffeine pill in a bottle
and that I used to take that a lot more
it's really bad for you I don't
recommend it but I do take it on
occasion when I want to put in work
I'm a kid I have a six-pack look man
when I was a kid I had a six-pack all my
life until about six years ago
you ain't got no fat on you when you're
a kid you got a Mattel lism it I'm
turning 30 bro thirty into six Becky out
here I am I am being such a traditional
developer it's disgusting man I put on
ten pounds and my first year is it just
over I look cute tonight amen every
night McRonald eighty-three trying to
make them rain gains I do not take
adderall now
that's right Ricky Ricky and I argument
clap on some stuff so if you guys aren't
a subscriber of Ricky get I like Ricky a
lot he's trying to grow his channel he's
in the grind man so if you for anybody
watching go ahead and drop our boy Ricky
alike show him some love show him some
support we're working on a collab
together it's gonna be the new hotness
it's gonna be taking over the coding
game
coquito uh I'm not like overweight by
any chance by any skills sense of
imagination guy so wait 180 pounds I'm
six feet tall it's just I don't have a
six-pack and I don't work out right now
I have a gym in the house that I haven't
use and part of it is I spent so much
time working on YouTube and studying
that I never get to the gym stuff it's
something I actually want to change how
much should I invest in Bitcoin I'm a
newbie you should invest whatever you
can't afford to lose is usually what I
say Bitcoin is expensive I have put in
about three thousand five hundred
dollars in a Bitcoin do you think there
is a reverse correlation of being fit
and being a great developer no I don't
think there's any correlation I think if
anything if you were fit you would be a
great developer because there's been
correlations with fitness and your body
being healthier and your mind being held
there because of it I just think that
you're sitting down at a desk most days
and most your hobbies probably include
gaming include the PC that is just
natural that's it I just think you get
comfortable how do I personally
structure learning for look for my
learning when learning a new language
I'll usually watch a YouTube video or
two on it build a project in it if I
feel ready if there's an interactive
course on free code camp or code Academy
I'll do that if there's not I'll go and
I'll do a course in said project on on
udemy but it's really just kind of
getting an introduction on YouTube
seeing what C seems somebody who works
with this say hey this is what 90% of
what you're going to be doing in this
language expose you to the big gist of
it if there's a project that I think I
can build in it I will if I don't feel
quite ready I'll go buy udemy course or
I'll go watch other videos on it
if I know HTML CSS JavaScript Express
equalizer react for ducks do you think I
can also junior developer position yeah
yeah Bitcoin reach 6k today my my
bitcoins looking great man Joe I play
csgo now I don't really play too many
games guys although I did buy a Super
Nintendo classic and up until recently I
just putting a little bit of working on
Super Mario RPG
yeah basket surrender order best for you
am i doing a live stream tomorrow too or
not yeah I'll do one man I I promise to
do my Saturday weeklies and this one is
for 28 K so this is just the essential
of the diffusor guys
your buddy and and the Milo my little
exit to the other cats don't like it my
little all about that essential oil life
so buddy this is a hot tip you need at
least three cats to be an excellent
developer every cat will multiply how
good of a developer you become this is
true fact guys huh
your wife has one of the diffusers I got
yeah I love it
do I ever come up with great ideas for
apps at the most random times yeah man
someone who's very very passionate about
software a lot of times she have
business ideas or projects that you want
to start sometimes you start them
sometimes you don't it just kind of
depends with April being a good idea
would be with April being unemployed
would it be a good idea for her to start
her own YouTube channel go over that
project manager course it wouldn't be a
bad idea
I think her main priority would be
perhaps to land a role and maybe in
between filling out apps and studying
doing something like that I'm not
opposed to that not uh not everybody
wants to be on camera it took me a long
while to be comfortable to be on camera
and be able to speak my opinion and talk
and you know it's it's really
uncomfortable for most people I would
say it's a little less so than it used
to be but I do think most people don't
want to be on camera and aren't okay
opening themself up a little bit to the
world whether that's a strange way of
putting that or not I could tell you but
that's kind of what I think and I say
that somebody who really
really didn't really I mean I had myself
on camera basically narrating my my code
but not for a very long time did I ever
like I think like a year and a half and
I start doing videos like these and
talking and and give you my opinion
about things and advice about things and
talking about things in my life and not
everybody is okay with that and so
although I don't think it'd be a bad
idea for her to have like a project
manager channel I think it probably a
great idea I don't think that's
something that's in the cards for her
necessarily how many projects that I
have in your portfolio in order before I
got a job I think I had six on there I
would say although a large quantity of
projects is never a bad thing quality is
better than quantity what's your opinion
on an app that lets you time lapse
fitness progress pictures I would say
that you should remove the Fitness
progress part and instead create an app
that focuses on time-lapse pictures of
anything and then allow people decide if
they want it to be Fitness now you can
market it at with one of the examples
being Fitness but I think what you're
doing is you're making it too specific
and instead you should structure an app
that allows people to create their own
time lapses and I think you'll be able
to gain a larger audience if you do
something like that do I get recognized
on the streets
I don't get recognized on the streets
I've got recognized a couple times that
add like coding meetups but that's about
it not it doesn't happen too often
uh I've seen so many youtubers drop or
semi leave their channels I don't know
if they think it's worth it anymore well
it kind of depends right so a lot of
youtubers do YouTube full-time I am NOT
in a financial situation where I could
do that so it's taking that out of the
cards but I could tell you that I've had
four videos do you monetize and I have a
pretty PG channel right like we're
talking about software education
technology coding JavaScript it's hard
to find stuff in there that is peak that
isn't like very politically correct or
age-appropriate for most people I mean
occasionally I'll drop an f-bomb here or
there and I get a little hyped and maybe
I'll make a little bit of a grotesque
comment but 99% of what I out there I'm
okay with and it's a very acceptable to
talk about so for these channels that
are much larger that said hey you know
what I think I'm okay too to do this
full-time and they were making enough
money to do it full-time I can
understand where their frustration would
come maybe that's a good work a job
again for me personally I this is part
of my career there's something to be
said about personal branding in software
you'd be able to get your message out
there and I don't make enough money from
software to or from rather from YouTube
to ever do this full-time right now
it's more of a passion project I mean I
do make a little bit of money but but I
could understand why some people are
leaving if they could totally just got
screwed over and they put all their eggs
in the in the YouTube basket can we see
those projects sometime in the future
most of the projects you guys have seen
man most of them are like the free code
camp projects or the hackathon project
or my website so
and I mean so part of the recent Kevin
in here saying one video can ruin a
career it's very true I I try and never
do controversial topics I've done maybe
two one was about the Google engineer
another was about the the coding babes
channel baath the witch got D monetized
by the way so I try to stay away from
controversial topics I every time I put
out a video I actually watch it one time
after like the day before it goes out I
watch it and I make sure like do I want
to put this out into the world because
there are consequences for throwing a
video alright there are consequences for
me saying voicing my opinion outside of
work because I am a employee and how
that can affect me so that's part of the
reason that I can't you know share my
opinion on certain topics or I can't
dive into things as hard as I want to or
be as brutally honest to certain things
tonight and I'm ok with that I accept
that the reality of the world some
people would say the censorship and some
people would say that's just smart and
make sure you're employed and that's it
that's kind of what I'm doing but
there's a fine line to be said
I'm 50s they're going to be hard for me
to get work as a dev I'm awesome was
free cocaine it's just gonna be hard in
general to get work as a dev but there
are there are benefits and downsides of
being young and being old I would say
that as someone who is just getting
their career started at 50 you're
probably going to be competing against
other other people just make sure you're
good and make sure that you're
hard-working honest and you're gonna
show up on time and you're studying
every day you're showing you're
passionate about it you know there are
benefits to being older a lot of times
people understand that you are making a
career change and you're putting
everything you have into this and that
you aren't going to be going into the
club on a Tuesday coming in hungover
right so there are benefits to
everything as a coin based rumors true
what coin base rumors
Oh am i I'm Vimeo or steam it no I'm not
do they deep monetize for cursing out I
don't think so
do I plan on making a Simon story it's
been so long since I've done that
project um I don't know why I ever grown
man but no not because I have anything
against Matt bonds but because look how
long it would take and I just as much as
I've wanted to grow a beard even though
it'd be a bad beard it just gets too
itchy and as much as I would want to
have a man bun it just gets too hot
I found the Simon project to be harder
only because the concepts of set
interval was harder for me to
conceptually grasp as well as how to
play audio there's just a lot more
interactive aspects of the Simon game
that made it a little bit harder to
drink would you rather drink but light
or Coors Light
I'd rather probably drink a Sapporo but
if I'd choose I don't care that they're
both whatever what do you think about
the value that udemy certifications hold
while actually going for a job I think
the value is in you I don't have any
problem with people putting it on their
resume but I think you're going to need
to be able to speak to their quality and
showcase what they've taught you right
so you you're saying so if I see on here
that you have an angular 4 course I see
on here that you have a jQuery course I
see on here you have a rack course and
you they ask you about that in that
moment you have 30 to 60 seconds to sell
those things so hard talk about the
algorithms you did the four projects you
did for each what you built after you
did that how it taught you the language
what you've done with it since you
really have to sell those sorts of
things but I think when they're they're
better than nothing so I don't have a
problem with it it's up to you to sell
it
how's the dev lootcrate thing working
out this is something I've been very
struggling with David because I want to
do it I think it would do very well but
the the issue I'm having is figure out
about shipping so I've kind of put it on
hold but it's something I keep coming
back to in the back of my head and I
want to I want to do it so I think
what's gonna happen David is when April
and I buy our house and we kind of get
settled whenever that is I think that
might be when I feel comfortable pulling
the trigger and I'd be like look I'm
just diving all in on this idea cuz
alright right now it's like do I start
this side business which it may or may
not be a success
or do I go by duplex and I'm going for
the first time in my life I'm going with
the safer round I really and it's it's
strange because all my success in life
in recent times have come from going a
non-traditional sort of unsafe route and
being okay with educated risk and I'm
kind of doing the opposite so he's
important I anticipate the next big
framework or language no you just got to
be able to adjust if needed that's the
good part about it Crusader drivers have
a good one pawpaw Sharma
how often do I use vanilla chest do on
occasion I mean so the thing about this
is the thing about vanilla JavaScript so
I write an angular for guys 90 point so
I'm laying down I'm getting tired Oh 99%
of the time now what that allows you to
do I mean you're writing JavaScript
right I usually am writing typescript
but so the really the what you're asking
is how often do you do Dom manipulation
in vanilla JavaScript and when you see
something like angular 4 you have no
business to do it there's just there's
no situation almost that you would ever
need to do that so so it's it's very
rare at least so I've seen him what do
you think your biggest hurdle from
starting businesses free is financial
capital a lot of the businesses I want
to start the dev loot crate box the dev
store and these are things that require
a lot of financial capital to get
started
should I start coding and Linux
environment and just staying Windows
honestly I don't think it matters too
much half most of the people I work with
these max I use Windows I'd say it's
about half actually everyone is talking
about you Jay
right now yeah a lot of people are
talking about you a lot of people are
always talking about stuff but it
doesn't necessarily mean that it's gonna
be good long term and it doesn't have
the jobs that angular or react O's have
I contributed to open source sort of I
poured bugs and I comment on things I
make requests for features on things
that I think should be in existing I
don't I don't ever submit pull requests
or anything like that and fix things
some of the time it I would consider
some people might disagree but I would
consider a YouTube channel open source
right because you're basically doing it
for free at the end of the day but it's
kind of like it's kind of like open
source video alright you're submitting
all this content for free and going from
there so all right I'm gonna hop in the
massage chair real quick and then we're
gonna wrap this up in a few
why did you decide to learn how to code
and why not something else when did you
figure out this is something you were
good at and a good career choice for you
um so when I started to learn how to
code is purely out of a hey I want this
is a good career to to get into and and
I want to make good money I want to make
sure I'm able have jobs and just found
turned out that I absolutely loved it
now I hated I hated how I was learning
through school and everything like that
but the actual aspect of when on the
very few times that we could actually
write core code I absolutely loved it
how much caffeine do I can do my day not
too much I've recently started drinking
monsters again but today is my last day
I'm dropping them I I kind of got off
the bandwagon a little bit so I gave up
energy drinks for about six months and I
started drinking last month but usually
I don't drink too much I have an
espresso in the morning with April and
that's usually it I'll drink some black
tea but I recently started drinking
monster again how was the phone for you
to live it's not too bad um yeah I mean
I I didn't really code till I was in
college but I mean as a child I've built
like HTML and CSS websites and things
like that nothing too complex I have a
video about it so talking about the
first time my very first web site got
shut down
you guys can go you can go see how how
cringy I was in middle school or
elementary school or whatever it was hey
Milo so my little likes to jump up when
you sit down and I'm a saucier cuz he
knows you're not giving up for a while
buddy are you doing you saying hi say hi
to the youtubes oh yeah so I mean it's
yeah so YouTube live is about it has a
chat on the screen and you see like
super chats and all that and would you
say that the front end cert on free code
camp is enough to land a job it's hard
to put one thing enough right you need
to be an interesting candidate you need
to be say that I personally landed a
role before finishing the front end cert
but I also taught myself angularjs I've
built my portfolio site
I had a hackathon project I was
volunteering it's one of those things
that you got it you got to go in all
each different direction especially I
get it started I got muted what
all right can you hear me now my bad I
was dropping some knowledge to y'all I
hope you all I hope you guys can hear
the sub top reading the subtitles cuz
I'm not repeating that so but yeah
so uh but yeah my thing is what I what
I'm trying to say is not only as Ricky
put it diversify your skills but also
diversify your learning resources
because you're going to be people I I'll
give you a perfect example I will teach
you what I know and what I believe is
important right let's say we're talking
about JavaScript now regardless of
experience there may be things that
other JavaScript takes advantage of or
find more important so that's why when
you're learning a language you need to
learn from multiple sources because
there will be overlap and I will
reinforce it but you also are going to
have other things that maybe didn't they
that didn't you didn't know existed I
found out today that console debug was
the thing I didn't know that was the
thing so which is strange so listen this
this is what I this is I have never even
looked up anything besides console.log
it never even occurred to me what else
might be going on in the console so
do you feel like going full sack is a
must these days or can someone still
find work as just a friend and developer
just back in developer I think being a
full stack developer is probably the
best route in terms of getting hired
because there's going to be more jobs
especially for junior roles you will
find out that as you move to larger
teams you will become a specialist I am
now pretty much only doing front-end so
I am hired as a junior front-end
engineer front-end developer but yeah so
it's just something to consider in that
aspect
we doing Milo oh yeah
shashi n-- bhajan Davi
welcome my friend I probably butchered
that Blatt right
how long were you coding before you got
your first dev job that's an interesting
question because I would go entire
semesters without writing code in
college and and so you have this
situation of I had three years of
college I'm the belt but I wasn't coding
for all three years but I did code at
times in those three years but I really
felt that I I really felt that
if I just say how long if I had to give
a knight an idea I would say I was
probably coding realistically for a year
straight before I land in my first role
my year a year and a half but I had
coded before that in college right so
the reason I say that is because I
wasn't coding daily I wasn't working on
my own side projects and I really think
the thing that made me become a
developer was coding every day and doing
every free tutorial I could get my hands
on with code Khadem a free code camp and
that was very beneficial but you could
make the argument that I had been coding
in college three years prior so on my
first day
Thomas rachelle how's it going by the
way
how nervous were you on your first day I
always accustomed ly nervous part oh I
have a second cat now hey Tito
oh my Tito uh there's not enough laughs
up here to go around um but I would say
that on my first day mind you also my
first developer job I drove across
country in three days did about 38 hours
of driving I think it was from Los
Angeles to Tampa and I had a two day
break so I arrived here Friday night in
shambles
I slept Saturday Sunday and Monday I
went into work and in the thing and so I
went I was completely burnt out from the
drive and stressed out and you know I
was really nervous because I did not
have time to study because I was moving
as packing up and doing all this sort of
stuff so I was pretty nervous to be
honest with you
do you use scratch paper when you try to
figure out an algorithm I usually use
the whiteboard if I need to I try to uh
if I need if I'm really struggling I'll
use one of my whiteboards if not I will
just keep on hacking away in the text
editor and then sometimes I'll take a
break walk away after thirty minutes and
think about it differently
yeah I think one of the best things that
you could do Ricky for your career and
free as a developer is just build your
own stuff man do you still feel any
securities about being a developer I've
been practicing algorithms and free code
camp and code fights and the
insecurities are real as
I would say that I don't part of that
comes from a very recent realization of
how hireable I am and what I mean I
don't mean that in like a cocky sense
but I mean that in a sense that there
are people who want to give me jobs and
that has been one of the like the idea
if I were to get laid off from my job
and I'm not going to I don't think it
but where's some wood to knock on right
um but there I am when I accepted the my
job I had other jobs in writing that
made me offers and that idea and the
fact that you know I've had companies
reach out to me like Amazon who wanted
to interview me for a role and stuff
like that that's I'm not the best of
helper but I am a developer that can't
get a job I guess and I'm trying to
become the best developer right that I
can but in that my insecurities had
always stemmed from not being able to
get a job as a developer and recently
with landing a second role and with with
getting other offers I would say that I
feel less worried about that than I ever
have before I also worked very hard for
a very long time to become a better
developer than I am every day right so
although I don't code outside of work
for blast I'm I did some contract work
but I haven't been I don't code like I
used to most of my most my free time
have gone into social media projects
right more media coding media related
projects building the den of course the
YouTube channel podcasts that I've
actually kind of missed starting up a
Cody and side-project like a like a
hard-coding side project where all I'm
doing is coding and that's something
that I'm kind of looking into right now
actually so
Amazon's are scary I think scary good
programmers with five years experience
have lifestyles I don't want to have a
lot of times I would take a job at a
company like Amazon for a year if it was
bad I'll be honest man you'll get me for
about 50 hours a week at most
on an average probably closer to 40 and
then when you want me to put more hours
in I have no problem on occasion but the
companies that think that they're gonna
work you 60 hours a week not this
developer I got side projects I have a
YouTube channel I'm trying to do we
ain't just got time we don't have time
for that but if it was to get like a
major company like Amazon on the resume
I'd be ok with it for about a year and
then I would you just go leave to work
at some other company how do you know
where to start start when working a
problem I'm working through the free
code camp curricula Mike find out hard
to figure out you're first up I think
Sal you need to probably understand the
basics a little bit understand what
tools you have you know understand
boolean logic understand for loops your
buddy understand understand all the
array methods and the string methods
that are there and understand how you
can chain them together and try to say
try to see if you can visualize these
things and draw them out whiteboarding
is a great way to get started with that
where's the best place to live for a
developer a recent survive sauce in
Seattle Washington but I think you
should wear it work a lot worry less
about where you're working as a
developer get some experience and then
move to wherever you want to go
see Seattle is almost as expensive SF
maybe I'm just telling you what the the
jobs per capita the salary the actual
salary was the best in the country for
um for uh based off this survey I saw
Conor McGregor at Tony Ferguson I know
you're a UFC Fan I'll be halfway
surprised if you actually fight step up
Tony Ferguson but my money is on Tony
Ferguson
I just think Tony has incredible cardio
and he's going to unless he gets knocked
out in the first round he's going to
probably just grind out Conor McGregor
towards the end of the second into the
third but I just don't see McGregor
lasting five rounds
maybe his cardio's much better after
boxing and working on his cardio for
that whole time but I don't know I I
just see I just see Tony Ferguson coming
out the victor although Tony Tony always
gets Tony always kids like if you watch
half of Tony's last wins he always seems
to just get his head knocked off the
floor man and so it's completely
probable that Tony Ferguson could get
knocked out I just don't like ever
betting money on oh it's gonna be a
knock at the knockout guy has to win by
knockout or the other guy wins right so
you're basically saying that this guy
has to mess up and allow me to knock out
if Tony just doesn't put himself in that
position he should be able to put in his
game plan I think he will
I did i watch the old ESC tapes when it
was a tournament I just highlights I've
never actually gone and watched the old
tapes yeah I don't know I've never I
mean it's it's fun to go and look at
history a lot of times but sometimes you
see things that are like and this is
actually completely different than then
what I love which is the you know UFC so
for those of you know this is probably
my only only cool hobbies is I watch MMA
news every day if there's a if there's a
YouTube channel that I could recommend
for MMA is MMA news it's like a yellow
icon it's amazing they don't have like a
host it's all music and text oriented
and highlight oriented and I they come
out with a video or two a day BAM so I
watch UFC MMA is my only cool hobby I've
ever thought about super nintendo games
for program asking for friend I have not
thought about it probably pretty pretty
fun shout out to our boy Johnny who's
killing it at Death Mountain right now
what about Jared first Goku yo man Goku
got Goku got God worked it hit the
special right so we'll see what happens
but yeah so uh I one of my less cool
hobbies is anime but I don't know man so
the ternary Power has been fun but I
don't know how I'm liking this arc I'm
hoping something else is gonna happen
like there's gonna be be something
changed do i braces yes for about three
more months then they come off
but I say that Goku Goku always comes
out on top that's the way we like it
I'm secretly a Vegeta fan not secretly
but I'm secretly hoping that Goku gets
knocked out of the tournament and that
Vegeta is just has a has a new form and
just beefs the tournament that's what
I'm hoping I know I'm living in a
fantasy realm because if Aegina always
has it on and Dragon Ball but as a
Vegeta fan I'm just hoping like that
this is the this is the arc where Vegeta
is just the guy that saves the day and
that's what I want I want pudgy to get
his moment where he's just like yo I got
this don't worry about it yeah I think
he's got the trump card man that's what
I wanted to happen so bad we all know
it's not gonna happen man Vegeta doesn't
ever get any love and Dragon Ball but
that's what I that's what I want man
I've been waiting for 30 years perfidy
today to get some love all right guys
last few questions I'm gonna wrap this
up in about five minutes
mhm
how do you find social figure out your
best way to study and retain the
information besides repetition I think
building projects is the best way
because often times you have to
problem-solve and you discover things
along the way that really stick
I don't watch Joe's channel Johnny do
not thoughts on the Nintendo switch I
think it's cool that you can take it on
the go
I don't play too many games but I did
just get the Super Nintendo classic I
love it because it's like a slice of my
my childhood DC or marvel I think this
is a flawed question because I think
both are great and I think as somebody
who grew up watching shows like x-men
and and watching like old shitty Hulk
movies and stuff like that that it is
just a great time and if you like Marvel
films you should probably like DC films
you like DC films you should probably
like Marvel films do you find a lot of
programs like anime I would say compared
to the average person probably there are
more programmers that watch anime and
then not also depends on the age right
you don't like Joe because he lied about
udemy being the reasons he got his work
he only started pimping them when he
learned you could make a little dough
well hey Andrea well thanks for joining
me
any idea what freaked out camp we'll
upload the beta I checked their backlog
they're cleaning out their backlog and I
think they're getting close to me I have
no idea though I've ever talked with
Quincy in a while
I should probably interview him again
it's been a while I like talking to
Quincy I would love to be working on a
project with him at some point it's very
interesting dude and I think that I
think that I could learn a lot just by
working with a guy like him and
so it's
I don't know it's it's interesting yes I
am familiar with I am familiar with Elon
Musk and his rocket stuff and how he's
gonna send us all of Mars hey man do you
see Bitcoin broke 6 K today for coming
up though I'm not too worried about the
fork and the 6 K yeah man that's a good
stuff right how do I feel about
augmented reality I've played around
with the I've had the opportunity to use
the the Microsoft forget what the
headset is called life I've played with
it's cool man it's really I like it much
better than virtual reality too bad it's
like $3,500 for the beta kit
Josh blocky doll though I don't mind
answering questions like this this goes
kind of against my my policy of
answering questions that might be a
little bit a little too too racy and to
a game like marry kill isn't really
something somebody should say that's an
employee if another company saw it I'll
just I'll just leave that back how I
seen Jessie LiveCode i watch one or two
react videos why I was doing it that
guy's been going on for like six months
what is it going on man Jesse isn't
running out of to teach you but
that was one of the things I talked
about in the top five challenge you
should follow is that they do these
great tutorial series and part of it is
you can get these people are specialized
in various topics and languages and they
can just deep die forever in it but yeah
he's coming
28k under once cave you aren't you the
the positive positive positive friend
aren't you live the cam angle the
Charles are coming I don't understand so
this is the thing about trolls I don't
understand how many kilos on the bar I
don't know that means I should
understand the motivation of people
trying to put other people down it's
unfortunate I think I think a lot of
people would own that bar oh there's
only 20 on there but the bar probably
weighs 10 so it's about 30 pounds
nothing crazy so I'll show you guys the
gym real quick but I would say this to
people who are a little bit on the
negative side I think you'll get a lot
more happiness in your life if you just
kind of focus on on maybe just pause a
little bit so we got the got the little
weight set here and a little thing there
nothing crazy
like a I've been negative at points in
my life and I found that it doesn't
really work
yeah
thank you and game operator you have a
nice night I think I'm going to I think
I'm going to okay I'll lay through this
I'll answer this this one this one
question for VLS and I'm gonna call it a
night so we're gonna go an hour and a
half and it's 10:30 which is way past my
bedtime
so sheet of Els said what is your
opinion on Chris Shawn's channel
basically turning some kind of
relationship heartbreak channel um this
is a this is a strange thing because I
don't want to kick a man when he's down
so I watched recently a video about
Chris Shawn breaking up and it was the
and it seems like every video I catch of
his and I don't watch many I was a fan
when I interviewed him and he was
talking about development and now it's
not so much and I it's not really what I
watched but I watched the video I got I
watched the most recent or one of the
lasts or second video about about half
of it but I found it too uncomfortable
to continue watching about the his
breakup even though that's what the
video is about I I clicked it because
that's what was about but then I felt so
uncomfortable watching it but I would
say I probably watched a video two or
three months before that and usually it
was it's always the sad topics I tuned
in for and then they make me
uncomfortable Eve and it just seems I
know I don't know but it's a vlogging
channel so I don't I don't I don't
having issued like from from a very
outside perspective I don't have an
issue with a vlogging channel logging
about what's going on in this life and I
think that's okay
as a viewer I haven't liked his his
content hasn't been relatable to me I
should say for quite some time but I do
watch whenever there are sad videos I
guess I want to say there was a family
death or something along that line
was the video I watched her for and but
this most recent video was just I don't
know I think I just felt uncomfortable
and I don't know I I here's the thing if
April and I broke up you better believe
I probably would be put in some
heartbroken ass video on on the Internet
we're back but uh yeah I don't know man
cuz I I know for a fact that I'm capable
of doing the same thing mine would just
be not as well visited that was just
throw it out there and I don't know I'd
probably take it down a few days later
or something but if he has multiple
videos talking about his breakup and so
that so here's the thing I don't watch
his channel enough to know the context
of all this but I watched up to a point
where he said this is the final time
we're breaking up this is for real and
and there's definitely if that if he's
thrown out a video every if he's doing
like the high school thing where you
break up you get back together you break
up you get back together you break up
you get back together you break up you
get back me if he's doing that that
would really kind of not be something
that I'm uh I I wouldn't appreciate like
I totally understand you're heartbroken
something happens
he deleted his chat sorry I'm catch up
on chat right now you deleted this
channel Chris Shawn got rid of his
channel is that accurate because I
watched this video I wanna say I watch
it like this morning or yesterday
morning that's unfortunate I mean I I
mean I didn't like the video but I think
it was enough to delete the channel um I
don't know I do find that I think
someone nailed it about the Oprah effect
a little bit too much as channel that
was part of the stuff
what's the dislike ratio I think it was
like a 90% positive 10% dislike when I
looked at it he gets good views on his
stuff and so people are watching he he
he has a smaller subscriber base to me
but gets better views than me most of
the time he's doing very well
um I personally I think it might be a
majority thing I don't I don't know how
old Chris's but but for me I felt like
he was in terms of maturity just a
younger guy who's still trying to figure
out to go that that level of maturity
and I never and it's hard for me to
relate to him I just assumed he's 30 no
he's not no he's not I thought he was
like 21 he's not 30 is he oh my goodness
I don't know that I was giving him a
pass because I thought he was like 21
um so yeah uh alright so that chain that
actually really changes my perspective
on him a little bit
so I so it makes a little more sense if
he's 21 I kind of like okay because
everyone does mature it at different
rates that's completely true right so
I'd like and I want you guys think I'm
like kicking him when he's down but for
me it's it's a it's kind of like all the
he's doing very well his editing skills
are top-notch but in terms of pure
content it's not what I would watch and
part of that is just being on different
sort of mental wavelengths maturity wise
I guess and that's all it is it's I
don't know and by the way I say this is
somebody who doesn't mind throwing their
life out there like I have no problem
talking about that um you know I have no
problem showcasing my life or like you
know I did a video when we drove and
stayed in a hotel and motel 6 during the
Hurricanes or like we'd go out of the
country doing stuff like that yeah I
would I would say constructive criticism
is kind of what I'm saying just kind of
explain not that I think is contents bad
I think it's very good it's just not for
me
when he was doing more more sort of how
he got started in coding that's really
what I liked about it and now I think
it's a little less so can you tell a lie
the computer guy to have your make
contouring to Lisa what do you think I
know you like I don't know what I don't
know Eli at all um you know doesn't know
me either you Eli don't give a
about me
you hate Chris's hardcore positive
anyone can do it when he got a lucky ass
break I don't it doesn't sound like he
got a lucky ass break he put in some
work I would say that I don't always
like his advice I think he gives very
poor advice a lot of the times the
advice to take a unpaid internship is
awful advice in my opinion and the the I
saw something the other day saying that
like the job stats on who was getting
paid like so you're saying something
this is this a while back and this is
when I advise wise when it comes to like
the he's like well no one's actually
getting hired at the rates that the job
sites are saying like you know the area
says 65,000 I think it was a live stream
I was watching but most people are
getting hired at 45 it's like no
statistically speaking from the people
who collect the stats most people are
getting hired at 65 or whatever the
number was and you telling people this
is really bad advice and my Drinan
anyhow so I kind of disagreed with his
advice at times but people have
disagreed with mine as well so uh I I
don't know man
I I mean I think if you work very hard
you can become a developer I don't think
don't think
no no man I don't know how to I don't
know how to put it because I I feel like
some I feel like he may not take this as
constructive criticism that's that's my
main thing right now is I don't ever
it's I I'm trying to be constructive as
to why I think he's wrong and make an
argument but I don't he's not here to
defend himself
ask you why he thinks that is so it it's
not fair for me to criticize him because
that's not that's not what I want to do
I'm just kind of since it came up and
talked about it and honestly I don't
watch enough of his videos to be able to
tell you if he gives better advice and
he was giving six months ago but I
wasn't very I wasn't I don't know I
don't maybe maybe he's maybe understand
the this the game a little bit better I
guess so
yeah I think I mean fintechs right I
don't think it's hard it I don't think
it's hard to the point where it's
impossible there's there's a certain
there is a certain group of people who
can't do it and the people who do just
do it for them I usually burn out but it
just takes a lot of hard work and it
takes a lot of dedication especially get
going and it's definitely not a good fit
for everybody and it's pretty clear
right so a lot of times you'll have
project managers and business analysts
who on your team you know they actually
used to be developers and they
transitioned to other roles because they
weren't happy with it right maybe they
they didn't want to write code or wasn't
really for them maybe they weren't the
best at it or maybe maybe it's one of
those things where they just didn't
enjoy it but they're in the industry and
how can we transition to another role so
ask yourself sis would you be willing to
code for free if so coatings for you
that's not a very good thing I mean are
you willing to code outside of your job
I think is a better answer
um there's a lot of things that I like I
code outside my job I would not code for
somebody who didn't want to pay me which
is a completely separate thing but I do
think it's important especially when
you're getting started and building that
you actually enjoy coding and a lot of
times people on paper
becoming a developer is a very good
career it pays well there's a lot of
jobs it's in high demand basically
everything that you want in a job and it
has large growth all right the three
main things are does it pay well are
there a lot of jobs and are those jobs
growing and being a developer hits all
those so a lot of people naturally will
be taken to that direction but very few
will actually sit down and figure out
hey is this for me is this something
that I enjoy and most people say look I
haven't enjoyed a job a day in my life I
don't care about this one but really it
is something that you need to enjoy a
long term
I could get all kinds of girls as a
developer I don't know what type of
develop me you doing but we'll have to
talk my buddy just graduated CS degree
in June and we're gonna be attending a
boot camp of three can't even complete
the tribute page a frico camp now that
could be a situation where he can't code
or that could be a situation where he
never got taught HTML CSS I'm afraid it
scared outsourcing er can you talk about
I'm not scared of outsourcing in the
slightest but I think I think web design
a lot job is to gain health source web
development not so much a lot of a lot
of companies want to do stuff in-house
it gives them a lot more control a lot
more customized ability and it's
oftentimes a lot cheaper than actually
outsourcing to a contracting company
have I ever ran into a co-worker that
was just impossible to work with no but
I have worked with some that have felt
that way about others I'm a pretty
mellow dude for the most part I try to
make sure I try to make sure that that I
can work with everybody I don't I'm not
like super serious and I try to you know
make everything a joke so I try to get
on people's good sides because I that's
how I I don't like being super serious
and if someone is below par I tried to
raise them up and if someone doesn't get
anything I try to make them better and
if someone is difficult to work with I
try to use my communication skills to
find out why so if there has ever been
somebody that has been difficult to work
with I will directly ask them and say I
say hey man what you just did it isn't
sitting right with me am i misreading
the situation or is did I offend you in
some way just direct no this let's be
passive-aggressive and then three months
later we're still being passive
aggressive I think it's I think having a
good communication skills can solve a
lot of those issues of being people
being being too aggressive
the AI fierce overblown I'm prone I tell
you this right now guys this eight the
AI stuff people are losing their damn
mind over about something that that if
AI is writing our code for us we have a
lot more issues in the world then you
you think are going to happen but I
think most people are just like to worry
that's it
um but I don't know man if you guys have
been following what AI can do now
it's not too much it's not yeah but also
like what are your alternatives I mean
really what it what are the what are
some good alternatives what happened to
your podcast I have a couple recorded so
um I was I did two with Niklas Spinoza
and it just wasn't working out of mine I
really didn't enjoy having a partner in
crime not that there was anything wrong
with Nick I just kind of like a work on
my own schedule right when it when you
are when you are when your developer you
work at a company you work under Sony on
schedule when your youtuber one of the
great things about having your own
channel is it's yours right it's going
you can put your time into it however
you want whenever you want in whatever
direction you want and you live and die
by that and although it was great
working with him and I have nothing with
positive things say from a work
standpoint of now I have to kind of as a
professional keep myself accountable
because I'm working with another
professional it was something that I
didn't like you know the YouTube part of
the reason I'm able to do YouTube and
you not care that I'm not growing as
fast as I would want and stuff like they
say I keep it fun I keep it as something
that I enjoy doing and I continue to
grow and all that sort of stuff but it
felt so much like a job even after the
two podcasts that although I'm going to
continue podcasts on my own I'm not
going to take on a partner in the
immediate future ever again do you have
any courses on udemy no not not yet I
did just interview Tyler McGinnis this
last weekend so that will come out look
forward to that
what'd I ever consider starting my own
business slash company versus working in
95 yeah I definitely would if I maybe
not as a developer like it'd be software
related like I've talked about opening a
dev clothing store or dev like stickers
notebooks sort of like a vari Anto 25
and I've I've also talked about having
like a dev lootcrate box if something
like that took off and I was able to
market it through the channel and it was
making me more than a full time income
as a developer and I couldn't do both
I'd probably hire somebody in the in the
near future maybe have April run the
general day-to-day until it got to a
point where it could support two people
but yeah I mean I I'm not opposed to
taking Gamble's in life if I were to
start my own business and it didn't work
out there's no reason I couldn't go back
and become a developer somewhere am i
seeing companies transition from angular
1 to angular 4 yes when I was
interviewing I had angular 1 experience
and a lot of companies were asking how I
felt about angular for what my
experience was that they were going to
be transitioning to it and so on and so
forth and so it seems that a lot of
companies are art now that's out of beta
and there's a lot more documentation a
lot more tutorials people are much more
familiar with it
yes a lot of companies are switching to
angular 4 or angularjs to angular I
should say the people at angular have
officially stated it somewhere in their
documentation that you shouldn't be
saying it's angular 4 cuz it's weird to
say the version number you should just
say angular what are your thoughts on
flash I think you're an idiot if you're
using flash because chrome disables it
by default
you remember when I only had three to
five people watching your live streams
yeah it was just you and then three or
four of my browser windows open oh uh
chalice crown yeah it's good man it's
it's nice I've been street live
streaming for two hours I don't know how
you guys got me for two hours man
and next time on the flash Barry Allen
let's face against this great ice so
Google Chrome alright guys so uh so let
me wrap this up if you're if you're new
to the live stream the reason I did this
live stream tonight was to say thank you
to the new 1000 subscribers that have
joined us we are now at twenty eight
thousand subscribers pretty cool right
the goal is 100k we're going for it
right so I like to do these every
thousand subscribers take a second to
thank the 1000 that game came before
it's for still tuning in and tell the
new thousand welcome and I like to end
everything on a a series of final
thoughts or so and and I think that we
will have our final stock be about
maturity and what I want to say is
everybody matures at a different rate
and I find that I know that I matured
when I understood what it was that I
wanted in life a lot of times we go
aimlessly through life and we're just
trying to be numb instead of be happy
and so whatever it is I want you to
really think about what it is you want
in life and why and then think about how
you can accomplish that and you may
mature in the process cuz that's violent
that's what happened to me it's like I
kind of really thought about what it was
that I wanted in life what I was unhappy
with and I was able to to really hone in
on how to improve it and because of that
I've been a lot happier in the process
sometimes I mean how many of you have a
dream board where you dream of doing
something and you work towards it or you
you have ideas that are concrete that
your work
every day towards probably very few
unfortunately and I think when you
actually think concretely about what
your goals are and how you want to
accomplish them you'll be much more
successfully mature a lot in the process
so I hope that there's something wrong
with maturing right it sounds like such
a old cliche word you know if if you're
going through like puberty right now
you're like shut up old man but it's a
it's uh I think it's something about
maturing as an individual it can happen
at any age whether you're young or old
right there's plenty of 50 year old
people acting like they're 15 year old
kids but I would say that I know for me
when I was when I actually thought about
my goals and how I was going to
accomplish them that there's certain
level of maturity that had to be earned
and learned and help me become a
developer and I'm slowly accomplishing
other things that I want and I've been a
lot happier in the process so just
something to think about that's today's
final thoughts like the late great
I don't think Jerry Springer is dead but
like the great Jerry Springer himself so
take it what you will a lot of times I
will just give you my thoughts you'll do
with it what you will sometimes in the
comments you'll tell me no one gives a
 about your final thoughts Dylan but
we're giving some homage to to the the
spring stir if you will so have a good
night guys
I appreciate you all thank you to the
28,000 that are here and don't forget to

that great and I'll see you next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
