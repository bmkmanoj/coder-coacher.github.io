back at it again make a website
boundaries and space boundaries and
space so there's couple things yeah I
know here you have your margin padding
content they do a really good job with
these images whoever they hired to do
these I've always been rather impressed
with it so good job man content is what
you put in their images text padding is
kind of the space around it border with
a class a chill efficiently a picture
frame sort of thing in the margin is
additional space that's kind of how I
think of it similar to padding I often
get them to confused all right excuse my
fill-in down in there alright so the web
bauer the webbrowser currently displaced
under galleries homepage let's give each
gallery item of border so we're going to
go to main CSS where I'm looking for the
class again class is denoted by the dot
gallery item and we just want to add a
border that adds a 5 pixel border along
with and we want that border to be solid
and then we want it to and you'll see
right now exactly what a border is / FF
now when we were in it you'll notice
that it's kind of hard to see right here
but there is a little grayish white or
what I think it's white actually border
around it so
alright so now in the page description
you'll see right here the face
description in class we want to give it
some padding now when you're defining
padding padding can be anything from it
can be to the left to the right to the
top to the bottom but if you just put
one value in its going to apply it to
all of them each direction so it's a
little hard to see here but you will
keep going you'll see the padding so it
had 30 pixels of padding so let's see if
we can so this was page description it's
up that's our page description so we can
add 200 and it should be very rampant so
you'll see there's a lot more padding on
each side here so let's just go back and
fix that next so we're starting padding
top bottom left right so gallery item so
currently in gallery item we only have a
margin of two so what we want in this
case is we want to give it 20 pixels and
this the margin will give it 20 pixels
between each other so padding is with
the object margin is between each other
so you'll see right here everyone has
about 20 pixels between each other
pretty cool this is I mean a lot of web
design is your styling in general select
the content in HTML is pretty
straightforward and then you have to
kind of have an eye of what looks good
so even if you know how CSS works you
still have to kind of a design mentality
behind it
alright so we're in main.css we're
looking for a containment side of day of
class gallery there's a gallery class
selector here it is and we want to just
set the top here to add 20 pixels it
looks like and this is how you would do
it for margin you just go margin desktop
20 pixels all right so block verse in
line elements this will be one of the
most semi annoying things to remember
but it's kind of how it goes sometimes
so sometimes if you have a block how did
you how explain so when something's
displayed in line it allows you to kind
of put these empty spaces there when
it's block you think it was a block for
the whole thing essentially most of the
time or block around the item so it'll
just be simple simply to showcase it so
in this case nav Li selector give it
display of property alright so we're
looking for now Li cool so in this case
we want to give it a property we wanted
to give it the property display the
value in line so now when you run this
let's see here so you'll see how it's in
light now let's go ahead and take that
away because we actually showcase it
without it whoops excuse me
what's going on here all right so
display inline i'll go ahead and run
that hmm maybe just like default it's
going to ruin interesting it should be
doing something slightly different but
uh perhaps I'm mistaken I could just be
the sizing actually works out the same
way as well so let's see here so I'm
gonna float right okay so floating right
will allow something like say you have a
text and you want the image to float
right you then float send the image to
the right and the text would kind of
work its way around and you could like
flow centerfold left as well so in this
case our contact button here we're just
going to go ahead and send it to the
right or float it in this case so we're
just going to contact button here it is
here and then we're going to give it the
property float into the right and you
again you can do this left to the right
to the center and now when we run it
you'll see that's right here and not
only is it right here because we're
floating it it's also unless we we put
something else it's also just going to
float to the right it's just it's going
to let all the other things to be ok but
as long as those things there it's still
going to go to the right it's going to
be in the same thing as well so you'll
allow things to work around it that's
part of floating ok so lots of stuff
here I highly suggest kind of reading
through this if you're if you're not as
familiar with it like display flex I
don't miss flex
it's life like sensitive classroom and
online horizontally okay alright so we
are in our gallery class selector macias
let's set the property to flex so let's
take a look at what's going on here so
these are all lined up and now we want
to set it to flex gallery class will set
display flex will run it i cool now
let's see what's going on here so when
we flex it it looks like it's going to
run it all the way off the page if this
is I bet if we zoom out we can get more
interesting I've never used to splay
flex I could see why I would never have
used it because it doesn't seem like a
very good idea with the responsive
design but I guess Mourinho in this case
all right to solve this problem solve
this blood display flex create a flex
wrap property and set it to wrap ok so
now now I see what's going on here so
well seriously great flex ramp so they
flexed a trap and we'll set the property
to wrap and we run it let's see how how
that works differently and so now we
have a little bit more responsive design
instead of it going off the side it's
coming down to the bottom not exactly
perfect because things aren't evenly
spaced but it's better than what it was
and now we just want to justify the
property justify content to Center cool
and now you'll see that everything
centered everything's kind of beautiful
because of our padding and spacing
everything is our margin and padding i
should say everything is working out
much better so we're going to do a
little bit of what are we doing here oh
wow ran out of anchor over to the anchor
button here now we're going to say
position relative
alright so
so they already added the anchor we ever
contact there our position relative
seems to be working now on active so
this is kind of a explain not actually
monstrament a pseudo class selector
that's what it's called so basically
means when you're hovering over it or
you're clicking it so we wanna do is go
top 2px so when we click it it's going
to your gonna see that's moving down
slightly and create it that in effect is
going to create a sort of animation
effect probably would do something like
this morning javascript but this is kind
of cool that you can do and CSS I like
that I like that they just showed that
it's always cool when they go that extra
mile do things like that so that was
boundaries in space definitely these CSS
skills right here are sorry I don't know
what's going on here just want to show
it but these are all pretty important at
the end of the day I highly recommend
kind of being familiar with mostly
things I've it like again I'm not very
familiar with flex but it may or may not
be important in responsive design but it
looks like we have one less than left so
as always guys don't forget to Like and
