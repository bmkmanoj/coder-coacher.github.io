back in free code camp in the advanced
algorithm section so what are we doing -
we're doing update inventory the task
here is we get two different inventories
each one is a two-dimensional array what
we have is the amount of stock we have
and what that stock is so we have 21
bowling balls and then our new inventory
sometimes we have matching inventory on
what we want to do is we want to combine
these arrays to return a single array
that has new values and then we want to
sort it so let me show you how I did
this this was I did this on my first
attempt it's actually pretty similar to
something I did at work for analytics of
combining like data on the front-end
normally you'd do something like that on
the back end but for the sake of time I
built it on the front end so how I
started was with a simple for loop and
what we wanted to do here was because at
the end we want turn array one so what
we want to iterate through our first
array we just set up a simple for loop
and say well I is less than R 2 dot
length is reiterating through the whole
thing I plus plus and I think I left
chaton whoops so let's go ahead and
close that
so we're iterating through the whole
array now what we're doing next is we
need to check array 1 to see if it
already has like a bowling ball in it
protect the value the current value
we're iterating through an array - to
see if that value exists so for instance
hairpin does and we don't we want to
instead just go ahead and add that to it
so the way that I do that it just graces
this we want to get a boolean value
because what we're going to do is if it
does an exodus we want to add the whole
thing into the array 1 so for instance
in our example halfeatenapple doesn't so
we're going to add the that array it's
its index value into array 1 but if it
does exist like bowling ball we're just
going to
update the total and the way that I did
that was using the every function and
we'll start by storing it into a
variable that I called inventory exists
and we're going to set this equal to
we're going to iterate through using the
every function if you're not familiar
with every what it is is a method built
into built into arrays and you've set a
condition and it checks to see if that's
true for every element in the array so
let's say you wanted yet an array of
elements as 1 2 3 4 5 if you set every
array if you could use every to check if
all the values are greater or less than
a number and if one of them fails it
will return back false or true and so on
and so forth so the way that I did it is
I just check to see if and you need to
use a return statement if the current
item that we're iterating through r2i
exists in here now not our - i just i
we're checking for the name the reason
for that is because if we if we don't
let's say we have multiple inventories
that may throw it off down the road and
so we're saying hey is it is it true
that it is not equal to the element
we're checking which is an index of the
array and notice how we're putting in
one so the element is this is the
element which is being this is the
element of current inventory or array 1
and we're saying hey does this exist all
right and 1 because we're checking what
type it is
now with that we're going to go ahead
and have put a little bit logic if it
doesn't exist add it to array edit our
one else add its stock to it add it soft
we'll leave at that so let's give it if
now we could just say inventory exists
because that's returning back a boolean
value so if it's false it won't happen
and then what else so if this is true
meaning that it doesn't exist we're
going to add that to the value so we'll
just say R 1 dot push and we know what
value to push because we're current
we're in our for loop so there's there's
not any thing to put to could I so R 2 I
else what we want to do is we need that
we now need to find out the index value
and we can do that using find index so
we'll create a variable here you don't
necessarily have to create a variable to
do these things inventory exists or what
I call what all these calling index Val
I just think that it might be a little
bit easier and cleaner code and to sell
the point a little bit R 1 dot find
index so we're going to iterate through
the first array array that we're adding
to because now we know that this value
does exist in our in our current
inventory array or our one parameter and
we want to know where it exists so we'll
go ahead and use the find index function
which what that does is it returns the
first value that brings true to
and what we want is returned where the
element that we're iterating over in our
one basically the the index of array one
that we're checking if that value in
this case would be bowling ball dirty
sock whatever is equal equal equal to R
to the current item that we're iterating
the current for loop item and then of
course the name of that product so
that's why we have two one there now
once we have that we'll have our index
value and then it's just a matter of
taking our R one and then the index
valve to target it and then index zero
because now we're targeting now we're
targeting the actual stock amount in
case of the bowling ball 21 and then
we're going to go ahead and just add to
that value we have our two I and then
zero and again we know that because it's
in the else statement so we know it
exists and we're going how to targeting
it and we found the location with
defined index now at this point at this
point if we run our code we're going to
pass some tests what the issue is here
and we can check to see like oh cool so
we have 88 bowling balls so we're
passing in 21 and we're passing in 6788
everything's working but now we need to
sort it we could do that with the sort
function now if you were going to use
sort just sort typically if you had an
array of strings you can go ahead and
call r1 dot sort and would sort it for
you
now that's not going to work we got we
got to do a little bit of a callback
function of it and the way that we do
that is we because we're checking an
index value in the array to sort it by
that is a string we just got to do a
little bit extra work so we're going to
do the callback function that's part of
sort and in here and again it's going to
get a little messy in here I should
probably have sort stored this in a
variable but the idea is all the same so
we're going to sort the array and we're
going to use a ternary off
Reiter which if you're not familiar with
the ternary operator don't worry I'll
I'll break it down and we're going to
say look is a 1 this is 1 index value
and this is the next one and we're
saying is that less than B 1 this is how
you're going to check a string and you
can look it up in the documentation
essentially it this is how it works and
what we want to do if it is less than
that we want to return negative 1 or we
want to return 1 now this is our
statement this is kind of like what's in
an if statement our hoops yeah it's a 1
less than v1 if it's true that's what
this means for the true statement return
negative 1 for the else statement return
1 it's just a nicer and cleaner way of
writing it and it works for what we're
trying to do but after that assuming I
don't have any syntax mistakes we are
done and good to go so we use a lot of
different callback functions if this has
been a video that I've been wanting to
do for a bit I left some of the advanced
algorithms but since I've become a
developer and I've been practicing
algorithms you're seeing a lot of new
stuff for me the every function I don't
think I've used I don't know if I've
used find index and the other ones or
the sort or ternary operators just
always trying to get better so hope you
