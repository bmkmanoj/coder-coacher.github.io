time we got the status of free code camp
if they were online or offline what we
want to do in this video is we just want
to get the followers now in the example
they give you an array to check we're
gonna do it a little bit different
because I don't I don't know I think
that's kind of a punk waiting to go out
I think we can do better than that
so let's go ahead and showcase the URL
before we get started and see what sort
of info that we're gonna get so this is
gonna give us all the follower info it's
an array that takes in a bunch of
information about the people that free
code camp follows now the information
that we want is going to be under
channel where is that channel right here
and from channel we want to go to
display name so follows i dot Channel
dot display name okay so let's go ahead
and get started here we're gonna do a
get JSON call to that URL that's how
we're gonna start off and then on that
we wanted to go ahead and just put our
we'll say our follower URL and you don't
have to do it like this you can you can
obviously just put the URL this is just
a preference thing um it may even be
worse doing it this way I'm not really
quite sure cuz we're creating a variable
for something we're using one-time we'll
go ahead and call this data too since we
already have a date of one
okay so let's go ahead and console dot
log data to make sure everything's
working as we check our work like so and
it's working it's too big for this
browser perfect that means it's working
otherwise nothing would display next
what we want to do is we want to iterate
through the array and then get the
display name from the followers now the
reason that we're doing this is the
display name is the same thing that will
go in the URL that we're gonna check
later on so that we can get all of their
information so we'll just do a little
thing like this we'll say we'll do a for
loop for our I is equal to zero well I
use less than data dot follows our array
dot length I plus plus so there's our
for loop excuse me this is data to dot
follows now from here all we want to do
is push out the display name again you
don't have to create a variable I just
happen to do it because I know when
people are starting out it makes life a
little bit easier for them to kind of
see what it is that that you're doing so
especially if you try to look back at it
you're like oh this is obviously the
display name because I have a name
display name there's no confusion so
this is our display name so let's go
ahead and console dot log this out make
sure it's working and we'll go ahead and
display name and you'll see we're
getting all the display names very cool
now if you remember correctly I said we
wanted to store this into an array so
it's going to get rid of this go ahead
and clear our data so what I did was I
just created a simple array at the top
here I believe I called it following
we call it ya following works will save
our following so you couldn't empty
array and all we want to do is following
dot push display name because we're
paranoid and we won't like to check all
of our code we counts we're gonna ask
actually after the fact we'll console
dot log us out so that's our for loop no
this is our for loop so outside our for
loop console dot log now following make
sure we got everything we needed one
there's our falling array very nice now
in our get JSON here we can go ahead and
push our values to it as well so if you
remember correctly we had a we had three
people that we needed to push to the
array the reason for it is that unique
cases where they either didn't exist or
we need somebody that was online all the
time just so we could test our code so
we're just gonna go ahead and following
not push three people work we're gonna
push the user concert 404 this guy
doesn't exist
we're gonna push the user Bruno Finn it
doesn't exist and we're gonna push the
use the display name I should say
ESL underscore SC two at the time I
believe these guys were always online
that's why they ran it so we can go
ahead and console dot log that out as
well just to check because now we should
have
everybody in our following array and
there we are right here very nice so
that's how we're gonna get the followers
up next what we're gonna do is we're
actually going to take this array that
we've just created from their followers
and then we're gonna run a get JSON that
is going to get all of these all of
their information using a for loop on
that get JSON and then we'll we'll
return the logo the display name and the
status and all that things sort of good
so so as all these guys thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video hey guys thanks for watching the
video my good friend Matt an engineered
truth has a three-part interview with
Quincy Larson the founder of free code
camp go ahead and check that out and
still get a lot of really cool stuff
thanks for watching and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
