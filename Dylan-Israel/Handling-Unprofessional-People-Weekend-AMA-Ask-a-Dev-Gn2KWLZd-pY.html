and I am currently up a little bit late
cuz I had a little bit too much caffeine
today because I was making up some hours
because I went to an acupuncture
appointment this morning which took
about three hours so I stayed up pretty
late so I decided tomorrow when April
and I are going to look at some
apartments to move a little bit closer
to work that I would do our weekend
livestream because I'm like I have time
tomorrow and I'm up and I'm trying to
drink water
get this caffeine the hell out of my
system so excuse the the nighttime
attire I'm gonna cover myself up here
but was ladies enjoy so if you guys
haven't been to the weekend live stream
before typically we do these on Saturday
so as I mentioned the reason why we're
doing today and I'd like to start off
with a question for why we let some
people funnel in here and then the point
of the AMA s and the weekend mushrooms
it's a to provide some guidance provide
some mentoring answer your questions
really on a on a once a week basis and
then of course if you want more
personalized answers you want one-on-one
I do one-on-one mentoring sessions for a
paid rate right so today's question is
something that's going on in my in my
professional life and out of respect for
my employer and and the people I work
with I'm not gonna go into too much
detail but how do you have you handle
professional unprofessional people so
one of the things about me is I'm a
pretty laid-back guy I try to have fun I
try to make sure that most people I work
with enjoy my presence right and but all
the same time try being professional you
know I want to let my team know that hey
I'm you know let my my co-workers know
but hey you know you count on me
essentially and then um I'm gonna try
and do put the best foot forward and
what
when you have that professionalism when
you do need some help it's you know you
can you've paid it forward and so on and
so forth so how do you handle
unprofessional people you know people
who aren't doing their job on a regular
basis I'm not talking about for a week
you know everyone has their ups and
downs in life in my personal case I've
been working with somebody for about two
months that is just a very
unprofessional in many ways you know mr.
meetings missus requirements it's not
essentially doing their job at times
having to follow up with them multiple
times to get a response things like that
things that are really just not
acceptable in my opinion so what do you
do about that how do you handle it well
the first I think the first thing you do
is the first couple times it happens you
just you don't worry about it right you
uh you say you you have you give you
give everyone the benefit of the doubt I
feel like if you're always on the edge
and you're ready to start popping off on
somebody no one likes that right you
don't know what's happened you know and
I'm talking about maybe once or twice
maybe three times you know the first
week or so say okay well something's
going on maybe there's some deadlines
who knows why they're not getting back
to me so you know you have that aspect
you have to have that uh
you have to have that outlook in life
give them the benefit now now after
you've given them the benefit of the
doubt
you know you kindly and by the way when
you when you do give them the Minnesota
you can kindly via vocally through email
I recommend through email the reason for
it is so that you can have documented
evidence essentially of hey you know I
appreciate it if you you know we read
this if you just try your best to
accomplish these things to do follow the
process that isn't in order that
everyone agreed on so on and so forth
now at this point you're probably
dealing someone who's just not very
professional and you're starting to
realize that after several times so what
do you do from then and that when that
doesn't work right well
I don't go to their superiors I go to
mine right I sort of explained the
situation you stay professional on your
on your own work and I've had this
happen twice in my in my professional
career once at my current workplace
currently and then at a previous
workplace and it was kind of handled the
same way I made my you know one-on-one
hey you know can you please handle this
this is an issue for me this is not what
we agreed upon so and so and so forth
right no need to get anybody else
involved give them the benefit about now
when it's clear that you're not going to
be listened to
you start documenting right through
email which may be you starting on the
very beginning no problem now if it
continues you you it's really sort of
and it's it's it might be uncomfortable
but you go to your direct superior who
hopefully is very open mind about this
sometimes it's easier said than done
right so you go to your experience what
they would do and maybe they'll talk to
their superior maybe they won't
sometimes let's sort of tell you what I
said you know well have you tried asking
have you tried saying this is an issue
start documenting it and then when the
when when that when you explain that
that doesn't work
oftentimes what they'll say is please CC
me on there it's like hey let's throw
that that big dick manager the big the
big dick boss signature on it to let you
know like amen
not only is this getting documented but
it's getting documented in you know some
managers emails so you're not the only
one getting looked on and it's kind of
unfortunate right because as a
professional right you expect other
people to be professionals and it's kind
of sad when you have to assign
babysitters really because that that's
what it ends up being right when you
have an email that only has one person
that needs to be on it realistically and
you have to start seeing other other
people on it you're basically showing
them that you are see seeing your
superiors on their show that you are
doing or doing the right thing and
handling it and letting them know right
you're not hiding this on BCC if you're
not familiar with the email so
essentially you can send emails right
and you can see see people which
everyone involved sees I think in BCC
which essentially hides the email from
the person you're sending to so you're
see seeing them because you want them to
see that you're like hey managers are
being being uh you know see see you down
here just sort of keeping a check-in
it's so it's so it's so strange when you
have to get that level because as I
mentioned I'm pretty light hard to guy
for the most part you know I make I make
jokes and I try to you know be able to
take criticism as well as give it but
when we have to start having baby
sitters this is when you it's it's so
very strange so that's that's today's
topic is how to have essentially handle
unprofessional people really sort of
those processes you give them the
benefit of doubt you politely request
that they do what is I guess considered
normal or expected and probably document
it I mean the first time you know having
conversation like a man appreciate if
you make the meeting that you set up or
whatever it might be and then reach out
to and if that doesn't happen after one
time you just start sending emails to to
you it happens again or another time to
three times you eventually just start
you go to your boss
hopefully I'm documentation to see all
this sir so because it does it just
affect the outcome of projects doesn't
affect stress levels frustrations
right I was so frustrated about it that
I started except talking to to you know
as a developer you get tons of
recruiters and stuff like that we're
sure taking phone calls I sort of looked
at the situation I don't really want to
leave I'm very happy at where I'm at I'm
just very unhappy with this one
particular situation and so
now it's also another reason I want to
make this video because you may be
frustrated by people in your work
environment who are unprofessional or
things like that
and I have uh this is probably the first
company I've worked with that I would
want to stay with for a short little
while which is strange but it was it was
very strange thing last two three weeks
where you start taking phone calls
because you're so frustrated by a
situation and you're like how can I
handle this better and then you started
looking a little bit differently at
things so if you are in that situation
really I think I think James says the
best is safe professional focus on on
your work and just document it really at
the end of the day you just keep
documenting it and documenting it and
eventually what happens is you know you
can only get by so often with so much so
that's sort of my my thoughts on it what
are your thoughts on cold stills web
developer course any glaring holes - may
not cover I'm not familiar enough with
it hmm the IO story is rejecting hybrid
apps what a bunch of haters oh yeah I'm
not too familiar with the mobile hybrid
app market I do think that's kind of
lame though it's really how do you
handle changes and scope that affect the
deadlines when changes are made by one
person others hounding you to get it
done this is another interesting thing
so I have this saying at work that
deadlines much like unicorns are both
imaginary so the reason I say that nots
got too much into the company culture
things like that literally a unicorn
comes from but so deadlines are
something that people make up nine times
out of ten there's no real reason a
deadline needs to exist for a lot of
things
and it's not developers who are often
making the deadlines it's not it's not
it's usually management choose a number
say a three months walk this okay
well we got five other things going on
so sometimes you get it sometimes you
don't um and very rarely is it like oh
we have a big press announcement oh we
have a big event it's um you know so
it's it's hard because I'll give you a
very perfect example I'm building a
reporting application I thought I was
building it for one report type at least
in the short term right so typically
when you're working on projects there's
usually multiple phases there's the
first phase the second phase third phase
you do multiple iterations you know you
build it out basic you build it
progressively gets more complex and so I
thought I was in phase one which is
which was because you know maybe I
misunderstood the requirements maybe the
requirements were good enough things
happen you adjust but the difference in
terms of scope of the project required
me to put in probably an extra day at
work extra full day at work right so um
set my myself behind a little bit uh
what do I do
well sometimes you rise to the occasion
sometimes you miss those deadlines in my
case I know for Isis occasion huh I'm
not one I will I will I like to put here
here's the thing guys I like to tell my
PM's I don't talk about the deadlines
but I because I try to set expectations
low so this is you want this I'm troughs
of knowledge right yeah knowledge on you
guys right now under-promise and
over-deliver
all right this very simple concept and
even as someone who tries to have that
mindset I make the mistake of over not
over-promising and under-delivering
because we all like to think that we can
get you
as a developer get 25 to 30 hours of
actual code unit we've probably closer
to 25 15 hours are consumed by meetings
and other things that go along with
being a developer of those 25 hours
you're gonna have maybe code reviews as
part of it so there's five hours at you
know an hour day gone you might have
other aspects that are still programming
related but in from there you might need
to you know work with the back end up
further oh so all that stuff happens but
we always it's so hard to as a developer
say yeah I think it's a weak thing and
then you get into it you're like oh
I didn't know about these seven features
that you just assume we're part of it
right or it's it's very strange so um I
will say that I've worked with one p.m.
and I've been very happy with the
project deadlines so I am sad to see her
go she has been promoted she's doing a
very good job I have nothing but respect
for her but there's one thing I will say
is that in the seven or eight months
that I've been here I don't think I've
felt too much pressure on delivering by
deadlines so I'm very happy with that
on a sidenote but um yeah so deadlines
are something very strange because they
they often come from people you don't
even know exist or you don't even talk
to you like I and honestly I would have
no problem and this is this is kind of
strange this is stepping out of the
developer will house I I have this joke
but it's kind of true I was talking with
another p.m. I said is this true are you
guys basically a buffer for PMS are
basically PMS are basically a buffer for
developers right PMS are are my this is
my theory this is my theory that know
something
we'll agree with this only not the PM's
our buffer for business to the developer
and part of that being that buffer is
taking the heat all right so being able
to you know essentially get yelled at at
times so the developers can get done and
they they essentially they essentially
take take not necessarily take the blame
but they take the frustration they take
the you know I tell you I've seen a lot
of the I've seen a lot of PM's who will
pressure developers to deliver something
because they don't want to have to go
back for a second or a third time said
look it got delayed by a week you got to
leave by two weeks why that is is is
probably just going to do that it's like
great thing I don't blame him I think so
I've been very lucky in that aspect I'm
very happy with that but a lot of people
aren't and I've seen other developers
and and you know it's a very common
thing work you're getting pressured to
get things done and even even oftentimes
show like oh yeah I could get this done
in three days no problem but everything
is always more simple till you get into
it
even if you try applying for it right
and nothing ever goes according to plan
that's why I personally don't get very
upset if requirements are off I don't
personally get very upset if features
get added because nothing that's ever
perfect and you know we don't take a
bunch of time to do all that sort of
stuff because often times you can't
predict any of it until you're actually
in it right things that surprise you
surprise you and there's very little
work around of that and that goes for
the front end or the back end right I
had a co-worker today today working you
know usually Fridays are kind of a slow
day for me but working like till the
last minute he was leaving for the
weekend to get something done for me so
I can continue
working and we had to involve you know
bi team and everything else and you know
sometimes you have those days right but
as a team you sort of work through it
and you go through it and the hope is
that it's more days than not that things
aren't like that right and what it
basically was was just some
miscommunication and requirements one
way or the other and then but you know
either you don't throw your hands up in
the air and I'm so frustrated didn't
know I'm gonna cry you say okay well
let's just take care of it real quick
and we'll get it done and then you know
whatever happens happens let's see here
so I think that was a very long answer
for how you let scope creep affect your
deadlines how am i I'm pretty good man
I'm uh I'm uh I'm a little juiced up on
the caffeine though I should be drinking
more water while I'm talking here you go
life is good I've been a little
frustrated last week or two which is
kind of what the whole topic of the
video came from but uh overall I'm kind
of frustrated and it's it's all strange
so here's your souls it's a little
strange because talking openly about
these things like a lot of times as an
employee you don't want to tell your
boss or you don't tell anybody like that
that like you're a little frustrated
with work a little frustrated with
certain people but here I am right
saying that 35 people and having a
recording of it a part of it is you know
if you're open and honest about these
things usually better than anything else
than keeping things pent up so it's
something I'm working on uh as well I'm
preparing for a bootcamp wish me luck
what can I do to prepare well I hope you
have about three to six months that's
really what I recommend for studying for
a bootcamp you know depending on what
they're teaching they're probably
teaching full-stack JavaScript this was
much most boot camps are teaching you
start studying everything that's going
to be in the curriculum it's better go
into these things already knowing how to
code and then refine
getting better and you'll get more out
of it that way so whatever the subjects
are that are there start learning them
today every day for the next 36 months
if you're getting started webpage today
what would you do differently I'd get
started in blockchain
that would be kind of how I would go
about it the air front-end and back-end
skills will will transfer over very
nicely to blockchain there's so many
jobs in it right now it's a very
interesting field to get into
as far as documentation do you think
it's more event event advantageous to
try your best to refrain falling up with
phone calls for the person and stating
you rather communicate via email if you
uh as far as oh yeah yeah so I would say
just documentation because often times
you can't legally record people without
laying them no it's kind of a hassle
right so you know and most of the time
when you're when you're dealing with
other people it's gonna be via email
unless you're on the same team or
anything else but yeah so you definitely
want some sort of copy of it and talking
on the phone it's not usually gonna be
the best situation it's probably better
dude over email so sort of text Skype
anything that keeps track of it hum
needs a Red Bull no I'm giving up
caffeine again yes tonight's last night
tutor killer hey what's going on program
mafia especially dope name scope creep
guy love it right ever see someone
cracked under pressure story please I've
cracked under pressure cheese stuff yeah
like no unlike the roids
I mean Hercules you don't say but uh
yeah
but yeah I mean I
under pressure from time to time this
last week has been a rough week man
I uh this is probably the longest week
I've gone without playing like without
coding and like playing around on side
projects that's when I know when I don't
want to code like for more than six
hours that is when when I know
something's wrong with me and I'm
starting to crack because I have I like
I Know Who I am for the most part as a
person it's taken 30 years to
get there but uh Emmet you know you're
always changed as a person but I start
realizing these tendencies of you know I
wake up every morning I work on my stuff
and when I wake up every morning and I I
go to write my book I go to work on a
course I go to film a YouTube video and
I don't want to do it
something's wrong and that's when I
start realizing that I've been cracking
a little bit and that stuff is bothering
me and but if you're looking for
something like epic story if like the PM
says we have to have the sound today
she's like fluke does just that I'm
out this bitch now I don't have any
screaming stories like that what
resources do I find myself coming back
to personally I occur YouTube huge in
YouTube is probably the the biggest one
what's going on Ricky
it's nice stopping by your livestream
earlier by the way men full-stack Java
or C sharp C sharp man I think there's a
little I think C sharp is gonna overtake
Java eventually as crazy as it sounds
but you'll like C shirt better
soo sharp is more for web dev with.net
giving up coffee
I know D and I'm such a degenerate I
want to man I want to believe what is a
good first project for learning
JavaScript hmm that's what you want to
do but I think API projects are always
good because api's are such a crucial a
crucial part of JavaScript now in terms
in terms of a project you're probably
going to need to do some algorithm so
that's probably the first thing that
happens I look like a Hugh Hefner
program I couldn't code what would I
choose instead so sort of digital
marketing something where I could work
on a computer but it's very it's like so
it's such a similar mindset something
where I have a technical skill and could
be SEO could be some sort of social
media marketing something like that
where I get started and work on a
computer anywhere and still have some
sort of skill well that would probably
be at the end of the day but but it's
not really a fair answer because knowing
what I know now I've a lude those things
so much more complicated that aspect but
say I didn't know and I did fail you it
I'm a always wanted to be a writer my
father is a writer I did several years
of journalism
so what about this admin sysadmin let me
let me make sure I understand what is
this admin is because I I get all those
sort of admins is that system admin like
a network admin system admin it's
personal
oaky configuration right yeah okay so
you're talking about like server
configuration and maintaining it uh yes
I know I mean it's not a it's not a bad
industry being I I worked for a while at
datacenter called Quadra net in Los
Angeles where I was a staff writer and I
have a good friend Jeff who basically
has been doing it for several years so
here's here's the thing and it's kind of
counterintuitive right so more people
than you then you know it's a system
admin sounds tedious it all sounds
tedious right the act of programming is
tedious in general so it's all tedious
and you're saying don't why you saying
is tedious don't you love it yes but
like when you could have a single air
break your whole application that's a
tedious thing that you're building right
and that's that's it let's and everyday
occurrence right where one thing where
someone doesn't put in a simple type or
something in in a crud system your whole
app just gets you know long digged right
so it's a it's all tedious just a system
add an admin version of tedious of
configuring servers and maintain
and you know having networks be correct
that's not your type of TV I guess this
is law I'm trying to say but I mean my
only my only concern is I feel like a
lot of those jobs are going to the cloud
and that that's my my only real concern
is that it it is going to the cloud
right so you know there's so many things
getting hired as a service when it comes
to networks and stuff like that that I
I'm not educate enough to speak on it
but I don't see anything wrong with it
but again what I base off of a good job
not talking about whether you join or
not you should enjoy any job you I'm
making these the assumption the largest
sumption that you're only gonna work a
job that you enjoy now I am with that
being said you should pick a job that
has good career growth high salaries and
it's growing lots of jobs good career
growth and high salaries so three basic
things if they don't have those three
things you need to start being worried
we're learning Python to get understand
the basics before jumping in C++ I mean
you could if you want I don't think it
matters I think you should just dive
into one language done get started it's
a council on integrity and results
reporting trust really I have no idea
in the invitee device for attending tech
meetups for those who are just getting
into the field a couple things one keep
copies of your resume on you when you go
to start going much sooner before you're
trying to get a job a lot of times
people go right away right when they're
looking for a job and you come off as
desperate you come off as
someone's trying to use other people a
lot of times just start attending them
regularly whether you're ready for a job
or not you never know what may happen
and also you'll start building those
relationships so that when you are ready
he's been going for three six months
whatever it may be you are at the stage
where you're like oh you know here is
Matthew and I know Matthew and we're
looking for an intern we're looking for
a junior and let's give them a shot
right and you've built up that
relationship you've built if you know
you've progressed as a developer so that
would be my one big thing is that it's
always uncomfortable and so on who's not
quite ready for a job is applying for a
job I had to meet up or something like
that and especially if it's like your
first time being there and you're just
like super hungry it's almost like how I
think women feel when they have super
thirsty dudes around all the time right
it's it's like hey you know you're just
giving all this stuff thrown at you and
a lot of times you're just like just
chill man let's just chill a little bit
I am we got to do this today right yeah
you got to go down today and you may
have the same mentality as someone who's
just getting started I asked this
rejecting hybrid app developer using the
hybrid app yes is it still profitable or
not I own a suggest something I don't
have anything suggest have to read up
more about it Matt
also I enjoyed your JavaScript 360
course yeah Thank You Man hey that's a
that's a good course to make I I enjoyed
it I'm gonna build a part two to it
eventually I do I used to get it all
every day everything the day
yes
yeah if you watch the air if you read
the Stack Overflow survey I think it's
like 88 percent or 92% uses geared so
your Tercel version control it is taken
over and has for quite some time right
so I'm excited man I am so what jobs
meet my requirements pretty much pretty
much the the easiest thing to check is a
most technical jobs do and honestly any
of the top 20 jobs usually will fall
into those roles so if we did like top
20 jobs 2018 right we just looked it up
see you okay so here we go
a glass door best jobs in America data
scientists it's a four-point eight out
of five hundred ten thousand base salary
with forty five hundred job openings
right now in America
DevOps engineer marketing manager
occupational therapist so that HR
manager electrical engineer strategy
manager mobile developer product manager
you see a lot of these are in either
engineering tech or manager base drills
so many of these are manager based roles
but you know so what I would do is I
just look at what's in here about 15 out
of the top 20 are tech or software
related and you just start looking at
okay I'll only learn a little bit more
about it
just a wage increase on the west coast
offsets the cost of living yes
um one thing I would say is that it
depends on you know sometimes people
sometimes people can't sometimes people
can't control themselves right so can
you
you know let's say I moved to Seattle
and I get a hundred and twenty thousand
dollar salary piece in terms of pure
money significantly more than I make now
but you can get an apartment for three
four thousand dollars but if you're
willing to commute you can get one for
1500 free and so sometimes to offset
that cost of living
you just have to commute you have to
find those sort of janky places and then
you could save a lot of money and then
go buy a place later on but so many
people live in the now and I don't I
don't blame them I'm gonna live I think
like so we're gonna apartment hunting
there's two things that I want I want a
nicer apartment it can be smaller but I
want it to be nicer I don't need a ton
of space I need my office and like a
living room and then of course a bedroom
so we're going from a three-bedroom to a
two-bedroom I'm okay with one bathroom
you know look man apron I used to sleep
on the couch right so like like
yo we're just a living here right we'll
just don't line it up um but so I'm not
too worried about that but I am thinking
that for the the first time in my in my
adult life that I will probably just say
you know what the hell with whatever you
know I know I can save $300 and get some
so a place that's significantly worse
but maybe I do want the gym maybe I do
want the sauna all this stuff and might
treat ourselves to that for the next
couple months even though we're saving
to buy a house right so but in in I'm
also gonna be paying so that we can't so
I can be closer to my work so I don't
have to commute 30 minutes every day but
that's the choice you have to make right
and so when you are making that choice
of living on the west coast and you are
getting more money but you are having a
higher cost of living
you have to figure out how you can lower
that cost of living even if it's not you
know even if it's not by a ton but
you're lowering it by 30% 40% and you
gotta invest a little bit time on
commuter you have to figure out other
ways to save money there are always ways
to do it right you know I have friends
who are working in SF and they commute
an hour and a half every day but they
pay a thousand dollars to rent a room
but they're making $10,000 a month right
so and they're just saving saving every
penny they can with the hopes of leaving
with a nice little nest egg you know it
worked a year you're paying a thousand
dollars for rent probably two three
thousand out of that you know food maybe
another two thousand so three thousand
dollars at ten thousand after taxes
you're probably paying about three grand
in taxes so you're say for about four
thousand a month you have fifty thousand
dollars by the end of the year give or
take and now you have enough for a home
payment would you say it's worth it if
you pace yourself what do you mean by
what I say it's worth it is if you pace
yourself King suggests a good resource
to learning it it seems too complicated
to me I also should just make a get
tutorial I could explain to you 3/4 of
get in about 20 minutes I'm going to do
it I'll do it this weekend maybe on
Sunday for a while I've been wanting to
make like a 10 hour boot camp course
where I just cover ten topics one hour
apiece that are like all skills you're
in need just introduction stuff right so
like an hour JavaScript our HTML CSS an
hour of getting marked down an hour of
you know this this and that and just
cover like 20 30 topics give you 90
percent of what you're gonna use a
hundred percent of the time you know so
two thing you're 90 percent seventy five
percent of time whatever you guys get
lunch I say in a course and this is
something I've been so just thinking
about for a while now maybe that'll be
my next course do you recommend learning
Python and Django I honestly don't know
too much about it
I can't say that Python has come in
continuing to grow beyond belief an hour
if gives too much yet 20 minutes 30
minutes again you're probably good to go
so what a A+ certification be beneficial
implying jobs it's gonna be beneficial
to what degree who knows though but for
certain roles definitely right so
especially when you're getting started
being a generalist is typically the best
way of going about it because you're
gonna touch more things and you're going
to be able to fill more of those
requirements when you need more you need
to be able to do that more often when
you don't have experience and so
starting out as a generalist is usually
the way of going about it and then as
your career progresses you want to
become a specialist in whatever it is
that you're in there
so any place cert might be great for a
system admin it might be great for a
DevOps role it might be great you know
for server configuration sort of stuff
and so when you get those entry-level
dev jobs that maybe smaller companies
where they want you to do more stuff
like that where you're like yeah you are
developing in 50% of time but we also
need you to deploy things we also need
you to maintain the server things like
that
just join streamer is this live stream
place in a Saturday stream it is indeed
Francisco I am going to be busy tomorrow
night and I can't sleep tonight so here
we go sorry I break your hopes and
dreams but yes this is what this last
room is about then that you know
sometimes I like to switch it up also
where I you know we'll do it on Sunday
or Friday night because not everyone is
in a time zone or has work on Saturday
at 11 or whatever it is I normally do it
you know so I don't mind switching up
the times uh Evan Buescher says have a
Red Bull on me man you know I'm trying
to quit that caffeine but I will take
your $5 thank you for that you're not
gonna question is that like a champ
don't let the weekend you know none so I
have I'm in a pretty good place right
now mentally
I was a little bit frustrated but
instead of trying to hide that
frustration and essentially in in effect
you know being frustrated and holding it
within sort of accepting the fact that I
was frustrated and then just okay let's
just go through the process and
understand and be as professional as we
can be
that's real all you can do and I've been
much happier since I've sort of accepted
that but I appreciate it man thank you
very much you guys should all be more
like Evan what I mean is that the 37 of
you need to give me $5 all right I'm
trying to come up here no give him money
for a trial no thank you no no no I
I'm already jittery enough my mom I uh I
need to take in less less coffee um have
you ever been in a fistfight
Oh God years ago I think the last
fistfight I was in us in like middle
school I got the kicked out of me
I'm a lover boys I'm not a very good one
by a mother lover fishing college team
I've been working at marketing for it
mm-hmm where could you start doing web
design for about a year eventually I
want to go full stack and vice on next
steps look for a web designer no um can
you move into full stack at your current
work that probably my first advice is
transition in your current workplace if
you can and go from there if you can't
start working on your skills outside of
work and start applying elsewhere that's
really it really the the hardest part
will be getting that experience was to
have that experience and you're
continuing to grind do better
you'll be able to get there do you
really believe the self-taught route is
more challenging to me it seems that
overcoming the financial burden time
commitment and difficult classes that
come with the traditional path is more
challenging I can understand that output
that opinion but yes I'll tell you why
it's yes it's about 1220 right now but I
tell you why I I truly believe it is
there is the great HR firewall okay the
great HR firewall is not easily scaled
by those without a college degree going
the traditional path it is a powerful
firewall it is one that has for many
decades dominated all careers and we are
slowly beating it down so so okay so how
do we overcome that HR firewall a lot of
unique unique things and a lot of be
able to hold yourself accountable and
unfortunately Anthony a lot of people in
life can't do that and you know a lot of
people can't it's the same thing with
like anything right where you can go
home every day and I like the way that
you look not like how healthy you are
and you don't you don't change anything
and it's you know you don't eat
different you don't exercise the same
thing with learning right there's a lot
of people who want to be devs but they
can't they need someone to hold them
accountable and it's it's a very very
hard thing for a lot of people so it's
really the two prong aspect of this is
that the great HR firewall and then the
everything that goes along with going
the self-taught route going the route
where okay I have to volunteer through
code.org okay I need to self teach
myself every single day for years I need
to build projects I need to do all this
sort of stuff would all that stuff help
you did go the traditional route yes but
those are things that you have to do as
a self-taught developer really at the
end of the day and it is it is is a very
hard task at the at the end of day for
most people to be able to just to say
look I'm I'm going to accomplish this
and I don't need you know ten thousand
dollars a year in tuition to hold me
accountable I don't need their student
loans you know someone expected me to
show up to class or not so that's really
really the two main things when it comes
to me and for most people I would say
probably about 90% of people they they
can't do that successfully what if we
create a giant group of people trying to
in Philly in flirt infiltrate all the H
Department HR departments say I'm with
you man when your boys in management
I'll keep a special place in my heart
for the self-taught deaf totally off
topic but you have been a huge
inspiration motivator and giant wealth
of knowledge for me thank you man I've
been in a job I hate for eight years and
finally reached you in place where I can
take a job change seriously keep going
what you do and thank you for supporting
educating promoting a positive community
Thank You Man I appreciate that and you
know don't don't be sort of encompassed
everything that we're started talking
about whether you realize it or not he'd
been she'll be hated for eight years it
took him eight years of essentially
being miserable probably poverty most
likely right on top of it you probably
you probably most miserable jobs
probably not getting paid well you know
live that shitty life right and I don't
know I'm not picking on you Dylan or
anything like I've been in the same
place right so it can be a hard and
lonely path and everyone has to sort of
hit their rock bottom sometimes even get
to that self-talk mentality so it's a
very very strange thing and men and I
kind of talked about this on our on our
last live stream winners here
about working shitty jobs right and
going from and going from there so the
youngest and oldest person you know who
got started in web dev we got started in
web dev um I don't really have an answer
for the youngest I think just QA stand
count so I've worked with a couple of 20
year-olds who were like QA the oldest
person I never asked anybody like when
they started in like when they they
started specifically but I do know my
last co-worker who the hell thing get
hired essentially he was interviewed me
he his first year and the job was like
36 so are you doing the self talk
I am the self Sagra yes I am doing the
self time I've done the self talk right
I guess that's what I'm trying to say
I'll trade you a six-figure job from a
four he'd pour for you Joe yeah yeah so
I mean it just really shows you like how
miserable even even at six figures right
you'd you'll um you still hate your job
still worth it and it really isn't you
really need to enjoy this and you need
to enjoy life right we're gonna spend a
lot of our lives working most of us most
of us aren't going to be independently
wealthy most of us aren't gonna make
that money how I don't say this to
discourage anybody or tell anybody not
to strive to be you know to to make the
the Chetta the bread to make that Wall
Street money but uh you know just
statistically speaking most of
us myself included are not gonna be you
know bringing in a million dollars a
year so when you're choosing a role not
to say that you should make an educated
choice about what's gonna pay the bills
because there is a part of happiness
that is related to money the part where
you can pay to not have to stress about
bills where you don't have to stress
about you know food insurance where you
can pay these things right
that's one stress of your life that gets
dropped and for the first time in my
life for the last year and a half two
years those are things that I don't even
think about anymore it doesn't
there is no paycheck that is the rent
check I got money in the bank for the
first time in my life I have zero debt
and so you're able to eliminate that
stressor right which is a strange thing
for most people right but when it comes
to having to eliminate those stresses
but then still being stressed out by the
fact that you hate you hate your job
that you go to five days a week so five
days a week you're miserable that's not
something that you can do right so you
gotta gotta figure out how you can have
the best of both worlds sometimes it
means you're gonna try a try a few
things right so they said that happiness
doesn't get any better after seventy
five thousand a year sound like someone
who never made a million dollars a year
I would say that there's probably
diminishing returns
seventy-five thousand year is probably
enough to do everything I just said
we're you know maybe maybe the
difference between seventy-five thousand
one hundred fifty thousand you're like
well yeah I'm making more money I'm
saving more money but in reality you
know the stresses that you eliminated
we're already eliminated right you you
you can't pay your rent you can't pay
this
so it's uh I can't say someone who makes
slightly above 75,000 when you add
YouTube and everything else that it is
strange to me to think that people can
raise a family unless because not that
much money
it really isn't it's not it's hard like
like I have money a safe half my
paycheck but it is the idea that if we
if you know just taking care of April
extras don't bring in income the idea
that if we had children and we were
making this sort of money it would be
very strange because I want to plan for
a future you probably be going out more
doing vacations all that sort of stuff
and I don't know and I'm by the way we
have no debt right so a lot of people
are making seventy five K F fifty
thousand dollars in student loans and
credit card debt and things like that
and uh you know it's you think 75 K is
low for combined I think you're wrong
man
so if we were to say average American
family income the average American
family income as of September 2017 is
fifty-nine thousand in the entire US
that's family by the way that is
combined family
so when you say 75 K is low for combine
you're actually incorrect
how bad is a I'm gonna be with for
webdev I'm not too worried about it
especially when cars are running people
over how much CSS should we know to get
in JavaScript just enough you should
JavaScript and CSS are not very related
I'm 50k in debt from student loans but
the degree is going to pay off I hope it
does man
how long did thy self train I ran one
mile did 100 pushups my next class or
whatever the hell one function it let's
see oh I was probably I was still in
school at the time so I wasn't doing it
as much but when I still in school for
it dropped out I was probably about six
months before I dropped out I was
studying a lot more on just doing like
Academy in free code gam and then I when
I dropped out and took a job for about
seven eight months and then I got my
first dev job so whatever you think that
is what is your opinion on the job
market in Florida for a junior dev I'm
graduating boot camp in a few months I'm
nervous about it I feel like there's
something like you should have
investigated before you joined a boot
camp in Florida uh uh but uh pure dev
rules are always rough I feel so here's
here's the problem junior dev rules is
that there are a lot of bad developers
and that's always the case and so
companies are very nervous about hiring
people who don't know how to code it's
kind of crazy right you've gone through
boot camp you have all these projects
there's a reason the white board
interviews exist right they're gonna pay
you very well for the most part but they
don't want to be stuck with someone they
don't want to be stuck with someone who
uh just can't do the job
hence the white board interviews and
everything else ooh
but it's up to your job to convince them
they can't do the job right and then
that's through projects that's through
passion that's through a lot of
different things but the good news for
you is that once you get that experience
and you get better and you continue
growing that the amount of developers
that
that our senior developers and good
developer is very limited and so I'm
very hopeful for once you get your foot
in the door which is hard but if you're
smart about it do just fine but you just
have to continue moving forward you
should try and get to the JavaScript
aspect as soon as possible in my
personal opinion a lot of people like to
focus and want to quote unquote master
HTML CSS I would try to get to
JavaScript as quickly as possible I
still talk to that annoying section
Linnaeus engineer truth prick I talk
with Matt on regular basis I'm guessing
you're not a fan a mock like board
interview second whiteboard in immunity
so I have this amazing 20 minute video
for my current workplace where I went
like I I did a I talked about the quick
phone interview I had and I went and I
did a whiteboard interview with them I
came immediately home
like literally first thing I did I was
like this was an excellent whiteboard
interview it's all fresh and I bring out
the whiteboard I have it on here and I
whiteboard it out explain the scenario I
walk through it like what a real-world
whiteboard interview is it still went
very well and I can't use the video
because I work there and you know
naturally they don't want people know
about their hiring process per se and
but it is an excellent excellent video
so if they ever change their hiring
process I will post the video we shall
have it it's on my old computer
I've known Matt for 20 years now
literally 20 years as crazy as that
sounds makes me feel old as oh man
alright guys so we've been gone about 59
minutes here it has been a pleasure we
did our one hour on the live stream
so I usually like to leave with some
sort of food for thought and today we
talked about being frustrated right we
talked about dealing with unprofessional
people that's frustrating and this isn't
to say that I've even have handled it
very well because there's been at times
where I haven't but it looks like
Dolan's coming now pretty soon there's
the Dolan video you can see when the
facial hair starts coming out so what I
want to say to you is that it is um is
is a challenge to be a professional and
you should be you should expect to be
challenged right and sometimes you'll
rise to the occasion and sometimes you
will not I have not always rose to the
occasion we're all human and we have all
been on the other side of the coin
that's why I suggested that someone's
acting unprofessional that you try to be
understanding you try to say oh you know
they're probably not always like this
until they prove that they are right so
the reason I say that is because I know
I'm not perfect right Ava and I recently
got in a fight and I was completely in
the wrong and in the moment I was wrong
and you know it goes for everything in
life and that's the same thing with your
workplace as well
and that's why I don't ever suggest
jumping to conclusions right and being
able to sort of put yourself in their
shoes for a time or two so when you are
frustrated with other people in your
workplace try to handle it like an adult
try to handle it as a professional
because there will be times where you
will be the one that is unprofessional
God knows I've been at times and you may
not realize it you may not even
understand what it means quite yet so
when you're having issues at work
do your best to resolve them as an adult
do your best to say you know what I
don't think I handled that very properly
when I wouldn't you think about it right
and don't be your biggest fan it is
easier to if you're willing to look at
what you're doing wrong as a person as
individual and you know I'm not saying
hate on yourself but I am saying to have
an open opinion about it and you're not
the greatest thing then you can always
get better right stay humble in every
aspect of your life and some days will
be easier than others but do your best
to stay humble and understanding and you
know if all this fails just document it
so that's the that's my final thought
stay humble be professional try to be
understanding in the beginning because
we've all been on the other side of the
coin and above all else subscribe to
