back in learn HTML and CSS the part one
we're doing styling with CSS fonts so
that's how we did colors we kind of
showed various ways doing colors now
we're gonna dive into the fonts that are
probably in the system as well as how to
in in CSS and HTML and how to use other
fonts that may be our custom mate just
go ahead and jump right in
lots of CSS going on in this page you'll
notice that targeting element the way
that you change the type of font is with
font family so we're gonna go ahead and
do that for the main heading which was I
guess our h1 so the way that we changed
it was simply okay let's go ahead and
run this because I know it's been a
little buggy so font - family and we're
gonna go ahead and change this to
Georgia notice that we're not actually
including any I need to include this I
don't think I do yes it wants us to uh
maybe they want us to put it in the in
the body turn around that there you go
yeah they want to send Clinton in the
body so single quotes double quotes
doesn't really matter they use double
coats I just have a new single quotes
now we want to actually change so this
is going to apply to the entire body
everything within the body is going to
change the font family to Georgia unless
we override it in something that's
closer or more specific so we're in jump
to our font family here in the paragraph
and we're gonna change it to Helvetica
it's gonna run this so I notice now that
the font in the paragraph is changing
now you may be a little confused but
basically the way that it works is yeah
there's two fonts but it's going to
choose the one that's deepest nested and
makes sense paragraph is within body so
therefore it's going to choose
paragraphs font family now if we didn't
set this it's gonna inherit the next
nested one which in this case would be
body the practice of typography all
right it goes into some nonsense here
basically it just shows that there are
various various details
this is serif this is San serif just
know that there's different versions of
different fonts that you can import and
you're just gonna have to set it that's
basically you need to know so in fonts
you have fallback fonts which I didn't
really know the technical name till now
to be honest with you but so what that
basically means is each one of these
commas you go left or right if Garamond
isn't available in the browser for
whatever reason it's gonna do x if it's
not x it's gonna do cereth that's
basically what you need to know so let's
jump into the main heading so georgia
isn't available we're gonna do Garamond
Garamond isn't available we are going to
do Sarah
and then we're gonna jump to same thing
for paragraph where are we urge simply
going to do aerial or sans-serif these
are basically just in case the other
ones don't run which can't happen quite
often because browsers are different
unfortunately and so you have to kind of
plan these things out or maybe for
whatever reason the link to your
stylesheet breaks it's good to have a
backup font so that your text isn't just
looking so raggedy now we're gonna show
how to add a font so they give us an
example here you're gonna include a link
and then you're gonna do it's the same
thing that we've been doing we're gonna
have a href the location on the file and
then we're gonna have a type and this is
gonna be text slash CSS and then we're
gonna have a rel and that's going to be
style sheet cool now the href that we
need is this this is our font that we
want to import to our document we're not
actually setting the font yet we're just
getting the resource so that we can use
this font control see this in case now
in styled a CSS we're going to just
appending in the paragraph so sup any
and I guess is and this is what HT to be
the stuff any so we're gonna specify
Roboto now when you're using a rowboat
oh we're boat tow when you're importing
fonts are always going to need to be in
clothes
it's been around that OOP got a jump to
paragraph and change that as well
and I want just go ahead and put
moto and then a comma there we go now
we're gonna go ahead and add an
additional font actually let's do this
and then we'll just change the URL again
you're going to need to put the location
the type and the rel
so this one is called play fair display
and they want us to do it for the main
heading which I suppose is this and this
will be play fair display let's go
around that
oh so it looks like they wanted us to
set this for the h1 specifically so
let's go ahead and jump in here so we're
gonna set font family and then we're
gonna have play fair display and then
we're gonna have the backup font or the
fallback font be safe and then don't
forget a semicolon like myself
oh and of course make sure you spell it
correctly with a lowercase F there we go
so you can import as many fonts as you
want typically when you're using like a
Google font from their site they'll tell
you how fast loading it is as well and
like that might be something you want to
consider if you're working with a very
large application so we're gonna go
ahead and jump into our paragraph and
we're gonna change the font size to 20
pixels so here's our paragraph the way
that we change font size is simply with
font - size and this is going to be 20
px now this is what kinda looks the same
to me looking at it but apparently it
changed but now we've set the font size
there's a lot of things that we can do
here and this is going over quite a bit
this is actually a really helpful page
you might want to print this out now I'm
looking at it so on the 12 pixel skill
I'm not sure what that let's take a
second three units of measurement for
font size you have the pixels you have
percentage and then you have M we know
what pixels are percentage should make
somewhat sense and let's go ahead and
so M s are equal to the width of the
letter M they change the size of the
text relative to the parents element
size this is a very weird thing they
came up with but they basically are size
based on paragraph you're really gonna
use pixels percentages and you may use
them eventually but I wouldn't worry
about it too much right now just know
there's various ways you can size your
font - size and other things as well so
we also have this line height parameter
apparently we're gonna use them right
now so let's take back everything I said
so what's line height line height is
facing the distance between one line of
text and the other by default it has
some some parameter I'm not quite sure
what it is and we're gonna go to reset
that to 1.7 m it's gonna run that and
now we've changed the distance of line
so let's go ahead you want to see the
difference real quick if I do up into
five point seven and you'll see all our
lines are crazy spaced apart this gives
us a nice little example here of line
height and what it can do for us so we
have our font size and we have the line
height
you also can increase the spacing
between letters so you can use this for
paragraphs any any sort of text element
in this example it's we're gonna be
doing the subheading
so we'll do font was a - spacing
right yeah no word desks facing so word
spacing and we're gonna go ahead and
save 0.05 am gonna run that oh that's
semicolon and for some reason it saved
my thing around I believe this was one
point seven it's got to run that there
we go I don't really notice the
difference it's pretty small difference
but apparently it's broken up a little
bit more excuse me so that's another not
parameter not property another property
that you can set now let's go ahead and
change the letter spacing so we did word
spacing which is distance between words
now we're gonna do the same thing for
each individual letter using letter
spacing so let's go to the subheading
here and we're gonna go ahead and do
letter spacing equal to 0.02 M
so a little different there now
font-weight you'll use this one a little
bit more than the other two there's
weight there's there's elements that you
can use they'll make things bold or
italic or things like that so there's a
font weight is something you set to make
your text bold without having to include
that in your HTML so let's go ahead and
do that here we're gonna go the
paragraphs and we want to make our
paragraph bold the way that we can do
that is simply by signing bold two font
weight
so it's a little bit bolder I guess so
earlier we had in this line code notice
the 100 this specifies that you've used
to like when Lincoln era but of fun so
apparently we can change the font weight
to of our font so certain fonts come in
various various weights I guess in this
case it's thin so let's jump back into
our index over a bottle 100 here
so we can change the font weight it's
set here of the ones that we'd like to
use we it's 100 if we decided to do that
so font-weight:bold apparently we can
set it to 100 let's see if this is what
they wanted I don't believe it is
and there it is it's thinner because uh
100 was thin 900 goes all the way up to
Bowl Super Bowl that's basically what
we're doing there just put it in the one
hundo all right so there's also font
style similar to how we just did font
weight which handles the bold aspect in
CSS font style handles the italic so
let's go ahead and jump down to the
subheading here of h2 a little font -
style and we're gonna make it italic
we're on this notice now that this is I
tell again there is HTML tags to do this
but is bad practice I don't encourage it
at all so texts Tex s transform there's
a way of setting uppercase and lowercase
and that's what text transform is let's
go to the main heading here or this part
and we're gonna go ahead and make it
uppercase
so we're gonna we're gonna call the
property checks s transform and we're
gonna set it to uppercase now only run
this you'll see everything's capitalized
now granted you could go ahead and type
everything in caps if that's what you
wanted to do but this is probably the
easier and the more logical way of doing
it because you never know what may
change in terms of your styling
preference and then you're gonna have to
go back and change that in your HTML
document as well so it better just use
the styling anything styling related
sometimes you can do it in index.html or
your your HTML page do it in your CSS
that's what it's there for all right now
you're gonna want to align things quite
often in your in your paragraphs and in
your headings and stuff like that so do
that you do
Tech's like excuse me so there's
basically three ways that you can align
your text you can align it to the left
so all your text is gonna shoot to left
you can line it to the right or you can
align it to the center so we're gonna go
ahead let's let's open this up a little
bit so you'll see that it's kind of by
default aligned to the left and now what
we're gonna do I'll open it up back up
so we can see the difference we're gonna
set the main heading so that aligns to
the middle
it's simply gonna do text - align and
center just gonna run this oh I did that
in the body excuse me just go ahead and
add this right here like so run it one
more time and you'll notice now how it
got centered it's gonna open this up see
it's all the text is centered now pretty
cool they didn't like it so we're gonna
change it to the left again one more
time see the difference so it's the line
to the left once more so we learned a
lot of stuff about fonts definitely
something you're going to be using a lot
- kind of letter spacing in the word
spacing and you're just trying to get
fancy at that point but what we learned
we learned that we can change the font
family or the type of font we learned
about fallback fonts we learned that
serif font set of different types and
details and stuff like that we also
learned how to import fonts such as
google fonts we also learned about how
to size them using pixels m's or
percentages we learned about line
spacing word spacing the the main ones
the main property is to know font weight
how to do the bold and sending different
values for it we also learned about text
transform having to make them uppercase
lowercase and text align these are all
things you're going to be using with
text quite a bit - the spacing for
saying so this is a very important
section
