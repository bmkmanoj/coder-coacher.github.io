got done with interview two days ago and
i thought hey this might be a good time
to kind of bring up some basic tips and
stuff and just the general stuff you
should already be doing but if for
whatever reason you didn't know to do
this for job interviews go ahead and
just you know take some notes I guess so
first thing I apologize I can't do wear
a tie if you can find us one too tight I
my girlfriend tied it for me I can't tie
ties I just tried for about 30 minutes
to happen but dress for the occasion so
you you may feel like oh I don't want to
be overdressed for this job but it's
better to be overdressed than even just
the slightest bit not not and the reason
for that is you just want to show that
you're eager you want to be there you
know you want to whatever the job is it
is just good to be there and show that
hey this guy's willing to dress up maybe
a haircut you know you shave and just
you're looking as prim and proper as a
future employees that it would want to
hire somebody so next thing is shown
really for your interviews a lot a lot a
lot of times people are like oh how much
how early did you show up I showed up an
hour early at with an hour drive
beforehand I thought I must've live
across the corner and that impressed
them and everything all I thought that
you know that's not that big of a deal
but to some people it is showing up on
time is crucial to jobs and in just the
fact that your boss doesn't want to have
to be keeping track of you and your time
they want to be able to trust that
you're going to do everything you need
to do and show up and do the things that
they pay you to do and so much so that
not only did my first interview did he
comment how he really likes that and
said verbatim the person hired me that
really shows me you want this job I like
that that's some good points right there
for you Dylan I said nice and you
continue on half the interview and if
they can't take you in don't worry about
you sit there and you wait but the fact
is that you were able to get there early
because you wanted the
the next basic thing guys is be prepared
and what I mean by that is no little bit
about the company know the position
forward and back and what is required
when they send you you know a job
application he says this is what you
need to do you need to know that in the
interview don't be learning what the
position is because you need to be
addressing the points of general duties
main duties all that whatever it is you
need to address each and one of those
bullet points in your interview and
bring your bring your documentation back
it all up bring at least two copies of
your resume bring your cover letter even
bring a reference list that expands upon
the ones that are already on your resume
and if you have any anything that like a
portfolio that would be good for the job
bring that too it's better to have too
much you know it's just to bring a
binder in with you that's what I that's
typically what I do and I want that
there for them so that when they're at I
want them to ask me as many questions as
they can I need to be there the longer
I'm there the better the interviewer is
going I'm not saying to extend it by any
means but you want a healthy
conversation because they are hiring you
and your skill set so the fact that
you're there means they're open to
whatever skill set you have now you need
to sell them you are salesmen at this
point and that may sound a little sleazy
but you are you're selling yourself this
is what you do this is why they need to
hire you okay so after we gave them all
this documentation our resume and any
any other additional resources that they
requested you need something unique
about you need something that's going to
say oh like this is what this is the
type of person I am that how does it how
do I separate myself from the other
people in my case I use my youtube okay
this is what I do plenty time I do
coding tutorials and I am working with
programs and software on a regular basis
Premiere Pro Photo Shop all these sort
of little things I hey that that may not
necessarily hit our target job details
but it's nice to know that you have some
additional skills if we ever need
something like that done so separate
yourself in whatever way you can and try
and be as unique as possible and be
there on game day is really how you need
to refer to it when you go in to the job
the job interview
game day and be prepared to deliver so I
hope you guys found these basic little
tips helpful see you next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
