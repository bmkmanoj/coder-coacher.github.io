weekly livestream usually I just call in
the weekend last year so sometimes I do
on Fridays sometimes I do on Saturdays
sometimes I do them on Sunday so usually
it's a start out Saturday weekly and it
usually is long Saturday so if you knew
the live stream is what these are all
about is once a week on Saturdays
usually I will answer your guys's
questions not because I have a an ego
and I want to talk about myself but
because I want to help right I want to
provide what mentoring that I can and
help anybody out because I know finally
somebody to get my questions just to let
just to maybe even just yeah man that's
a great idea
you're going in the right direction that
sort of stuff it really helps you mature
and just sort of understand like you
know give you some confidence as well as
some guidance so that's what this is
about I do these also every thousand
subscribers so that's a little bit of
what this whole weekend last dream was
about
so whatever questions you have sometimes
people want me to look at their
portfolios so people want me to look at
their resume there are websites whatever
it is look at the code say hey how can
we how can I make this better and
hopefully I can give some advice so that
is the that that is that so let's go
ahead and talk a little bit about what's
going on with me as a person as a
developer while we wait for people to
fall in I released my very first course
calling which is essentially a it's
currently called angular learning Euler
by projects part one but I think I'm
changing the title to angular 360 part
one gotta use that branding so I'll be
doing that but I'll be giving away one
of those during the live streams so on
these weekend last year it's a new thing
that's gonna be happening so I'm going
to be giving one away every single
weekend that I do this let me actually
turn the AC on real quick guys just
really hard
yes so we'll be giving one of those away
I haven't really decided power to who or
anything like that but someone somebody
will get of course so that's one thing
look forward to and I'm also working on
my JavaScript 360 course where currently
I have over a hundred and twenty videos
so I'm really trying to touch everything
I can in that course and hopefully
hopefully a lot of you will enjoy it a
lot of you will see that it has a lot of
value to try and help you out good
morning Jordan
good morning yeah so that's what I'm
working on oh I also have parked angular
360 part 2 which is actually a full
stack mean project and I finished the
rough draft of the content there's some
bugs I have to have to work out what hi
when when you make a complete course in
angular 2
well my course is in a complete course
it's kind of a one-off project and the
second one covers a lot more advanced
topics such as routing such as
authentication such as services as well
as the MongoDB node and Express so it's
those things where you're gonna pick up
a little in each one it's gonna be fun
man
don't worry yeah I don't I don't plan on
actually making a full angular tutorial
there's just so much that you couldn't
do it like Maximilian's course that's 26
hours of content and all it is is a full
angular tutorial it is there's a lot
going on in that framework but I prefer
building projects that's how I learned
and so the the format of the courses
that I do is I first we wireframe it out
so that you can see what it is that
we're building and then we we go ahead
and we
we go and that's what I'm looking for we
go and we build it the one time and then
we refactor and then I give you features
to build on your own so that you can
learn from that up early I saw that
early it's 8:30 meant I get up at 6:30
every day and work for an hour and then
I slept in today
so select until 7:30 today um
guardzilla welcome welcome so I I
recently it's very it's very strange to
talk so casually over the internet about
your your sort of issues you're having
but recently I've been having but I
think talking about things helps things
because it lets you air out so I so as
an introvert and I'm I consider myself a
bit of an introvert much better than you
should be but recent life I sort of have
been having anxiety again and I'm not
quite sure why I think it's just a
combination of being overwhelmed and
other things but I think it is something
that that developers in general have a
lot of and that's kind of what it plays
into with the whole impostor syndrome
thing and I think it's a little bit of
impostor syndrome and a little bit of
just standard anxiety and so it's been
interesting to try and see how mentally
I can overcome these things so I'm very
aware of it so what I've been doing is
as I drink this monster it's a Saturday
so I allow myself one monster for the
week on Saturdays preface that I have
started I've gettin rid of caffeine as
much as I can so I'm down to two coffees
a day at work and I'm trying to get it
down to one coffee a day and then no
coffee and eventually I'll give up
caffeine entirely because that that
really doesn't help with anxiety makes
you jittery all this sort of stuff
although I kind of like me and jittery
is that is that kind of strange well
yeah so I've also tried to step out of
my comfort zone to force myself to of
depth so last Friday
not yesterday but a week ago I went to
the bar with a bunch of coworkers
and not necessarily even people I worked
with only two people there that really
worked with the other night I didn't
know some who were like bosses of my
bosses and it was an interesting
experience part of the reason that I
wanted to go was I had been feeling this
anxiety and this anxiousness for about a
week at this point and so I am I'm a
believer that you go and tackle that and
so I went and hung out for like six
hours and I still feel drunk no but it
was a good time but part of the reason
that I forced myself to go is I wanted
to step outside my comfort zone
so I the reason I bring this up it's not
to complain about my own personal
anxiety but I think it's probably a
fairly common thing that developers have
in general because most of us I'd say
the majority of developers at least at
one point in time or introverts and I
would I would say that that helps me a
little bit not entirely but if you are
having anxiety of your own as a
developer imposter syndrome or whatnot
there's a couple things you can do about
it one you can objectively look at why
you're having it - you can just try the
things that make you anxious you can
just go and do them tackle them and
that's kind of my approach because once
you do that it's like well that wasn't
so bad right so you know that's my two
cents on stress and anxiety and what not
are you planning on making a mean
framework course well you learn the
angular 360 part two course does node
MongoDB Express and angular and yeah I
mean I I don't dot in all honesty I
don't know enough Mongo and I don't know
enough known Express to make a course I
can build a project using it and just
kind of figure out what I need here
there but I don't work in the stuff so I
don't spend enough time in those things
to to showcase okay
let me show you the in situ the outs
like I could show you how to do a get
how to do a post
what uh what packages you typically
would use all that sort of stuff
that's fine I can use I can do that but
actually building a course oh yeah I
don't know unless I were to get a role
that's a note in Express and MongoDB
alright which I would love would
absolutely love I don't foresee that
happening in my future
yeah
good morning Robert also in a personal
note why I personally may be feeling
less stressed a little anxious is is
it's a sigma I just woke up it takes me
a little while for my voice all right
that might be a little bit better is
that better so it takes me a little
while to wake up until I have my
caffeine which I'm currently digesting I
sound like I'm exhausted because I am so
yeah so uh so on a personal note a lot
of changes going on in my life right
waiting on April to give jobs so that
was something that kind of halted our
plans so they had a little stress to
life not that it's her fault but that
happens right and then was looking for a
house to buy that kind of kind of that's
off the plate now but kind of stressful
because I wanted to do that and then and
then also going back to school which I
will be starting January 1st maybe
February 1st and so just a lot of
changing parts I'm a pretty comfortable
on my job but still a new job right I'm
I have my three week or three month mark
in a week and a half or so Arun Kumar
welcome I like that you're streaming on
Twitch yeah so if you guys don't know
I am simulcasts Dean as I was called
restreaming at simulcasting we have
three people over on Twitch I have
you'll notice I have the chat and a
little YouTube icon if those twitch
people want to say you know if those
dudes on YouTube you live you know that
they're there from twitch at the twitch
icon but uh so this is going back and
forth streaming to both platforms part
of the reason for it is the very
practical and that YouTube's been de
monetizing every single one of my videos
and it's been really a motivating to
make content when that happens so that's
the very
practical reason and also the reason
that I've been starting to do courses
and working on clothes and things like
that because if YouTube's gonna do
monetize my videos I have to find
another way to monetize myself because
although I do this and it's great for my
portfolio and it's great for me as a
developer I do plan to make some money
from it although I don't make a ton of
money but it they're gonna demolish my
videos I should protect myself so that's
hence at which so now we will always be
when we're doing the live stream
streaming to twitch now these weekend
ones usually stay up this on the main
channel on the YouTube channel but if
you ever notice during the week that I'm
live-streaming and I'm working on my
course I'm working on my project go
ahead and jump over on to the twitch
page because I take those down and those
videos are recorded there so you're like
damn man Dylan was Dylan's going deep
into this mean stack project I know he
deletes it on his on his YouTube channel
yes the live streams are up over there
because I usually listen to music I
don't get ad revenue should we switch to
twitch then no I wouldn't say that just
because I don't get ad revenue from
twitch yet I don't get anything from
twitch but it is another platform that
I'll expose my YouTube channels people
on twitch who may discover it and then
the people on YouTube may also want to
watch it on Twitch but as of right now I
don't even monetize my live streams at
all until after the fact because they
just do monetize every single one so
this is really just something that I'm
doing I had the goodness of my heart
this is basically my face with the
YouTube right now this angry Yoshi um
it's just another another platform
anyhow should we where you going to
school for software engineering yeah now
it's just an interesting thing because
I've gone back and forth on this for
about a year or two and
huh ever since I dropped out I've been
going back and forth am I gonna go back
when am I gonna go back under what
circumstances I finally found the right
one and a lot of people asked like do I
have to have a computer science degree
to be a developer no but how hard do you
work so a lot of people think that
getting a degree is really hard it's a
different type of heart you have to go
to class you have to hand in assignments
that don't really do much for you I
it's definitely work but if you are if
you are looking to be a developer you
can be a developer that getting a degree
now I'll be a senior developer in about
two years I'll be making stupid money
and at least I hope anything out right I
don't have a degree yet but I plan on
knocking my degree out in the next year
not necessarily because I need to be a
senior developer it's gonna put a cap on
my my income the main issue is that I
will what if I want to go beyond a
senior developer that's where I think
you need the degree now there are
companies that will turn you down
entirely won't won't even interview and
I've had it happen to me personally so I
can't say it's a fact but there are a
lot of companies I will hire good
developers I'm not care if you have a
degree or not what are you what what are
you working on right now well I'm
working on my JavaScript 360 course but
working on angular part 2 I'm working on
YouTube video so I have a couple of
videos I need to film dev Mountain has
decided to sponsor the channel again
which is not very cool so I have a nice
monthly sponsor and there I have another
sponsored video for it in a platform
that's coming out so I have a couple I
have like 4 videos I need to record and
one I have done that I need to upload
make thumbnail for it's a pretty
exciting one it's it's something that uh
I've only been putting up one video a
week lately because I've been so
so busy but I've also kind of just
fallen in love as into writing code so I
come home I write code I don't film
videos even though the videos take a
couple hours it's not like a total
investment of time I just don't I have
to give up actual coding what makes one
a senior developer a couple things of
experience is the first one right so
somewhere between three to five years
experience I have always said five but
other developers are much more senior
than I am I have said three so three to
five years of experience will make you a
senior developer also it's it's what
changes when you become a senior
developer as part of that question you
might be a little bit more involved in
architecture decisions you might have to
mentor junior developers so but it's
combination of skill and it's
combination of experience and then the
your job changes slightly from being a
junior to senior can you tell me how to
get a job as a front-end developer as a
fresher I guess this is an entry-level
person well I have a video called top 5
things you can do that you must do to
Landa a a job as a web developer in 2018
and I also have a job saying the skills
you need to be a front-end developer I
highly encourage you to watch both those
videos and they'll they'll help help you
out in the process do you like reactor I
like react tight I've built about five
projects in it
I find angular one easier I would say
that I find angular one easier as well
so how many people do you work with that
have degrees I would say it's about a
sixty about two-thirds have a degree of
some type and one-third do not
Kevin what's going on man that light
going though that light coin
Kevin I you I think you sold out your
Bitcoin if I remember correct cabbage
you hold on to any light coin like coins
exploding right now
but yeah I mean the thing about degree
is it does nothing but help you if
you're smart right there's a lot of
people who don't have the confidence ask
for raises or leave a job for money I'm
not one of those people I oh I'll
totally if I think I'm getting screwed
in money I'll go ask for more and and if
I don't get it
I'm not just gonna take it so I'm very
aware of the job market and what I'm
worth I think you should be there's
nothing wrong with that for me a degree
is just something to pad the resume
drive a degree no I I don't
but that's why I'm going back something
Pattee the resume make me more confident
to be like hey I just spent ten thousand
dollars finishing up my degree I want
10,000 more dollars maybe not like that
but uh you definitely put yourself in a
position where you're more valuable
right it does nothing about help you
olá do you think that framework is more
valuable than a language more valuable a
framework is up plays on top of the
language so you gotta know the language
at least the bulk of the language to use
the framework it's a it's a strange
question you need both is the question
if you're trying to find out if you need
to learn a framework or if you're trying
to to
focus on language you need both love the
new job is it for CSS for software
engineering so now I could actually see
s how much out gorilla work do you do on
a day-to-day basis and your current job
zero zero and most of you will - oh yeah
I do a lot of crud applications or uh or
Dirk apps as I like to call them you
know you got swap it up delete update
read create so yeah I do a lot of
credits build widgets here there it all
just depends but yeah most most places
you don't really do too much algorithms
it depends on the business so that's I
mean it's it's a fair statement to say
that it is a skill needed because it
shows that you can do critical thinking
but is it actually a practice practical
skill no not really
let's see here says I'm in DevOps Dylan
working on udemy to learn DevOps
practices but I want a code so badly
should I continue coding how would it
affect my future job since I switched
from DevOps to a developer um I mean
honestly I think if that's what you want
to do that's what you should do if
you're not happy and DevOps and you want
to switch to developer role do it put it
in a time putting the effort putting the
energy and you may have to take a slight
pay cut depending on your years and
DevOps but I think it's not really
though I think you'll do just fine but I
would highly encourage you to do it if
that's what makes you happy but I also
think it makes you a valuable tool right
so a lot of smaller businesses you know
the reason they go with full stack
developers it's specialists it's because
they want someone who can kind of do
everything so if you can do DevOps and
do full stack development you're solid
man you really are you should have no
problem getting a role you just gotta
get those those software skills under
your belt I think that's a good way that
Kevin put it that the language knowing
the language that you're trying to work
in in my case is JavaScript is they must
know now knowing the framework will make
you marketable i i'll I like I think
that's a a good way of putting it
because you will need to know both
without a doubt but you're definitely
gonna have to know the language
because I mean I mean read in reality we
don't do vanilla JavaScript anymore
vanilla JavaScript in terms of Dom
manipulation like you should be aware of
what's going on how how things work but
in reality when it comes to web
development specifically front-end
development we use frameworks it's just
the way it's the name of the game now
all right no one's bringing back the
document dot get element by ID that shit
those days are done right no one's
getting the no one's doing document you
know dot get element by ID dot class
list add class name that shit died a
long time ago and we're okay with it in
web development man so this just it's
just how it goes on the front end now
should you know that the vanilla Jas
world exists yes because sometimes you
may have to write two lines of vanilla
J's because the way of doing it in the
framework doesn't exist or is pain but
is worth noting that um that you will be
doing front-end development 95% of the
time in a framework usually angular or
react
sometimes jQuery if you're unlucky
algorithm work kinda makes me nervous
this most alive in practice front-end or
back-end dev well algorithm work is
front-end and back-end all it is is
taking that language and being able to
solve things with equations being able
soft things solution giving solutions to
problems front-end it's not front-end or
back-end in the sense that you're
building application it's front-end or
back-end and so you're using that
library or that that language to solve
an algorithm what's going on Michael I
haven't seen you in a while man
what is DevOps DevOps is essentially the
people who help push out your code to
various environments and also make sure
that it builds and that compiles and
that there's no conflicting issues with
other repos and things like that
they're kind of the gate they're kind of
the last result the last wall of defense
to making sure that kind of so kind of
the way that the answer really the point
of DevOps is DevOps makes sends your
code out to the world in different
environments and maintains it they're
the people who maintain the servers are
the people who make sure that the the
code goes to the right location and is
backed up and all that sort of stuff
sort of the way that the the process
works when you do a project is you get
requirements I should rephrase that you
get some requirements or no requirements
or shitty requirements and occasionally
every once in a blue moon you get good
requirements so that's where it starts
right
that's where it starts and then you as a
developer depending on what requirements
you got you start building right you
start sure tinker in a way you start
making the change you go sometimes so
you have to go back and forth get more
requirements because you don't usually
get very good requirements and then you
you start building stuff so let's say
you go through this whole process you
built out the application you would then
send it to QA QA job is to test it and
make sure that they they find issues
with their code that's it that's the
gist there they find issues with the
code when they're done they then send it
to DevOps don't like literally send it
to dev ops but it the next step is
DevOps typically who will then try to
build the code and usually there's
processes set up and and if it builds
it'll go out and to the world and work
just
now every environment is different so
I'm giving a very rough rundown of what
a lot of them what certain environments
are like but so QA says okay you know
what
good job it's good to go bam let's
release it so it goes to DevOps then
DevOps has systems that are in place
that will then send it up or around and
if DevOps has any questions they'll come
back to you and that's the gist of it
though
my dude where's our DevOps dude that was
just in here
Aki Kumar are you still in here
what do you think about go I heard that
since the release eight years ago Google
is making major moves to push it harder
can you give me a little rundown on that
appreciate you honestly uh Jorge I can't
I can't man I haven't been following up
with it I only care about JavaScript
right now until there comes a time when
with JavaScript justice and killing it
I um I honestly probably won't be typing
into it hunky Kumar congratulations my
friend you are the winner of our course
I'm going to give you a copy of my
learning angular by projects part one
which is now going to be renamed angular
360 part one moving forward but I
appreciate that you were going from
DevOps to to to trying to be a developer
and if I can help you by giving you a
free course that will be it you'll be
our winner for today go ahead and enter
your email in chat so I can send you a
link later on
you start going to meet up some more man
I haven't gone to one in like three
months it's just a disgusting amount of
time they closed the one that was around
the corner so I haven't gone since our
IPI or near admin
yeah I honestly haven't seen anything
let's go when I look for jobs I didn't
see it a couple times so I did see it a
couple times but um alright my friend I
will send this to you immediately after
this livestream in so just hang out for
a little bit and I'll hook you up
this is bullshit
hey when you have your own YouTube
channel you can pull all the shenanigans
you want baby
but um yeah I wish I could help you out
I don't ever heard mmm untouchable
I don't really listen to music guys I
know it's kind of strange cuz a lot of
people music is like life the music I
listen to are like anime and like gaming
remixes that's what I listen to
although I mean it's not to say that I
haven't listened to rap I just don't
anymore
hey Kevin your senior developer so let
me ask you what's your advice for
somebody like me trying to increase
their salary as fast as possible I think
I already know what it is because we're
on the same page I'm just curious I I
want to know what your advice is I was
late for the giveaway a sorry Devex man
who was the first white rapper Ice Ice
Baby I know it could be vanilla ice I
love to watch me amen when you when you
got I can be like me I understand thank
thank you sir Beastie Boys do things
that no one wants to do I don't want to
do my there I'm going back to school no
one wants to do that shit do I use atom
or sublime I use Visual Studio code I
highly encourage you to use it I think
it's amazing it's the best text editor
I've ever used and Microsoft makes it up
coincidentally so surprised
it's the shoes I'll have to I'll
investigate man I I'm going in night so
I've I have these weekly one-on-ones
with my boss I just sort of like 15
minutes sit down say what's going on
with you or you alright
you know how are things and I'm asking
for more work man I'm bored I need more
work
I'm usually waiting on the backend devs
to finish building like api's and so I
finished what my work is on things -
having to hook things up and like a
day's worth of work or half days worth
of work for when the API actually works
so I'm waiting on these things and I
don't touch it for like a week or two
I'd rather do they just flood me with
projects so that's gonna be what I'm
gonna be talking about and this next
meeting so maybe just give me at all
just throw it at me I'd rather have too
much work than not enough man ever done
Android coding with Java or on it with
Java on Android studio very long time
ago for a very short amount of time yeah
I was really excited to do Android
development but I just didn't like Java
I just couldn't I know it's also very
very early on in the programming world
for me so wrap and Rodney hey just wait
till the coding God drops his beats or
his bits and bytes
I hope react that NATO sucks less yeah I
don't know I haven't touched your AK
native that was something that was gonna
be in the the nanodegree do you think
someone working with react angular
should be a master of CSS slash design
god I hope not
cuz I've done definitely not I'm not
very good design I'm not very good at
CSS but no I mean it it helps you'll get
better over time right I'd become so
dependent on bootstrap it's disgusting
but they're they're really different
roles in in reality so my advice is you
know just try and get better at
everything slowly but know you don't
need to be good at CSS to be working
with reactor angling you know I started
an ionic project we do these hackathons
where basically - for the last two hours
- every Friday we get to build stuff and
I I started an ionic project it was
pretty interesting
I haven't dove deep into it quite yet
but yeah I definitely started the
project in it people say programs like
Wix will cut into the web designer space
that's why you don't want to be a web
designer you want to be a web developer
big difference also that's why you you
don't want to learn things like Wix and
WordPress and you don't want to work for
the mom-and-pop businesses of the world
I really appreciate you just sitting
there and answering all these questions
have you been keeping up with any other
youtubers what do you mean like keeping
up I don't know what DHH who DHHS but I
mean I do watch other coding channels
I'm a big fan of of Chris Hawkes I'm a
fan of John SOG nez a sticker so if
that's what you're talking about yeah I
mean I do watch other youtubers I don't
like intimately follow them
yeah John I mean John John's got it
together man
she is didi you meeting Eli the computer
guy
nice top five coding youtubers in your
opinion well I did a video on this but I
would say in terms of tutorials
traversée media I think does an
excellent job giving an introduction to
to tutorials especially he's putting out
different content every week couple
times a week he's doing a very excellent
job it's no surprise that he's blowing
up I think Chris Hawkes is a breath of
fresh air I think he gives great advice
and and in general well tell you like it
is there's something I appreciate
although simple programmer doesn't focus
too much on coding I think when he does
he does he gives very excellent advice
and I also think that it's worth taking
in a little bit of what I'm looking for
life life experience and knowledge and
things I also really like although he
doesn't do I think he's running out of
content he doesn't do the the newer
stuff like traversing media does Derek
bonus I used to watch a lot of Derek
bonus right now he's on let's build some
games
type of stuff I think he's focusing on
like rebuilding Super Mario and like
Zelda and stuff like that but Derek
bonus has always done super high-quality
tutorials and then there's a cat of mind
who does great tutorials as well
do the top 5 and top 5 ways not to get a
dead video voice what is a dev video
voice I do want to do a talk I it so I
have a have a super cringe video that
I'm thinking about recording it's called
a top five wise ways not to date as a
developer so I have some stuff coming
out for that it's been an idea that's
marinating that will be the next top 5
oh yeah Derek is great I'm just saying
in terms of web development what I'm
interested in
he's been he's been staying away from
you know what development changes so
much I don't expect anybody to stay up
to date who it isn't doing web dev
full-time
yeah the not videos are always fun to
film I think they're gonna be a should I
do one a month but it's hard to come up
with something that's a serious topic or
that's related to it stinker
you know it's funny about that is those
are actually some of my most disliked
videos even though I have like a hundred
likes the five dislikes usually I get
like zero to one to two dislikes on the
video but those have really high amount
of dislikes partially because I think
they hit people a little too hard like
the people who that stuff is true for
get super salty about it and they they
dislike it because I in reality it's
supposed to be a joke but in reality
those people exist as well the people
put in two hours a week when they're
just learning the Covenant and don't
understand why they don't learn to code
type of thing the rope so the not video
so Rover is becoming a staple of the not
video so if you see some now with the
not videos you know it's gonna be lit
all right is there any overlap between
analytics and web development projects
it depends on your project but if you're
building a a lot of times in when you're
working for a business they're always
gonna want some sort of data analytics
on it and as a developer you may have to
build over I've built a report admin
tool I've a report a report tool where
you're basically building custom reports
to be filtered in and out so they're
there definitely is if you're building a
project in which you need to visually
represent oh bloody alright visually
represent the Oh
visually represent the the dashboard the
the code then yes there definitely isn't
overlap but just go in defense of it
about where you are in your in your
project but yeah there can be but
actually going and getting the data
analytics that's usually not your job
that's usually your doctor to visually
represent the data analytics as well as
give options on how to filter
you should hold a cigar in Cognac while
you're doing you're not how to bits plus
row next time I think I'll have my
sunglasses on that's all I'll do we'll
just we'll just progressively get more
outlandish can you do a video slash
course on reporting like I'm building a
report tool that's actually gonna be
part three
yeah I got finished my other two courses
I got to incorporate Tito moving forward
the the not videos are fun I just try to
have like a message at the end and so
the dating one doesn't really have a
message it's just supposed to be funny
for a while I've been wanting to do a
video about develop or pickup lines and
this is gonna be the video we're gonna
go through like the top five deaf pickup
lines but I'm having intro as to like
how you can shoot women down so that you
can focus on coding that's basically
just it'll come out good yeah I got some
stuff marinating up here that I that's
fire alright the not videos are always
designed to go hard we don't want to
hold back
should be your alter ego yeah that
should be it be like well so for a while
I wanted to do like a Francis like skit
don't want the Wix developer oh my god
is so good
Dolan the WordPress developer though
that should be it so like I've been for
a while trying to come up with a skit to
do like a Francis like character from
Boogie who has like if you're not
familiar with boogies a gaming youtuber
he does like gaming news and then he has
his character he does what called
Francis where is Francis has like anger
issues is screaming and yelling and so
that was kind of what I was going for in
the not videos but I never fully
developed it so Dolan doe on the
WordPress developer oh my god that might
be it
dylon cuz I spit hot code would baby
alright
that might be it
could have an impact on future jobs
maybe they're funny videos then they're
not like too risque they're over-the-top
that's for sure
we're talking about developer humor you
think that's too risque I mean your
point is very valid without a doubt
Kevin have you watched the two videos
that we have that we have recorded by
chance
I'm a little Tito short and fat here is
my boo chin here's my fat
Francis yells and curses every five
minutes yes he I don't I mean I will
curse a little I'll be honest but not
too much but it's gonna be fun
III try to keep it clean
what's that whoa do you what is it or
your cat senses tingling are you gonna
protect daddy are you gonna run there's
nobody Hey that's just your mama making
noise Tito gets a little skittish
sometimes hey buddy
just farted - cuz it got scared now it
stinks that's my life am I drunk I'm not
drunk
it's 9:30 a.m. I haven't been drunk at
9:30 a.m. in about a decade
I think on and on vacation just to put
it in practice in any context all right
guys so it has been fun I usually do
these about once a weekend and I like to
end my livestream so I'm sort of a final
thought on sort of a a a something give
you to reflect on as always we will do
these every Saturday where I'll try to
answer what questions I can if you want
to support me because this these live
streams can't be monetized for whatever
reason every time they take it take they
they do monetize the live stream
specifically you can by going to bait
ron calm slash coding tutorials 360 you
can of course buy the course and you can
of course buy the clothes which should
be in the link of the description of the
video as well which is pretty cool and
let's see if i have if i can show you
guys real quick before we do our final
thought we're going to be probably
releasing one to two designs a month
right now it's one designers we're
trying to work out the details but it's
something that I'm excited about because
like I like developer clothes I don't
have enough of them so instead I'm just
gonna make ones that I like and so we're
we're launching our bro do you even code
stuff right now so if you're interested
in that I'm going to show you real quick
what it is
well the page doesn't want to look here
it is so I just order a t-shirt for
myself but if you want
for me you can't buy going and getting
all the bro you don't even code stuff I
have a video coming out laying the week
promoting it but uh alright one last
question before I do my phone aside
before you end what question would you
ask you if you were a newbie today I
don't understand your question if I was
a noob what would I ask me oh okay so
I'm I understand the question now so in
this case I am a new what question as a
noob knowing what I know now what I want
somebody to tell me alright give me a
good answer for okay um let's see that's
a very very good question what do I know
now well I guess it'd have to be the
side project and I I would say the
question I would act asked is what is
what would you tell me if I'm if I'm the
past me and I ask the future me so what
would you tell me to become a a good
developer a better developer I would say
start a side project code daily and
that's it and a really start a side
project and code daily and find that the
side project make sure you love it and
if you don't love it certain another
side project and once you find the one
that you love in my case its YouTube
once you find the one that you love
you'll you'll be learning so fast
because you'll want to learn you're
excited about it you're like oh I want
to add this one feature to my project
and how do I do this and that that would
be what I would tell you tell myself is
how can I become a better developer how
can I learn development the fastest code
daily and start a side project that
would be what I would tell myself so on
that note let's talk a little bit about
for our final thought mistakes of the
past as learning as a developer one of
the things that a lot of people are
surprised by is that until recently ty
already had a developer job I never
spent a dollar on a course I never spent
a dollar on
dollar on on on anything to learn
software and that was a mistake of mine
as a past self is I should have taken
the ten dollar sales that were on udemy
and purchased an in-depth course on the
tutorial because there's only so much
free content on YouTube right not that
you can't learn everything but sometimes
it's out-of-date sometimes it's you know
it's hard to maintain it right um and
you make pennies on the dollar really
releasing stuff on YouTube versus
releasing it on udemy so as you're out
there learning and I know a lot of us
are trying to better our life situation
and struggling and you know I totally
get it but don't make the mistake that I
made and just using free materials go
ahead and break out fifty dollars every
couple months to go and pick up some
quality courses and learn from them and
that that's today's final thought is be
willing to invest time energy and a
little bit of money in your future and
it'll take you a long way so thank you
so much for watching I appreciate you
guys so much I'll see you in the next
video have a wonderful Saturday and if
you're around in about thirty minutes
I'll probably start live streaming and
me coding on some projects and finish up
some things so I'll see you guys then
