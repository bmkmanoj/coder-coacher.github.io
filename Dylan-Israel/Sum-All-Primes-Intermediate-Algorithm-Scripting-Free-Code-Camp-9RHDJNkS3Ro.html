and free code camp we're working on some
intermediate algorithm scripting some
all crimes so let's just quickly go over
what it is that we're trying to do here
in this case we want to take in an
inputted number we then want to get all
the prime numbers up to that number so
in the instance of the number ten that
would be the number two three five and
seven those are all prime numbers and
then we want to just add them all
together so there's a couple of ways we
can do this the way I decided to do it
was to just add it to an array and then
add the array or reduce the array by
adding it at the end so to quickly go
over what a prime number is uh because
this is it's more math than programming
at the end of end of the day and once
you're able to understand how prime
prime numbers work you can probably
figure out how to check for all numbers
in a prime number so prime number is any
number that is only divisible by 1 and
itself
1 does not count as a prime number
everything else does that is that
meatsack requirement so 2 is a prime
number but every even number after that
wouldn't be because 2 would divide
evenly into it so essentially anything
that's divided is any number that a
number below it divides into it evenly
meaning there's no remainder will return
a prime number so for the entire length
so if we go up to 7 well 2 2 3 4 5 &amp;amp; 6
will never divide evenly into 7/10 7 is
a prime number so how do we get started
with this so as I said we're gonna
create an empty array to store our
numbers in we're then gonna create a for
loop that's actually going to start it 2
and then while it is less than or equal
to because we need to we need to check
our inputted number as well to see if
that's a prime number that's why it's
less than or equal to we're gonna go
ahead and increment upwards for that so
what's going on here the way I did it
was I had a second for loop let's say
our input and number in this case is 10
if we're checking to see if when we're
on let's say 7 we need to check 1 2 3 4
excuse me 2 3 4 5 6 7 but we don't need
to check 8 9 or 10 so the way that I did
this pretty intuitive if you just kind
of think about think it out for a second
and I I highly encourage everybody to
draw it out if we take my webcam for a
second it might be a little hard to see
but over there you can see my whiteboard
and I actually drew all this out kind of
rough draft it rough drafted it if you
will so I highly suggest you do the same
so in this case we're just gonna start
it to again our very first number that
we're iterating from and then we're
gonna say well J is less than or equal
to I because we don't need to check any
numbers above the number that we need to
find out if it's a prime so next we're
gonna just go ahead and increment honey
and now here's where the real logic
comes in so we're gonna have two if
statements here and again you may have a
better way of doing this this is the
most simple way for me now if our eye is
ever equal to RJ all right let me put
this way so let's just have our true
statements first we're gonna go ahead
and do that we'll keep it empty so in
this case in our second if statement
here if I if the number we're checking
modulo for any value of J is ever equal
to 0 that means it's not a prime
so what we want to do is just want to
break that there's no reason if we're
checking the number six that on two
because two divides evenly on six our
six is divided evenly by two that we
need to check three four or five because
five won't return anything so once it
fails one test it's done there's no need
to run continue the for loop so that's
why we're gonna break the for loop okay
so that's the logic there so the next
thing we need to do is what what is the
statement right here that we want to
array dot push I or J doesn't matter at
this point what's how my logic goes so
when we want to add that number when
it's a prime number what's going on here
so the way my code set up is whatever I
actually is equal to J that means that
we have checked all our values and it
would have broken or break breaked broke
I guess but we'll say it would have
broken the for loop if if it ever if it
failed one single test and that's how my
logic works here so if if we ever get to
i7 is ever equal to seven we're gonna
add it to the for loop and then that's
actually gonna going to return zero as
well so we'll just break the loop anyhow
do keep in mind that if you end up
switching these it won't actually add
the value ever because it needs to add
the value first before breaking the for
loop so just something to think about so
what do we so what we can do now is just
kind of test our code so that's gonna be
the hard the easy part so let's make
sure we're where everything worked out
there's no spelling mistake so so you
can see right here two three five seven
these are all our prime numbers when
checking ten so how did I go about doing
this now when I when I was doing this I
was pair programming with a friend and I
worked it through one more time on my
own and so the way that he's I
originally wanted to do a for loop where
we just add through the values and he
told me to stop being a chump basically
and just use reduce so I'm gonna go
ahead and there's a showcase for reduce
if we haven't used it before I don't
remember
but array comes in with a a array is
built in with a function called reduce
which will reduce your array based on a
function that you are passing in with it
so in this case what we're gonna do is
take in and x and a y from our array we
are then going to add them together and
then we're simply gonna return it so
here you'll see right here we're gonna
add it together so what's going to
happen is array is going to run this
reduced function this right that's gonna
run a function that adds like the zero
index and then the first index and the
second index and the third index except
your X Edra until there's no more spots
left and then just return a number then
you'll see right here we end up getting
17 so we know that's correct because if
you were to check that 2 plus 3 is 5 5
plus 5 is 10 and then the final prime
number when inputting the number 10 is 7
or 10 plus 7 is 17 so let's go ahead and
just put our comments in here
if anyone that's been watching these you
know I'm a huge I make the suggestion of
always putting comments in so what's
going on in var right create an array to
reduce later you choose later and store
prime prime numbers here first loop to
check if number is prime and then here
we check all numbers up to actually the
better way to put this is check inputted
number
by all numbers leading up to it and then
here if they are equal it is a prime
number and then if true break the loop
and isn't prime and then will put one
last thing here that's a cue that says
reduces the array by adding all of its
inputs so again I hope you guys found
this helpful as always thanks you thank
you for watching don't forget to Like
and subscribe I have a patreon page as
well guys and leave me comments I really
like them and they're really helpful for
other people that are learning as well
so I hope you guys are doing really well
in free code camp and I'll see you guys
in the next video I want to say thanks
to skillet Thrilla for sponsoring this
video he has his own YouTube channel
playing games such as fallout 4 rain of
Kings dota 2 and Diablo 3 and I'm sure a
few other games so good just click the
360 annotation above it'll take you to
this channel if you're nervous and
checking it out as always guys thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
