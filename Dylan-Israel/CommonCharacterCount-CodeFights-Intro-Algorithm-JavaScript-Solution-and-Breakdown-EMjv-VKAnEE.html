we are back in the intro of code fights
doing common character count what we're
trying to do here is we are trying to
return a count of how many letters they
have in common and how many times for
instance there are two A's in here and
three A's in here so we only count two
of them the way that I did this was I
created an object for the two strings I
get passed in because we get an s1 s2 I
split that into an array and then in
those objects I append to it and then I
keep track of how many days are in one
how many bees etc are in each object and
then I compare and I take the lesser of
those and I return I add that to the
count because we wouldn't take the
greater because it doesn't have a both
in common so first we got to find out
how what letters are in it
second we have to find out how many of
those letters is that are in it and the
third and final part we got to find out
what is the smaller part because that's
what they have in common so let's go
ahead and get started by and I'm gonna
put some comments in here just so that
it all makes sense because there's a
little bit of code we repeat two for
loops we could probably have written a
function for that and I'm sure you guys
can come up with a better way of solving
this what this is how I do is just split
up the strings into a race all right so
we're just going to use oops so s 1 is
equal to s 1 dot split and these are
good this is going to be a character
rice.i thing with the s 2
so we have our two arrays now of
characters the next thing that we need
to do is we need to create an object I
call it s1 object and s2 object and
these are going to start off by being
empty now what we're going to do is
create a for loop that iterates through
the first s1 array here and is going to
check if our s-1 object has a property
that's going to be equal to the
character that we're checking and if
it's false we're going to go ahead and
add that property and add one as its
value add that key and if add one is the
value if it's true meaning that it does
exist we're going to go ahead and add
one to its value so we need a for loop
standard for loop RI is equal zero
well I is less than s1 dot length I plus
plus in here we're going to say an if
statement that chase us a does s1 object
dot has own property
does the item that we're checking the
current index that we're checking does
it exist is it is it not does it not
exist rather if it doesn't exist we want
to go ahead with bracket notation add
that value and we want to go in and set
it equal to one so the first iteration
of this a doesn't exist in our object so
we want to add it to our object and if
we want to right now just kind of
showcase the the objective here let's go
ahead and run our tests and we can we
can see that right now all we're doing
is adding the letter so there's a a B
and a C in there and they're all value
of one but that there's two ways one B
and two CS
so what do we do for that well if it's
false that means it exists so we can
just make this an else statement and in
here when you say s1 an object on this
property here let's go ahead and just
add one to it you can run our code one
time to see that it's working and now we
have two A's to CS and one B as we
should that's the first part now
everything we did right there in this
this life said that we could probably
write a function covered we are quite
literally going to be copying what we do
here but since I did do that I'm just
going to copy it and all we're going to
do here is change the s12 and s22 su
object s1 object going to swap that out
it's going to do the exact same thing
and while we're at it we can check to
make sure everything is working so we'll
run our string and we'll see that we
have an s2 object here we have
Oh
that's two objects out here we go I was
like there's a mistake somewhere so now
we should be good so you'll see we have
three A's one DNS see everything is
working great now the last little part
that we need to do is we need to iterate
through one of our objects and compare
it with the other object to see one does
it have it in common and then we have to
see which one has less than the other of
the item that they have in common
thank you track of that so because we
need to keep track of that let's go
ahead and create this total variable
here we'll initialize it to zero now
we're going to do a for loop that's for
that the that's going to iterate through
an object so we'll say prop shorten
property in our object you can iterate
through the first one or the second one
doesn't really matter next what we're
going to do is say look does this object
does the s2 object the opposite object
of what we're iterating through contain
this prop so does the is a in a and s1
in having a property in s2 so is the
this I'm getting ahead of myself which
is me that does that property exists is
it equal to true now it's the spaces up
here now if it is what we have to do
from here is have an if-else statement
says hey which one is less than or
greater than
so if yes we want to add the less than
if this prop is now we're checking the
value isn't less than its s2 object is
less than the s-1 object prop because
now we know it exists go ahead and take
our total
go ahead and add that SQ object because
it's the smaller value now if that's not
the case we'll do an else statement and
right here what we're going to do is
we're going to add the S one object
prompt values because that is the
smaller value meaning they all have it
in common now all we have to do here in
a bar code a little bit and return total
and that should be it assume you know
syntax mistakes or anything else and
submit it and we are good to go so this
is how I solve a we use the Haslam
property quite a few times we use
objects a little bit more than I was
expecting to when I first saw this but
this is what what uh how I ended up
solving it but as always guys I'm always
interested in your solutions for myself
