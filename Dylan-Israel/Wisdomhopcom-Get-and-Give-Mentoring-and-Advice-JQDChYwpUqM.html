about how you can get a mentor for
relatively cheap as well as mentor
others to make a little bit of side cash
on the side using wisdom hop look
forward to that as well as how I use
wisdom hop moving forward so I want to
start by thanking wisdom hop for
sponsoring this video
we don't get too many sponsors but it is
appreciated and it's something I
actually really like if you know me one
of the reasons I like software is to be
able to be a digital nomad so anything
that you can kind of do remotely I'm a
big fan of I think there's a pretty
interesting thing cuz it's actually
something I already kind of do on the
side so what is wisdom hop they call it
the knowledge marketplace and what that
basically means is they're a marketplace
where say you are an expert in something
in my case let's say it's YouTube and
JavaScript right those are probably the
things I'm most well-informed about say
you want to have a conversation with me
about JavaScript you can I have an
account on here and YouTube and whatever
else and you you basically sell your
time by the minute and you have a phone
call and you set your own rate so you've
set it at whatever is worth your time
and this can go for anything we're gonna
see some of the cooler profiles I saw on
the site and right now because wisdom
hop is recently launched there there's a
lot of people who are just trying to get
some reviews on their account so you can
get some sometimes even free but low
cost conversations about topics you're
interested in so what type of topics
could that be well you can see right
here travel digital marketing right I
know a lot of us are nervous in that
education technology JavaScript say
you're trying to start a podcast what's
better than talking someone who already
has one right being able to sit down and
by the minute let's say they charge 50
cents a minute you'll spend $30 for an
hour-long conversation with someone who
has a successful podcast journalism
swimming Twitter urban gardening
augmented reality you can see there's a
ton of stuff here and it's constantly
growing right maybe yoga maybe you want
to get started with that and get going
sighs work well basically you search for
who what it is you're
that you review a profile let's go ahead
and choose a profile real quick so
Matthew machalek
I'm sorry my friend if I butchered your
name but he's actually one of the people
who's saying hey I just want to get some
reviews and I want to build up my my my
wisdom hop portfolio or profile rather
and from there I'm just gonna charge
zero a minute zero a minute and you're
going to set up your conversation tell
him what you want talking about so what
is what is he qualified to consult on
well this is a experience that you're
thinking of moving to the Dallas area
this is one thing you talked to you
about where to go what to do to see if
it's it's for you right especially in
software we move around a lot I went
from California all the way to Tampa
Florida free diving motorcycles business
school to be able to talk to someone
about if you're trying to go to an MBA
program or you're thinking is it worth
it what was it like you talk to you can
talk to Michael here for completely free
about these sorts of topics and they'll
include their social media as well their
LinkedIn their Facebook so you can learn
a little bit about them and dive in a
little bit more to see hey it's just a
person that's right for me to sit down
because at the end of the day not
everyone's going to be free and you're
gonna you're in spent some money to talk
to somebody for 15 20 30 minutes an hour
two hours if you if you feel like it
then there's a Teresa Lawson another
person who is talking about budgeting
that's the one thing she wants to talk
about she has her own system called the
priority method I think it's a little
funny when you start naming this
you do but hey whatever comes like and
believe it or not you can talk to the
man himself Jesus Christ for only a
dollar a minute now
you'll be able to meet your Lord and
Savior and be able not to meet but
rather have a phone call you know using
heaven cellular so theology definitely
qualified to talk about that so you can
sometimes have a little bit of fun on
here
this guy is a YouTube channel on here as
well and followers but the point I'm
trying to get across is you can get a
lot of value for let's say you just
wanted to have a 20 minute conversation
it's 20 dollars later right you can
learn a lot in twenty dollars if you
really just have to three questions
about a very specific topic
that you want to just have the
confidence to pull the trigger on
whatever it is that you're trying to
start in your life and not only can you
do that you can also provide a service
right on my on my page when we go to
view my profile I charge a little bit
more a church 250 per minute I'm
probably gonna lower it to $2 and I'll
probably do one or two free ones so if
you want to talk with your boy about
some some topics holler Adam in the
comments that we may do a couple free
giveaways of you know 15 20 minute
conversations if you think I can provide
value well um so you know what are
things that I could talk about obviously
program me I'm a full stacks full stacks
web developer self taught YouTube
JavaScript I'd already do mentoring I
already kind of do that living in
California how to move to a different
state these are all things that I've
done and in terms of moving again from
Florida to California so you can see how
somebody might be how I in this case
would be able to provide value and
hopefully someone's going through here
and says hey this guy's is a YouTube
channel and maybe maybe he is interested
in answering a few my questions I'm
thinking starting a coding Channel and I
want to sit down with him for 30 minutes
or 20 minutes and just kind of pick his
brain over the phone it's that simple
you sort of set up a date no time and
tell them what you want to talk about
and then you handle your phone call it's
it's really as they put it the knowledge
marketplace and it's pretty cool not
only for someone who's trying to get
some questions answered but for somebody
who is trying to make a little side
money and help some people out in the
process and I really like it's one of
the reasons that I kind of do my every
every thousand subscribers and answer
questions for people because I do think
there's a lot of value in getting to
learn from the mistakes of others and
that's a lot of what it is is hey is
this the right path no no let me tell
you why that's not because I did it and
I want to make sure you're successful
right and this is really you sharing the
knowledge that that's what wisdom hop is
about so thank you to them again for for
sponsoring this video I'm excited about
it
