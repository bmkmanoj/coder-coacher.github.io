excited we're almost at the bonfires so
we've been just kind of doing the basics
we started with HTML CSS we moved on to
responsive design with bootstrap we now
did jQuery basic JavaScript and we are
finally in object-oriented functional
programming and then we're gonna be
joining right into here so we're gonna
be using doing object-oriented program
with JavaScript so in this case you see
we create an object called car it has
the parameter wheels and we're going to
do the same when do same thing with a
motorbike except we're gonna save our
motorbiking in here we are going to say
that it has engine's parameter and that
is going to be got a colon and we're
going to set that equal to let's say 1
then we put a comma well so we want the
wheels parameter and we're gonna put
that at 2 and then we have the seats and
I think technically there's two because
someone can sit on the end so cool so we
kind of just instantiated our motorbike
so in this case this is another way we
can do it we can var motorbike equals
function and how what are we gonna do
with this we're gonna say this dot
engines you see in the example that car
and we'll set this equal to 1 and then
we'll say this dot wheels there's equal
to 2 and then we'll say this so we're
treating it like an object now so that's
why we're using this and so we'll say
this dot seats is equal to 2 as well so
two different ways we can do that I
prefer doing it that way just because
it's more intuitive to me and I quote s'
whatever takes a long long a longer
amount of time for me to work with so
the method get speed of my bike should
be accessible outside the object so my
bike dot sweet is on a fine so what we
want to do here
so like our bike this uh speed add value
my bike top speed I'll say my bike top
speed and is equal to equal to 100 oops
and we don't want it in there really
want it right here
I say what's going on here let's run it
the method gets for you - my bike should
be accessible outside the object so good
speed return let's see here the mythic
it speed on my bike should be accessible
outside the object it should be yes so
my bike dot speed
apparently I'm gonna understand what
they're asking so see if you can keep my
bike top speed in my bike dot ad unit
private while making my buttocks
publicly accessible properties in public
methods you can also create some say
public so dancing
let's create an object with two
functions one attach as a property on
one it's not so sorry when we started
this I think I was a little tired I did
a couple coding videos and some coding
homework and my brain was kind of dead
so in this case we want to make the my
bike should be accessible outside the
object so I believe we need to make this
a public function so this is a public
and this is a private function you see
right here it gets speed is styled under
the private and how we know that is that
if we're not calling this equals
function so my bike dusty should be
undefined so so that's undefined and so
we want to get rid of the speed variable
actually we can say I will just look at
that so that leaves it undefined and
then next we want to make it should be
accessible outside the object so we want
to allow it to be accessible throughout
the object speed is not defined
all right so apparently oh and then we
need to say this dot speed and now Sherk
cool so it's undefined right now and all
we did was make it so that the get speed
function is public now meaning that it's
a lot easier to get a hold of in private
essentially so the property engines of
my car should be a number
all right so in this case we want to
select my car let's put a space in
between just like my car dot and what
property do we want to set we want to
set engines and I believe we want to do
it it's just the correct one
I believe this how it how we do it my
car died engines is not a function see
here wheels for so they don't want us to
say it here we'll say call properties
you can create each units and center
itself for instance and an engines
property with a number value to the my
car instance so this is what I was
singing during originally this done it
is equals one but yeah see they don't
want us to have it in the constructor
here so let's say my car dot engines
let's see if that works
cool so a little bit of a brain fart
there so what's going on here is we're
selecting the my car object we're adding
an engines parameter because it's not
included in the default constructor and
we're setting it equal to one so when we
were going to log this how you can see
right here it's engine than one so how
it this is just plain our code alright
you should add three to each value in
the array all right so we're going to
say four we're into a four loop
oh they want us to they want us to do it
this way okay so in JavaScript this is
kind of how we could do such a thing
although so this is called the map
function I haven't used this before I
was actually going to iterate through it
like for loop and just add it to the
array but apparently this is another way
of doing it so in this case we're
creating a times four that's going to be
equal to our old array and we're going
to change the value so one and we're n
times it by four in this case we want to
add 3 to it plus 3 and in this case
we're gonna say var x 4 nope
old array of our new all right how many
wants to do this
there we go so you kind of need to think
of it in three steps so you need the the
ending array that's our new array you
need a temporary placeholder or you
could actually just use old array but it
might be a little more make more sense
to use a temporary placeholder times
four hello buddy
all right so single valve should be
equal to the sum of all items in the
array variable let's see here
all right so apparently there's a reduce
method as well so let's go ahead and
copy this over and we'll put it above
single Val so let's see we're gonna say
Val single vowel is equal to our rate
dot reduce function previous about
current file
except you're yourself girl so what are
we doing wrong here we have a single
male so it returns to minus 30 so let's
see 4 minus 5 is 10 so negative 1
negative
you know something I'm sorry all right
so let's read over this a little bit so
you sorta deuce message to iterate
through an array and condense it into
one value when you use reduce you pass
in a callback whose argument starting
accumulator in this case previous Val
and current valid those are the index 0
and then index 1 and incremented by 1
and the 0 there is where we're setting
it so we're starting at 0 and then we're
going to let's see minus 4 minus 6 is 10
at least 25 so minus 32 that's alright
if I understand this correctly so 10 15
20 no 30 minus 30 is what you get so
yeah this is correct so
Oh in this case we want to add it there
we go so that's where the mistake was I
thought reduce was just for subtracting
but in this case we are actually adding
the two together to get positive 30
so see here you should have removed all
the values from the array that are
greater than five you should use the
filter method to restore the values from
the array and granted I haven't done
much JavaScript so I don't know these
offhand but obviously you'll become very
familiar very quickly with what it is
that we're trying to do here so we're
gonna set fine
so so in this case what do we want to do
we want to get an array and we want to
change this to old array I'm gonna that
parses through this and then we want to
return only values that when we mod them
by five let's see if we want them by
five they'd be greater than 5 mod 5s
equally cool dope is greater than or
equal to 1 I believe that's right
now we just said no already old all
right yeah should have removed all the
values from the array decorating the 5
just don't see what happens newer guys
not define and then we'll set new right
equal to all right oops here we go one
chain just the old array then we want to
change this to how that work
just sit this to array change this to
array so this is what I was talking
about placeholder so I think this should
work now huh
so rate is equal to old array dot filter
function as well okay so how do I want
to do this return
no that's not right because it could for
you to monshell alright so I turn a
number for a that are great in the fire
maybe we do an if statement sure this
if val is greater than for return Val
six seven eight nine ten she removed all
the values from array that are greater
than five
you should have removed all the values
greater than five so this works so we're
getting six out of eight nine ten well
we didn't use filter we're gonna do it
with you
yeah I pause the video I want to do a
little bit of research real quick to see
so I noticed that I am mistaken we did
not want to remove values that are less
than five we want to remove values that
are less than five so let's go ahead do
that and also there's some sort of air
going on where it needs to be less than
or equal to oops wrong way always put
these on the wrong side so less than or
equal to and that should work so even
though it says less than five it's just
a mistake there's a comment from freaked
someone from free code camp as soon as
eight days ago saying that they've fixed
this but it's not live so you made it
may just be less than by the time you
watch this video so you know you should
sorted the array from largest to
smallest so a radar sort so on twelve to
twenty one so we're gonna start so
here's our array very nice sort and then
we are going to declare function in here
that takes in an a it takes in a B and
then we're going into
implement a method and what do we want
to do from here we want you to return a
minus B let's see
I see all these in parallel so it down
was the smallest largest
there we go so we need to switch the
other way around
so it looks like it's only returning B
minus a is greater is true so if like
say this is B and this is a so it goes a
B if B minus a returns a positive number
we're gonna add it in that order so
that's so that's all what's going on
here you should try to reverse the array
Oh see we have array dot reverse and
that's all it does so now we reverse the
array just swaps everything around all
right we also want to concatenate
strings so so what we're gonna do we
want to set the new array equal to the
concatenation of the old array concat
and then what do we want to add to it
can cat me run that cool 1 2 3 4 5 6 it
just adds the two arrays together to
take one or a say on this array can cat
this other right on to it used to split
to split the string by its pieces so we
have our a string that split and so
we'll just in this case a string dot
split and then what do we want to split
we put in quotations here BAM and I'm
sure there's a way to concatenate that
with multiple things so join strings
with join let's see here you should join
elements so in so we're going to say
join string dot join and we want to join
anything with an element right there so
what's gonna happen now is when we add
this it's going to every every thing
here at of space I believe so you see
how it split me into an array
all spaces cool and if you're curious
with it if you're not sure you can do
now like that you can see right here
it's all messed up we're moving right
along and I think that's it I think we
just finished the first section you can
look right here we're gonna be moving on
to function me to bonfire type of thing
so we're finally in the bonfire so it's
very good news
up till now we've done get started the
HTML responsive design gear for success
Jacek jQuery basic JavaScript object
oriented function functional programming
and now we're finally in basic algorithm
scripting so there's 16 sections 50
hours we've been going about oh one for
every three minutes they give us we've
been doing about one and I think we're
doing pretty good but I think where
things are gonna slow down a little bit
right now so I'm very excited to get
started with our first bonfire and we're
almost there I mean we still have
according to this about 350 400 hours
before yeah but we've knocked out a few
things and we're ready to get going and
I'll see you guys in the next video and
as always thanks for watching don't
forget to Like and subscribe and
constructive criticism is always
appreciated thanks for watching the
video don't forget to Like and subscribe
that'd be great and leave me a comment
