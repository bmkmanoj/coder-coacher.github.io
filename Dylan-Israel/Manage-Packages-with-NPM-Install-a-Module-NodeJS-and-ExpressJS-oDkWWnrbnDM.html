in manage packages with NPM we are now
doing install a module if you don't have
this up already go ahead and do so by
calling the how to NPM come in and we're
gonna go install module so oh it looks
like you're in the wrong folder please
CD into work so we're gonna see into CT
360 so you'll see we're now on the
correct folder so let's do the how to -
NPM we could probably have done print as
well so we're now in the correct if the
correct area first thing that most
people do is install a dependency
dependency it's kind of like a module
that you use in angular for instance you
have dependencies such as other
libraries that you may use that are
you're going to install necessarily
install a call too because most of them
already and angular they're just not
automatically called
to save loading time and things like
that but you know defend disease are
fetched from the registry and unpacked
in the node modules folder just saw a
module used to npm install so we're
gonna do an NPM install and then the
module name we're gonna install at Alain
Clark slash pkg so we'll see that we are
having an air here so let's see what
happens when you go how - to - NPM
verify so make sure you install link
lock pkg module all right so we're gonna
try this one more time and before we do
anything we're actually gonna delete
these files the node modules because I
think this node module came when I tried
to remove it so we do npm install at
Lynn Clark
slash pkg
there we go so a little bit of an error
for the previous video so you'll see
that this seemed to work just fine and
now we know how to NPM verify and you'll
notice that we're getting some errors
here or warnings there's no description
no repository filled all that sort of
stuff I mean in the future videos we'll
worry about that but out for ads up
right now - all we have to do is install
so kind of things to basically keep
track of is that we have if you have a
dependency or module that you're going
to be using you can install that to your
to your node server and go from there
