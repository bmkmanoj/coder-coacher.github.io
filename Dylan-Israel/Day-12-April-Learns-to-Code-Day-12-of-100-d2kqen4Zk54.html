Angeles anymore thank you for getting
the diffuser going so let's got him good
this flaws um what we see you tick are
you using this pillow for something is
there reason to say yeah be comfy all
right is actually thinking we would why
didn't get everybody caught up in what
you've been doing last day James welcome
welcome okay um are you mention see you
wanna you know we're all still at this
yeah
oh what'd you say so pretty much the
same oh okay so right now I've just been
watching our videos going over notes I'm
starting to get the hang of it um a lot
of it like I'll try I'll read over it
and then I'll try to do it myself and
the last like three times that I've done
that I three times three times that I've
done that I gotten it on my own the
first time around so that's exciting or
if I have it I understand going back
over and kind of like look uh like going
over my notes and stuff I can figure out
what it was that I did wrong so that's
cool um because in the back of my mind
I'm like if I can't do this what if I
don't understand this what if I can only
get so far because I was just reading an
article talking about this guy
who's been doing coding just as like a
hobby because he likes the challenge and
I'm like Jesus ah and he I wrote down a
goddess monkey bought me a book I'm
reading it right now I just got done
reading the preface and I'm gonna read
on like how to use it and whatnot sounds
really cool so I'm excited to start
using it as I wrote down in the book to
remind me that this isn't word-for-word
but it's kind of like in the general
idea that when and if your journey
becomes difficult don't despair because
you're you know you're on the right path
the hard one and so I just kept as this
is this is hard and like Dylan said a
couple days ago like yeah it's hard
which is why a lot of people don't do it
and I really want to hit the wall and
not be intimidated by it so I'm hoping
that all of the work that I put towards
everything will help me deal with the
wall when it really does come so thank
you a big maybe god I need these money
so yeah uh so I've been doing notes I've
been now reading a book I've been taking
notes I've been watching our videos and
I've been working on my portfolio page
and so my portfolio page is kind of
frustrating the out of me right now
because I don't know enough to do what I
want it to do and so I'm hope I'm trying
to catch up on my notes so that I can be
able to do what it is that I need to do
for my portfolio page so yeah I've been
kind of avoiding my portfolio page but I
try to go back to it so I'll read I'll
look at my notes I'll do some I'll do
some coding on
recode camp and then I'll go to my poor
feller and I give and kind of like
sectioning it off like that because I
don't want to procrastinate on my
portfolio page because it's something
that I know that I need to get done
but it's like I said it's just
frustrating me because I don't know
enough yet to get it done so it's just
anyways that's what's been going on well
all that's pretty natural and I'm sure a
lot of people can relate to that with
that being said let's just get started
so don't don't sweat getting stuck
everybody in here will tell you that
they get stuck all the time
it's not so much getting stuck it's kind
of like that feeling like oh like
it I feel like hey like um John said
here's like going to the gym I feel like
it's like a course like one of those
like what does triathlons yet like a
triathlon course like you just get to
the point where your body's just like
nope I was terrified of my brain getting
to this point where oh yeah here's a
really big wall good luck
climbing it you know and I just I'm
dreading that point so yeah and I feel
it like I got little hurdles right now
I'm just terrified of the big hurdle
economy because the God knows I I know
it's coming because I'm looking at this
JavaScript and I'm like the moment I
have to start coding JavaScript I'm just
gonna like in pain so I just I'm hoping
that my basics all kind of I'm hoping
that I have built my basics well enough
that I'll be able to slowly climb my big
hurdles when they come so I guess it's
not a matter of if it's just a matter of
when so yeah and but again with the guy
that I was quoting earlier say
that if it's not hard if it's hard then
at least you know you're on the right
path that's just kind of some kind of
weird reassurance for me at least I know
I'm going in the right direction because
it's really hard are with that
being said because we could all be here
all day talking about how much how hard
this is let's let's jump into today's
lesson um so last time we were
struggling on this where we were I reset
our code we're in start fresh where we
wanted to check if a name is actually a
context first name and the given prop is
ser given problem so check if name is an
actual context first name so we have to
iterate through all these right remember
we do that with a for loop hmm ok so
what are we doing we're gonna check what
what we want to do is see if the name
which in this case would be akhira want
to check to see if first name exists ok
um so the way that we can do that is we
we have to check all the values and then
I had to start from contacts oh no we do
a for loop reversing for the length
remember contacts is our I plus plus all
right check if name is actual contacts
first name and so we want to do is we'll
do an if statement here that says if
contacts and we pass in our current item
that we're iterating on this has been
doing this today I need new monitors or
new cord dot or read it like this we
know the name of the property right
first name
is equal equal equal to the name
property so sorry guys it's alright you
can we go my my monitor is bugging out a
little bit guys on a second just because
the connection from it's just flopping
because it's not a good connection I
gotta get a better monitor um alright I
have to get a new cord or something for
it it's a new Kourtney okay so here it
is better if it's written with dot
notation okay so they want to use dot
notation no big deal
so saying look does this first name
we're going to iterate through each one
of these indexes and we're checking does
first name equal the value or Passyunk
here the first one won't hit yes but if
it didn't would move on to the next one
and so does that exist that's what we're
doing free and we're checking every
value so we have to iterate through the
whole array next what we want to do is
and the given prop is a property of that
contact so if this is true if that name
exists we have now found where this
exists and so we want to say
and the compromise so Christian lastname
should return boss and so then we want
to do another gift statement that all
it's checking is does that Prop exist
and we can just do another if statement
here contacts thank you not calm cat oh
my god contacts I did concat we
this all up on facts and then we'll do
another nested assumes as if yeah what
that was I doing around contacts and
we're saying if that prop exists all we
want to do is return the phone okay
the remember the variable we're setting
which is I the iterator
I sure for iterator otherwise iterator
mean um each time you go through
something is an iteration so when we go
our first loop and I'd be an iteration
zero but yeah and so I in contact when
we pass contact zero I'd be the first
one and then we've run that loop dot
length so the whole of it a whole object
that's how many times we've run it the
length of the arc of the array okay so
if there's four items in the array the
length of it is four one four and so
you'd run the loop four times okay
so why this statement is true run the
loop and then every loop increase the
iterator by one in this case okay where
is the loop the for loop for is four for
loop why
would give me why why is it gold for
loot oh that's what it's called it is
it's the same thing for everything it's
not like something unique for each
iteration run this okay alright and so
what this is statement here so this
statement is the loop yes this is
kicking off the loop and everything
that's being looped is winning okay okay
bit code says hey Dee I guess that's me
I'm finishing up digital marketing with
set times and come to learn that doing
AdWords at a high level takes knowledge
javis Kristen oh that because of how
well digital marketers can get paid that
there's a lot of technical knowledge
when seat when messing with SEO and
AdWords so I'm glad to see that he went
into that detail with the course which
is why so many people are signing out
for her to having good results I would
imagine it's a great skill it's a number
one skill I would say outside of coding
that you could teach yourself and earn a
good living with which is when not when
I saw that you're taking the course I
was really happy to see that because it
is a good course and they people are
getting jobs left and right there's a
lot of jobs in that feeling when I go to
look up like web intern half of them are
that hmm alright so afternoon
Hecate Hecate ah've and now no Lola Rock
no no rock alright so here what we want
to do is have an if statement it says
function if name is actual contacts
first name and the given prop is the
property of the contact if both are true
then return the value of that property
all right let's try writing this so this
should work for some things
all right so here we're gonna do blood
cuz I think I I think I had the same
exact logic last time and I
misunderstood why my logic wasn't
working then also so what we're gonna do
Hey they'll be scratching things
scratching do you guys air real quick
I'll show you is this how it is in my
office here so you guys could see what's
going on we got we got Tito right here
we have a kilise right there and then
Milo right here and then just like
hanging out man they're just like a
everyone I know we have a 2-bedroom
2-bath with the living room and dining
area but let's all just hang out
together in the tiniest room in the
house cats huh
I uh a little insight into our cat life
each of them is like like three of them
is another person so it's like having
three people on here and sometimes when
the on the cats are really in the mood
each one feels like its own person like
a full individual in the room because
they won't budge like you can't like
walk through them because they won't
move it's like you have to shove them
out of the way sometimes oh do I work
from home not usually I will be working
a few days from home this coming week
though okay cool so what we're doing
right now is more debugging we're trying
to find out where there's an error in my
logic and so I want to make sure that
this is right so we're getting the
first-name as we thought so the next
thing that we can do is we can consoles
so we're only getting first names or not
any long last name right now no we're
just care about first name right but
that's what they're saying that's the
thing that you should get the last name
should Harry another they're all passing
in the first name that's all but in this
case we're getting a Christian and then
they're asking for last name and so what
we're going to do now is we're going to
pass in context I we're going to check
our our next logic and we're passing
drop check piece by piece so cool so
this is working as well or why certain
let's go ahead and clear that real quick
we'll try it one more time
the is this
this seems to be the user object of free
coke an interesting
I know it's in here so here we're
returning likes each one these return
something so this is actually working as
well it's not returning when it should
good right here I don't understand your
logic I'm going to show you it's saying
it should return boss none of that is
returning what it should be so we're
getting the prompt in this case likes so
this first one Akira and likes would be
pizza coding and brownie points so it is
returning and the other values are being
returned as well everything that's
getting in here is part of those unit
tests to make sure that our code is
running properly so somewhere in our
code this isn't running properly so what
we have to do is we'll just go piece by
piece and see where our logic is broken
so let's run this and you see we still
are hitting some of these values and say
okay cool and then that makes sense
let's run this
that's making sense so
the question oh so the logic is right
here we made a mistaken I don't want to
actually return prop but I want to
return is this whole contacts here so
remember this value that we're checking
and so we'll do an else statement else
to return no such property
and that should return some of it we're
gonna have one more okay so what
happened here was that we were returning
the parameter what we actually wanted a
return this if statement checks if it
exists right so the prop in this case is
likes for the first one does likes
exists that's what this if statements
asking because if we throw that in here
and it doesn't exist it's going to
return false it does exist it returns
true okay and we're saying if it does
exist go ahead and return our return
that information I made a mistake by
just throwing prop in here and not
thinking so that's why we got these
other tests fast if it doesn't exist we
won't say no such property we're using
the F else and so this one's going to
take me a second it's any kind of lunacy
so calling the first name gives you the
last name you'll see how you check off
the first one Christine last name so
these tests the these tests are running
in the background it's as if we're
calling it here so what we're saying is
hey find out if this person exists the
very first parameter we're passing in is
always going to be the first name okay
so that's why we can hard code hey check
to see if that first name exists and so
we're saying the first name property
based on each index if it's equal to
that name we found the person we're
looking for if that name exists
but how can the first thing over here on
the checklist should return boss how did
it return boss well alright so then it
passes in the parameter that they want
to return so in their case we're
checking hey check the first name in the
second one is hey for whichever
parameter we want in this case the firt
and our example here it's likes in this
example here it's last name return that
I want the last name or I want the phone
number or I want the letter is just
asking you to see her logic works it's
not actually testing that statement
right there uh this one it's just seen
these are all tests that are running in
the background use case this would be
what it is and so so if it's saying that
if I give Christine and last name it
should return pause and you'll because
your logic works it does yes
so you're we're writing our code in such
a fashion that based off our if
statements our else statements and our
for loop it's going to return all that
right now it doesn't work for this one
which in this case Bob number since
there is no Bob here see there's no Bob
first-name it's it's not returning no
such contact it's just not returning
anything now one thing we could do is
put a return statement here that says no
so the reason we will put it here is
because there will only be one return
statement in a function that once you
hit a return statement you're done so if
we're gonna hit this for loop first
right because there you go top to bottom
so if first it's going to check if the
name exists so if it never finds a name
that exists so once it goes through the
for loop yeah once once it doesn't ever
return anything in the for loop with
which is in its own
SCOR scope let's go
yeah the within its scope here the code
that's running in the for loop if it
doesn't ever hit this return or that
return this first statement is hey we
found the first name and we found the
property value return that property
value the the second one is okay we
found the first name but that property
doesn't exist so return no such property
and the third one we're doing right now
is hey that guy doesn't exist return no
such contact so that's why your buddy
yes
it was exhausting coding so we're
putting it all together there based off
the requirements that we have let's zoom
in a little bit all right so now we're
going to be talking about some other
math libraries so there are certain
things that you can use such as math dot
random say you need to generate a random
number you could do that using the math
dot random library our math library and
the function would be math dot random
and what that will do is will generate a
number between 0 and 1 and then we can
multiply and all that sort of stuff to
get it to what we want it to be decimal
all the decimal is in between
indefinitely destiny's okay so um random
numbers are really useful use that all
for a lot of things so we want to
instead of it returning 0 um say we
wanted to make a heads or tails we could
generate a random number between 0.5 and
below and 0.5 and above say we we're
making a game and we were going to auto
place pieces onto a board to start we
use it for a lot of different things
computer AI in a game stuff like that so
here if we wanted to generate a random
number we could do math dot random and
this would return a number as a decimal
between 0 and 1 I believe if we probably
opened up the console it'd probably have
some examples in there
maybe they don't but that would return a
random number between zero and one well
dive into that a little bit but let's
say we wanted to return a but that
decimal is going to be long it's going
to be like point three two four five six
seven eight
absolutely right but say we wanted a
whole number right because those
decimals may not work for us and what
we're trying to do so instead we can
return a whole number which in this case
uh their example here math dot random
times twenty would return that long
decimal but times twenty so I'd be
between potentially between zero and
twenty now the problem with that is
sometimes you just want a number between
whole numbers so what we can do instead
is use this Mac dot floor library to
contain it well that does is it brings
it down to the the whole number level so
it's going to get rid of all the other
decimal places but also keep in mind
that sometimes you with math a flourish
maybe you want to decimal places and you
could pass that in for that as well but
for right now let's not not worry about
that so if we wanted to have the number
if we wanted to go between zero and nine
how would we what would we do format
thought random
we'll remember is between math dot
random January senior we're going to
zero and once the first thing we do
let's multiply it by ten to get a number
between zero and nine so if you multiply
depending on where it's at if it's point
five times ten is going to be five to
generate a number between zero and nine
using the math library so the math
library is just more JavaScript stuff
that's pre built into the language for
you to use and so far math dot random
generates a number between 0 &amp;amp; 1 with
various decimal places and if we wanted
to instead of go 0 to 1 we wanted to go
1 to 10 we would multiply 0 to 0 to 9
we're multiply it by 10 the reason is 0
to 9 is because we're going to call
math.floor and it's going to drop off
the rest of those numbers so even if
it's zero point 1 1 it's going to be 0
once we calm at the floor because it's
going to drop it off at the decimal
place and then we're only going to have
whole numbers so math uh flirt drops off
the decimals map dot random generates a
number from 0 to 1 and then we just
multiply to get it to the numbers that
we want
what's going on aim high so um let's see
what else we got on here so it's a
general random number between zero and a
given number like we did before let's
generate a random number that falls
within a range of two specific numbers
so you can do that as well so we've been
talking about generating between 0 &amp;amp; 9
10 different numbers are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9 now we're going to say hey maybe we
want a number between 5 and 10 we can do
that as well so we're going create a
function called random range and you can
see how we do this right here we're
going to insert a returning 0 we're
going to generate our random number or
first we want it to be a whole number so
we'll do math off floor we know
everything's going to be called within
that function math dot random because we
want it to be random good and math dot
random generates a number between 0 &amp;amp; 1
5 and 15 so I'm at so the first thing we
want to do okay so you're giving it so
you can give the values of where the
numbers need to start exactly so in the
way that we do that is it's going to be
our max number minus our min number plus
1 and then finally we're going to add
our mid number on the end this is just a
standard function if we were to work
this out if you actually wrote out the
math to find this let's just think about
this for a second so let's say our max
is 15 and we minus the min so that's 10
and then we add 1 that's 11 to make the
math work basically
whoops I forgot a bracket here so my bag
is alright so we're taking our max and
our man and we're this is basically our
x number to build the range that we want
that's our x 10 so if you were if you
want a number between 5 and 15 if you
take the max 15 minus 5 is 10 add 1
that's 11 and so 11 times zero to 1 it's
going to return somewhere between 0 and
11 right yeah so what you'd instead you
get that number then you add 4 to it so
it's always going to be the minimum
value
that makes sense and then you get the
range that you're trying if you if you
draw it out a little bit it'll make a
little bit more sense what did I do here
my max my min yeah
sometimes have that thing doesn't work
too well I have to go back in and figure
it out yeah speaking of which of things
not working too well did my night bot
ever go off see here I activated this
night bot
I thought I did
my thoughts like I automated bot this
supposed to be spam in my chat messages
every 20 minutes let's see here
oops I didn't mean to go
trying to find out click join channel
buddy you're not Bateman sorry I'm
trying to drink more water and the goal
is to drink again I don't think that
 yeah I hate drinking water
Reb bought has slain the knife thought
so free code can't video just said it'll
be using mdn a lot is this true I don't
know excuse me
should be a dark night but all right
cool I think we got it set up we should
get our boy night bought in here pretty
soon
all right enough of that mdn is mozilla
and if you typed in mdn you'd see right
now it's JavaScript documentation
Mozilla developer Network it's kind of a
more developer version of w3 schools a
lot of people are just getting started
don't find it as intuitive that's really
it
Kaufmann and cop max is not define
is it talking about
you just have to refresh it because you
mess up the first time you could be
let's see
there we go yeah just a little bit yeah
as far as that let's everything looks in
as far as I could understand but I can't
imagine anything else being wrong in
there so sometimes you may as you say
your so you want to turn a string seven
into a number seven you can do that with
the parson function this is another
thing that you can do in JavaScript
using percent and there's a variety of
reasons yes so um sounds like they
charge a Bix parsley and mint together
person instance your integer par stands
for parsing a stream parsley a minute no
all right all right
so say with the area so int is short for
integer okay and parse is going through
a string and and going going through it
like parsing I guess it's for the part
special okay all right so let's continue
on so use parson and converted string so
it converts to string into an integer
and returns it night thought yeah so
what we want to do is a return statement
that parses it into an int and so we
have the string 56 and what we what we
wanted to return is in number 56 so we
just have to parse it into an integer
so the par sent blah blah blah parts of
string returns entering its second areas
for the radix was just as based on
restraining device manager between 2 and
36
this is just um there's just thing
called binary you don't really need to
know it I'm asked to choose some people
tell you I'm wrong but that's the truth
is you sorry you don't really need to
know it so we're just gonna do this real
quick turn bars and coffee and apples
and what keeps you alert when cutting is
that the secret huh it is actually
that's funny that you should say that my
friends in high school and I was having
a hard time studying
he gave me an apple it was like here
this will help you focus so I was
literally drinking coffee and like how
did Apple my hand and like studying and
like typing with any other hand he said
is the chewing factor that like helped
because I I just the tangible Apple and
you can see I get it so I'm gonna give
you a quick rundown a binary binary is
an outdated thing that like the ones and
zeros or binary and so if we wanted to
break by using the matrix ice little
ones ins that pill or blue pill that's
what you're saying so the ones and zeros
are binary and you can parse a binary
value by passing in the value that
you're checking that's what you're
writing like a I would use it then cuz
one day I use a lot more binary code I
don't know I've not written AI all right
so then you pass them this too and it
will parse it into the ant that it
represents mm-hmm absolutely really
after no parse is a binary number into
an integer all right all right so now
we're going to learn condition the
ternary operator which should you do a
binary into like instead of an integer
what does integer integers it's a whole
number okay and that's it that's all I
can
into a can turn it into a string not
what percent no interesting so now we're
going to talk about a ternary statement
which is another way of writing an
if-else statement shorthand so I'm teri
ternary states statements are pretty
true it's it's a simple if-else
statement if it true or false if there's
always a true or there's always a false
and that's it that's that's where you
would use the ternary so the way that we
set it up is like this where scotoma in
the conditional operator we want to
write here what do we want to check if
they're equal so we're going to return
is a equal this is our statement this is
like what you would put in there to
check
so is a exactly equal to B if true this
is saying if true what we want to return
is what function it return true and then
else false this is a if else statement
with the return in our case so we're
saying this is our statement saying hey
is this true all right compare this if
the answer if this is a true statement
return this value or return that value
and it doesn't have to be true or false
it's just this represents the true
statement it is represents the false
statement
I thought Python was old Python is not I
think thinking maybe a PHP um but uh
she's not bored incredibly gay she was
studying before we even did this thank
you very much um scale uh you should
hear a Dylan scales he's like on a scale
of ten to ten I like as a rhetorical
that should um alright so in previous
challenge you use a single conditional
operator you also chain them together to
check for multiple conditions selling
you can also that was a simple ternary
now we're doing multiple condition
ternary search by the way I haven't done
before so I'm pretty excited to to see
how this is all going to work so we're
having an if statement elsif and else so
we're going to write this as a ternary
operator ternary mmm for my knee turn
the thing we just did I know where you
have a statement yeah and then the
question mark is the true result and the
colon is the false result in that order
so statement true result false result
that form yes we are okay so we're gonna
have a true form
my god this is how our cat Sully tells
us he's ready to play he dragged that in
from the living room
hey kilise what's up buddy yeah I uh
don't worry buddy we're almost done is
there a way to donate without Visa or
MasterCard PayPal is a great way of
donating April on a scale of one it's
not so much that I don't you think
boredom is in the equation it's more
like what the is going on all right
so here we are going to return if a
number is zero all right so we want to
return check if the number is positive
negative zero so if a number so we're
going to take our number or say look
this is our statement if the number is
greater than where's the F zero this is
our this is our statement this we're
writing as a ternary so if it's greater
than zero so you don't need to put in no
this is a different way of writing it
the shorthand way this is the legit way
that the kids would say so if the number
is greater than zero what we want it's
positive right so I'll surely return
positive so in here the result would be
positive
constitutive however if we wanted to
change so that's one result now we want
to change it together so now we're
saying if false and we have us another
statement here a is equal equal to zero
the answer if that's a true statement
excuse me if number is equal to equal to
zero we want to return zero else so
remember this is our else and because we
add a statement it's an else if net and
then we're saying if that else if is
true returns zero else we want to return
the value negative all right so what we
did right here was write an if statement
with an else F and an else in one line
so we're saying if you start breaking it
down piece by piece it becomes a little
bit simpler so this is a start saying
okay this is our if it's just a true
statement and then we set an answer for
true and false sorry say if that's
positive if that's true return positive
then we're saying for our false
statement so remember our if statement
fails so we move on to the elsif so for
our false statement we say alright
that's false so we move on I was like Oh
number is equal equal to zero is that a
true or false statement if it's true we
return zero if it's false we return
negative is a triple equals
is the strictly equals operator so we're
checking value and type and we finish
very now we get to move on that was all
es5 which is the old and now we're
moving on to es6 which is the new
but I would encourage you for simple if
statements to write things as ternary
operators when people look at your code
will be much more impressive if you put
symbols
um but I think that's a good place to
start so so we finish that up
yeah with answer questions for a little
bit but well I was doing that for
suckers
hey stinker got you belly
here come out to source
okay so thank you again two-bit code you
donated $5 for our 4k goal here I think
we're close to like $90 I know it says
60 there but we're local so they're not
um are we working on the beta or free
code camp regular I am having her in our
own time because mind you she's redoing
everything that I'm going on here she's
doing the regular free code camp and I
am doing the beta because there's more
stuff on here for her to learn and we're
covering more topics um so I I know that
you're still just getting started with
JavaScript and so what it went from us
finishing the JavaScript course together
what are your takeaways so far like what
it what is it what's on your mind
it's reading I'd say yeah so it is a
difference that wall I've been talking
well it's it's a different way of
thinking right like you have to kind of
reprogram how you see things and you
have to break it down into individual
it's almost like um solving aim I'm not
even I'm not even thinking about like
how everything's being used I'm just
trying to remember what the I need
to use for what it is that I need cuz
like I don't have any libraries
memorized in my head like how you're
just calling out counsel a log but that
that you like you know all those things
to use for the functions that you need I
don't I have to go back and even if I
like vaguely remember it I can't recall
like some of them are pretty similar in
my head cuz I don't have them completely
defined so that's like the whole reason
why I want to make but flashcards is
because that'll help me build the
library in my head that I need to call
on those when I need to start coding for
you know what they ask you or whatever
it is I need for the website that I'm
you know making at the time so I mean as
of right now nothing really seems hard
nothing I don't have any expectations of
its of it because of because of that so
and then once I do get that once I do
have letters everything to call on then
I'm gonna be like what happens next like
what am i what's gonna be my hurdle at
that point so yeah so it's it's gonna be
done any code Academy courses yes I
actually started on code Academy and
Dillon suggested that I switch over to
free code camp and so I have been but I
I actually go back to code Academy and
look at some of the stuff I've done so
that I can really do it on free code
camp because I'll be like I forgot
but I know I did this here so I'll go
back so um do you like learning how to
think like a dev know if it's hard think
of your life as you go through your day
as an if-else statement actually it's
funny that you should say that rav4 404
because I dream that I literally am
dreaming of statements like in my head
I'll be going through like my dreams are
like really weird so I was like in a
Jeep and then all of a sudden I had to
use the restroom so I was using if it
take needs to get from the Jeep in the
big desert that I was in to the bathroom
at my house that I was just like I don't
know how this is gonna work but my brain
figured it out so I have faith that my
brain knows what's going on and I'm just
catching up I'm I'm excited for April
once she finishes the portfolio section
to jump in to the basic algorithms
because that will be the the biggest
challenge for her because then she's
actually going to have to put it all
together on her own so I'm pretty
excited about that and that I won't be
helping with all answer questions I'll
give hints and things like that but I
don't think we'll be going through that
I think more so what may
happens you'll be presenting your
solutions yeah so um Bazaar the
audiobook I've actually thought about
that um but I just got less monkey you
just got me a book of like a hardcover
book so we bought that so I'm going to
go through that and I think in the
future on my own and studying and stuff
I probably will be listening to a lot of
audiobooks about lots of coding because
I I take in learning in all areas like
I'm pretty cool
amongst like everyone has you know their
major way of learning like hands-on or
listening or looking you know everyone
has it I actually took a test in my in
my college they have you take that test
and I got super lucky and all of them I
need all of them to learn at the same
capacity that someone can use just one
way so I get the joy of doing every
little bit of everything to get that
100% I got it type thing so uh
audiobooks are definitely on the list to
get do you like learning um to just
fulfill that question do I like my huh
I don't like it probably just because
it's different from what I'm used to and
that's usually following my gut I'm I
like to follow my gut Dylan doesn't like
followings guy he likes following logic
so I'm learning how to follow logic and
I'm not happy about it because it took
me so long to follow my gut so now I'm
hurting away from that so we'll see how
I feel about that later on
I haven't instructed her to use solo
learn yet but uh what is the woman it's
another coding site that you can
actually do on your phone but it's kind
of like quiz oriented and you can like
drag and drop things together I'm not
like that check it out yeah check check
it out then I used to teach myself in
elementary school on like spelling and
all the basic algebra functions and
stuff so I used to write
code to develop tests for myself
that would be randomized and it sounds
kind of like like that and but it was as
a child anyways it was really useful so
maybe it'll be useful once again whoo
there's university classes that's cool
that's good to know yeah so in college I
would actually watch other college
professors lectures on the same subject
that that I was going to saw like if I
went to an English Lit class I would
record my professor watch re-watch that
lecture and then I would watch either
like a Yale or a brown or someone else's
lecture on the same subject
I would watch so many lectures I loved
lectures I learned from lectures
especially if it's like a good lecture
and they apply real world like
techniques and they can explain out it's
it's a it's cool when you find a good
lecture because a good lecture will
really cover the basis and a simplicity
of being able to understand something
new so that's cool I'll probably start
looking into those too but I just want
to focus on our videos so that I can get
through and start applying it and all
that jazz what's that so the solo learn
is more syntax oriented and what I want
to do is get you through the syntax part
as quick as possible and have you move
into building things and solving
algorithms because that's going to be I
feel like I should spend more time in
the syntax and not like breeze through
it because how I suppose build anything
if I don't have anything to build from
that's what the algorithms are for in
terms of JavaScript so they're going to
start you off basic and you're gonna
have a ton of questions and I'm happy to
help and give you hints and stuff I'm
and basically to remind you that the
syntax of this is what's gonna happen
yeah that's how I'm going to help you
you're saying well how do I check
everyone I would say well before loosen
how do you like that you know how you
sound so you just did it okay cuz you
 take that oh um but alright guys
I appreciate you being here for our our
tutoring this is only day 12 we got 88
more of these baby and we're done with
Java so well JavaScript JavaScript and
so we did the free code camp JavaScript
course now the natural the natural thing
for you to go to is to jump into the
algorithms so if you get kind of bored
on your portfolio and you want to
challenge yourself jump into the very
first soccer I'm doing in order they get
harder as it go okay so start like an
algorithm is a project so an algorithm
let's let me show you real quick uh sign
own and algorithm is but is it like a
project that you're referring to or like
applying it to my profile it's kind no
it's no it's it's computer logic is
you're you're gonna River remember those
like big things we were doing isn't one
of those so like right here what they
want you to write a function that
converts Celsius to Fahrenheit oh yeah
there was one that I that one is closer
up on the on the JavaScript like I
skipped it because we hadn't hit it yet
hmm
okay so this is something that if you
want to jump back between now that we've
completed the course and continue doing
the core if you want to start jumping in
here and try and put it together I
encourage you to because this this whole
first one to give you an idea these 20
algorithms or so are was equivalent
what's going on here to basically one of
my first programming classes in college
and so they're it's not gonna be easy
but that's really what was she even do
that I don't know but it was impressive
you almost slid cuz I think such a
moisture over here um but it's lighting
comes balance dude you see his tail whip
to the side I come here buddy
come on Milo I know um but I think that
I think that'll be a very beneficial for
you um alright baby you wanna oh by the
way guys join our Facebook group co tech
and caffeine the link is in the
description as well now thanks to night
bot in the chat somewhere so uh if it's
there as well if you want support me you
can at patreon.com slash coding
tutorials 360 your money goes towards
upgrading the channel better lighting 4k
content all that great stuff let's
appreciate it I appreciate you being
here asking questions of April getting
her I I like the questions because I
think it gets her thinking in terms of
this stuff and maybe get a different
perspective sometimes she just thinks
I'm full of all the time is it's
good to occasionally have people say hey
no that's how I learned also that's
great um but uh anyhow I appreciate you
guys watching that's been verified trust
but verify yes thank you um alright baby
you wanna you wanna say goodbye okay
thanks everyone
and as always cold long and prosper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
