next project we're gonna be doing the
open weather API project in angularjs
what we're gonna go over is a we're
gonna obviously review data binding and
setting up our app and our controller if
you haven't done the tribute page I'd do
that one first as that's what the main
video what the videos main purpose is
we're also going to be using ng href
which is gonna allow us to dynamically
set the href of anchor tags we're going
to be using our first filter to change
things to uppercase by default we're
also going to be using ng source as well
as ng and knit where you can essentially
initialize a variable using angular
ng-show and ng-hide repeat which is a
crucial part of angular and you use on a
almost daily basis I I feel like but
that is those are the key concepts that
we're gonna cover this is going to be in
two parts so go ahead and check out this
first part where we get this the
foundation of it set up and the second
part where we connect some more the
logic as well style it a bit but as
always thanks for watching let's go
ahead and jump right into it alright
guys we are back in our angularjs open
weather API project we're going to be
building out some functionality now now
there's a couple things that we want to
do I think I think at this point it
might be easiest if we start cleaning up
our HTML before we start doing that so
let's go ahead and jump into there and
and get that so everything's looking
pretty solid now the way that I did this
was I use bootstrap so we're gonna go
ahead and first thing we're gonna do is
close out that Jas and we're gonna start
putting some h1s h2s all that good stuff
so let's go ahead and do that we'll have
an h1 tag here on our channel heading
so have that out well then have our h2
around our subheading it's 2 / H 2
very nice and then I believe I put a h3
yes nh3 here around our other output /
h3 so sir getting that sir seeing
everything slowly getting formatted now
what do we want to do next
well we can use a bootstrap to assign
some classes to do these and what we're
gonna do is just put much anchor tags
and we're gonna use a I don't think we
got Nita href so we're gonna use a class
is equal to VTN - LG which is just a
large button classes on BTN - primary
and then we'll go ahead and close this
/a and now you'll see right here we have
our clear sky now we're gonna go ahead
and do the same thing to everything else
now I don't worry right now that there's
two buttons for the temp and then we're
gonna do the same here what we're gonna
address that with additional
functionality later on in the video so
we're gonna do this like so
now one thing I just realized and that
in the last video I was trying to set it
up so that we got everything that we
needed but it looks like I forgot to get
the icon so let's go ahead and jump back
into our JavaScript real quick and let's
get our icon so the icon being the
little Sun icon like what's this guy
like so let's jump back into our open
weather URL and we're gonna strain go
ahead and create VM dot icon is equal to
and then this is just something I got
from the documentation but basically
it's gonna get the icon for this zero
index and we're going to truncate it
here now why are we truncating it or why
we concatenated it here like so the
reason for it is we're gonna actually
pass it into an image right now so let's
go to that first button put a little bit
of a space let me put that I am G &amp;amp; G -
SRC is equal to it's going to close that
as well and then in here we're gonna
just go ahead and pass an icon and there
we go we have our icon like so
everything's looking pretty good
so far so good so what do we want to do
next well now that we have these buttons
and they're they're kind of looking
together
let's gonna Center that real quick we're
gonna use a bootstrap class called text
centered now what we can do here we can
just go ahead and assign a class to the
body text center I should work just fine
so there we go everything centered at
this point now what do we want to do
next well let's learn a little bit about
filters and how they work if you notice
you made a small thing is I have this
all in caps
now we're outputting the value how do we
change that if we don't want to change
it here well we can use a filter now you
don't have to do this but this is just a
quick way of showing you some things now
let's go down to our description
we put this line in here and there's
this filter called upper case there's
filters for quite a bit but they
basically give you functionality that
you know it's pretty standard and pretty
easy to implement so you see now that
this is clear sky so that's how you use
filters if you want to look up more just
go ahead and check out the documentation
now next thing that next thing is we
want only one of these to show and then
when one of them click so let's go ahead
and jump to the first one F temp what
we're getting the way that we're gonna
make this work is we're gonna use
something called ng in it an ng-show and
ng-hide set allows us to do various
things and set variables ng in it which
we'll do right now it's gonna let us to
initialize a variable this is basically
the equivalent of saying ten Val a
variable 10 Val is equal to true that's
what we're doing right here it's the
same things that we're doing it using
angular now what we're gonna use next
there's something called ng - show now
when this returns a true value such as
10th Val it's going to show that it's
going to show the anything that's within
here essentially it's going to show our
button now what we want to happen is for
this value to change what using ng click
this will essentially reset the value to
the opposite of what is so we'll just
take 10 Val is equal to not 10 Val so
we're just setting our true to false so
right now we'll be able to click it once
and it should hide temp al
ng
val is true
kenji show Tim Val sorry guys just
checking my my logic here we have ng -
click 10 Val is equal to not oh I see
where our areas so make sure of course
that you set your you name your
variables correctly but now when we
click it you'll see that it's hitting ok
but that's not exactly what we want to
do so let's go ahead and do the rest of
it we're basically going to take half of
this code and assign it to our C temp
here now because we already initialized
the variable we don't need to use ng in
it instead we're just new ng show and
we're gonna set this equal to so this is
equal to not 10 Val now basically we're
setting instead of it being true we're
saying look when it's false show this
that's what's going on here and then
we're gonna set ng click to be the
opposite so it's gonna be going one than
the other one than the other one than
the other that's basically how we're
gonna make these act as buttons so we
can't just go ng click and we're gonna
set this equal to the same thing we're
gonna set whatever the value of temp al
is its equal to the opposite of temp Val
and because the ng show values are
different only one's gonna be showing at
time so let's see we're gonna click it
we're gonna show it we're going to click
it we're gonna show it clean
we're gonna show it so it's switching
the value so that's how we're able to
create this button functionality like so
but now that we have that let's go ahead
and clean this up a little bit more you
can go ahead and import a font family
make this a little bit more let's go to
name or file as well I'll do YouTube
version API weather so I can go back
this and we're just gonna go ahead and
import a font that I found that I liked
into the header now you normally put
this into the head tag so here is this
well save and close save and close now I
use something called I created a class
called dot info that we're just gonna go
ahead and assign to right here so just
call it info now we're going to jump
into our CSS and we're gonna assign a
font family to the info class so this is
going a font - family allows you to
assign a font and our font in this case
is going to be Monts so that so
everything should import this like so so
there's a nice big bold font as I wanted
now the next thing that we're gonna want
to do is add a little bit of margin to
our buttons these are all a little bit
too close for my liking so we're just
going to target that BTN - LG class that
we are using for our button so we're
sitting margin we'll just put 5 pixels
px you'll see adds a little bit of
spacing cool
we're almost there at this point the
last thing that we really need to do is
to use something that's gonna set the
background based off of what we're doing
the way that we do that you switches
with a switch statement let me go ahead
and pull up my notes real quick so I can
show you now you're gonna need about 8
backgrounds for how I do this so feel
free to use the backgrounds I have if
you're looking for a place to get
backgrounds I use unsplash.com
I'm not affiliated or sponsored by them
although I wish I would be because I do
promote them in almost every one of
these studios but they have tons of
videos especially for whether you type
in the word cloud you get hundreds so
they're all high-quality and they're all
free to use so you can use them in your
projects as well check it out that's
where all my images came from now how
are we going to set the background we're
gonna use VM excuse me we're gonna use
the switch statement on our VM
description remember this clear sky this
changes based on the condition of the
sky and that's how we're gonna do it and
there's about nine of them so let's go
ahead and I wanna make sure I'm within
the I need to be here this is there
we'll do it right below here close this
up a little bit
close this up so what we're gonna do is
essentially set the background for
something down the road first thing that
we're gonna do is start our switch
statement and remember this is going to
be checking for VM dot description which
we have already defined now what we're
going to do next is create a case that's
gonna check to see if that's the
description so our case here like we
know right now is clear sky and within
here we're gonna then go ahead and set
the background using something called ng
style but first let's go ahead and
define our background print we're
basically in define our right now we're
defining our CSS that's what we're doing
we're gonna set properties for the CSS
they're values and then we're gonna pass
those in using ng style so let's go
ahead and create something called V m
dot weather background this is just
gonna be a store the properties and
we're gonna set this equal to don't
forget this and don't forget your break
statement in each one of these cases as
well we're gonna create we're gonna set
the background property and then we're
gonna set this equal to R the value that
we want it so background and then this
is just two RL and then we're gonna pass
in our URL like so and our example here
it's a clear sky one so you're gonna
need to put single quotes within the
double quotes and then we're also going
to set the background - size parameter
so let's go ahead and do that as well
and this is gonna be with the value of
cover okay now that we have one example
you'll notice that nothing has changed
yet in our background it's because we
haven't used it yet
what we're gonna do is jump back over to
our HTML and we're gonna instantiate
into the body here the ng - style so
that whether object that we just created
ng style is going to read it as CSS and
it's gonna set it for us so we have
whether put their background and now
you'll see that we have our our
background cool so how are we going to
set it up so that multiple multiple
things are changing well we just have to
repeat what we did right now we have it
set up so that clear skies explain
there's one we're gonna go ahead and
I'll copy one more of these in and then
I'll put the rest in as well so what we
want to actually set that's going to be
different than each one of these cases
is a default but it's usually good to
have a default so you'll see right here
just gonna go ahead and put default this
is basically what happens when none of
the values to this the reason that we're
setting this is in case the they change
the API at least we'll have a default
image going and it just won't break so
we're going to weather background and
then what same thing same exact
properties except one slightly different
so we're just gonna set that and then oh
what did I do
oh one too many one too many
and then we're gonna have a break a
break statement this is going to
essentially if we change this so right
now it's reading our clear sky
description now say for whatever reason
clear sky we change it to clear sky one
which would break it it's going to then
go ahead and reset the value like so to
our default one and this this is
important in case anything breaks it's
the coolest reset that now at this time
we're going to I'm going to copy and
paste the rest of these in here and I'll
just make a minor note about what they
are and what they're supposed to do and
by the looks of it I have duplicate
alright so we did clear sky so case
broken clouds few clouds mist rain
scattered clouds shower and snow and
thunderstorm cool so I'm gonna copy this
over put that in between default is
always going to be your last one now
what I copied and pasted it over is
basically just all the other
descriptions of the icons
it goes from there's about eight there's
clear sky broken clear descriptions
broken clouds few clouds mist and then
this duplicate mist
let's go and get rid of that and then we
have rain scattered clouds shower rain
snow thunderstorm and then our default
this is going to set the background to
each one of these based off what the
description is or what the sky looks
like so we'll have our backgrounds
floating in and out and that's pretty
much it we can also assign a our URL
value here we're gonna use ng SRC for
that so let's go ahead and do ever was
this channel info 72 name so we're going
to do a href is equal to
info dot subheading reading to dot link
and then we'll go ahead and close this
bad boy yeah /a this needs to be in G -
as RC r ng - H ref and then this is
actually in the wrong spot as well so
let's go ahead and control X s throw it
outside the h3 and take this oops sorry
guys a little bit sloppy here relax some
reason that's affecting our thing like
so let's take another look at this later
well it's working just fine but for some
reason it's affecting our our code I
think perhaps I might have a little bit
of a bug here somewhere
let's go ahead and put this on the
inside and see if that fixes what's
going on so very interesting stuff going
on right now oh I see here we are
so I forgot to close the tack there we
go alright so now we'll have this and of
course if you want it to open up to
another page we can go ahead and just at
target is equal to blank and in your
example it probably be to your portfolio
page go here you see I'll go to my
channel definitely subscribe like and
share if you want to join the coding
community we're almost at 10 K so that's
exciting by the time this video comes
that will be a 10k alright but that's
pretty much it guys this is how to do it
in angularjs it's pretty straightforward
we have our various projects you click
the buttons the background resets we
you we showed how to use a filter we
show now ng-show works and Janet
ng-click
we also showed how to use HTTP GET how
to create objects and how to link
objects and how to use JSON so now to
use the open weather API and how to use
the API location one but I hope you guys
found this helpful
thank you for all the support don't
forget to Like subscribe and share and
