tea here some unsweetened tea um really
for those of you who are new to the
channel what I like to do is every
thousand subscriber special do a every
thousand subscribers which is about
every two and a half three weeks we go
and we answer scrubber questions anyway
try and give you some feedback so mentor
II whatever it is that you need you want
to know my opinion about something when
you talk about anime if you want it
doesn't really I don't really care what
we talked about but usually it I try to
give you an outlet to pick my brain and
that's what these it's it's a
combination of saying hey to the
thousand of you that are new to the
channel thank you and to the you know
those of you who have been here the
first 18,000 thank you as well so we're
having our we're about five or 10 away
but I had some time to do this today so
we're gonna take an hour or so and
answer any questions and and you know
pat ourselves on the back a little bit
about a long row you know nineteen
thousand subscribers isn't a lot to some
people it's a lot to me is so literature
the ACL real quick is already bring it
up
uh James I did get your email um I
haven't had a chance to respond back to
it but I'll answer you right now so
James email me I've been talking about
the developer box or the coding box I'm
not quite sure what I'm gonna call it
yet um that I'm going to be starting
think Luke crate but developer stuff
that's that's the gist of it um and he
was asking hey uh uh I like the idea is
there any way I can get involved in
terms of of uh maybe give me some resume
experience or anything like that and I'm
not quite sure yet how that would work
because I'm going to be using a
third-party platform now I have my own
site and everything but in the interest
of time I'm going to do very little to
no coding unless I need to customize the
platform at all um but James let me I
like to be able to have some subscribers
be able to help out in one way or
another with the with the site and if I
think of something I'll definitely let
you know James III I appreciate the
interest and right now I don't have
we're not far long enough to to be there
ali asghar hello hello um but I'd like
to let me let me see if I can find
something to get us there to to early on
in the process of saiga um today's video
that went out um for those who don't
know I'm trying to upload a video a day
I haven't been doing it as much um
because of what happened with my hand
which is healing nicely
it may look you can see the wrist here
uh where they took the skin it's got a
little scar and low scab but the finger
is actually healing nicely if you look
that right there and it sees a little
pink that's actually skin that wasn't
there a couple days ago so uh it's
healing um I have my follow-up visit in
about two weeks I imagine that it will
have scabbed over and everything will be
good and your boy will be at a hundred
percent not have to worry about his
finger any longer right so in a long
ordeal um
I changed shirts real quick all right
sorry about that I was burning up in
that shirt but um April and I we decided
to treat ourselves and we went to a
movie theater
matinee it's been a while we saw
guardians of the galaxy two very good
movie um but then again it's basically
every uh every Marvel movies good if you
like Marvel movies so that's kinda the
the gist of it what happened to my hand
I injured my hand opening a jar and it
ripped the skin off my finger and then I
didn't heal properly and what happened
was my blood vessel actually got damaged
and it created what's called a uh is a
very specific type of granula so instead
of hatching it it actually just started
growing outside the blood vessel so I
had to get up first I had to get surgery
on my on my finger here and the skin for
my wrists they had actually cut skin out
of my wrists here to to patch the hole
where the skin was because the granula
made it's so wide that they couldn't
stitch it together
so that's what they had to do there and
they had to go in and cut it out seal
the blood vessel and it caught it cost
quite a bit of money um yeah all in all
even with insurance it cost about $1,600
for the visits and for the surgery and
everything and the pain that went along
with it so I've been debating doing a
video about it I've talked about it
quite a bit because I do some live
streams and dived into it and there but
I've been going back and forth about
whether or not I should do a video kind
of explaining what was going on what
happened and maybe trying to add a
message to it about um about putting
yourself in a situation in life where
$1600 isn't going to make or break it's
gonna hurt but Lee a lot at least you
you know when you're making money save
money guys that's kind of what the
message would be so that you are
prepared for these things
um the average family I saw recently if
a 500 no if the $700 medical expense or
car bill came their way they wouldn't
have the money to pay for that's the
average family and that's that's if
something like 65% or 63% that's that's
troubling right so I I don't want to be
in that position I've been broke too
long and so I'm kind of almost
traumatized to a degree where I invest
and save right now 21 percent of my
income will be I'm increasing by one
percent per check and so I'm going to do
that until I can't anymore
up to 50 percent so see I just because
I've been so broke that I'm just
something like stock finally my money
investing it so that it can help make a
little bit of money and hope that uh you
know I'm financially independent one day
for various reasons but mainly just not
have the stress about being broke
so as far to part of my what motivated
me to be a developer I love to code but
I also love an industry that's growing
and salaries that have been proven to
grow and in-demand skill set which is
you know it's it's which is one of the
reasons I although I don't appreciate
art and like painting as a path I do
appreciate I do appreciate um the the
grind for those who choose to make it a
profession because it is a grind if
you're doing something creative nowadays
whether it's writing a book on paint
becoming a painter being a mute a
musician it's one of those things where
you have to not only be passionate about
it but you have to hustle to find a way
to make money with it
software is different you don't
necessarily have to be passionate about
it it's going to help if you are in any
field but in terms of making money you
know you have a salary it's something
easy if you really want to be a writer
an artist and there's some respect to
that so Sukhram a myth says hey when is
the last room with April I'm missing
every day maybe it's too late my time
for me and Sweden so we typically do it
at somewhere between 5:00 and 6:00
Eastern Standard Time so I don't know
what time that is free Sweden but to
is when we do our live streams with
Danny Bennett says first time programmer
since basic that's a we got a og in here
today good for you Danny I am interested
in designing web applications that are
the most flexible but easiest to pick up
language you can recommend so one of the
it's probably the same language that
most boot camps are teaching which is
JavaScript what you may want to look
into is the entire mean stack because
you'll need all of it to build a build a
fully functional web application a
front-end in the backend that's MEA n
also the myrn stack which you just swap
out the angular in that for react now in
terms of what that all entails the mean
stack traditionally is MongoDB with a a
mongoose package which is a node package
to help streamline things a bit and
that's a no SQL database so that's your
database the difference between a
relational database and a no SQL
database relational smores the
traditional ones it uses tables and it
relates sinks and columns and rows and a
no SQL database is more of a document
oriented database and then you have
Express so that's the M is the MongoDB
mungus Express is kind of the the
framework if you will for the backend
then you have angular which now they
have angular two three four I think
they're after for now and you can switch
out angular for react depending on your
preferences both are great things to
learn a react might be a little bit
easier and then you have node which is
the backend that works with Express and
they all work hand in hand but it's all
JavaScript you're learning more
framework so anything else and so that
would be the easiest language to pick up
for a full stack of skills because you
don't have to really learn one language
um let's see here what programs don't
use your record editing stream for your
channel so what we're streaming on right
now is just the YouTube built-in Google
hangout I do this with my interview
and my it's called an event technically
but if you want to do a live stream you
have a little bit more control I
traditionally have set these up as
events I forgot the time it so I mean to
be honest I didn't realize we were so
close to 19 Kate and I looked at it
today I thought where maybe 18.5 18.6
but we're growing pretty fast as is our
Facebook group if you haven't joined our
Facebook group code tech and caffeine
the link is in the description that's
growing as fast as my channel at almost
at this point and so it took us a little
while to get to a thousand took us like
two months to get to a thousand and I
think in two weeks we got to 1,600 from
there so we're going pretty fast and it
doesn't seem to be slowing down um but
in terms of what programs I use I use a
OBS which is the open broadcast software
to record my screen shares and then in
terms of in terms of what I edit with is
Premiere Pro although I don't do too
much editing into and what I make my
animations with are like my intros and
my outros
that's usually a combination of Premiere
Pro and Adobe After Effects and
streaming I use OBS as well OBS is a
streamers application I just used it for
screen recording um Cory said Cory
strikes us a I how's it going to love
your videos first time I caught you
laughs thanks man um I'm I hope they
help out help you out I can always
promise the quality of my videos because
I have always been learning I use coke
Adam ESA tools for me to cook add me and
free code camp as a way for me to learn
skill set and explain my thought process
as I solved them so sometimes you see me
struggling through it and I think
there's benefits to that but not
everybody enjoys that they just want you
telling the answers and I see you grind
it right through it
I'm glad you find it helpful comments so
those you don't know I have uh since the
age of 17 since the age of 17 I have
drink I'm and put it in perspective on
29 right now be
thirty in October I have drank monsters
somewhere Beach on average to some
sometimes three a day monsters since I
was about 17 uh in terms of energy
drinks and there's really not a one or
two months where I stop but I promise
April whoa
that I would stop drinking them and so
as of a week and a half ago I've stuck
by it and so you'll see me think
drinking things that are a little
healthier for me like unsweetened tea I
also have the occasional 5-hour energy
in the morning and other ways of getting
my caffeine and stuff in there try to be
healthier but I will tell you that after
the first week or so I've been having
headaches and I've been a little grumpy
if someone if somebody watched the live
stream yesterday I got a little grumpy
at April not paying attention and and if
you like people are giving me about
that I shouldn't have um but that might
have been part of it but after about
another week I should be stop having
headaches and things like that and I can
maybe cut back my caffeine a little bit
but uh I'm always trying to improve
myself and one way or the other in this
case this is a kind of a health change
because I you know I've been drinking
monsters for over a decade and energy
drinks uh daily for over a decade so
it's a nice little health change for me
I when my fingers fully healed I'll
start exercising once more um I focus so
long and getting a developer job that
I've ignored things like my health and
my body and it was time to refocus some
things in that direction while still of
course focusing on code but now I'm
coding 40 hours a week as a job so I'm
always going to be focused on code but
just a little side note about what's
going on in my life
let's see here um so what questions you
guys have thought my ask a dev series I
is when I try to depart my knowledge on
what I think would be beneficial but
sometimes I don't get I can't
sometimes there's questions that are so
part specific that I can't make a video
about it because it is so unique to your
case that's let's say people can't learn
from it but usually that's case but so
if there's a question like that and you
want to maybe elaborate in a paragraph
or so about something going on in your
life that you you would like my opinion
about I'd be happy to guide you to the
best of my ability um if not how have
you guys been enjoying the ask a dev
videos I've now officially put up 42 of
them 42 videos going over everything I
can think of today's video was a more of
a story time video talking about it's 18
minutes long so it's quite a long video
knowing your worth as a developer this
is a talks about two points in my life
when I was disrespected by someone who
is interviewing me and uh just trying to
sharing that and I enjoy doing the
videos um and I love you guys know this
but I actually go back and I watch them
to make sure that I think they're honest
and true because sometimes you say
things you don't so sometimes I'll
record these two three four times to
make sure that everything I'm explaining
is how I meant it to be said can you use
sessions with a RESTful API yes you can
um social artis you liked today's video
good I have one or two more stories like
that coming up but not too many um uh
not that was probably one of the more
profound two days of my life just
thinking back on it and really happy to
see that I succeeded where I wanted to
go even though it was hard to a degree
yeah Jordan if you're usually in
sessions with a RESTful API if you're
building one that is you may need to use
a Express Express some package called
passport and you can use OAuth sessions
like that it's what I am using for my my
the project I'm building right now or I
was billing I it this is what's crazy
I'm so close to finishing the voting
application that I know I'm gonna have
to go back and do it one more time uh
good to hear people talking about money
sometimes yeah it's a little bit about
money I don't try to dive too much into
into finances because a lot of times you
can be misconstrued as coming off um
cocky or coming off as a I don't know
greedy person and I don't try to do that
um but I do think that you should know
your worth all right and sometimes you
have to just say cold hard facts about
what it is and what what it came down to
at least said that for me and so that's
kind of why I talk about what I what I
made at the time what I was making at
the my heart started what its easiest to
learn back and our front end so front
end I actually have a video coming out
and a couple days uh Stefan mg
discussing just that uh what which one
would I learn first and why god this
vocab good man and thank you again for
buying the book for April it's supposed
to rise some day today Amazon says as I
she's going to get started with it right
away oh why why are you moving um a
couple of reasons one I signed a seven
month lease here because I actually
rented this place out before April is
down and um it's about a 25-minute drive
to work so for a place that is a ten
minute drive to work uh we are paying
$50 more a month
getting an extra bedroom and it's uh
it's only a 10-minute drive it's five
miles away from my work and on top of it
it's 30% bigger but that's why we're
moving to be closer to my work as well
as we have a slightly larger place um
that's really it that guy was me so
generous with his offers he's held me on
I would you know what man I uh I I wish
I had recorded the conversation and uh I
don't know my name is it was an inner
like even now it's been probably two
three years at this point and it's just
it's still so vivid everything about it
is a very vivid memory because they're
so weird the moment I got there
um and I say this is somebody who has
gone on several interviews that I
haven't been qualified for it's I think
that's part of it I've got a lot of
interviews and second interviews and
third interviews where they have not
wanted to hire me um or they wanted to
do contract to hire I was willing to do
that or whatever it may be and so I know
there's a good way to let a potential
candidate down in a bad way
and if he wasn't if he wasn't there
telling me how I was so unqualified I
would have assumed that I wasn't getting
an offer but it's so weird to be like
you know what you ain't uh we're
gonna make you potentially uh it's
it was a weird experience but that
that's the guy hadn't changed in two
years so contract to hire what are the
negative effects so I've talked about
this a couple times in the past and
recruiters a lot of recruiters at least
in my experience and um this has been
something that has only been happening
for eight eight nine months but I think
I think I can speak to this right now is
that recruiters a lot of times are
looking for contract to hire positions
because oftentimes the way it works not
always but often times
it works is you're actually get hired by
the by the recruiting agency and they'll
say okay well we'll buy you for this
amount of money and then we're actually
gonna once we have a placement we'll
assignment you'll sign a contract with
us and then at six months or three
months they decide if they want to keep
you and then you go and actually work
for that company that's a lot of how
that works so contract to hire has a
couple negative negative things one you
may not have a job at the end of the
contract so you sign a three-month
contract and you're three you you know
it's pitch to you that that's your
evaluation period essentially um that
you may not have a job that's a huge
negative and it's hard getting a job
right even though you have recruiters
reaching out to you guys do interviews
you got take algorithm sets you have to
find the right fit your to find it an
offer that you agree with right so if
you're in a salary position like me and
mind you I've talked about this where I
take I take recruiter calls and I answer
I answer their questions and I'm very
cordial and I tell them I'm not looking
but I'm happy to have a conversation
until you know maybe I lose my job so I
take these calls and I talk with these
people probably on a weekly basis that I
would say I have at least one phone call
on a weekly basis now as a salary
developer I it would I don't think I
would leave my job for a contract a
higher position because I I'm in a
position where I have benefits I have a
paid vacation and I have the security of
knowing that if they do let me go for
whatever reason I have unemployment if
your contract to hire there is no
unemployment a lot of times depending on
the contracts are higher if you're going
through an agency you may not have
health insurance or benefits or 401 a
you 401k and you may not have any sick
days at all zero sick days zero paid
holidays but it that depends but it
leans towards having less benefits but
the big thing is you may not get hired
and you may be unemployed in three
months and it's out that you're going to
have unemployed because remember you're
a contract position so after your six
months are up
done so that I mean that's a big thing
sorry a lot of these recruiters in my
experience are looking to do contract to
hire for these companies and i i i I
would never sign a contract that was
less than a year in a position most of
them are three to six months it's very
rare that you get a year contract to
hire and you're also by the way paying
more in taxes because you're not an
employee you're a 1099 or whatever
whatever a contract position is which
means you pay basically doubling taxes
because your employer's not paying that
part so there's a lot of financial
issues with that as well that does mean
that you can argue for a higher salary
rate as well but you may not get it so I
I'll give you an example I talked with a
company that a contract place and they
said hey we were interested there Disney
in Orlando is hiring for an angularjs
developer would you be interested we saw
your resume we think you'd be a good fit
you're a little bit on the junior end
for what they're looking for but you
never know and I said okay uh what are
the details I let's let's talk details
right um well uh you would work for us
technically for the first six months and
at the end Disney would renew your
contract for a year if they wanted to
keep you so every year I'd have to worry
about my job being renewed I said okay
um what are my benefits they're like
well you get our health insurance we pay
3/4 of it so automatically for my health
insurance I'd be taking a hit so right
now I pay $0 for medical and dental now
that's the base package I pay $0 so
assuming everything is equal every month
already I'm losing $100 uh give or take
right $50 a paycheck it could be $100 a
paycheck
I don't know it depends on how good
their insurances but we'll say $100 so
for the year I've already taken a $1,200
hit now my work currently pays I think
it's 14 PTO days and 10 payin all day so
I have 25 days a pay at the end of day
um and so I said okay what's the PTO
oh and the paid holidays they say we
don't offer any right and so it's just
one company every company every
technical recruiter company is different
so say we don't offer any I say okay so
if you said if you estimate that roughly
24 days which is five weeks of work
right we'll say 25 days run it round it
to that which is five weeks of work five
full paid days I have to get paid on top
of so I take a $1,200 hit will say that
I make $300 a day pre-tax something like
that um now I have to what does that
come out to 1500 for five days times
five so that's six thousand dollar hit
right there um so now we're down seventy
two hundred dollars of which we just
have to get that in terms of a salary
increase and we're just talking numbers
right general generalized numbers right
now we're not um but this is this is a
situation I've had this conversation
with the recruiter and so I need 70 to
200 dollars to break even but we just
talked about taxes about paying twice
the amount of taxes because your
contract now and because your contract
your employer is not paying that part of
your taxes so you're paying twice the
amount of taxes so we'll double that
will say that seventy two hundred is now
setting two hundred so now so we'll say
about $14,000 hit right now if we were
to go in at the same amount so in order
for me to break even I need a fourteen
thousand dollar raise and on top of that
I want more money because I'm now
contract out in six months I may have to
look for a job and be unemployed so I
need let's say fifteen thousand dollars
on top of that and because I I'm paying
I I want I want to make a premium as a
contract employee and you should because
you're not a salaried employee you
should be paid a premium because there's
no job security at the end of it um at
least insurance unemployment so now in
order for me to feel comfortable I need
not only the 14,000 to make up the lost
income in terms of real income right
I need the 15,000 on top of that or the
tent will say
thousand on top of that just because in
six months I may not have a job so a
contract to hire is its and by the way
that's different with every company
again with the benefits and what they
offer some companies uh some companies
will pay for your health insurance the
some ponies will pay for you know it
just depends on the technical recruiting
agency but in this specific instance I
need to ask for $25,000 more as a
developer moving to a contract position
even though it was for a great company
like Disney in a nice city in Orlando
which doesn't include any relocation or
anything like that in this case um but
but would that be so so we talked about
the cons of contract to hire and uh
thank you for bringing that up because
I'm gonna I'm gonna actually make a
video basically saying when I said there
talked about the pros and the cons pros
and cons of contract to hire cool um
well the easiest and best act to learn
in my opinion is the mean stack if
you're talking about web development so
I went on for a second so ended Django
first Ruby on Rails I would say Django
because I a python-based right and
Python is a little bit more in and on
the incline while Ruby on Rails is
either stagnant or kind of on the
decline pending on what stats you look
at but generally speaking Ruby on Rails
is is easier brennon seems easy at first
but then I have to deal with package
management browser compatibility and so
on I feel discouraged don't worry about
it man um I feel discouraged all the
time and I'm a professional which feels
kind of weird to say right uh I am a
professional in his part part of part of
you becoming developers accepting your
limitations and saying okay this is
where I'm bad now let me spend time to
become good at it um one thing that I'm
trying to get better at is CSS you say
damn Dylan you're a salary developer and
you have CSS issues yes I do because I
focus a lot on JavaScript and not so
much on
Eiling so I'm trying to get better I
became dependent on on you know angular
material and bootstrap and things like
that
only one of my advanced algorithm
projects work hmm my calculators edition
doesn't work I'd have to check it
through but they all worked when I was
doing it uh it's been a while since I've
touched those so I have to look at it
again to see if if I need to do an
update to those I don't have any plans
to you if I do
I probably redo it in angular something
different and I'll catch any issues I
have there but also the point of the
projects aren't really for you to copy
it so much as we explain my logic and
based off that logic you should be able
to if I have something that's breaking
you should be able to have the skill to
fix it on your end at this point because
you've seen the logic to get everything
to work and how I do things
so hopefully you can use that to to at
least guide you to the correct solution
so uh if I am to be a mean stack
developer I despise face tree as do i as
do I um should I continue learning mean
and wait for a job opening or a swap
mean for PHP uh if you can't relocate
you might want to just learn both um
that would be my advice start uh instead
start building and what would be a good
example is building uh JJ ehh no worries
man it's all good
um my uh my advice is build your full
stack of mean application and then copy
the front end and build it build the
same functionality in PHP so you can
kind of uh you can kind of understand um
you kind of understand the thought
process of your node in your express
application and then r.e.m you late that
in it's in PHP which is something I
think is a great way of going about it
because when you're learning a framework
or you're learning a language like
jQuery and that's why I built it that's
why when I wanted to learn angular I
rebuilt some free code camp projects in
angular because I already kind of had
the the basic logic figured out and I
needed to emulate that in angular and it
it makes a learning curve a little bit
less is there such a thing we'll say let
me let me sit down here is there such a
thing as going too fast and free code
camp I really want to find the right
case I work 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. 5 days a
week and trying to figure out the best
sleep schedule while learning full-time
um I don't think there's anything wrong
with going fast if you're actually
learning um and when you finish free
code there's so much to do in free code
camp you have the front end you have the
back end and when the beta comes out you
can jump over to the beta right now and
check that out if you actually finish
everything up but there has not been one
person who has actually completed all
the curriculum that means all the part
time projects with us with we got with
uh with the nonprofit projects and stuff
like that so I think you probably have
plenty to do but if you're just talking
about finishing the front end um no man
I think you should power through the bit
to the best of your ability and from
there just continue making your own
stuff and learning it and doing what you
can
Russ Wilkie I hope you you're the first
one man I hope you all are I'm working
towards it man I work on free code camp
stuff almost every day except the last
few weeks but yeah man I'll be there
with you
attempting the impossible uh but uh yeah
the thing is I learned best with the
lecture it's like April and that's why
I'm loving the series Daniel :
hello Daniel : jello ass
does anybody know some good PHP
resources never touched it before I'm
going in for a second interview next
week and of course there used to be a
tree my advice is check out code course
is a YouTube channel he's been doing PHP
for eight years if you go to code course
comm he actually has his own courses and
he has hundreds of like two three-hour
courses going over PHP and a bunch of
other stuff uh I would I would imagine
that he has a lot going on there yeah
you know it so what's really funny about
this is um is I have been coding for so
long though it feels like that to a
degree I'm learn I'm losing things that
I have accepted as fact and how like
stuff works in code
it's so strange - it is so strange to
see uh somebody who's just getting
started like April ask questions that
wouldn't even occur to me in my brain
right and so like like how did you get
to that question and you get to see some
of those moments when we do these
tutoring sessions because like I don't
even know sometimes how how she gets
there mentally that's not saying that
she's dumb or bad or you think it but
it's just so crazy because I feel like
I've been doing this so long now that
maybe I've lost some perspective about
where when people get started how they
can get going I guess and like how you
have to build those sort of fundamental
building blocks in your brain of like
for loops and things like that like it
makes s mean it goes once and then goes
again until it doesn't go right they
like what the you talking about um
do I to tur yes I do
uh if we were to go to my website
although I've been doing a lot more
mentoring and tutoring lately uh but a
lot of people want to have like
one-on-one sessions and stuff like that
but if you go to my website here
tutorials 360 calm / tutor this is the
first website ever built in angular I'm
pretty happy with it but um I charge $75
a session which is about about an hour
so we talk about whatever you want some
people just want me to work through free
code camp with them or code CAD me or
anything else like that and so people
just want some mentoring where they want
to ask their questions about boot camps
or or how to prepare whatever it is uh
but that's what you are choice
eighty-five dollars for an hour for the
tutoring how do I accept the NASA HP FCC
program challenge what is that
a 15,000 prize you can speed up its
simulation code alright what book did
April get um one goblets monkey donated
for her to get a new way to learn
JavaScript or something like that uh it
hasn't arrived yet I'd have to check the
Amazon Amazon make sure have I learn
anything about data structures and
algorithms like merge sort some binary
searches a long time ago when your boy
was in school I learned that stuff uh I
don't I don't think I have any of it
retained so I'd have to relearn it which
would probably be something I would
start studying about a month out if I
was looking for a different job just
because there are a lot of those
algorithm tests that are tragic but part
of the process sometimes a jjjj HHH says
what do you think about well what do you
think if I take an offer a startup ting
you paid minimum wage just get my foot
in the door just finish the free code
camp front answer I think there's
nothing wrong with it if you can afford
that but my suggestion is take it get
that resume experience and the whole
literally from week one that you're
there apply like elsewhere
apply elsewhere and get a job that pays
you better that that's my advice unless
you're getting equity at the company
that's a little bit different but in
terms of getting that resume experience
great idea um that will really help your
career out but you could probably do
better to be honest with you um but if I
were in your situation where I could
afford to take minimum wage and I just
wanted a developer position to get the
resume experience um I would do it and
then the whole time from week one I
would be applying elsewhere I'd be
talking to recruiters I'd be doing the
whole thing and they'd ask you why
you're looking elsewhere just
being paid minimum wage I just wanted to
get the resume experience just be honest
about it
you have to speed up the code by factor
of 10 to 100 in the NASA challenge 10 to
100 seems like a bit but to put it in
perspective jjh I'll call you gage um I
didn't finish the front end certificate
before I got hired I get paid five times
as much as minimum wage I don't know
what I get paid something around there
somewhere between four and six times as
as much as minimum wage um so are there
certain project types you favor when it
comes to coding right now just full
stack applications I like Bill I want to
build as many full stack apps as I can
um just because I that's the skillset I
want to work on I always feel like
building stuff in the skill set I want
to work on call me whatever you want
darling are um but uh JH what uh to give
you what I told April bad around thirty
forty days in once she starts doing
things in JavaScript and she has a
couple things built to go and see if she
can even get an unpaid internship or a
minimum-wage internship at a web design
place to shark any resume experience of
going in that same direction so
um you know it just depends on the
financial situation you're in as well as
like a lot of might what I don't want to
happen for you is to accept the job
make minimum wage and then be there for
a year from day one
your fill out apps every day after work
you're building your skillset and after
maybe three months you get you finally
land a job that pays you a respectable
wage if it doesn't have it three months
live my six months but you like just you
continue working and the whole time
you're gaining resume experience you're
building your skills you're getting
better and you're going to triple
quadruple your your income by doing that
uh any tips on getting a programmers
mindset for a non programmer that what's
to be that wants to become a full stack
developer um the main thing is just code
everyday start doing um start
visualizing things find groups become
part of the community start meeting
people who code start pair program you
just got dive all in every day a code
though that and that's why when I'm
teaching April to code and she's coding
on her own it's a hundred days a hundred
days of coding everyday we're at day
twelve today and let me tell you I'm
getting tired she's getting tired but
once you kind of get to day thirty it's
already part of your life and you just
continue living like that's it so you
just got power through you got code
daily and you have to have an idea of
what you want to do and start applying
for jobs early on you'll learn a lot
just going by interviews you'll learn a
lot just by just by building projects
and continue on man that so just power
power through code daily and really
start to try and make it a part of your
life rather than like a task I guess um
you know watch videos daily on it read
articles maybe start listen podcast is
that's your thing you know watch
channels like the videos I put out like
today how to know your words as a
developer put it part of that part of me
putting a video out every day is me to
reflect upon things that I've learned in
my life and share them with you and
start thinking someone asked about
contract hire we had a great discussion
about contract to hire early and so you
know you once you get in that sort of
daily um daily routine you know any that
could be in a variety of ways that could
be going to meetups every Wednesday and
joining a free code camp meetup that
could be going to hackathons that could
be watching coding videos on YouTube and
that could be actually coding right and
so you just have to dive full in and
start picking up little pieces here or
there um but mainly the main thing is
just a code like a lot of people think
there's a
secret there's not a secret code that's
it code all the time and code everyday
um and enjoy it right so like I'll give
you an example of one thing that I do
that helps me enjoy coding and that's
YouTube right YouTube in my case I
thoroughly enjoy YouTube and it it
reminds me that I'm a developer I need a
code I need to get better and find a way
to enjoy it um in terms of YouTube I'm
at the point now that I don't think it
does too much for my career as a
developer because I'm already hired the
point of me starting my channel was to
go from not unemployed to employed I am
now employed so the way I have fun with
is like yeah I could go and have like
these great thumbnails but instead I
just put a picture of me having my
surgery like this and I have fun with it
add some personality and I enjoy that
sort of stuff it's just a small way that
I can enjoy it and still get better as a
developer because like you learn a lot
about yourself thinking back about the
past and things like that but that
that's unique to me right that's unique
to how I I enjoy being a developer and
things like that um let's see if you
can't afford shared web hosting and a
domain when you say it's acceptable to
your website on a free service when
employers take it seriously I think they
would uh but you could probably buy URL
for a dollar on GoDaddy with a coupon
and then you could that's what I bought
mine for I think there's a dollar for
the first year and then it's like four
or seven dollars a month so you can
afford it I have no doubt you know it's
costing you eight dollars a month to
host your own website it's not a bad
idea and also it gives you a lot more um
gives you a better way of showing your
portfolio they having to link to code
pins and things like that if needed
it's starting as a web designer a good
move or will people let label you as a
web designer forever see it's not a bad
idea but you have to why you're working
as a web designer at work come home and
be a web developer you need to be
learning JavaScript you need to be
learning jQuery you need to be learning
angular you need to be learning react
and then once you have some of those and
while you're learning them you need to
be learning the backend and then why you
once you once you kind of have a good
JavaScript foundation before you even
learn the back game you're applying for
jobs because you have resume experience
that's relevant it's not perfect but
it's relevant and now you're trying to
make the jump it's a natural jump but
you have to be you have to be no one's
going to make you go from a web designer
to a web developer you have to do that
no one's out there to accomplish your
goals but you and if your goal is to
work right now as a web designer to
eventually work as a web developer you
need to go and you have to work to get
there is no one's just gonna naturally
kick you up the ladder um if that's the
case like you have to really go there on
your own and this is like something I
think a lot of people think is going to
happen if someone's going to deliver
your dream your dream is your dream and
you have to work towards it and that
goes in your personal and professional
life as well
but I don't know you can always just
change your title to literally just
change your title of the web developer
on LinkedIn or on your portfolio it may
be a little bit shady but it is what it
is
oh man by the way guys uh for the 35 or
so of you that are in here if you
haven't already please do join our
Facebook group code teching and caffeine
the link is in the description below um
it's a great resource to stay focused as
we were just talking about like the
hardest thing is stay focused I highly
encourage you to join the group you can
meet other like mine in dividuals who
are sharing resources on a daily basis
and giving feedback and helping out any
way they can myself included um any tips
for internships because I'm applying um
let's see at the end of the day what you
really have to do is one have a nice
looking portfolio on LinkedIn it's same
thing for applying for jobs I have a
portfolio site so that they can look at
things that you have done and really
sell the fact that you're eager to learn
because that's what they're looking for
be social work on your public speaking
skills a lot of times will set you apart
as just being someone who they think
they can work with someone that they
want to be around cuz they're going to
teach you there guys too they're gonna
have to they're going to have to mentor
you but just see try and be likable try
and be relaxed and and just do all the
basic other stuff that's expected dress
appropriately business casual or just
straight up business um show that you're
eager man that that's really it um you
know it's just one of those things and
be prepared to have a bay
six skills test oh hey man I know it
sounds weird do you think it's a
definite turnoff to employers I don't
have a Facebook Twitter LinkedIn or
Instagram Facebook Twitter Instagram no
LinkedIn absolutely you're going to have
about two times as hard of a chance
landing a job who is your fundamentals
of computer science teacher I don't even
remember man
I do not even remember slightly
our boy engineered shirts try to give us
a call Thank You Raph for or for um yeah
man we've been working hard on the show
we're at 19 K it's pretty impressive man
the goal is a hundred I'll be honest
with you is I want a hundred K that's
what I want I feel like a 100 K I get
that verified check that big dick check
is like I'm pushing subs on
YouTube check mark and uh you got a
little weight behind you you're walking
with a limp cuz yeah I don't talk about
but I want a hundred K man each year
says I liked your worth videos pretty
good yeah man I try to so one thing I
try to do in my ask a dead videos is I
try to relate it to experiences in my
life I don't want to talk about advice
so much just tell you my thought process
and things that have happened to me and
what I've learned from them and then you
do with it what you will right I hate
people say this is the only way you this
is right I'm 100% right I you know you
know you're talking about I just want to
tell you what I've tried and what has
worked for me and so no the knowing
you're worth video is kind of kind of
how I I just tell you what what happened
to me in my life man I'm not else to put
it and I want you to learn from my
mistakes
you love my foul language I don't swear
too much do i I don't know man the
stinky leg check 100k subs David yang
welcome welcome
um I don't know man I just try to be
myself if I if I had to watch my
language on YouTube uh I don't know I
just I think I could drop an f-bomb
every now and again right I should told
the the web design shop see it CEO to
suck a fat one I don't think you can
call yourself a CEO he's just an owner
of the shop what is a jst a JavaScript
ninja is what that stands for you say
enough to be a JavaScript developer like
a full stack JavaScript developer I mean
yeah but as a developer as a developer
you're always going to like once you're
once you have the skill set a full stack
JavaScript stacked up you're gonna be
you're gonna be attracted to learn other
things like I am really attracted to
learning Python because it's on the
up-and-up so once I feel good with the
backend of the mean stack you guys are
gonna see some Python tutorials like
you're going to see some Python
algorithms and things like that
um so it all just depends you have to go
where you're in mind you it may take you
a year or two to get there but in a
20-year career you could learn ten
languages you spent two years or be
proficient enough work in them so it's
just offense man you sass innate code at
night yo man any any developer tell you
you don't assassinate the code the code
assassinates you man oh how about this
for an idea asking have types of devs
you expect to meet that wouldn't be a
bad one put that on the on the note here
see that's what I'm talking about Cory
good for you man um a little background
on Cory says hey uh low background on me
I quit Walmart getting paid at a local
casino landed a $28 an hour job by
dressing up for the interview and
telling them I'm willing to hustle there
you go man
and like in a Deb interview especially
on the junior role and you're gonna have
to have some skills but you're also have
to just prove that you're hustling
gettin a you're learning you're doing
this daily right yeah you gotta you
gotta you gotta want it man and you have
to they have to see that you want it you
can't just say that you want it words
are cheap words are cheap and and so
when I add a yeah and this is this is
one thing that has stuck in my mind if
you're in here I don't mean to pick on
you or anything like that
but this is a good example one of my
subscribers asked me during the last
livestream or some livestream hey Dylan
I really want to learn to code but how
do I stop playing so many video games
and go to coding you don't want it bad
enough that I mean that's the truth the
matter is if you wanted it bad enough
you would do it you would find a way I
had an issue with gaming and stuff like
that I got rid of my game systems I sold
them I put them on my mom's house I got
rid of them out of the house I
uninstalled all the games on my PC and I
just focused on school or focus on code
so so I don't know like a lot of people
are very very you got like words are
cheap you don't want to learn code that
bad you don't want to learn to be
developer that bad if your game is
distracted by League of Legends if
you're getting distracted by Call of
Duty like maybe you haven't hit your so
called rock bottom that you can you know
you're okay where you're in added life
and you're gonna play call duty ah and
it's not that I'm trying to pick on this
gentleman but this is I mean that's
that's the reality of situation is if
you wanted it bad enough you would
hustle every day until you got there
there'd be no gaming there would be no
no
oh but this is that is something
completely in an individual's control
whether they hire you or not that's that
that's someone out of your outer control
you can only build yourself to be put in
the best situation possible you can only
do the most educated guess but if you're
saying hey I spend my time doing this
instead of I really want to do this no
you don't you'd rather do this that's
just the truth of the matter which is
why you're doing it so if you're
in that situation you need to you need
to focus just need to get your focus man
you may have to change your lifestyle
for me I have to stop going the gym I
had to stop dating I had to stop a whole
mess of and I just came home every
day and I coded for hours before bed and
you know 10 hours on the weekends and
plus and I just gave up everything else
man
until I got to where I was going to go
and I remember having conversations with
April when you know we got back together
she's like well what if this doesn't
work out all right like out of year what
do you mean doesn't work out I'm
get in there one way or another um so
it's it's doesn't it may not work out
tomorrow bleh this shit's working out
I've no there was no doubt in my mind
I'd be a developer at some point I don't
know when I just know I was working
everyday to be one step closer to it and
I get there and I may have to do that
unpaid internship I'm after that
minimum-wage internship I may have to go
in and do freelance to do all this
but I it just be one step closer to
where I wanted to be there was not a six
months we're backing out a year we're
backing out no we're getting there and
just start trucking because that was my
entire focus I put my mind on it I put
my energy towards it I put my time
towards it there's no way I'm not
accomplishing it every day is one step
closer to me trying to accomplish what I
want
sera fluorophore says um any thoughts on
a top-five series or top five devs you
mean top five languages uh a lot of
these coding channels do lists and I've
thought about it um I it's been in the
back of my mind
so JH says AI was a construction worker
and by day piece of delivery driver but
night I was a pizza delivery driver by
night as well so I understand that I had
three four jobs at one time I was
learning code man so you got you got to
be in that hustle um but for the top
five yeah I might do something like that
in the future okay so Russ Wilkie says I
love to code but there are days where I
just have a hard time wanting to code
coming home from work after coding all
day what do you want well if you're
ready coding all day I understand that
um what do you want how do you deal with
coding burnout well for me I had a video
talking about how I know I'm about to
burn out I think that's important um um
but it's okay to take a day off as if
you're already a developer it really is
but you have to instead use your time to
to better yourself that could be
something like maybe you write a blog
maybe you do a YouTube video maybe you
maybe you do coding in a different
fashion where instead of instead of you
actually going down and coding maybe you
share some resources you read up on
stuff you follow the trends uh you know
it all just depends man but try and be
productive in in a in another manner
that all the days that you're a little
bit tired I understand that that that
happens to the best of us especially as
a developer right you go you work eight
10-hour days and come home you're like
 I promised myself an hour to my
side project um so it it can be
difficult but sometimes you just got
powered through um I with that being
said in my I've talked about uh things
that I learned in the last six months
being a developer is that there were
weekends where I coded like I did before
where I coded to ten-hour days and then
I showed I coded Saturday ten hours
Sunday ten hours and I showed up Monday
and I wasn't refreshed so there's a
difference between burning yourself out
like that and just steady one hour a day
side project so maybe maybe code less
but
it should but you have to be aware of
what your limits are at the same time um
Eddie says he quit his job to focus more
on coding feels good man good for you
man good luck with that
it was either quit the gym or quit my
job
I definitely quit the job eh everyone's
got different preference right
um no dating no going out monk my I'm
not bullshitting you man you can talk to
engineer truth about this when we both
lived in LA I was always trying to
hustle and YouTube and coding that was
that was all I did I didn't go out he'd
invite me out I said nah man I got cook
I'm trying to finish this like an
algorithm and I got a good a job as a
developer just in the talk um so it's
the Year Batman Mike's is a sought TED
talk where this Asian gentleman have a
2.3 GPA fill the CS class twice I got a
job as a software engineer at Facebook's
that isn't motivation than what is there
you go
yes instead of coding just chilling
watching me yeah that's right that's a
song at all uh all right guys um I
appreciate you showing up for this 19k
subscriber ama we do these every
thousand subs to kind of answer
questions shoot the do whatever we
need to do basically say thank you to
the thousand new members um so thank you
for being here and for the old eighteen
okay y'all get an old I appreciate you
all the same though geez and the next
AMA the you new nineteen you new one
thousand you'll be the oh geez as well
um but anyhow guys I appreciate you
being here and appreciate you watching
the videos I'll have more Aska deaths
coming out mainly on a daily basis I'll
be streaming later with April for her
tutoring session enjoy that the next
hundred days we are continuing on we are
in day 12 of April's a hundred days of
code she's learning to be a developer
and we're trucking through you're going
to see the the good parts the bad and
the ugly
um um good the good of the bad and the
ugly and you probably learned a little
bit about me and her in the in the
process don't forget to join our
facebook page code check and caffeine uh
it's a great resource for those of you
who don't know what resources will look
at how to stay up-to-date in coding how
to see the best memes as well uh anyhow
the link is in the description and if
you want to support me guys you can at
patreon.com slash coding tutorials 360
your money will go towards the goal of
upgrading content to 4k as a 4k screen
so screen shares will be 4k and a 4k
webcam that's the goal as well as better
lighting so I don't have this sort of
half half pale half dark face going on
here in the future thank you for
watching I'll see you guys a little bit
later look forward to tomorrow's video
as well I'm going to try and make a
pledge of and ask a dev video everyday
so make sure you start commenting
questions you have I'll do my best to
answer them I'll see you guys next a
next time but more than anything else
stay motivated work hard I want you all
to be a developer in whatever fashion
that makes you happy do those side
projects do those blogs do those YouTube
channels uh whatever it is you got a
dream and a goal go for it man and my
nap is to evolve coding I'll see you
guys next time as April would say code
long and prosper bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
