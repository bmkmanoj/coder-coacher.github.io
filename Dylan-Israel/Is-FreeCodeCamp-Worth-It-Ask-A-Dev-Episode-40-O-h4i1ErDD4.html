often is is free code camps certificates
worth it is it worth your time is it
worth your energy what do you get out of
it
what does it do for you and you know is
it is it relevant to put on your resume
is it you know all those certs are
questions and that's what we're going to
talk about today because I think it's
important to note a few things easy uh
we string this element you'll see over
my shoulder right there I do have it up
there but uh that wasn't always there
that was hot
that was so that's the front end
certificate and it took me probably I
would say realistically 200 to 250 hours
of the of the estimated 500 hours now
what's it worth it to me to getting that
of course it was oh and I'm going to
talk about why and what it's not free
and also put in perspective I was able
to get my salary developer job before I
finished that first front end
certificate and you can too if you know
you do everything you need to but why
was it if you're like oh well we're
talking about what's a certificate worth
it none we're talking about was free
code camp worth it not necessarily
certificates but what did free code camp
give me free code camp other than giving
me a a free
competent learning path punished
mentored me into making a portfolio
which is the number one thing that will
get you a job as a developer just
starting out is you need to build things
you need to showcase your skills in
actual projects and so at the end of
Rico camp I had 12 projects done I
believe at the time I accepted in my
position I had nine of them done
somewhere around there but I had nine
portfolio items for potential employers
to look at and see okay this is
alright this guy can code in jQuery and
and angular and and you're like a little
Dylan there's no angular in free code
count what do you mean they could see
that you could code in angular well
because I had already coded these nine
projects in free code camp after looking
and getting the skills and being
introduced to new topics like Ajax calls
and and things like that and now working
with frameworks after doing a little bit
of research of my own and looking at
jobs and seeing what's in demand in
terms of front-end developers I saw two
things I saw angular and I saw react and
I started simultaneously learning both
and so what happened was is rather than
me going and developing brand new
projects and starting from fresh well I
wanted to showcase those my skills based
off those free code camp projects so
what I did and I encourage you to do
something similar was I've rebuilt my
projects that were in jQuery in angular
so I now had angular projects to
showcase that skills all from free code
camp now note there's no instructions on
the angularjs for that but all crucial
and part of free code camp in my mind as
it is next thing that it really gave me
that you know to me says it was worth it
was in my education section I now have
ah I now have on there free code camp
front end certificate now I did have the
time because I haven't completed it but
now I do and I have a brief you know if
front-end certificate free code camp you
know basically coding boot camp
certificate on there and when it comes
up in conversations that's what it gives
you gives you something to say this
guy's studying this as learning
I don't really haven't heard of free
code camp Preston you enlighten them say
well you know I did 40 algorithms I did
12 projects and these are the
technologies I use it's estimated 500
hours of coursework and I'm continuing
my education on now the backend
certificate and these are technologies
that I'm learning these use those
talking points and it's about selling
yourself and your between your
portfolios and your portfolio that
you're creating through free code camp
that you're putting on your resume in
their project section or your LinkedIn
on your project section you also have
something to put on your rest
and with this the completed certificate
as well as in the education section of
your LinkedIn these are kind of what at
the other day got me my job and for me
was way worth it and one of the reasons
I continue to learn off Rico camp not
only am i picking up skills left and
right is freako camp gave me a sort of
mentoring rubric of how to go about
learning and what to learn right so a
lot of times the hardest part when
you're getting started is all right I
learned the basics of JavaScript what
now I learned the basics of HTML CSS
what now how I can't learn the basics of
JavaScript how do I learn them and so
freak okay I took you from this sort of
what was available in terms of online
coding tutorials with coke add me with
basic syntax and showed us that all
right one way that you can challenge
yourself to really learn these things is
we're going to start introducing you to
algorithms you need to know algorithms
it's a crucial part and like alright now
you're going to need a project you got
tie it all together and then you're
going to learn up for jQuery framework
any like I know people have you and
then you know it continues on and on and
on and free Coquette for me kind of
mentored me in terms of getting that
portfolio getting that rest vectors and
I I have to say that it was one of the
larger reasons that I feel that I've
been very prepared as a front-end
developer and I think one of the reasons
that going to a full stack developer now
I have a very good skill set and to me
there's no doubt in my mind that if you
stick with free code camp and you do
what you need to do you it will be worth
it for you as well just the skills you
will pick up the portfolio you will
build and the the sort of running start
that a lot developers need before that
they even considering the self a
developer right the hardest part is
getting started free code camp is there
to get you from beginning to
intermediate as far as I'm concerned and
beginning being like the absolute syntax
intermediate being I can build stuff on
my own with
with you know without people baby
Stephanie along the way I got it now and
I hope that you continue our free
cocaine is one hundred percent worth for
me in foot of respect it took me about
nine months maybe maybe even longer to
finish a front end certificate so it
wasn't a sort process but the back end
certs going much faster I plan on
finishing that in three months oh yeah I
hope you guys continue your education at
free code camp it's definitely worth it
for me
for what I've seen with people have done
similar videos and talked about
similarly a lot of people have found
jobs before they even finish myself
included and after they finish they
continue on because they enjoy it as
every good developer tell you they enjoy
this right they just don't do it
for a paycheck you'll get burnt out if
you do and I hope hope you guys take
focus hope you stay motivated I'll see
you guys the next video oh don't forget
