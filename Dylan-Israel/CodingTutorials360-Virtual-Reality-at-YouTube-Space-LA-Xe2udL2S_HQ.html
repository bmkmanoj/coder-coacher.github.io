flat tire on the way to the VR
waiting for triple-a now for glaze here
early but after this we'll go and go to
an actual of the Arvin at YouTube space
eventually we're arriving late but will
be there
the year
he said
YouTube space la just go do it play the
game made by chronic lads it's my first
virtual reality
parents it's kind of a like wave
simulator which you collect resources
and build as kind of like almost at our
defensive wheel and I absolutely loved
it
I'm reaching out to one of the
fenders and boundaries to see if I can
interview some of their engineers for it
but I really liked it a lot and I'm
hoping to be able to show you some
gameplay control my point of view in the
future so hopefully that works out but
so far i really enjoyed the game and
I'm actually hoping to be able to place
the war of it I didn't think I was going
to like the virtual reality aspect of it
as much but the controllers in your
hands it's very very fun and I didn't
feel sick at all I really enjoyed it so
hats off to sonic labs and hopefully
you'll see more near future as always
thanks for watching I'll see you guys
next any other for watching the video

collaboration with Eric serve six going
over how to get started coding and if
