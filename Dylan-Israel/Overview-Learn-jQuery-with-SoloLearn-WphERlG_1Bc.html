back in solo learned today doing jQuery
I didn't use a lot of jQuery but I do
think it's an important language to get
started with or library rather uh-huh
especially when you're just learning
JavaScript because it's kind of an
assumed skill that you're gonna be able
to work well with jQuery we have a short
little course here let's go ahead and
dive into it
jQuery at its core is very basic use
selectors and they do things with those
selectors so what is jQuery um it's a
rich fast small Futurist javascript
library that's pretty true so a
JavaScript library and so in the past if
you needed to select a document by
selecting element you do this by ID now
you could just use jQuery syntax and
assign the function after the what you
want to do so you're selecting the ID
with our jQuery selector and then we're
doing something with it in this case
we're overriding the HTML to be go
pretty cool so we call VAR e is our VAR
e for our element and we'll say e dot
inner HTML is equal to test this is how
we would change the text of a single
line in the past with just pure vanilla
JavaScript jQuery makes this much easier
first thing you're going to need to do
is import your JavaScript or excuse me
your jQuery library using a script tag
this isn't native to any browsers so
you'll have to do that and you simply
pass in the script tag like so the
source the and finally fill the blanks
so we ever script oh and then of course
your closing head tag here
so you want to throw this in your head
in your header all right no in your head
tag because now we have header tags in
HTML not to be confused there now in
jQuery we use this dollar sign to
basically say this does jQuery this is
kind of how it works
now when you want something to load on
default you need this document dot ready
function and then you throw your jQuery
in there
all this is saying is is that imagine
has two tags this is your first tag and
this is your second tag and what you're
doing is you're basically saying please
run my jQuery in here and it gives you
it gives you a little bit more but
that's all it is is start jQuery within
here that's the gist of it
there you go so ready is used to
basically prevent any jQuery running
that's not designed to be in there
you'll see right here we have our
function start go so what's gonna happen
is this is like that the IDS start and
we're gonna change the inner HTML or the
text here to go and if we try it ourself
we can kind of see it in action might
make a little bit more sense so let's go
ahead and do that so we have our
JavaScript here which is basically just
running this immediately and when we run
it you'll see that our inner HTML
changes this start text to go that's all
that happened there learning angular 2
in the meantime through a lot of great
YouTube channels which symbol is used to
access jQuery the dollar sign which if
there's a technical word for the dollar
sign please let me know in the comments
below I'd love to know what it is
so you're basically you do the dollar
sign to say jQuery says axis is jQuery
you pass in your selector and then the
action to do with or at that selector in
this example we're targeting all
paragraph tags to hide in this example
we're targeting all classes with demo to
hide in this example we're targeting an
ID with the name of demo to hide all
right so we want to hide an ID so our to
show an ID so we're gonna use the jQuery
selector the dollar sign and then we're
gonna pass in the selector we want in
this case is ID so we use the hash tag
and then for the show function we simply
call the dot show on it and wham bam
we're done so selectors we've been
talking about you can select elements
you can select IDs you can select
classes you do need to make sure you use
parentheses within there so make sure
not to make that mistake as well so with
the class of demo that's the dot
remember your CSS it'll become pretty
apparent you can also use cs3
conventions such as selecting the first
paragraph element all div elements with
the class menu so you can do div dot
menu you also do all you can do multiple
selectors so you can do all H ones and
peas
by just putting a comma and you can do
if you put a space all paragraph
elements that are descendants of a div
element and they feel most like all the
Dom elements you can use an asterisk for
all select all the 8x so we're going to
define our selector and we're just gonna
pass in the a tag which are inside
paragraph tags so if we want to do that
its PA like so useful selectors so
you'll see there's a bunch of selectors
here if you're familiar with the first
three or four on here
basically the ID the dot class and the
element those are the bulk of what
you're gonna use you can see how it can
get kind of more and more complicated
but basically anything you can use to
target your CSS is kind of what you can
do in jQuery which is a rough rule of
thumb so select all the elements that
are direct children of div elements whoa
select all elements that are direct
children of div elements so throwing the
a stroke over the a stroke is all so you
can see you can get kind of complicated
right there they threw one that you
probably wouldn't do too much of but you
can so what symbol is used to access
jQuery that's the dollar sign fill in
the blanks of jQuery manipulations as
soon as the document is loaded so again
we're using the dollar sign and then we
want to pass in function in the past
you'd use document dot ready but
function will work as well fill in
blanks paragraph following paragraph P
just like the following paragraph PID so
we don't need to target the paragraph
instead what we can do is target the ID
and put it in us excuse me the ideas
hash tag hash tag test and select all h1
h2 elements and if you wants like
multiple elements that's separated by a
comma and finally if you want to select
the children of the element ID demo so
what we're gonna do is our jQuery
selector and then we want the ID demo
and then we have a space notice the
space right here then the paragraph tag
we want the children the paragraph
children of demo and that was a quick
overview of select
what to really get away from jQuery what
you really get away from from this first
section is how does jQuery work jQuery
workspace it basically off using
selectors that's a crew that is the
bread and butter if you will of jQuery
and the functions that we're going to
work through in the next couple videos
you'll make your life much easier than
doing things in vanilla JavaScript and
is kind will be very helpful as you
learn jQuery to kind of get you prepared
to learn other frameworks like angular
or react so thanks for watching if you
