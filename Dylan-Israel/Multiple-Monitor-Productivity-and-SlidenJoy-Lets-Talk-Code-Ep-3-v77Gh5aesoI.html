video so soon because I still be playing
starcraft legacy of the void but
unfortunately I hate it let's lift move
on now what we're going to be talking
about is multiple monitors not for
gaming like with starcraft but for
actually programming so one of the cool
products that got kick-started and
improved unfortunately it's a little bit
on the pricey side i buy it if i had the
money i don't but i think it's well
worth it is a new product called slide
and joy they're taking pre-orders right
now they were a successful Kickstarter
and basically what it is as you can see
from the images above that we have a
single monitor anton and a double
monitor hat on for your laptop it comes
in 13 15 and 17 inch sizes this is
something that will increase your
productivity very dramatically and make
learning a lot easier so that's a kind
of a cool product if you want to
preorder it I would if I had the money I
recommend checking it out at least Afiya
you got a few hundreds couple hundred
dollars fun starts at 249 for the single
349 for the double screen model and on
top of that it is increases i believe
about 40 to 70 dollars depending on what
state you live in i think it's up there
somewhere in europe so it's kind of go
over the ocean but let's talk about
having multiple monitors i currently use
two monitors for programming i used to
use it just for gaming i start using it
for programming and expand my horizons
I'm reason for this it's not just my
personal experience actually looked it
up because I said I mean to me I feel
like I'm getting more done but other
stats to back this so it turns out there
are there's quite a few stats to show
not only is it not only is the user
happier and finance information easier
because there's multiple monitors that
means easy reference so you're kind of
if you have two monitors I see you're
working on two things because you have
one thing going on the side one thing
here when you only have one monitor
everything's up in your face and very
jumbled and gotta find things and
because of that the tasks you did get
done per minute actually dropped so
let's say something normally took you 18
minutes I believe in an example I said
okay it's going to take you 15 and a
half so none
does your productivity go up but it's
also easier to learn with multiple
monitors because when you're learning
something a lot of the times what we're
doing is we're referencing that we're
trying to copy that we're trying to say
okay this is what this array meant it
does let me look at it and try to
emulate it in my program here and get
better so that's kind of my little tip
and trick and check out the sliding joy
I think it's really cool I'm uh I'm one
day one day I hope have the good nice
little paycheck to treat myself but as
always guys questions comments concerns
all that sort of stuff and topics are
appreciating I'll see you guys in the
next video hey guys thanks for watching
