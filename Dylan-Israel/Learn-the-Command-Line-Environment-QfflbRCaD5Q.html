new microphone today for a little bit of
better quality here let's get back to it
we are in the command prompt configuring
the environment the last section here
learn to configure the environment using
the command line so first thing that we
want to do is a simple command line text
editor called nano so Nano hello oops
Nano you don't know what Nano does yet
we'll find out the next slide but let's
just try it the syntax so it looks like
it's brought up a couple of commands
here for us to take to take care of if I
had to guess so now we're going to type
in hello I am Nano
let's try without the quotes
no no actually it doesn't seem to be
letting go this last quote control-x
all right there we go so I don't forget
to control X to exit out let's go to the
next page so you edit a file in the
nanotech setter how does it work
nano is a command line text editor so
it's it's basically a tool to make our
lives a little bit easier when we're
working within the command prompt by the
looks of it so let's go back to Nano it
looks like and I believe the squiggly
Alliance name is tilde if I'm fine on my
keyboard
alright hey Milo I'd uh slash dot bash
underscore profile so let's see what
this does
so this brings us up into uh Nano and in
the bash profile at the top of this file
we want to echo out echo and then
welcome comma and Jane Jane Doe and then
we want to control o to save the file
and we want to hit enter to write the
file name and then ctrl X to exit cool
we'll see here in the terminal we want
to so we're back in the tournament on
the line below we want to then go back
and we should see the greeting that we
entered so C tilde slash dot bash
underscore profile so there you see
right here welcome Jane Doe
all right now that we know what a bash
profile was is let's configure the
environment by adding command aliases so
we want to say Nano and then we want to
open the bash profile that we created
there goes so you can see right there
that goes out what we have edited
beneath the greeting so let's go down
oops
so back go down we want to create an
alias that is with the password that is
PWD by the looks of it we want to save
the file which is control know it's a
control out and then we want to exit
which is control X no
so let's go back
so far
that's nice I thought it was control
odor right out read just fine good help
all right
control Oh control
oh don't forget to enter okay so now in
the command line you source come in all
right so we need to control X say Y to
save the modified control X how do we
get back to the command line control Oh
No excape so to get back to the command
line control it control C control X exit
you'll see the cancel control X oh and
that opened
answer I know will destroy changes so
control why we want to save it control Y
or just Y okay and it still won't let us
out
let's try typing in here
all right there we go sorry I had to hit
enter to save to the correct folder
sorry
now we want to open it up slash dot bash
- for profile and that's gonna welcome
our our welcome us like we already
pre-programmed and now we want to try
our Elias and our PD it's gonna show us
where it's at by the looks of it you
should see singing outfits you would
typing PWD
so PWD I think we may have over saved it
when I was messing around there so we'll
have to change that so we're gonna
practice Nano a little bit more so we
have a slash dot bash under your profile
so you can see that our PD is equal to
PW that's good now we want to create a
new alias called hy set that equal to
history we want to save the file
so that's ctrl o Enter
control oh gosh
hy is equal to history let's see if this
gap right here is causing our air
control oh there we go
make sure there's no space there all
right so we're gonna add another alias
it's gonna be LL
I'm gonna set this equal to LS - la
control o enter and now we need to exit
so control X I'll bring us back to the
command line it's not gonna ask us to
save because we just did and we haven't
made any changes all right and then
we're hit source and O source and I
guess we have to call the file again so
this is slash don't bash I miss about
profile BAM
so now in the command line let's type
rhy it's going to show us a little bit
of stuff and then type ll that's going
to show us what's going on here so we'll
be able to access these profiles and we
can get the parameters and what folds
are there and stuff like that
what happens when you store aliases in
the bash profile hy is set to an alias
for history the alias is unavailable to
a session by source so basically by
typing LL we're typing this sub command
that we've already programmed in the
alias that's what it kind of sounds like
here now that you're familiar configure
ingredients inning let's move on to
setting environment variables so
all right so we are going to export
export my user equal to Jane Doe feel
free to use your own name
alright we'll use my Pizza poker guy
alright save file ctrl o enter press
Enter
exit control X we're back in the command
line so you source to activate the dot
Bash tilde slash bash underscore profile
and then it says welcome Jane Doe now
let's go ahead and echo so we want to
find out what the user is so echo user
and you have to declare the variable
looks like with the dollar symbol and so
comes out pizza poker guy exactly as we
set it up the line user equals Jane Doe
sets an environment variable usually use
a very real set to the name what
computers owner okay so line export
makes variable available to call so
basically we need to use export
otherwise we won't be able to call it
from the command prompt only in the Nano
text editor so let's learn a few
important so I back to Nano
/ - dot - missile profile I saw back in
the Nano text editor we are now gonna
export ps1 equal-to don't forget the
space at the end we're gonna control s
yep
so we want to save it and now we want to
exit control XXII so we're out we saved
it
clear
okay let's try the only time it did seem
to work so nano I think we have to save
it then EXO we can't exit save exit with
the the fish oh sorry
so it's nano and then it's profile I saw
her back in it here so open it up we
want to export I also think about looks
that are here that we entered it in
wrong
all right and so to write it out control
I'll enter and then control X we're
going to get back to here and so we want
to use the command line source on our
bash dot - I'm just for profile and now
we want to echo out hello
so it prints out hello now let's type LS
- alts did you notice how the prompt has
changed I did not
let's see so I'll probably tell us how
it changed next window so ps1 is a
variable that defines the makeup and
style of the command prompt
since the command prompt variable and
exports the variable so apparently this
changes this to this okay
in the command prompt learn to echo out
home so we want to echo out home home is
probably a default variable this returns
the value of the home variable so here
we want to echo out our path this
probably tells us the path of the file
structure and folder structure that
we're currently in let's see what
happens when we try to activate bin
slash PWD so this is going to take
wherever PWD is bin slash LS is going to
display all the folders in bin just our
bash profile hello text and artists
yeah so path stores a list of
directories separated by a colon this is
a script that is executed when you type
the PWD command
and this is basically runs the LS
command on this path alright so let's
see what env does environment this looks
like it gets a whole lot of information
it's this it basically looks like it's
everything
there's our path our terminal all that
sort of stuff so let's see what env and
I forget what the slash does we used it
earlier so this just gets the path from
our env by the looks of it so this gets
all the environment variables the enemy
gets all the environment variables for
our current path without making and then
the grep or greep trying to pronounce it
gets a single environment variable oops
cool and it looks weak like we are we
are done we finish the command prompt
probably a lot more complicated than
this short little program but a short
little course but at least we'll be
familiar with it and be able to they
didn't even cover the command that I
used it which is just pinging sites to
see let's see if we can even do it in
here ping let's see if it will work
so this is what we would use at my work
to see if our if we don't get a return
it means our sites not getting the ping
so you can see right here we're getting
it's gonna continue and continue but um
you know thanks for watching the video
and anythink instructors always
appreciate it and I'll see you guys in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
