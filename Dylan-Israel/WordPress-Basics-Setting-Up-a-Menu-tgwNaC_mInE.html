something a little bit different word
price is a great tool to simplify a
website and it's something I use quite
often as a freelancer and in my own
personal life this is just my own
website I haven't really set it up too
much I just bought it and started
messing around with themes so why not
but we're going to show you how to set
up a menu and certain little things that
we can do with menu so stuff like that
that's appearance related it's going to
be under appearance than menus you're
going to see I already have one created
but we're going to go ahead and create a
new one so let's go ahead and create a
new one we're going to name this primary
we just named a primary navigation
create menu and now there's a couple
options here so primary menu means that
anywhere in your theme this is the menu
you want to use so let's go ahead and
just select that for now and
automatically add new top-level pages
this menu is whenever we create a new
page this is going to automatically add
it to that I leave it unchecked because
normally when do that so the way you
want to add pages you can see right here
I have five basic pages home about us
contact home and portfolio I have two
homes for some reason so we'll just
select that and you can see right here
because they're not layered they are
their individual so let's just for the
sake of this let's put this under
contact will do about us and we'll put
contact under there so you can see the
difference in liner so we're going to
save the menu and now if we go to our
dashboard and let's go to let's go to
the site and you can see although not
very clearly because I haven't set this
up where is our our menu oh here it is
up top up top up here you see your home
and then about us underneath it drop
down and you can create a contact now
let's say we don't want to give home a
name I
we want to rename home we can do a
couple things so let's go back to our
customized here and customize rather
let's go back to menus and we can even
do a few different things so in here
there's a drop-down box so we're gonna
say we want to change the navigation
label it's still going to be the same
page but we're going to change it to new
new name so this will still be the home
page that displays but you can see right
here original home now i'll be that and
if we wanted to remove it we can do
right there so save menu and let's go
back to visit our site and it should now
be called new name so that's just a
quick brief on how to set up a menu
using wordpress
