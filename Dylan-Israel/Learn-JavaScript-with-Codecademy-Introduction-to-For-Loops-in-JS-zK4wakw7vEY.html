jobs javascript is anyone who codes for
loops are crucial so in this case we
want to use five console.log statements
are not numbers 1 3 or 5 okay I guess
this is kind of showing us why we would
use
alright so that was pointless but we'll
keep it going here the for loop of the
code will print out the numbers one
through five use far less code than
years previous exercise changed the six
to eleven and press save and submit code
all right so we're gonna change our
counter to eleven and it should print
out one to eleven or one to ten one so
now for loop starts off at one it won't
end up ten changed for loop such that it
will start off at five so we're gonna
change our starting value
I hear to five and there you go five to
ten so we're kind of getting the feel of
how it goes
we know the for loop counts from one to
ten so it starts at 1 it goes to 10
because this isn't including 11 changes
for loop so that starts at 4 so we
change our initials variable I to 4 and
that it counts up to including 23 so
it'll just change this to 24 around the
for loop and see account for for 223
there we go alright controlling this
little this code counts from the number
0 to 35 make it start counting from 5
all right you know how to do that
stop the County when it prints out to 50
51 only count every 5th number so you
want to increment I by 5 equals I plus
fun
so this should make it so that it skips
over fun so 5 times 55 good all right so
let's case we want to make it count by 8
or start counting at 8 keep counting
while I still less than 120 and
increment it by 12 so I equals I plus 12
remember if you accidentally make a loop
that never ends your browser will crash
done that before
all right so you can see right here it
starts off at a increases by 12 don't
run the code without changing it so the
reason this is an infinite loop is
because I will always be greater than or
equal to 1 because it starts off at one
it increases so it'll never end so
that's why it crashes so we want to
change this on our starting point into
10 and we want to stop once it gets to
zero and then in this case we're going
to work our way down so I - - and then
you can see it gets all the way down
all right so now we're gonna write our
own direct burial for you so we're gonna
say for that count down from 100
so we'll say I and say I is equal to 100
and then we want to say while I is
greater than zero
we're gonna say I equal to I is equal to
you can see so it looks like we're gonna
be using arrays arrays are just kind of
like a collection of data types so in
this case and then see I want to secrete
around array called junk
oops john equals an array separation put
four bits of data in the first two
strings into numbers all right so say
cat separated with commas and then one
Dylan and I have two cats so no no
semicolon to know in comma and then we
will console.log
so that is print out our array array
positions so in this case print out the
fourth element of the race to figuring
out how to express with the fourth
element in that radius remember
everything starts at zero unless other
told otherwise from the most part so
this goes zero one two and three so in
this case we want to do console.log and
then our junk data and then we want to
call an index point three that's zero
one two three
Koller semicolon and this should print
out 31 there's our 31 so we're doing
some more loops in arrays so unless they
want us to change the elements in the
city right and you put as many elements
as you like
so we'll just put Los Angeles in here to
add something to it run the for loop and
see them all printed out so it's just
showing us we're going to run this dot
l'ainte takes the total length the
amount of indexes and it's going to
running for this so you can see that it
ends on Los Angeles right here which is
our last one alright so now we're going
to create an array called name so their
names is equal to the bracket they
arrays filled with five names
all right so fill in April
my little cheeto and my my original baby
kidding babe all right so we're then
gonna write a for loop 0 all right we
could do this a couple different ways we
would we should do i dot names wah wah
eyes listen name's not lanes that would
work this should also work five but the
reason we're gonna do it like this so
that if anything changes if later on
when your code gets more complicated you
don't have to go back and change the
portlet it'll just run for the length of
your names array so we want it to print
out
BAM there's our five sentences and
there's our five array indexes so that
was our introductory part two for loops
a little bit of arrays and mixing all
what we've learned in JavaScript so far
as always we're going to share it close
that and in this next section of four
loops we will be iterating through texts
to try and find a certain part so I'll
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
