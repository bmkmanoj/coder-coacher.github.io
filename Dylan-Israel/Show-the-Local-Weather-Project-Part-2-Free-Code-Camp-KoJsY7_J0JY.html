time we were working with the API and to
be able to make sure our query string or
our API code is working well this time
what we're going to do is we are just
going to be going through the longitude
and latitude using what they what um
free code camp current link gives us so
if you remember from an exercise the
this code that I'm pasting in here right
now is completely from free code camp
it's in the get geolocation data section
I'll throw an annotation up right here
and it should take you there so um of
course you if you're not doing free code
camp it's gonna probably have you create
a free account anyhow so this is going
to give us our launch in latitude so we
changed our PID here to data in a
earlier attempt at this video and we're
calling on that data using jQuery to get
the position chords dot latitude so this
is checking if this exists if our
geolocation exists based off the browser
I believe is what Navigator works off of
and the position so it's saying change
the data I the ID paragraph data to
display the latitude and the longitude
and when when you save it you'll see
that it's there so what else do we want
to do again we're getting this so that
we can get the geolocation of where
we're at and then we'll end up changing
our API URL here to the longitude
latitude version and we'll concatenate
that string with these variables we're
going to create right now so we're in
credit one called long we're gonna
create one called lat and we're just
basically going to store the data in it
so oops excuse me
so we're going to say long is equal to
position
position chords longitude and then to
make sure that it's still working we're
just going to go ahead and put long in
here save it and you'll see now that we
have two longitudes so go um so let's go
ahead and switch that out and then we're
also just going to set that equal to
position dot chords
dot latitude so we're going to save that
we're going to go ahead and throw that
in here just checking our work as we go
ahead save it you'll see that our latch
is still working and just to make sure
that it's not like a caching issue or
anything like that we'll go ahead and
change the one that didn't have that
identical value and so you'll notice
that it's it's working so let's go ahead
and put longitude in here and so again
we're getting our geolocation so that
our weather app will be able to say oh
this is the weather in your area based
off our longitude and latitude and we're
going to be using the open weather API
to do that so coming up next we're going
to do a quick little video about how to
concatenate the string and going over
the open weather API see you guys in the
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
