code we talk with our CEO of library who
we interview about when he kind of looks
for in candidates how he's had to let
some people go what are good people he's
worked with and traits of bad people he
sorta we also talked about their project
library which is kind of a open source /
selling your videos non-server base
using block chains very technical and we
showcase some of that and how that works
out uz it is and I don't even understand
what block changes but it is very
interesting and he's a serial
entrepreneur has about 10 developers
with a lots of great stuff I hope you
guys enjoy it thanks for watching um
would you mind introducing yourself for
everybody Jeremy Kaufman just CEO of
libel I and what library is completely
decentralized and sort of community
controlled way for people to share
discover and potentially purchase
digital content yeah so I you guys
emailed me originally to kind of check
out your site and see how if I wanted to
upload my content is it have you have
you had many youtubers that kind of gone
about this quite yet so right now we've
been doing robotics if you're if you're
technically minded youtuber and you're
interested in diving in we
wholeheartedly support that for most
youtubers we're happy to kind of do the
heavy lifting so you can just kind of
one click and we'll do all that work for
you we have had several youtubers well
we've got more than several we've had
several thousand youtubers commit to
joining we've had a good number of
YouTube issue are you know fairly
prominent and popular one of the ones
I'm most excited about is grade-a Andre
because he's literally made the video
everything that's wrong with YouTube and
I think there's a lot wrong with you
tube or a lot wrong with how we
distribute content in general and that's
what we're working on fixing to do so to
get someone who gets it is always
exciting so great great aid under a is
you know massive youtuber for those of
you know people who maybe not know who
he is I actually follow him as well as
described him what sort of benefits when
he get by posting his content on your
platform but there there's several but
I'd say there are two ones that are
really big one big one is the amount of
money you make on YouTube takes 45 per
cents of every dollar that you're making
out your content YouTube's taking 45%
about which i think is too much you know
I'm not going to say that moving bits
around is easy but at the end of the day
that is all you're doing is moving bits
around and forty five percent is a lot
for that the other thing though and this
one is potentially even bigger than the
percentage is the trust elements your
you see these creators who do really
great stuff who build basically the
entire business their entire livelihoods
on top of a company that can change the
rules on them at any time and is shown a
willingness to change the rules on
people at any time and for the benefit
of having an open source shared system
that can be used by anybody to publish
an exchange content I to me that level
of trustworthiness it's difficult to put
a price up and so you had mentioned
monetization and YouTube and so for the
people who don't know YouTube does take
45 cents of every ad that gets played
and I you know keep fifty-five percent
and then all you bastards use a block
out getting your money but uh so what
what would there be a rep split on your
platform or how is the game plan for
that so we when you make a piece of
content available on library we take
nothing on beverage on any transaction
so you you publish your content to
library you it's published on to the we
use a block chain is sort of the
equivalent of our database of the
content that's available and that's
actually all that a block chain is for
anyone who doesn't isn't that aware of
black in technology there's a lot of
hype around that all it really is is a
database to database with some somewhat
unique properties but functionally what
it is is a database so we use a block
chain to serve as that listing of all of
the content that's available
and the benefits of doing that is that
it's a shared system that anyone can
participate in even without our
permission you don't need to get
permission from us to make your content
available and similarly because it's a
blockchain we don't have the ability to
control it so we can't remove your
content even if we wanted to and so that
kind of system where it's it's shared by
everyone no person fully owns it I think
it's a definitely superior to their
status quo now is this kind of someone
who's not educated in this to the degree
obviously you are is this similar to
like how torrents work that part of it
is similar to how torrents work wait one
way if you're familiar with Bitcoin
here's another way to get your head on
what we're doing a flyby this toilets
have three problems one the cat what I
call it would call the catalogue problem
so while distribution is decentralized
there's no catalog there's no shared
catalog of what's available on the
Bitcoin network a blockchain provides a
decentralized way of having a shared cut
along the second big problem with
bittorrent is the incentives the torrent
basically works because people are nice
or don't understand how it works now
it's great that people are nice and make
their diskstation benefit album but
because it only works if people are nice
old content disappears we're content
disappears BitTorrent works great for
popular content for rare more obscure
stuff not so much good torrent is this
is partially the design partially a
marketing and a branding issue it's
basically nothing but infringing content
over ninety-nine percent of BitTorrent
usage is for infringing content and that
is not what we want to happen with
library we've designed library in a way
that we think you know the legitimate
creators of content can monetize it and
can hopefully make more money off of it
than they were making previously and so
we want to fix that problem with
Victoria as well we don't want library
to be you know 99 percent infringing
alright so we've talked about a wristlet
and making money how how does one make
money on you guys this platform is it is
there a is it add bass or
or what's kind of the idea so the VD
idea with library is to make prices
explicit you know a lot of people say
that YouTube is free I would disagree
YouTube is free maybe if you live
forever and your time is absolutely
worthless to you otherwise YouTube does
cost you money and similarly if someone
must be paying because people get paid
for making their videos available so the
way that YouTube works is effectively
watching a quote free video on YouTube
has a price that price is anywhere from
a tenth of a cent to assent and that is
what a publisher earns or what you two
burns for that video being viewed now
that cost is frequently paid for by an
advertiser right so effectively what's
happening in the YouTube publishing
model is you're saying i want to make
half a penny every time this video is
watched an advertiser says well I'm
happy to cover the cost of the half a
penny if someone is willing to watch my
advertisement to watch the video just a
lot of times people don't think about
that way but that is I think the right
way to think about so what library does
is it makes cost explicit so you can
price video at free you can price a
video at half a penny you can place a
video at a hundred dollars for videos
below a certain price on this is
actually not part of the system
currently but it's expected that an
advertiser can cover that cost similar
to youtube so for videos below a certain
price a user will essentially have the
choice of do I want to watch an ad or do
I want to pay the penny all right and
for videos above a certain price it's
basically a more like a la carte pricing
model where you pay the two dollars or
the three dollars or whatever to access
a cup cool so I you know I happen to
have 400 videos and if i said something
like ok let me upload my entire library
I could say dollar video let's see who's
exactly like that I would you could
absolutely say that I would guess
however if you price your videos at a
dollar more people would choose to
consume them from YouTube because
they're cheaper than a dollar on you
okay so uh I don't know if you guys
great a under a prices videos out of
curiosity well we've just got that we're
just pricing at it free okay that
supposed to free right now this is this
is phil this is a product that's still
in a beta actually right now it's in a
closed beta where we're going to go to
an open beta very soon but dishes
definitely the early stages of what
we're building with with library cool so
how is when you have the option of
selling i'm guessing you're going to
take a certain percentage of the sales
to sustain the business model or how
does how is the company going to sustain
itself I thought so that's a good
question we do not take any money do we
do not take any percentage of the videos
that are shown and amazing things about
library is we never can take a
percentage of the videos that are shown
now never is a strong word if over if we
won decided that we wanted to do that
and over fifty percent of the community
thought that we deserve the money that's
the only way that we're we're ever
getting any we have no intentions to do
that just to be clear but the beauty of
this kind of system is we are hand
cutting ourselves we do not have the
ability to change the rules unilaterally
we only have the ability to change the
rules if the users of the system once
the rules to be changed that way now I
haven't gotten to actually entering your
question which is how do we make money
and we do want to make money we are
business the way that we make money is
to fold one we have retained a small
portion of the credits that are used to
maintain the sort of block Jane database
so as library gets more popular we have
an asset that increases in value and the
other way is similar to other kinds of
open source software so by being the
experts at this software by knowing it
better than everyone else we are in a
position to provide all the tools and
all the things that need to be built on
top of it and those may cost money we
may charge money for those or we may
charge usage fees for those and things
like that
cool look let's talk about being a CEO
because I'm looking at your LinkedIn and
it seems like you spent five years seven
months as they see you're currently the
CEO and you spent almost six years at a
company called top score I'm not
familiar with toxic or with what did top
scorer do so I was also the founder and
CEO top score top scorer was and is a
company that provides a software service
for sport and activity organizations so
basically on the larger side those would
be places like us a water polo USA rugby
large kind of national international
sporting activity organizations on the
smaller side it would be your kind of
local soccer club or your local baseball
league or that kind of thing and what
our software did was it would power your
home page it would sing the registration
tools all of the legal stuff surrounding
waiver signings and and and collecting
information potentially from children
who are young and all that stuff but
basically it was a software tool for
people who ran sport an activity that
nice how did I I see so you seem to have
kind of a startup / I'm gonna work for
myself mentality how did have that one
having a tough score what made you move
on from top score i should say uh what
bad what made me move on for tougher was
exactly that mentality i mean top score
was and is doing very well as a company
i just got bit by this dog for something
new that i couldn't stop thinking about
and and to be honest i do i just i love
the early stages of a company the first
two three four years when you were
trying to figure something out you're
trying to figure out how to do it when
the ant like i like being in that area
where the answers are very unclear i'm
not the kind of person who I have some
friends are into we're into video games
and I like video games with some of them
they're like playing video games and
they just like they really like winning
if they could go in and they could play
the video game and they just like could
just like crush everybody that's really
fun for them for me I love the challenge
I love being internet barrios like I'm
going into that unknown of being in that
place where I don't know how to figure
this out and maybe I'm even nervous and
scared about whether i can in the first
place and I
I love being in that early lot of energy
nice and before that you had a company
flicks switch here okay that's not
really a name I made up for my
consulting business okay or actually
started as a consulting project so it
started as a for hire you know kind of
single web development projects for one
organization and we and my friend and I
you know we could make a company out of
this that's what we did cool now how
does the what in terms of being a CEO
what sort of you know it's going to vary
depending on the size of company and
then a visual individual but in general
what kind of entails being a CEO of a
company uh and just to be clear that
that's going to vary a lot depending on
the size of your company top score was
ten people when I left library is eight
so I have not been the CEO of not it's
not the same thing as being a CEO of a
giant company being a CEO of a company
this size well so another one thing your
job as a CEO regardless of the size your
company is you are the buck stops with
you for everything so you are the person
who is making the decisions about where
the company needs to go who are the
people who are the best people you know
to be running that company high-level
strategy and stuff like that now when
you're a company that's this size with
either of those sizes that's not all
that you're doing and when you're at a
company there those sizes it's useful if
you can step in and do a lot of the
roles it's you're not going to be able
to just when you're running a company
that's eight people you're not just a
manager you need to be able to actually
do the work and how as a CEO of cut
their company those sizes where you'll
step in and do the work is probably
going to depend more on what your skills
actually on um but I would say the
broader your skills the better you know
and in my case you know I know about
programming I know about product design
I know about sales and marketing and
these kinds of things and I'm able to
step in and help out in those areas sort
of as necessary nice now with you know
10 people or less so small compact team
when you're looking to kind of bring
somebody on what are you know at the end
of the day it's probably your your
decision along with you know some input
but how do
can't decide who's the right fit when
bringing somebody on who's going to be
you know we only have ten employee it's
going to be such a huge crucial impact
you're absolutely correct and the
hardest decisions at least for me and I
think it'd be true for any CEO is who do
i work with how do I find good people
how do I identify that someone is a good
person it's really hard you know it's
because you're meeting someone you're
talking to someone who you've never met
before and and they're essentially true
now there's a lot of people out there
who are who are good honest people
there's a lot of people out there who
aren't and you're how do I tell this
person is actually going to actually
knows the things they claim to know how
do I tell this person is going to be
reliable it's going to show up on time
it's going to get their work done or
they're not and sometimes you're not
going to find that out kelford like
months after you hired them you know
I've certainly hired people before I
thought they're going to work out and
then you know you spend tens of
thousands of dollars on that person and
they end up being not very good the
pattern that I've ended up coming into
for hiring people has been one I'll
usually do like an initial just a quick
get to know someone this can be real
short 10-15 minutes just like very
initial screening if they seem you know
they seem decently competent my
preference is rather than to do these
kinds of abstract tests and stuff like
that is to come up with the most
realistic simulation of what the work
would actually entail and have them do
it and and Tatum even so hire them for a
day two days three days to do somewhat
related work and to get them to see what
it's like to work with you as well like
when you're a company that's ten people
you're almost certainly you know working
for a company that's ten people is a lot
different than working for a company
that's a hundred people or 200 people or
a thousand people and so I also like for
that person to get the chance to see
what would it be like to work for this
company and so that's what I've
ultimately come down to as being the
best is to do the most realistic
simulations of the work possible
and and to do that over anywhere from
like a day to a couple of days and and
assuming it's longer than a day then I
do it as a paid job nice now what you
invention they had hired a couple people
who just you know it's sucks there's
some people out there that on paper they
look like great developers but in
reality they're either paying the
astronauts killed or whatever the case
may be handle like a negative situation
like that uh fine five of them yeah I
that that was only one lesson I learned
with my with my first company I was slow
to do that at times and it I think
anyone who has ended up running a
company for longer than a couple of
years will tell you one of the things
they learned is you can't keep people
around who aren't performing and I think
that is something that would people are
new to starting a company maybe they go
and they hire their friend or you know
they someone says oh well this guy's
good and they just kind of hire them and
then you know you'll learn if you'll
learn pretty quickly funny a company
that like you can't keep people around
you like you know who are performing
right now is it's more of a performance
thing is at least in your experience and
kind of a personality or now a flash you
know we work with her yeah um is there
time I mean sure though there are times
so yes I can't say that there are times
when I've sort of lost an employee and
didn't want to and that was because they
maybe they can fit in or maybe the job
wasn't what they wanted to be doing or
so on so it's not like every time I step
working with someone it was because they
were bad it about what they did have
have I ever I don't think that I've ever
let someone go for those reasons I
actually find that to be an easier thing
to kind of stuff out more quickly is
this person you know a culture fit here
to figure out then is this person you
know as competent and reliable as they
might you know protect themselves today
yeah yes I I asked that question because
in my experience especially for the like
junior level roles you know you don't
have to have a basic
that a lot of times what what happens at
least for much for what I've taken away
is that sometimes they're more looking
for a good fit that they can mold into
the developer that they want that will
you know stay longer or just someone
they can work with a lot of times rather
than the great guy who doesn't really
work well except by himself yeah yes I
you know one of the things that I like
to try to do is I try to not which is of
how I work with people I trying to try
to figure out a way that works for their
style of working so like if you're the
kind if you there are if you're the
developer type who wants to put your
head down who does like to talk to
people I like you know you're productive
and I'll try to give you a good
environment and a good word so that
works for that kind of person if you're
the kind of developer who is very
engaged it likes to talk problems
through with people all the other time I
try to accommodate that too I'm a big
fan of that you've ever heard a month
you know Moneyball so I I think that's
especially if you're a smaller company
that's the right way to hire people
right yeah it's obviously the person no
it's not a hundred percent true but odds
are if you got the computer science
degree from MIT you're competent
programmer right like odds almost all
those people are going to become from
programs but everyone knows that and
those people are going to have you know
high salaries and they're going to be in
demand everyone there the money pin in
baseball there the guy who hits 50 home
runs in your has a better and everyone
knows they're good if you're a small
company I think what you want to try to
do is try to find the sort of rough
diamonds the people who maybe they do
have a personality quirk and if you can
work around that a little bit they're
really good employees or maybe they
maybe they you know they're undervalued
for some other reason or whatever so I
actually kind of like working with
people or maybe a little bit quirky a
little bit different or whatever because
I'm I don't you're not going to put me
off and I sometimes you can kind of get
a good team of people who are a little a
little bit different so no so let's jump
back in the library real quick
you just announced that it's going to be
going to open beta pretty soon now we'll
what do you but between beta and then
you know the full release what sort of
changes are you expecting or you know
potential updates in a perfect world
would you like for your platform so the
we've been in closed beta because
basically it's been very unreliable as
we're seeing good reliability we're
going to move to open data the open beta
will still be missing it's missing
features that like clearly people are
going to want like a lot of stuff that I
would actually like to be able to
deliver to creators like yourselves in
terms of analytics tools and insights
and stuff like that it's not there
there's more work that we need to do in
the in sort of the UI and the
recommendation side of things there's
definitely a lot of work to be done
there however what the open beta will
showcase is that it's possible to build
this kind of system it's possible to in
a completely decentralized way provide
not just the ability to access content
which we've known has been possible for
a while via BitTorrent but also to
discover it than to purchase it as well
and that's the new part and so that the
open data will showcase that these
things are possible that they can be
done in relatively performant ways and
they can be done in ways that create a
good you know user experience nice and
so is it because I've watched things
that there's a hundred second
introduction video that as for me like
very hippie dippity notice okay can I do
it I is it okay to do its creature
because I don't mind just popping it up
for a second and showing you again let's
say there should be a screen share
button on left hand side let's go ahead
and do that let's dive into it yeah i'll
just share that out and actually i
already have it running okay so this is
the we're switching to a version that is
going to be based on electron rather
than the browser but this is it we're
viewing this is the homepage for library
sometimes i call it when i'm doing a
demo but i will actually sometimes call
it the world's most boring demo because
we're not trying to be
you innovative in terms of the UI or in
terms of like this is all stuff that
we've done before you know we know how
to access to quick watch and have a
video come up and I will go ahead and do
this this is this is a great movie
actually this is called coherence this
is put out by oscilloscope laboratories
which is a great kind of their like uh
they're in Hollywood they do more indie
stuff but right it's a quick play i'm
watching a movie you know i can i can i
can search for stuff if i want to
publish stuff and it's it's going to be
fairly straightforward but what's really
cool is that all of this is happening
and you'll see actually here in my url
bar I'm not accessing a website and
actually accessing a little thing that's
running locally and what that's able to
do is search search the network access
something and pay for something all
without any kind of centralization all
without any authority that's in charge
of the whole network now is this going
to be streaming it or are you going to
need to download these files so you can
stream it's been designed with streaming
in mind which BitTorrent was not
designed the streaming in mind this is
the hippie video I believe who you
watched and yes a bit torrent was not
designed to streaming in mind this has
been designed with streaming in the hood
all right now are you able to turn off
the debt like say I upload a video but I
don't want people to have the ability to
download it i want them to only a baby
five dollars or whatever it is and then
they can watch it on on library so right
now we do not make a distinction between
streaming and downloading if you stream
it it will also download it that we may
uh just a puff up the screech engine
really we may go we may add support for
a feature like that if we see strong
demand for it part of I personally I
think it's a little bit silly right like
we're kind of just pretending that when
you're streaming something you're not
actually downloading it and part of what
library is trying to do is acknowledge
certain realities about how moving bits
around work that I think content
companies do sometimes want to like put
their fingers in their ears and not and
not believe in the case but they're
coming more and more around and actually
I've been surprised
you know I've obviously explained I'm
very upfront with how the system works
and its properties as I've explained it
to to a lot of the publishers they're
actually more keyed in and they get fit
like you know that the way that stuff
works that there's no there's no
actually at there's no actual way to
stop someone from being able to download
a video right look if you're letting
someone stream it to their computer you
can't stop that person from saving it if
they want to was there was there
anything else that you'd like to cover
about library well so I mean I know a
lot of the people that you know watch
your show or if they're into programming
something that's really cool about
library is it actually provides an
entire API actually I'll just do another
up to another quick screen share here so
this when this is running and there's
running so right yeah it's actually
providing it's packaged separately you
can install it and it's providing a set
of api's that you can call from anywhere
and in fact I can even just call them
via curl let me grip so right any
programming language is going to have
whether use curl or something else is
going to have an ability to interact to
make simple calls and interact with a
web server so I'm just going to make a
call here this one is going to give me
the status that's probably a very
exciting what's still more exciting one
maybe they'll call I'll just but now
I don't know if you're comfortable
saying it so how if you don't want to
buy help me say you know don't want to
save it how many how many users is
library currently out so we have a
hundred and seventy five thousand people
on our list for the beta we've actually
only let in less than ten thousand of
those because we've been having we were
having a lot of trouble getting the
getting the system to work I hate typing
in curl parameters from the Commandant
males do and we have a CLI vision so
that's an example of a making an API
call to just resolve but you put a
little URL look up and I can get the
metadata back about you know what is it
who published it for that URL and this
is what's really really cool about this
is all the other ways of doing this they
involve a centralized authority that
provides this we do it and it's only
powered by the people who are running
the software itself and similarly if I
wanted to download it I would just make
the call just called get and that's
gonna that's going to start downloading
it for me and downloading it to my local
machine and so there's just a set you
know it happens it actually only
provides I think it's about 50 things
and it's real easy to install and anyone
with even moderate programming ability
can use this as as a database and as a
back-end to build all kinds of services
it doesn't have to be a video service
you could do you know distributing CAD
files you can do all kinds of different
stuff we have a guide for programmers
it's at lbr why I 0 slash quickstart
there's actually a new version of it
coming out just this coming week so
hopefully by the time the show is out it
will already be up there's a version up
now it's slightly older but it's
basically designed for programmers even
even more novice programmers you can be
up and running and talking to this API
and and be building things against that
are doing really cool stuff with it nice
so I noticed that you guys are using a
credit system which sounds like you're
probably
changing cash or some sort of credits is
that is that how you're buying like
videos that's right so in terms of the
way that the protocols specified the
protocol actually says that whatever two
parties are willing to kind of handshake
and agree on that's totally cool um we
have a credit system for our block chain
so and again block came and every other
word blockchain just think database so
for our database of content that does
involve having its own credit system
because all blockchains require some
kind of token to power them so we use
our own credit system to maintain that
catalog that's the only time that our
credit system is actually like a hard
requirement it's also optional to use
our credit system for other kinds of
payments and that's the default behavior
but that's not like a rule and so if
people want to pay dollars and people
want to pay Bitcoin I want to pay
whatever that's all supportive so how
many let's say 100 credits was that you
know in USD for instance right now it's
probably that's probably so about two
dollars that's what people would buy and
sell 100 credits for about two dollars
cool however that's a market price and I
do as always have to say that these
correct you know sometimes people like
to buy and sell these and speculate
these speculate in these we discourage
that we would like people only to bind
by those credits for usage on the
network let's try to you know the new
bitcoins trying to salute like that yeah
yeah well I mean I just there's so much
hype there and I don't want you know I
don't want to see people put their money
into something that's like I want people
to put their money in it to use it I
don't want to see people you know
risking their money on something that is
like look this is a this is the early
days of something we think we're trying
to do something really really absolutely
you know amazing and we think the
potential here is really large but I
don't I don't like the i'm personally
uncomfortable at the idea of you know
people putting large chunks of money
into something at this stage and you
know they can't uh it's r it's risky
we're doing this is a risky endeavor
yeah i personally love the idea i'm very
excited to hear once you guys are I feel
like nowadays food companies give it
they're like look we're saying it
beta for a while until we go fishing
like everything's worked out and when
you're there I'm pretty excited to see
and hear updates about what what changes
have taken place and I've been I've been
thinking about originally i believe i
was talking to riley if i remember
correctly and so it sounded like i
wasn't going to be able to sell my
videos but if that's an option i love
the idea of your sort of marketplace if
you will where i can take my videos
throw it on another platform be like hey
if you want to buy it and you want to
have it you know accessible you know
five dollars here's this video and so
it's something that I'm probably going
to spend some time this weekend
transferring over my videos and setting
up market price room oh that would be
wonderful so we absolutely totally
support that as a programmer yourself I
would actually let you know if you've
got a large databases video yes i would
recommend on your trash dissing it
rather than I mean you can go through
the UI and click publish a hundred times
but we've got a nice little API you can
you can do that in a programmatic
fashion now it needs a little bit of
cleanup but it is it's enough it's in a
pretty tolerable and usable state and
yeah that's I mean that is absolutely
one of the use cases that we want to
support so that you can make it you can
sell your videos you can pick whatever
price you want and people can come on
and download them and you get one
hundred percent of that money and we
take that as an idea that will be
appealing to a lot of people well thank
you for taking the time I hope to do a
follow-up interview when you guys you
know I know you're just going to open
data but maybe towards the end of it and
you're ready to release it whoever knows
how long that's going to be right but I
would love to see all the progress is
going on yeah wonderful thank you very
much jealous I think have a go away hey
