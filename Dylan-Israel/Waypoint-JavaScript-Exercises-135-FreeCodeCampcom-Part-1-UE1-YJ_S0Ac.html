working on our web developer certificate
we gotta get through basic JavaScript
here object oriental programming and
then basic algorithms scripting this is
really kind of cool 50 hours of stuff
here so we're doing actually full
projects I'm very excited about it and
this is stuff that you're actually gonna
use like your name you're gonna need to
know how to reverse a string obviously
but anyhow so uh let's get started with
our basic javascript comment your
JavaScript code so I've taken some
JavaScript and let's see this is a
single line comment in one second the
way I'm kind of doing this is I'm kind
of giving myself a timer so let's give a
let's give ourselves a timer for this I
suggest you do the same thing if you're
trying to work on something everyday so
just go ahead and throw like I'm doing
30 minutes right now so in 30 minutes
what can I get done so we got our first
comment now let's do a multi-line
comment and slash star star slash and
reminder this is a three hour of course
usually we're doing things about a third
of the time so multi dash line comment
period so maybe we'll go a little bit
quicker maybe we'll go a little bit
slower but I I imagine this will take us
about an hour
so welcome Williams so welcome Williams
should return true so change doesn't
true cool and now returns true not too
shabby
my name's sherry a stream that contains
at least one character in it all right
so we'll save our my name equals Dylan
run that
Oh make sure that's correct gents so
we're using camelcase not too bad all
right what else are we working on here
my first name should be oh I forgot I
moved the game whoops I forgot I move my
my webcam for uh senator video I was
making it looks like this lights shining
quite brightly so let's go ahead and
we'll go night vision mode on this
that's not too bad
my first thing should be string with at
least one character in it and well so
we'll save our my first name and
JavaScript knows this is a string just
by how we're using our quotes here and
we'll do my first name it's Dylan
and my lap bar my last name and also
equal to Israel and also Alan Turing
kind of the father of computer science
very good movie one second we're gonna
turn off flux real quick very good movie
if you're interested in the Turing
machine I believe it's what it was
called
and a very good very interesting so
should be equal eight so we're gonna
save our last name so he won't just set
this equal eight and so we set that
equal to an integer and you should be
getting the length of last name you
should be getting the length of last
name by using dot length so uh so this
will be my new last name dot length just
outlines okay just don't leave
so cool not cool so the first letter a
first letter of last name should be L
the first letter of first letter last
name should be equal to last name dot so
you want we want to get our zero index
so in this case first letter of last
name first name zero is a da so it's
going to give us zero or our L rather
for first letter last name
Lovelace there you go all right so third
letter of last name so again we're just
going to go to our last name the third
letter would be the second index lot
very cool so Lovelace last letter of
last name should be an e last letter of
last name should be nice so our last
name so I guess they want us to get the
e o are the last year rather so we have
eight letter words so that would be the
seventh index fine and last you should
have to use Dalian to get the last
letter okay so another way we can do
this is we can call dot length minus 1
because the length is always going to be
one greater because we start at one
Oh
what are we doing around here
not here let's see if they want us to
bracket this up like in the example
there we go so apparently we have to
call that and then I thought we were
just checking the length my mistake so
what what I actually made a mistake on
is when we do the last name dot length
what's actually getting returned here
only minus one is seven so what we want
is to take the string last name and for
the spot that's last name dot length
this is a number remember not a string
minus one get that in index spot so
that's what's going on there
alright so 2nd to last name should be C
all right and they want to use that line
so again we're taking the string last
name we're finding the length of it so
it's gonna be last name dot length and
then we want to - how many we want to -
- to give us our our goal there so not
too shabby mark this the variable sum
equal to 20 so there's just that just
change the value there subtract one
number from another JavaScript and we
want to equal to 12 so 45 minus 12 is 33
so 45 minus X 3 is 12
cool our plus 3 3 is 12 so let's see
here make the product equal to 80 so
just between times that by 10 it's just
a stroke this is should all be pretty
familiar if you've done any sort of
coding so make the quotient equal to 2
so 66 divided by 33 is too bad my
decimal should be a decimal point number
let's create a variable in my decimal
DOS am I so we'll say var my desk
decimal is equal to we'll just say
higher decimal
and of course make sure you spell stuff
correctly cool we just all we did there
was create a decimal and we just set it
to the one they already had so we want
to make the product equal to 5.0 so two
point no times and the reason they're
doing it with just not two times two
anything 2.0 is we want it to get a
floating point so that's why we're doing
two times two point five instead of
doing like five times a one all right so
make the quotient equal to 2 point 2 so
4 times 2 is 4 so I believe 4 point 4
will come back to 2 point 2 cool so
we're just dividing with different types
of data so floating points and Hannah
truce and everything else so we want the
first item in my so we're working with
arrays now so what arrays are is they
take in groups of data and it's stored
in a variable so he wants the first one
to be a string so let's do pizza poker
guy 87 and we'll put a comma in between
here and we want the second one to be a
number notice how we don't use
quotations because we need this to know
that this is an integer then when we run
it we're good to go
so my race should have at least one
array nested within another array so we
want so what we they have an array var
our array and in this case you can have
an array within an array
once you get past doing more than two of
these think it's a little complicated so
in this case we're just going to
substitute our array into my array and
now it's going to inherit from that so
the variable my data should be equal to
the first value of my array so we're
going to create a variable my data and
we're set it equal to my array and we
want the first value and again array
indexes start
at zero oops
and I say started there I put a 1 in
start at zero and there we go
not too shabby we're blowing through
this right now I really feel pretty good
about this
so my array should be 3 to 3 so we're
gonna say my array at 0 is equal to 3
and then we can do it again my array at
1 is actually we only need to change the
1 because the other ones to 3 so we
changed this one and now we're gonna get
3 2 3 so all we did was we chose this
index and we said look override it and
set it equal to 3 my race should only
contain John 23 and so how do we remove
stuff it's called the dot pop pop on an
array well we'll remove or get the very
last value it's not going to remove it's
gonna get the very last item so we're
gonna say removed from my array is equal
to my array dot pop and I believe that's
correct so so there we go so what we did
was we popped this part off and now we
have Katan - I'm good to go here
my ratio not equal John 23 dog 3 so not
only can Papa theta you can also push
data on to the end of the array so what
do we want to do we want to say my array
dot push and
my rationale equal so my array not pop
so what is my rate myarray is equal to
this and we want to dot push John also
pushing I think they just want to sit up
I I may be mistaken by believes this is
already working dog three okay so we
want to add it to it so we're gonna say
my I see what's going on now so we only
have John 23 and we want to add dog and
three so we want to dot push it on so
this is the opposite we're actually
going to be adding something and here we
want to add a string that's dog and we
want to add a value of three and I
believe we're going to need two of these
this is a oops
so here we go so we're putting in an
array here of a dog and three and we're
pushing it to the end of it so wherever
it's at push it to the end all right so
now my ratio now equal 23 in dog 3 my
array is equal to so how do you want to
remove stuff so we're gonna say my array
is equal to or my rate a shift so my
array dot shift will will remove the
last or the first value so now that does
that and then we're gonna set this equal
to my array dot shift
area
so my race should now have Paul 23 and
dog three so there's also an unshipped
so we can say my array dot unchipped and
in this case we want to add Paul so I'm
sure if we should move it to the front
of the array
that's how shift removes the front away
unshifted move moves it to the front of
the array alright so now we're working
with functions you can see here that
when we define our function we have two
variables a which is equal to an integer
that's equal to four and be an integer
equal to five and then we just say we
need to take any sort of input here and
then return the value of it so let's go
ahead and get started we want to change
this so that now when we add it it
returns nine so let's go ahead and just
add that up
all right so make sure we call the
function as well so we'll say our
function and then we want to put in a
comma B so that returned nine your
function or the value of a plus B
hmm I should Richard nein
I return FF vehicles my function av
so that returns the value maybe they
wanted it within the bracket here I
don't know why
oh I don't think they want us to change
that so instead what we'll do is we'll
just say oh we want we want they've
actually wanted us to create our own
function and not change our function so
we're gonna create a function to call my
function and it's gonna take in an a or
and a be like our function and they
should just name this subtractive
addition we've been when she's here in
return it's going to return the combined
value of a plus B and now when we run it
there we go so that's all what's going
on they're off the charts they say all
right so my doctor came containing the
property name and and it should be a
stream so my dog we're gonna take an 8
this is the name property and we're
gonna set it equal to we'll set it equal
to my mom's dog's name is Stella don't
put a comma and Boop's and that it's not
equals it's a colon I always forget that
so you know we can run and make sure
we're on the right track cool so next it
needs a legs
Stella currently has three legs and
hopefully it's stay that way unforced
and this is an integer you can see here
and then tails and these don't have to
be strings but they all are in this case
so tails and we'll set that equal to one
and then we also have friends and that
is a array so we have a string to int
and now an array and in our array will
say everyone
and you notice that where there's no
coal comma after that and cool so we've
created our power level 9000 I like that
watching the I'm watching Dragon Ball
super I'm not gonna lie I'm not gonna
lie man I am watching it all the time
alright so now we need to update this so
apparently something happened to my dog
and we want to change it so we want to
say my dog dot name is equal equal to or
equal to excuse me equal to and what do
we want a name happy coder
so what we're doing is we're saying
select my dog from there select the name
parameter set it equal to happy coder
cool add the property bark to my dog so
how do we do that
so we now want to say we want to select
our dog again my dog bark and we're
gonna set it equal to bow - Wow and so
now when we call on my dog I would be
able to bark you see her hair bark la la
Bow Wow
all right let's see out of curiosity
where we're at so we've been working at
about 20 minutes but things are going
really fast so we're almost we're almost
halfway so we'll probably end up
finishing this up in about half an it
about 45 minutes so it wants us to
delete the property from tails so how do
we do that we say delete and then we
choose my dog and we say dot tails I
don't know that's how it does it very
nice cool so you should be using a for
loop for this my array should equal zero
one two three four okay
so what we're doing here is we're going
to put zero so they want us to iterate
they want us to do a for loop so easy
enough so we're gonna set a variable I
equal to zero what this is doing is this
is where we're setting a variable to
keep track of how many times we want to
iterate through and while that is less
than five we wanted to continue doing
that and it's going to increase by one
every time so in this case we're
actually going to put this below it so
we're gonna iterate through and in here
we're gonna say my array and then we're
gonna put I in here for that index value
that we're currently on which will start
at zero we want to then push the number
I meaning we just want to put a zero
we're going to put a zero to it
Oh apparently we don't need to do it
like that that's actually Java syntax to
do that
so again just paid pay attention we're
doing JavaScript not Java I typically
work with Java so sometimes I'll make
that mistake well it's more important
just to know constructional e mentally
how to do things then it is to know
syntax you can always look syntax up so
we're in create another for loop will
save our I is equal to the zero in this
case what are we going to do it one
three five seven nine okay so I'll say I
is equal to one will start at one and
while one is less than nine let's say
one three five seven nine okay so while
I is less than nine I is equal to I I
plus two so we're gonna increase by two
here so what do we do here we are going
to again take my array and we're gonna
say dot push add it to wherever the
array we don't push our I through so
push remember push puts you at the end
of the array so it's gonna go one three
five seven nine and then eyes equal to
nine it's not gonna go any more or it
won't work at all let's see here
alright is equal 1 all right oh well I
is less than nice so what happened there
is one is always less than so one three
five seven
Oh apparently this needs to be ten so
forget what I said less than equal would
have worked right there so let's put
that nine do listening eagle
and there we go cool not too shabby
not too shabby at all all right so you
should be using a for loop for this
again another for loop we're gonna
create our count variable and we're
gonna set it equal to set it equal to
nine and we'll say well it's so while I
is greater than nine greater than 0
greater than or equal to one let's say
we're going to activate - I'll just say
greater than zero I is equal to I minus
two and then in here what we want to do
is we just want to my array dot push our
value so we're actually going backwards
this time so notice how this is greater
than and this is is minus and then BAM
so it's gonna go nine seven five three
one stop you see our output right here
so here Waypoint iterate with JavaScript
so so another way we can do this is we
can create a variable so we're gonna
create a variable I and we're gonna set
it equal to 0 it's gonna feel kind of
similar to to what we've done except
we're gonna use a while loop and what
this is saying is while I is less than 5
kind of like our for loop
it's the beginning like the mid part of
our for loop we want to instantiate here
my array dot push and we want to put our
I value like we did before except in
here we're gonna say I plus plus now
what I plus plus is is I plus plus as I
is equal to I plus 1 so that's what I
plus plus this here this is just
shorthand just wait do things quicker I
personally like doing I is equal I plus
1 because it just it tells you exactly
what it is and I think it's helpful but
anyone who does any code and will know
what I plus plus is most of the time so
my number returned my function should be
a decimal
so we want to return so we're gonna call
in the math dot random library so math
is library and we're calling on the
random function so this is something
that we that isn't naturally encouraged
in JavaScript and we're gonna say look
import this math library and use the dot
random and generate a random number so a
random decimal so here you see right
here is our random decimal and it
changes again not too bad not too bad
alright so you should have multiplied
the result of math dot random by 10 make
sure it's between it so the decimal is
between 1 like 1.0 in point 0 0 to a
bazillion decimal places as you can see
here so in this case we're going to do
math dot random and we want we want it
between we want it between 1 and 10 or 0
&amp;amp; 9 so what we do is we multiply this by
10
except they want us to do it in brackets
like here so there we go I think they
both work don't quote me on that but
they should both work it's just this is
how they prefer you do it all right so
we want to create a function called my
function so here's that they have a set
up for us and we want to set we want to
say my men is equal to math dot math dot
random
oops and then we want to say my max is
equal to math dot random
oh look they have actually somewhere
they want to some way they want us to do
this so it looks like our timer is about
to go off so I'm gonna go ahead and
pause that and we'll finish this I think
we can finish this section up in another
15 minutes so let's go ahead and see
what this does
so Matt top floor max is not defined so
we want to say find two variables my men
and my max and the balls equal the
numbers Oh
so there we go and we want to put that
in there max is not defined and this is
actually how we want to do it we want to
see my Max and let's see my min and
let's see if this works anything I mean
it's not defined plus my man
my function should use both my Max and
my man and return a random number in
your range the random number generated
by my French were greater than equal to
minimum my number so my function I don't
understand what the math tough floor
does so this is you're not gonna
generate a random number actually let's
do it like this so we can say will save
our man is equals thanks for watching
the video don't forget to Like and
subscribe that'd be great and leave me a
comment letting me know what you liked
