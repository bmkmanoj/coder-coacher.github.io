is a freelance web designer he's also
been a CEO uxu I project manager and a
whole bunch of other things very
established individual and we'll be
talking about a lot about design with
tools to use what skills you can learn
freelancing being a freelance designer
design versus development a lot a lot of
things like that we're also be talking
about this course which is completely
devoted to helping you get a job in the
tech industry or is tech space whether
its development design project
management all of that which is cool
because a lot of courses out there only
talk about skills and it's a skill in
itself to get hired and it's really hard
when you're at a junior level and as
something we talked about as well the
description for that will be our link
will be in the description I hope you
guys enjoy this I I really enjoyed
talking to Tim and i'll probably have
them on in the future thanks for
watching code everything ok so um
there's couple things I wanted to cover
today obviously we're going to be
talking about purposeful um dive in that
a little bit uh and then talk about your
experience and why the the course kind
of changed over time a little bit and
what you what you think because I get
this question all the time is like
should be designers I be a developer and
I i I'm a developer so I'm a little
biased so I like to carry design a
designer point of view so would you mind
kind of giving yourself introduction for
people who may not know you yeah so my
name is Tim netsol right now I'm a
freelance designer and I'm working on a
project called purposeful which is all
about how to find and really your dream
job in tech but before that I've I've
led design for a number of startups and
originally started my career as a
consultant which I J absolutely hated i
was i was traveling four or five days a
week to glamorous places like the Kip
see and you know really just wasn't
enjoying it so i quit i started my own
startup um we we designed one of the top
apps in the App Store
but the business itself just wasn't
making a ton of money and that really
kind of made me step back and sort of
re-evaluate my career as a whole and
just kind of what I wanted to do um you
know a little bit a little bit more
thorough early and I kind of didn't want
to take another job but I wasn't going
to absolutely love and so that's that's
sort of how I got into design was was
really just kind of thinking about what
would make me happy and you know kind of
analyzing that and um you know I went
from I was basically like broke at the
time because my startup was failing and
I went kind of from from broke to having
like a fantastic job that was paying
well and working with amazing people and
that sort of prompted just like a
fascination how to how to do that
whether whether or not I just kind of
got lucky or if it was something that
was repeatable and um turns out it is so
um you know kind of encoding people on
that as well so that's kind of one of us
too nice and uh so purposeful your main
focus right now and working as a
freelance designer now um what so one of
the things I really liked about it and
like the idea behind it because I be
fairly honest I have yet to watch any
videos but like I've been looking at at
the the titles it's all about how to
actually get your foot in the door isn't
it exactly that's exactly right so you
know I work I work with people who were
really kind of all from all walks of
life you know people who just graduated
college and trying to figure out how
lamb their first job a couple of work
with a couple of people who are in their
50s and um you know I've had other other
careers and are trying to figure out um
you know how to sort of reboot their
career and get their foot in the door in
tech and it really it really is exactly
about that like how you figure out a
what you want you want to be a designer
or developer or you know do QA or you
know whatever and then be how to go get
that quickly um you know cuz I think a
lot of people think it's a has to be
like a multi-year process and you know
they've got to be great coders or you
know tons about design and honestly
just not totally true um you know you
definitely definitely have to learn and
have to hustle but there's a way to do
it quickly and efficiently and um you
know that's kind of what course focuses
on nice and that I it's funny we were
just talking about like I'm kind of
people are kind of intimidated apply
when they don't have any resume
experience and trying to get their foot
in the door cuz you have these long list
like 30 skills with multiple years
experience things I don't I don't even
like like we won't you have ten years in
angular 2 and angular 2 came out last
year you know like a couple let's go is
like just recruit bit but I tell people
like look if you kind of need about half
the requirements or you think you do you
should just go ahead and apply what's it
gonna what's it gonna cost you yeah I
think I think that's absolutely true and
i actually just interviewed a bunch of
folks who run um tax and design
departments at startups and ask them
kind of with their thoughts on it were
and you know the thing i heard over and
over again from people was just that
it's really about you and your
willingness to learn and your
personality and whether or not you'll
fit in with the team you know way more
than what's on your resume or which on
your portfolio you know those are just
tools to get you in in the door um you
know and so you really should think
about them that way yeah I I tend to
agree i add some people don't really put
an emphasis on marketing yourself as
much as they should and having a strong
portfolio and like what that even means
right which people at all the time i say
have a strong portfolio but when you're
when you're you know a junior level dev
or a junior level designer and you have
no resume experience what like how do i
do it how do i market myself you get all
this great work and all this great stuff
to show but if you don't show it in the
right way you're really gonna lose a lot
of value right yeah no it's I think
that's exactly right it's it's
interesting I work I work with a lot of
designers um and devs and one of the
things I kind of see over and over again
that's just a really big mistake that
people make is really just kind of
putting their work out there and
thinking that it's going to speak for
itself um and you know if if you were
the user of a particular piece of design
or a particular piece of code that
probably is true
um but if you're evaluating it as a
recruiter um it's not like they need to
know the context right what did what was
I able to accomplish for the business
you know what was the business problem
how did I fix it that kind of stuff um
and so kind of giving that context and
saying like all right he was the problem
here's the approach I took and you know
he really you know amazing results we
were able to do x y&amp;amp;z really just kind
of motivates employers to talk to you in
a way that kind of just putting your
work out there um doesn't now let's jump
over to the kind of more of the design
UI UX fic you have you have you senior
ux designer at a company called we swear
it looks like you took on several roles
at some point what what sort of tools
did are actually used in the workplace
for you doing ux yeah um you know it
kind of depends on what you're working
on um you know the honestly the biggest
tool um this is this is gonna sound
ridiculous is like a pen and a piece
paper or whiteboard um you know and
you're really just your sketching out
problems and and you know trying to
figure out different approaches but but
digitally all over the place I'd say
most most UI designers work in an app
called sketch um which is you know it's
a vector based app for for Mac it's it's
basically if you think of like Photoshop
or illustrator but just way more
streamlines um and then there's a lot of
user testing tools that that we use and
even sometimes if you want to do
something really low fidelity you lose
like balsamiq mockups but then you know
at least least for me I'm you know I
also do front end dev and so a lot of
times i'm working in in sublime you know
or another text editor and um you know
so really just depends on the project
nice no i'm looking at at your linkedin
and you have a very established like
years of experience like i have no doubt
you have it's much easier for you to get
work than probably someone's just
starting out so say someone is trying to
be a freelance designer ux
I will kind of be your advice for them
when they're looking for work yeah um so
I I think there's there's a couple of
approaches to take and one of the one of
the things that I kind of recommend when
people are just getting started is to go
do a couple of quick projects for free
so basically volunteer for some from for
some small kind of early-stage startups
that just like desperately need the help
and get a couple of portfolio items i'm
talking like you know do like a week of
like nights and weekends for you know
not something huge but then basically so
you get a couple of portfolio items that
aren't just like okay here's my personal
website that i built or this hobby
project and those are great you should
definitely do that stuff too um but if
you've got a couple of things where you
can say okay like I actually worked with
this company and you know get a
reference from that company and you can
categorize it as freelancing on your
resume or or whatever um I think that
that's that's just really really
effective um you know it's it's a great
way to get like a couple of just like
quick shots of experience without um you
know putting time to time anything no um
some people are always concerned it all
comes down to money a lot of times with
some people and um it's it's interesting
because that I I'm a very money
motivated individual I get it but I feel
like sometimes design gets overlooked in
terms of oh we pay the developers this
amount and we always make sure we pay
designers this amount is that is that is
that like an individual scale or is that
more general or you think it comes down
to really the individual like what's it
what's your thoughts about that one
comes to money comparing designers to
developers um I think it totally depends
on on the individual uh you know i was i
was making significantly more than the
vast majority of the devs working at at
the company i was i was working at when
I kind of first started out and you know
it really is about kind of what you can
bring to the table and I keep seeing um
you know more and more companies trying
to hire people who are sort of cloth
across this
linaria right who are you know designers
who can do front end dev work you know
or developers who can design and those
honestly are the folks that they get
paid the best yeah definitely I uh so I
always tell people try and make yourself
as marketable as possible right so I do
i do a front end work and i actually
have video editing skills so when from
you know YouTube all that when my bosses
asked me but he had video editing skills
now I broke my hand based I said I can
and now it's kind of made yourself this
kind of merge role where now they don't
need to hire video ders but you can do a
little bit there a little bit more in it
you kind of add more value and you're
worth more at the end of the year when
your race comes along right right that's
that's that's exactly right you know I
mean the more value you can add the kind
of get out the more arrows you have in
your quiver in terms of skills and
capabilities that are for sure now
someone like me who is maybe design
challenged would probably be the best
way of putting what would you have a
free cuz I i love the logic I love the I
love learning I love building stuff I
don't necessarily have the passion to
make it look good or even maybe the
skill set right what would kind of be
your advice for someone like me who
wants to improve upon that yeah I mean I
think honestly the first thing is is to
think about it a little bit differently
I was you know definitely kind of design
challenged myself growing up it wasn't
kind of the the thing that came
naturally to me at all um but I think
what change was because I actually you
know like I got I got into this field
like when I built my first website when
I was like eight um you know and i'm a
huge nerd so it was like it was a star
wars website and i was you know just
totally geeking out but um you know so i
I've always kind of had that logical
approach to two and it's very much
design is very very logical actually you
know it's really just about
understanding people's motivations and
translating that into something that
works and so you know first of all
there's there's there's more than one
kind of design right there's UX design
and and there's UI design and user
testing and user research and you know
like there's still a whole bunch of
different things
than design so you don't have to start
with the visuals but even if you do
there's totally a logic to it right like
you know one of the one of the rules um
you know that's that that you kind of
here pretty frequently is that light
comes from the sky right and and it's it
sounds obvious in your comic yeah what
does that have to do with design right
but when you look at like a button um
you know it tends to be and this is a
little bit less true with flat design
but it tends tends to have kind of
darker edges on the bottom and so it's
like okay like you know that rule and it
it totally makes designing easier right
and it's you know it's it's kind of the
same type of things like all right you
know like um how to how to take like a
functional programming approach or or
whatever right like there you don't
always have to do that um but they're
sort of recommended things that you can
do and once you sort of know those um it
becomes a lot easier to sort of do
visual design nice now so I I'm the more
I look at your you're very impressive
linkedin here um I see that you've
actually it seems to me just by scanning
it that you've kind of jumped physicians
a little bit like you've done a little
bit of everything this is something that
you think is a good idea for a lot of
people or there's risks but reward at
the same time so like you were a project
manager business analyst you know uh CEO
then you went into senior ux design
director product is I ahead of research
and development out of freelance
designer it seems like you've kind of
jumped around a little bit is that kind
of a normal path for a lot of people um
I think I think it is and the the kind
of the the big distinction I draw is
basically that there's there's a big
difference between what your title is
what you're actually doing um and like
if you if you kind of look at what i was
doing really even in that business
analyst role on though i didn't realize
it at the time it was really was really
kind of UX in product design um and and
so sometimes that's sort of titled a
little bit differently and it's a little
bit you know that's a lot less true
actually with developers right there
there tend to be kind of pretty typical
roles um but as long as you can kind of
tell
a cohesive story about your career and
this is totally applicable to developers
to um it's okay to jump around and try
and try different things right you know
and so for me I was kind of able to say
really and I actually kind of just said
it I didn't realize it at the time but I
was actually doing UX design you know at
in my consulting job as a business
analyst and I really kind of just I
continue to get more and more interested
in that just kind of moved in that
direction and it and as long as you can
kind of tell that sort of cohesive story
employers love it and actually I
actually think it's free helpful because
it sort of gives some context and and
paid pain to you as a passionate person
which employers really want they want
someone who's kind of like excited about
their work not someone who just kind of
shows up and clocks in yeah and that
goes back a little bit too what were you
saying earlier about it it's really on
the individual to prove that they're not
just here to get a paycheck like
everyone knows your show up for the
paycheck but also like what makes you
unique to the fact that like AI I want
to hire this guy even like and sometimes
they'll hire less qualified candidates
just because like I think I could work
with this guy cuz i got see his ugly
face 50 hours a week sometimes it's so
you just gotta able to be that guy right
yeah now that's that's exactly true
right like when it comes down to it
there are literally only three things
that employers are looking for you know
they'll ask questions and interviews in
a million different ways but they really
want to know if you can do work if
you'll fit in with the team and if you
really want to be there and it's
actually the second and third of those
three that are the most important um you
know because they can they can work with
you particularly if you're if you're on
a junior side like you can learn how to
do work as long as you're really
sufficiently motivated you really want
to be there and so like that's that's
what people are looking for more than
anything else yeah it's someone else an
interesting question and I found this
when I was looking for junior level
roses just thought what you as someone
who's probably worked with more
developers than myself uh what do you
what is your opinion about companies
that put June
in front of like front-end developer or
stuff like that is because they were
asking if it's just a way of paying
people less money sometimes and to me I
definitely noticed that is that
something that you have any knowledge or
opinion about um you know I wouldn't say
I have a have a strong opinion about it
um you know I think I think it depends
on the company right there's there's
there's some companies where like when
they hire junior DAV's they really are
Junior um and they've built programs
within the company designed to make them
no longer junior right and so it's it's
kind of an acknowledgement in in good
companies that like hey we're tracking
you in you know putting you on this
track to get to a place where you're
more experienced and you can handle more
things by yourself and you know and be
more productive and we've got the we've
got the stuff in place to do that but
then for other companies yeah it's
really just kind of a way to say all
right you're younger we're gonna tell us
um you know and I think you know I
frankly think that's bullshit um you
know and is it one of one of the best
people I worked with at we spire was
still in college and he was one of the
best front-end devs I've ever seen um
the guy was just fantastic because he
because he cared about it right and so
to like have have him be at a company
were like he was just sort of yeah
slapped with a junior dev title um you
know I would I would be really mad on
his behalf so you know I guess that's
kind of my thought on it is it really
does depend and I guess I'd encourage
people to worry a little bit less about
the title and a little bit more about
how the company actually treats you you
know are they are you working with
supportive and inspiring people and as
the company really investing and getting
you to the next level yeah I tend to
agree I think you can learn a lot just
by like googling a little bit about a
company and seeing what people have
reviewed not like I would um across
country from California to Florida
without ever meeting the people I worked
on and when I googled it the things on
glassdoor we're great company love the
CEO love this
I was like all right I'm there let's go
like good yeah no I I think that's
exactly right like tools like glass door
I think are fantastic you know you can
take individual reviews with a grain of
salt but when you're kind of looking at
the trend and you can see it like ok
these seem legit you know it's not just
a couple of people company making a
bunch of stuff off and they're
consistent um you know you you know
you've got a pretty good company on your
hands no I do are there um so at least
at the the I've only worked at two
software company so my experience is
limited but uh at least on my old
company we had about 15 developers a 1
UI UX set in the same role now is that
is that something that is pretty common
we're like ratio wise is it usually very
few designers to the developers um it
actually kind of depends on the product
um you know and so so like it we spire
we were doing behavior change design and
so basically the the product was
designed help companies motivate their
employees to to do different things like
volunteer or be more sustainable things
like that on and so because the product
was literally design our ratio of
designers to developers was a lot higher
it was more like 12 4 and you know and
so you'll kind of you'll kind of see
that that it that it depends um you know
if you're working with like a really
technical product like there's there's a
company right down the road from me
called Akamai and basically what they do
is make the internet go faster um and
you know so like their their ratio
designers to developers probably like 12
30 um you know and so it really it
really kind of does depend now as a as a
freelance designer versus an in-house
designer or some things that you think
maybe someone might learn working
in-house at a company yeah I mean I I
think that's the first thing I'd say is
I would definitely recommend working
in-house for your first job no matter
what because you're just gonna pick up a
ton of stuff that you wouldn't
um you know if you're if you're trying a
freelance um and so it really runs the
gamut like it's it's great to kind of be
exposed to a bunch of different sort of
apps and tools but more than that I
think it's about approaches to solving
problems right because the reality is
there are very few new problems that
nobody solved before and so you if you
can get into a room and sort of talk
things through with other people and not
have it 100% on your shoulders um it's
just it's super helpful to sort of learn
other people's approach it is and other
people's ideas it's a same thing goes
with I feel like everyone's a big on
this type of the digital Nomad lashed
out which sounds great but when a lot of
people talking about I've never had a
software job and so they it's like you
kind of need those those first five
junior level years where you're just in
there in the environment feeding off and
just leeching knowledge from the senior
developers or designers and then maybe
you can consider going down but it's you
lose so much value as a as a developer
at least just trying to say yeah I'm
just gonna work at home the rest of my
life and never learned from anybody in
person yeah I think I think that's
exactly right it just it it lengthens
the time you're gonna spend learning
everything um you know because you're
not getting kind of that feedback loop
now uh is that is that so now that
you're working freelance is that
something that you're gonna kind of kind
of embrace a little bit the digital
Nomad lifestyle or you gonna stay in the
steak X to stay kind of local and I
travel around too much um you know it's
it's something I'm thinking about um
right now I'm planning this day local at
least for the for the foreseeable future
I think it's you know really really for
me just kind of about what's going on
for me personally but also from a
professional standpoint is sort of like
you know give to get your business going
and that kind of stuff it helps to to
work your network in my networks here so
that's kind of where I'm focused and I
also i also like to be hands-on so like
you know going into clients and working
with clients face two faces is a lot of
fun for me so so yeah I'm freelance
yeah i spended a decent amount of my
time working from home but like love to
go in and work with clients too so yeah
that's one of the things when I was
freelancing as a developer is that
always found a lot of people thought you
oh you're just going to send emails out
and you're just gonna make phone calls
but sometimes just taking a second to
drive to the verses office to kind of
seal the deal I will get you the job
almost before anybody else and it's a
key skill to have to be able to just say
okay let me meet with you we'll talk say
I'm gonna say the same shit I said on
the phone and but you're gonna see me
and then I'm gonna get the the deal
right yeah I mean there's just there's
so much more you learn from just like
reading a person's face then you can
over the phone you know and and and
their body language so like I I think
that that ability to kind of sell
yourself um is absolutely huge now what
is I'm looking at the purposeful kind of
path of videos and a guide here what
would you say people mapping is I I
haven't heard that that term before yeah
so so that the lesson of that module or
the module that that lesson in is in is
all about kind of finding figuring out
what your dream job is right and so the
whole idea is that they're basically and
this this has been validated by a whole
bunch of research but there are
basically four things that matter in in
your dream job you know you need to be
doing great work that you like really
enjoy you need to be to have a chance to
kind of make an impact day to day you
need to work with inspiring people and
the work needs to fit your life rather
than the other way around um and so that
module around people mapping is all
about kind of figuring out what kinds of
people tend to inspire you um you know
and sort of what a you know a supportive
and inspiring person looks like in a
context of your career right now because
it's basically like one of the things
I've learned is that like your happiness
in your work is not like about your
personality type or any of the kind of
like high level stuff that you typically
hear from like the so-called career
experts it's about the day-to-day
right like if you're showing up and you
know you hate the work and the people
suck and you're working for a company
that's doing something that you think is
is horribly evil or or really just
boring it's gonna be a grind and you're
just going to hate it but if on the
other hand like you're working on really
cool projects and you're making impact
on something you care about and you're
working with people who are really
helpful and supportive and inspiring
you're gonna like you're gonna want to
leap out of bed every morning and you
know and go like run to work and it i
was i was lucky enough to kind of find
that but about seventy percent of people
hate their jobs and I kind of think yeah
personally like that's like a horrible
way live oh yeah there's there's nothing
worse than hating your job it's like if
you guys hate your job right now go into
your boss's office tell them you want to
do software you want to design and see
if they'll work with you it's much
better than just going into work and
collecting FHA yeah I mean you know you
get you get a limited number of years on
this earth right like and you're gonna
spend 40 hours or more a week doing
something you hate just like yeah what a
waste yeah a journey opinion on like a
lot of these coding boot camps are also
offering you x UI design as a most
program what's kind of your opinion
about that if i don't know if you kind
of follow it up with any of that yeah so
I think boot camps can be great um if
you you kind of want everything sort of
handed to you um I think they're great
but they're they're expensive right and
so this you know this is kind of a like
there's good boot camps and there's bad
bad boot camps that's you know that's
that's true for development and it's
true for you x UI um but but the other
thing is that you can actually kind of
build your own um and that's you know
that's kind of one of the things that
that I get into in the course and so it
really kind of depends on what your you
know your personal situation or your
goals are right like if your goal is to
go to network with a bunch of people I
think I think that a bootcamp is
fantastic for that because you're kind
of be exposed to a lot of people
but if your goal is told to learn I sort
of question boot camps a little bit
simply because I think it's really
important in in the tech space to to
learn how to learn on your own you get
out of that boot camp you're not going
to know everything or you know really
anywhere close to everything and you're
gonna have to build those skills you
know without the kind of like laid out
curriculum that you would get otherwise
and so that's that's kind of my opinion
is is I think they're a great way to get
started some of them are better than
others but um you know the biggest thing
is is is knowing how to learn and what
you know being able to sort of push
yourself nice uh was there any was there
anything that you wanted us to make sure
that we covered yeah I mean if I don't
know if you want to talk a little bit
about kind of the the course in in
general um but you know the basically
the the courses is called design your
dream job and it's really all about how
to how to land a job you love and tech
um you know it's it's as Dylan said
earlier about getting your foot in the
door but also if you're not happy if
you're already in tech and you know
you're a senior developer but you're not
really enjoying your job you know is
it's also for those people to um you
know and so it basically takes you
through you know exactly what you need
to do is sort of figure out what kind of
job is going to make you happy build the
skills to need to get that job and then
go go market yourself and land it um so
you know it's a check it out i think
it's a it's a really good resource I've
I've I've been getting fantastic
feedback from from people looking to
learn how to be developers or how to be
designers so so yeah that's that's kind
of my little pickle I'll leave it at
that I hate selling so I'm kind of you
know I'm kind of like if this is
valuable I do love to talk and if it's
not um you know how can I help but
that's that's what sources so what I
particularly like I like the idea of the
course in itself because I think there's
very few courses all there's tons of
courses that are going to take your
money and going to basically teach you
something that someone on YouTube
teaches you for free right there's like
so many JavaScript
thing but there's very few things out
there to teach you how to actually get a
job right if no one SAT you down and
said this is where you need to look this
is where you need what you need to do
and these are something so I'll help you
get more hireable and that's kind just
like the way you break up the modules
right so map your fit why like seventy
percent people hate their job so the
first section is let's make sure that
the job you're looking for you're not
gonna hate right that's really what I
imagine this first section of next one
is what skills you thank you it what
skills you need to get that job right
build these skills up and what skills
are employers looking for like crucial
thing so first step step one let's make
sure we're not going to hate the job
we're looking to step two let's make
sure now that we know the job that we
want skills are going to step three
finding the right opportunities and you
know going about a lot of people like
where do I look for jobs are looking for
junior devs junior designers whatever it
may be project management step 4
actually getting the interview and what
to do when you do that and you'll step 5
landing the interview and how do that
because a lot of people they can be the
most accomplished developer around and
then before you know it they go in and
they're just like yo man I got guys fuck
out of here and everyone's uncomfortable
right and as we're talking about it's
not necessarily always about your skill
level it's can I work with this guy on a
team because you're going to be working
as a team and that's that's really what
I what I've always liked about this
course is it teaches you how to get your
foot in the door how to how to get the
job you want in a tech and that's very
very specific to that but really you can
apply this to almost anything ya know i
think i think that's that's exactly
right I really you know there are sort
of transferable skills for sure right
like landing a job is is first and
foremost a skill and it's it's it's kind
of ridiculous that like schools don't
teach you how to do that right like you
graduate college and kind of like what
the you know what am I supposed to do
now and they especially don't teach you
how to figure out what you want to do
with your life um and you know and so
this really you know this really is kind
of about teaching that skill that you're
going to use over and over again
throughout the rest of your life and I
think people don't really really kind of
stop and think about how much
of an impact that kind of makes on on
your life and your day-to-day happiness
um you know being able to get a job at a
company that's that's flexible that lets
you work from home you know or if you've
got if you've got a family or when I
have a family someday gives you the sort
of flexibility to do those kinds of
things you know the the salary you make
all of those things really really center
around how well you market yourself um
and that starts with understanding what
you really want um so so that's kind of
what the course is about all right so we
have some good questions here um
question is do you feel one should
pursue design and development at the
same time or like creating a balance
between the two are kind of focusing on
one or the other when trying to get into
the marketplace yeah I think if you're
if you're just getting started you
should focus on one or the other arm but
you should know just enough about the
other one um to be dangerous and so like
if if you're starting focusing on design
like you should know HTML and CSS you
shouldn't be you don't have to worry
about being perfect at them um but like
you know you can go go to code Academy
and learn HTML and CSS and like a couple
of days right so um so definitely kind
of do that on the flip side if if you're
you know you're you're looking to be a
developer right like you should know
your way around um something like sketch
or Photoshop just just a little bit
right like go take a ten-dollar unique
class right it's not a big investment
and you'll have a sense and have a sense
of kind of some some basic design
principles um you know so there's some
great courses out there like there's one
called hack design that's you know
totally free it'll teach you kind of
some of that stuff there's another one
called a design for developers um you
know just so you kind of know the basics
and know why because it because what you
really want to know is like why the
others the person on the other side of
the table is doing things the way they
do right like as as a designer you know
like ultimately the stuff I design is
going to be
lamented by developers right so you
don't eat you know I don't want my
developers too hazy which means I want
to design things right the first time
and have an understanding of what it's
like to be a developer so that they can
implement my designs easily and you know
the flip side of that is as a developer
you know you want to have the
perspective of like okay this is wise
person is making this decision right
like this is why this is important um
and like once you have a sense of that
it's it it makes a lot easier to sort of
work with your colleagues though was
there any books or any sort of
inspiration material that kind of kept
you on course when things got
frustrating as a designer or anyone
trying to get I've tried to get into the
job market anything in your personal
life yeah um so as far as good books go
I I'd recommend a couple um if if you're
really just getting started with design
there's a great book called don't make
me think um it's it's absolutely
fantastic it's a really short read and
I'd actually recommend that every
developer read it too because it's it's
really that shorter than that you useful
and it really is all about the the idea
in the one of the big ideas in design is
like mental models and basically how
Howell users conceive of problems and
the fact that the product should reflect
their conception of a problem not yours
and so in again really what that means
is like as a user you don't want to make
the user think it should be intuitive
and so that's what the book is about so
that one's fantastic um you know if
you're if you're into startups and
interested in like design and within the
context of startups there's a great book
called running lean on that i really
recommend which is basically all about
how to figure out what people want and
kind of go give it to them which i think
is is honestly the the biggest thing
that design is about right you know
designs about solving problems and
ultimately if you don't understand what
people want your designs not in good so
those those are kind of the big ones you
know
happy happy if if if people have
individual questions or the specific
parts of design they they want to focus
on happy to kind of to recommend other
books to people too all right the the
last question what is the process cycle
for is this designer from scratch to
being competent enough to applying for
your first design job yeah um so I think
first of all you got to pick what type
of design you want to do you know just
just like as an engineer you wouldn't
say okay right like I'm going to learn
everything right now I'm going to try to
learn you know to be a front-end out but
then I'm also going to learn back and
stuff at the same time you're not going
to learn every part of Design at the
same time so like decide if you want to
be a UX designer or user researcher or
UI designer and then based on that like
what I basically recommend is go and get
an overview um you know find a couple of
resources that just give a really broad
overview don't don't worry about the
specifics um too much but just kind of
get a sense of what the general practice
is and then go do projects um you know i
think it's it's kind of the exact same
as engineering in that way um that you
know you're going to learn stuff by
doing so you know design your own
website and then you know design
something design something for a
business but you know as far as the sort
of process behind that are like going
from like a blank canvas to a finished
product usually what i see is its kind
of starts with user research want
understand people and their problems and
kind of what their perspective is you'll
go sort of prototype something and that
can be like what's called a paper
prototype or you literally just draw
stuff on paper and show it to people and
get feedback um you know or can be like
a clickable prototype in something like
envision get feedback from people there
and um you know and then it's basically
an iterative process right you're just
you're constantly getting feedback and
improve
the product based on that oh so
hopefully that answers the question hey
well we got a bunch of knowledge that
needs to sink in they live lots of good
stuff guys um well thanks for taking the
time and we'll definitely come play much
and while i'll let you know when i sent
us out probably next next i usually
release one of these interviews every
every weekend so be definitely i'll be
making intro and an outro and definitely
have everywhere for everyone to be able
to check out purposeful cuz I mean I I
personally think that the hardest thing
for a lot of these junior devs other
than confidence I think confidence is
when you're in when you're kidding like
a i want a job but i haven't had a job
it's Alice intimidating so I think
actually being able to get your foot in
the doors one things a lot of people
struggle regardless if your designer
developer or anything else so I really
actually like this a lot and so we're
gonna we're gonna do it justice to share
with the world special thanks to our
sponsor dev mountain if you're
interested in coding boot camp why don't
you check them out where they include
housing alongside their tuition so you
can get up go and immerse yourself in
