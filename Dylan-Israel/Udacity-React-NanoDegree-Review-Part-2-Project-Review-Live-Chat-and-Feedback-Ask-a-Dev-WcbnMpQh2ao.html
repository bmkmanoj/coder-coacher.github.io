Udacity react now degree program in this
in this review we are going to talk
about three main things once won the
Live Chat help which is available almost
a Monday through Saturday about 7 or 8
a.m. to 5 p.m. or 4 p.m. around there
and then there's also we're also going
to showcase the project what what
aspects of react we learned using the
project then we're also going talk about
the feedback one things I said in my
first review which on the link in the
description to what I was expecting out
of the nanodegree program was that we
were going to get good feedback from
people and I have to say I really do
think that they delivered on this so
first and foremost let's talk about the
react fundamentals course now I really
consider this entire noun degree program
about four different four to five
different courses all in one so that's
how I kind of like to think about this
the first one is react fundamentals the
second course is reactive or ducks the
third course is react native and then
this extracurricular you're going to get
and github that's on the fourth course
and then we're going to say these two
right here are are the fifth course and
the career personalized feedback I'm
very excited to actually review that
aspect down the road as well now today
we're talking about the react
fondamental so the project the project
will teach you the basic aspects of
react components how to get started on
an application a lot of the small
libraries or modules that you probably
wouldn't know existed unless you did a
course some things like the sort by
which helps you sort items
alphabetically things like that this is
our project right here it's the it's
called the my reads application for my
reads project essentially what it is is
where we have a database set we can
query through a search engine through
this plus sign here and let's say we
type in something like react it will
pull up a bunch of books and then we can
go ahead and I don't know we'll take
this one and we'll add
one to the currently reading application
we jump back to here and you'll see now
it is part of our our database and
you'll notice when you refresh the page
here that will actually purse this
thanks to local storage so you'll learn
about components you learn obviously the
the basics of react states props you'll
learn a lot of you learn about browser
router links all these things that are
pretty crucial to react and all in all I
think this is a pretty good introduction
project and and one that I could see
myself taking something like this and
then maybe creating a new project that's
not that that they didn't help give me
some starter code so essentially what
you get when you start this is you
basically get a hard-coded template you
get a lot of HTML lot CSS very little
JavaScript and just to get you going
because there focus on the react aspect
which is kind of cool now let's talk
about the live chat normally if they're
online there'll be a little thing here
it says click live chat then you have a
message here you can ask questions I did
this about three times and in terms of
the quick response time I was very happy
with out how the quick turnaround it
took me about five to 10 minutes to
connect to somebody on chat although
some people said that for them it took
anywhere up to 30 minutes to an hour I
never had that experience they did this
very quickly in my experience and most
of the time they're pretty helpful
you'll ask some questions when I first
got this I was a little intimidated I
said hey Matt I'm just a little curious
what would be a good path to get started
with this this is before I knew that
they had a rubric so they send you
there's this online thing which they
break down and let's actually showcase
that because I think this is pretty
helpful a lot of people struggle getting
started on projects and they give you a
slight little Rubik rubric of the user
stories and what to expect essentially
you're grading criteria i had similar
things that were a lot worse in college
so documents such as okay how should you
be able to set up your application when
you submit it what is your main page
supposed to do and look like who is your
search page supposed to do and look like
how
routing supposed to work and what should
we
how should your code functionality be so
all these things are very crucial now
I've submitted my project twice now the
first time I submitted it with small err
it's two small errors one I knew about
no one I didn't notice and I submitted
it with the one particularly because I
wanted to see how detailed they are I
don't want to be able I don't want to
promote something that so far Minh I'm a
huge fan of what I've seen but I don't
want to promote something and and say ok
well the greatest benefit of the program
compared to maybe picking up a twenty
dollar course on on udemy is the fact
that you get that feedback and it's
crucial right and I have to say not only
did they catch my air they gave me a lot
of great suggestions in the process so
let me go ahead and show you what you
can expect when you submit your
application so first is the project
review that rubric we just showcase they
go through and give you a check mark
sometimes they add some some notes right
so you're you're required to attach a
readme file I use markdown I have a
video showcasing that if you're not
familiar with markdown but it's
basically how you create the readme
files in shorthand HTML but you can do
it in HTML as well a little note here
that says hey check the code review to
see how you can improve this so go there
here's where I fail they said all right
I met this requirement but it's not
quite perfect here are some general and
I like that they give you a general
direction to go to and here's the
thought process we're not going to give
you the code right we're not going be
really upset if they just copied and
pasted some code but here's a little bit
of a thought process and you should be
able to figure it out from here and I
did a I did the I think I fixed both
these unless they meant something else
right sometimes you should they send you
stuff you send in code sometimes you say
one thing but it's interpreted another
way but I think I interpreted it right
and then you can see down here there's
another small thing that I messed up fix
that as well so I was pretty happy with
that but more than anything else the
code review was what really stood out
for me and you can see right here I'm
gonna go through each one of these just
so you get an idea
that in the readme and they give some
nice work like this is good but hey you
could add additional things and here's a
resource for you to go learn that to go
see what are those additional things and
they they just send me straight to it
which I thought was pretty cool they
also make a note here like hey it's it's
better convention to only have one
readme you should probably get rid of
this and then in our actual application
everything you're seeing here is what I
submitted in a zip file you can submit
your projects via git or a zip file I
just did sip file because it's quicker
for me but you can do either one now
you'll see here that they have
suggestions which is what we're going to
read right here just giving me some
heads up about hey maybe you want to
clean this up because your main love
bootstrapping point from your
application I ignored that for the
second thing because I didn't feel the
need to create a sort of container
application to submit in here we'll see
though if that ends up hurting me down
the road now here it is giving us some
some insight on what we should do to not
repeat coding practices and stuff like a
good suggestions all these are good
suggestions regardless but more than
suggestions I think here it is you'll
see required so they say hey here is
where I think maybe you might want to
change some of your logic and same thing
here are you sure you're doing this
correctly very very detailed in terms of
what we think you can approve on and
where and then they gave me some more
suggestions right here as well but and
also I'm surprised by this but they also
say good job for using prop types which
is another thing they go over prop types
is kind of a way that you can
essentially do typescript and set types
of your variables props or something
that you pass in to your components that
are essentially variables at the end of
the day of your component and our
properties is hence the prop types and
you can set values for that now they
also mention something called default
props which we didn't touch on I don't
believe and then more suggestions but
all in all what I could say
so I paid $300 for this course and it
also loves Lemieux they I came to this
in Saturday in an hour and five minutes
later they sent it back to me review
now they say they expect to give
everyone 24 hours but I can say that I
got mine back in an hour and five
minutes which I was very impressed with
I wasn't thinking I was thinking I was
thinking to get this till Monday I
submitted on Saturday at noon got it
back by like 105 so I was very impressed
by that oh and you can see right here
life help so many people are online so
you can say here the way that life
health works you go say hey what's your
problem and how we try to fix this
problem you can attach files as well and
then you click find me throws you up in
a queue basically so if I what I could
say about this is if the rest of this
course is is is also there's a slack
channel that was very helpful as well
everyone's really helpful with that but
if the rest of this course goes in the
same format and I imagine it will just
with redux and react native and so on
and so forth if you think about it as
getting about five to six courses and
getting feedback from developers when
you submit your project and again I got
mine back in an hour and five minutes
which is pretty impressive it is I think
it's a valuable resource all the videos
are very easy to follow along I'm pretty
sure they're all stoned in it but that's
another that's another thing altogether
though they all look like they're pretty
lit no judgments just the observation
but if you look at it like that it comes
down to about a hundred dollars of
course and I think that is a pretty good
deal when you when you consider that
you're getting feedback as well as well
as help but I got mine for 300 on sale
maybe you can find some some coupons to
get it for that $500 for the course but
if the rest of the course goes like this
I'd be very happy with the amount of
money I spent and there but I will also
say that I don't think I think you can
get a similar experience going through
Udacity and getting a couple $20 courses
so instead of spending five hundred
maybe by five $20 courses
you just say you know what I don't I
don't really care about the the project
feedback and that's okay but I do like
that that's probably my number one thing
that I like about this is the project
feedback is the suggestions hey how can
we clean up your code and write it more
react style but I'm very happy with this
so far anyhow guys that's my part two of
the review I will see you guys in part
three in which we'll be reviewing react
and redux and we'll do one more react
native and then of course we'll do one
summarizing everything together so thank

stuff out you can help me out that way
as well thank you for watching I'll see
you in the next video bye hey guys
thanks for watching the video especially
thanks to our sponsors dev Mountain if
