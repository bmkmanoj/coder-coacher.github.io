back in HTML and CSS part 1 and we're in
HTML content common HTML elements let's
go ahead and jump right in now if you
remember from the previous section HTML
element is basically a tag such as these
are all elements anchor tags paragraph
tags unordered list tags Li tags all all
elements and uh looks like we're gonna
be doing ton of stuff with it so let's
go ahead and just jump right in
oops I'm going to go next so we have our
it looks like they've already set up our
page if you remember before I was saying
that there's various heading tags h1
being the largest and h6 being the
smallest and various sizes in between so
let's go ahead and in the body because
it's where our content goes tray to h1
tag and in it we're just gonna go ahead
and put the brown bear and that looks
like all we need to do well run it and
then it's nice and big and bold heading
tags are really there to make a
statement to be a little bit larger than
maybe a paragraph tag or anything like
that we're just floating text or
something like that
speaking of paragraph tags so a
paragraph tag starts with the P and ends
with the closing P we're gonna go in a
copy paste this in here similar to how
you'd have paragraphs
they'll be on a different line and
they'll cause a space at the end as well
so if you have multiple paragraphs
you'll see right here there's an icecap
that's cuz that's how a paragraph should
be that's basically it
so you'll see a
it looks like you got rid of our
previous paragraph it's gonna add this P
and we're gonna put it this in here so
the following subspecies up oh sorry it
looks like we had a little bit of a
brain fart on our ID here so we're gonna
go ahead and add a second paragraph
let's go ahead and run this and you'll
see another gap between the two next
what we're gonna do is add an unordered
list
so there's ordered lists which are oels
and then there's unordered lists which
are you else so we're gonna go ahead and
do a ul now there's nothing in here
right now but this is setting up our
list elements so within the OLS and the
UL s you'll add list items so you're
basically saying look start this is
where a list is with the US this is
where an unordered list is and these are
the list items which are our allies and
notice how they're they're within the US
so we're gonna go ahead and add the
items which are arctos arctos caller US
is also in like Pokemon names and other
names of bears I notice how each list
item has its own tag as well and finally
apparently an extinct bear which is kind
of sad that they added that but guess
that's just the way of life that is now
no Sahni
is extinct it's going to run this and
you'll see we have our four less items
and they're not numbered because we use
a ul tag or an unordered list tag so
next what we want to do outside of the
unordered list because we're adding a
paragraph here now you can add paragraph
tags in Li but that's not what the
instructions are nor would that make a
lot of sense
given what we're doing we're gonna go
ahead and add this paragraph tag like so
it's going to copy in the content paste
it in there so next what we're gonna do
is we're gonna create an ordered list
looks like we're having a little bit of
a issue here with copying over this is
still in preview mode so we're bound to
run into a few little hiccups there we
go
now NOL as I was explaining his our
ordered list starts with the o L tag
good and zoom in just a little bit run
that again we don't have any content in
here we're gonna go ahead and create
three L items one for Russia one for the
United States and then one for Canada
and now when we run it you'll see that
they're numbered 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 this is the
only difference between an o L and a ul
alright so we're gonna be working with
anchor tags like this you'll notice this
HR F value an anchor tag is basically
links you to a web page and later on
will be used to link you to various
other things but for the most part for
the for the context of the simplicity
simplicity anchor tags are really just
used to link you to web pages so we're
gonna go ahead and add a anchor tag so
after the first paragraph right here
it's gonna run this real quick just so
there's no issues all right we're gonna
anchor tag also has a closing bracket
and what we're gonna do is we're just
gonna put in here as the content learn
more just gonna run that now it there's
there's an anchor tag there it's just
not doing anything it's not going
anywhere so what we have to do is put
this href parameter and we're gonna put
HTTP notice the quotes you'll be putting
this in quotes so it knows where it's
supposed to start so let's go ahead and
copy over this link actually
put that like so it's gonna run that and
now we have a link and you can see it's
a link because we haven't styled it any
differently and by default it's gonna be
blue and underlined to show that it's a
link one too many so now we have another
target attribute I think I believe I
said parameters that attributes actually
the correct term now what's the term
what the target attribute does now some
attributes can be used in various types
of tags but not most and in this one the
otário attribute I believe is just for
HTML so you'll notice that we have the
again it's in quotes like so and what
happens here is when we set it equal to
blank it's now going to open up a new
web page when we click it by default it
will go ahead and go to where wine and
open up a new page why are you making me
a liar yeah but target equals blank
underscore blank will actually pop it up
in a new window I'm not quite sure why I
did it there now by default it will just
go to the it'll take your current page
and then go to another page so to add
images pretty straightforward here we're
gonna where do they want us to put this
below the ordered list at an image okay
it's IMG closes
oMG and then you have to say where the
image is located this is usually a URL
this is always a URL I should say and
notice how there's no closing tag
justice slash right here now depending
on what sometimes this slash is optional
my piece of advice is always to put it
in there especially later on advanced
framework some of them require it for it
to work so it's just better better habit
to just put in the extra slash so this
source this SRC is where this image is
located so now it will display it and
there's our boy yogi
so what does the alt attribute do do
this is to help those users that are
visually impaired and make that's that's
kind of it there's another aspect to put
here so they can hover over the image
basically they can hover over the image
and then hear what it is so we're gonna
go ahead and add alt tag it's not it's
another it's another attribute so just
for the space put alt and we'll put
brown bear actually yogi the bear there
you go
so we've added that
so now what we're gonna do is we're
gonna go ahead and delete delete the
learn more link you added previously
alright so let's go ahead and get rid of
that just gonna run this go ahead and
get rid of it one more time seems to be
a weird little bug where it's not
updating properly so instead in the next
h2 amount transfer your image on your
page by linking by alright so
do they just want us to I got it alright
so they want us to basically show that
when you click this image it can go
places so right now nothing's happening
it's not linking to anything so we want
to we want when you click this image for
it to link to something so let's go
ahead and set this up we have the href
we have the target and then we're going
to take our closing tag and actually put
it after the image this is going to make
it wrap our image to go to this URL and
we're gonna go ahead and put underscore
blank let's go ahead and run this and
now you'll notice when we hover over it
we have a a picture you'll notice in the
bottom left-hand corner it'll show the
link as well and I'll open up in a new
window and I'll link you to there now
you'll see that there's a lot of stuff
going on here it's basically saying try
and make your code readable you'll
notice that I've been kind of doing this
is much more readable than than just all
having it in one long line that's really
the importance of it you're gonna need
to make your code as readable as
possible
especially as you move on if you're
trying to be developer cuz you'll be
working on teams some small some large
but you'll be working with other people
they need to be able to read your code
as well so you have to follow certain
standards alright so we have a br slash
here now what is a br slash sorry third
paragraph one two
one two three carrier so let's run this
real quick so BR / is basically a
shorthand wait of putting in a line so
let's look at our you see populations
right here it's gonna actually drop of
brown bears down a line she'll see right
here drop down that's what the be our
slash left so we're gonna go ahead and
delete this line break because makes no
sense and it's ugly so let's go ahead
and run that and move on
all right it's um another thing that
it's bringing up right now we're gonna
run this is what it's basically saying
here is when you have nested elements
for instance rol these allies are nested
within we want these to be indented we
don't want them to be at the same like
that the reason for that is it shows off
how what's within what and what's
outside of what and this is an important
concept in programming and nesting in
general will be used not only in HTML
and CSS but as you move on it is a
crucial part of JavaScript in any
object-oriented programming language so
comments comments are also extremely
important you'll be working on things
quite often and you'll need to comment
things out comment things in when you're
testing something you want to try
something new so we'll go ahead and
we'll just put a comment here especially
if your if you want to put something in
your code when you're new you say this
sets the title of the browser page and
so this is a comment it won't display
anywhere except in the browser console
or in your code like this so you can
look back at it just gonna run that
all right so it did the same thing again
I forgot to run it so this is a comment
he's gonna run that like so there we go
hey not gonna make the same mistake
there we go all right so what did we
learn throughout all of this because we
learned quite a bit we learned that h1
to h6 is come in various sizes h1 being
the largest h6 being the smallest we
learned about paragraph tags and how
they're kind of formatted and what we
use those for we learned about unordered
lists and how you have to have list
elements or li elements within it and
how they're just dots and not numbered
we learned about ordered lists being
numbered we also learned about the
anchor tag or the a tag and the href
attribute of it that allows us to link
to other pages and other websites and
things like that we learned about the
image tag which is how to put images in
there and setting where the image is
with that using SRC we learned about the
alt attribute that helps the visually
impaired and we learned that whitespace
doesn't affect your positioning we
didn't really talk about that that you
need to indent when nesting things as
well and we learned about comments I
cannot stress enough to people who are
starting out learning HTML CSS any
programming language use comments as
much as you can because it will help you
so much now and then later on so just my
best piece of advice there but as always
