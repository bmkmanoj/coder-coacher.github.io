interactive website unit three events so
last time we kind of just went over a
little bit of JavaScript so that we'd be
more understanding of what jQuery does
and Jake or he is and so now we're in
unit three events events are kind of
like actions that the user makes for
instance when you click something that's
considered an event so we click that
that was an event usually there's like a
next one I'm gonna refresh this page oh
there goes so I'm not quite sure why
that wasn't there so we write what's
called an event handler so let's see
what that is so this right here we
select what's going on here is we're
selecting a parameter in this case it
looks like an ID called like dash button
and then when we click it it runs some
code so it toggles the class to active
here and then document dot ready just
launches our code basically to run on
that so we've already I mean everyone
knows how to click so iris so this in
this case is SEC selecting the social
list items so that when this happens
it'll toggle not active and then here
what are we doing this is showing that
it's going to eventually change the
background color to red we're saying
this object would be that and when we
click it performs the active so a lot of
stuff we're going to be speeding through
until we get to the actual little bit of
coding that's in here so fill in the
event handler below to apply the class
button dash like all right so first
thing we want to do is change that and
then we want to use toggle clasp to
apply top class so we do this if I
remember correctly we need that
this dot toggle clasp and I don't
believe they told us what they want to
do let's see here what is that simple
there's also the key press event so you
press a key it does some stuff drop-down
menu bubble aww sookie press here's our
event and this is where it what it does
got it so let's see we want to change
the event handler on the key is press so
far doc you're not key press function
so
on that's like dot toggle clasp let's
see if that's right Oh looks like it was
right got it shy kept told this is
working or not yeah it's just something
about this seems a little weird okay
it's not like oh good job or you don't
see the code it's just like okay so it
worked yeah just more stuff this is some
sort of event so we're saying if this
parameter apparent maybe dot which is
something we can set it to so if that
parameter or the object it looks like
that's a parameter doesn't is equal to
something do something simple enough so
let's see here apply the class but not
like so element win look at G excuse it
go to do so
so for but not like ice so we got to do
this so if event dot which is equal
equal equal to 10 3 button dot like not
toggle clasp let's see if that's right
so we did the document on keypress if
event dot which is equal that now
alright so that looks like it's correct
very nice next to these events to build
your newsreader pretty cool pretty cool
so let's get started once this loads
which I internet going slow is what's
going on just refresh this page real
quick all right there goes oh so click
on the first article use the N keyword
shortcut to go the next article then use
those shortcut to open the article
distrib the scription if you have any
issues all right so these are basically
just showcasing 111 is probably n + 110
is probably all or vice versa actually
110 would be if we're going like in
order it would seem like one time would
be in I don't know what um the event all
the events office we can set up the
basic skeleton for a JavaScript program
and functions so basically you always
want to have it go like this if you want
something to to load automatically
document already function
all right use the keyword var so then
create a function called main so our
main equals function and our function is
going to do some stuff what is it going
to do all right so and then it just
wants us to run our I forget how to run
do we have to do the doc yet document
dot writing mate so what they may wanted
us to do is not declare it like this so
let's see if that's what they wanted to
find a function named VAR awesome so i
don't think they wanted it like this so
there we go I think that's what they
wanted cool so instead of that instead
of it loading automatically they want us
to do this code first and let's actually
clean this up a little bit so try to
click on article nothing happens because
we got rid of our code let's change that
use jQuery select CSS class article are
we doing it in the main function so what
they want ok so they want us to do in
the main function so select the
parameter article and I think article
will work we may need to use start well
click and what is it click do click
calls a function then we'll do some
let's see what we want it to do this
functions got a click event handler
inside the event handler display a this
sought children description the show
the code and stuff for his little
complex marks when they should get be
found on him below so let's see here
show is jay Cory's way of saying list or
displaying these okay so we want to
display the children of description so
what's going on here is each one of
these has a child it's a child
technically I think so let's see what's
going on here oh this probably needs to
be dot article try it one more time
there we go so it was weird because
sometimes it would work without it and
but it could just be an older JavaScript
language that I was working with so have
the descriptions of all the articles
except the article we clicked how on the
first lining the event handler adeline
that selects description on the first
line of Adeline so we on Adeline the
selects description so let's select
description and it's using dot hi
oops no that's right so maybe they will
know alright so let's see nice fella
description wrong I believe this is
correct
so it would appear
let's see if this single quotes are the
issue I don't think they are oh my god
they are all right so make sure you
single quotes double quotes does work
half the time but it could be quite
sensitive i guess in here so it's look
the current article using this add the
class current to using dot add class
alright so select the current article
using this alright so this
all right sir I'm looking for you so
this dot add class current and it's like
the current article so how do we select
the current article article click all we
already did that then we want to add
remove class article
so add the line right above this
okay this not at class current all right
so that's why I was looking for the dot
add class my brains a little dead today
would seem I haven't had my morning
monster so we're going to select the
current class and once I'll select all
the other articles using the article
class remove the class current from them
using remove class so select all other
articles using the article class arm is
going alright so we are going to select
our article within our article here so
we're saying when we're on article dot
remove whatever class it was because we
we want to change classes so maybe it
needs to be null or maybe it's just
better convention this way we're going
to remove the class cool so use the
jQuery to select document and a key
fresh all right so we're going to have a
new Q press event oh you know what it's
probably going to be in the same event
here so these are going to be nested
together so we're going to say document
please check your select document dot
key press
function
ma'am and then that I should take so
this also is going to take event as a
parameter cool so we set that up what
are we doing in here and then we'll say
what we're going to do now is say if the
event dot which so if this is equal to 1
1 1 which is probably is the okey so if
you press oh this is what we want you to
do we want to take the current children
of description and toggle them so that
means turn it on or off
alright so let's check what we did here
so if event dot which is exactly equal
to 111
Oh looks right to me so oh whoops all
right so we're not looking for dot
document where the document is the whole
thing so that's what our air is there
ducky press function event BAM
well maybe they don't want it to be in
there yes you want to have to click and
hit oh it's just going to work if
shut our brackets off so one two one two
so one two one two
Oh
hmm
so this to me looks like I thought that
was our air so document dot key press
and we call it's a function and it takes
in the event parameter and then if the
event dot which is exactly equal to 1 11
that the current children of description
toggles alright so we're a little stuck
around seven to ten the Oh shortcut
let's go ahead and see what's going on
alright this guy seems to be on the same
page
alright so we have some example go here
and luckily we can compare so
let's see document dot ready let's work
our way backwards bam bam there it is
semicolon we put a semicolon out of
force a habit and it's not needed oh my
god that wasn't it
alright well logically I understand
what's going on but we seem to have a
syntax error somewhere rather than make
this a 30-minute video watching syntax
error let's try tasting this in and the
scene if it works ok now that worries me
that that didn't work they're real okay
so somewhere in there we had a syntax
error someone can find it just to leave
it in the comments I couldn't find it
right now but eventually I'm sure I
would've so all right we're going to do
the end short cut for the next two
exercises so in this case we're going to
the same thing and what we can do is
just copy this excuse me copy this put
that throne else in front of it and then
we will change this still 110 and it
should work there we go inside the else
if statement select the current oh
alright so what's it want to do inside
our else--if select dot current I don't
think that was supposed to be there
it's like correct uses the current
selector save this in a new variable
called current so we're going to say are
eight of our current equals dot current
a you this could be wrong let's see here
or current out current article he goes
no that's very cool so we have our
current article and we want to create
another variable called their next
article and we're going to set that
equal to current current article dot
next as saying here and then remove the
current class of the current article so
if you forgot how to remove the class we
it's going to look similar to this
there's a roof except so we're just
going to put this as an example real
quick so we're going to say current
article oh my god my cats knocking
everything our current article equals 0
no excuse me current article dot or move
class and then we're going to sit oh my
god cat current duck right so the only
thing I was kind of similar I guess it's
a remove class so that should remove the
current class and then we want to add
for the next article dot add class
current
cool then we do we finally made a little
thicker supposed to toggle it's not
toggling it's switching between us stuff
but I guess you can't open and close the
same one maybe they didn't want we
weren't supposed to go to like that
that's how I would do it though but not
bad so we have finished the interactive
website newsreader really ugly
background that could have done better
with that but as always guys questions
comments concerns and anything
constructive appreciated we're halfway
through we have dlm Dom manipulation
going to use some more jquery and more
jquery effects in the video after that
so I'll see you guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
