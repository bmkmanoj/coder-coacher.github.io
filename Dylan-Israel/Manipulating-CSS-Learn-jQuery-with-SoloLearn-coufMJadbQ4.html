in solo learned doing the jQuery section
let me open it up here
I forgot what spend about 4 days since
I've touched this but let's see what
section I was on manipulate the Dom
something you're doing all the time in
jQuery it's basically all you do so if
it wants to load into the dome itself
here oh I've met manipulating CSS my
mistake so we're gonna be adding and
removing classes with jQuery something
that you do quite frequently
you'll see right here perhaps we want to
add a class header so we're taking the
div we're targeting all divs using our
jQuery selector and then we're adding
the class header let's go ahead and
check this out real quick I think I
think it'll be easier to see so let's
look at our CSS so our header here is
header class is the color blue and then
the font size of extra-large so when we
run this you'll see that our font size
is extra large and the color is blue so
we're applying our JavaScript jQuery
here on divs adding that class to it
that's why that that works we're adding
a styling class to it so again in jQuery
we use our selector and then we fill in
the blanks
we at Witts you target the paragraph in
this instance then we add the class and
add the class names text and menu to the
P element so we want to add class name
so we have a dot text dot menu
how do we add multiples ticks there we
go
like so did it want text in menu okay so
because it's at class we don't need to
put the dot like I was doing earlier my
mistake on that sorry about that guys
we also remove a class exactly how we
would add a class you can add a class C
and then you can remove the class and C
so we have a paragraph of class a B so
we add class C remote C so we'll be left
with B right so we have a B and C but we
removed Class A and C pretty
straightforward
that's really one of the benefits of
jQuery although it's not a language
that's gonna or a library that's gonna
be super super helpful for you getting a
job it is something people kind of
expect you to be comfortable with now
toggleclass
is say you want to set something on
click toggle clasp so you click a
paragraph it toggles the class on your
add to class you click it again it
toggles the class off so we'll the
paragraph have a border after this class
so it checks is this on yeah it is so it
has a class test and we toggle it and
then it turns it off CSS properties you
can also apply just CSS instead of
having a class perhaps you just want to
apply on the paragraph in this example
background color blue you can do that as
well you do use your selector in this
instance we're selecting a paragraph
then we're using dot CSS followed by the
property followed by the value and it's
all in quotes as well so in this case we
want to set the color of the paragraph
color to blue and the font size to 16
excuse me
now as we continue on you can kind of
notice that these are passed in using a
JSON syntax if you're not familiar with
that what that is it's a JavaScript
object notation is what JSON stands for
and it you notice let's kind of break it
down it goes a little like this in key
value pairs so you have your object that
we're passing in and you have background
color and then the value this is the key
and this is a value and then this is key
and this is a value it's a you're just
passing in an object of CSS values in
JSON format and that will work for you
as well so in our example here we're
still talking CSS but this time we're
passing in an object separated by commas
and then this width property here as
well
dimensions so you also pass in width and
height or set width and height we set it
like CSS but you can do it directly as
well so you see this div we're setting a
width of 100 a height of 100 so let's
check out our demo because we're using
the selectors and we hashtag demo that's
the ID and then we want to set the
height to 68 pixels it's assumes by the
way that it's going to be in pixels
right there so you don't need to
actually put P X so there's inner width
and inner height so you have width you
inner width is your padding outer width
is your border outer height same same
same thing I always get this stuff all
confused between inner width and outer
height and stuff like that so you can
see there's a lot going on in here if we
wanted to assign it piece by piece let's
go ahead and jump right in though so
what is the output of this code
so here we're going to alert the divs
inner width so the inner width is the
padding so it's going to be 5px that's
what's going on there
no div style let's get a hint
let's see is it 200 yeah it's 205
because it's adding the width plus this
padding I guess it's just 200 so inner
width let's go back is the element plus
the padding or just the padding huh
inner width in air height also includes
pegs so that should have been right 205
why didn't it yes go should be 205 we're
add the padding of five two hundred and
Oh silly me
so you add padding on both sides so it's
210 so you start with 200 but it's also
the padding you add five pixels
uniformly around it so it's 2 5 here 5
here 210 whoops
that makes sense all right let's take
this little quiz here fill in the blanks
to set the color of padding so again
we're going to use the CSS property
we're using the JSON object to store all
the CSS values and here we are going to
set the color to blue and then we are
going to set the padding to 5 pixels
around it what is the value of the outer
height for the paragraph after the
following code so we have 84 then we
have a margin of 8 so that's 16 so
that's 100 plus 4 it should be 104
weight the value of the outer height so
is that margin outer height god I have
to go back and look at this it doesn't
look like it's gonna be a
outter height no outer width was the
padding okay so this should be 88 there
we go and special eye with multiple
class names for the add class method we
need to separate using them so if you
want add multiple class names you can
just put spaces you only need to put
commas or anything so fill in the blanks
to create a new paragraph element set
its height 250 pixels add that the
before element before the ID tests so we
have a vari here and we're gonna say
we're gonna create a new text element
right here and then we're gonna add some
text and then set its height so we're
gonna say look e dot height and you see
how we can chain these in variables now
that you know save us some time so e dot
height and add it to before the element
e dot or before so this is before e got
I forgot how to add this beforehand I
would use prepend I guess we're gonna
just target the week and use the tags
right hmm let's get a hint
let's see Oh with I detest I didn't see
that whoops there we go and we just
target the ID halfway through so this
next one that I tried clicking on will
be doing that in the next video
manipulating Dom which is basically
we've been we've been manipulating CSS
in this last one the Dome we're gonna be
starting to create and dynamically
interact with the objects in the
document object model which is something
important to get comfortable with in
jQuery because you do that non stopped
in react and angular so if you're just
getting started get kind of comfortable
with the idea in jQuery so that we move
on to more popular in advanced libraries
and frameworks it's not a foreign
concept to you but as always you guys
