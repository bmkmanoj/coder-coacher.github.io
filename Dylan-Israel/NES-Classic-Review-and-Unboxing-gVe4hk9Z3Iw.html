emails on craigslist i finally got my
hands on a nest classic edition because
i didn't pre-order it like a scrub
pretty excited to open it do itself it's
really small that's really surprised by
how small it is but i guess when you
have the hand holding it and it's calm
to be expected so go ahead and open this
up and see what it looks like a real
quick up close look don't want to be too
rough with box look like well as i like
to keep the boss mr. things aside swing
the hard way now IRA I cool so I'm going
to use your manual here which is kind of
cool and then you get my cat jumping up
into the girlfriends lat pushes
recording so freely get some rewards
it's an awesome always this up it's just
a poster tell me this little poster this
would be so like the nintendo classic
soap alright so first thing that's
pretty badass and you get a poster going
on here that shows a little you see you
see the classic nintendo poster
showcases duck hunt that's a kite that's
pretty cool yeah where's my jam ah
controller now my hands still gigantic
for this right i guess this was the
actual same size more or less that's
what's being a pretty close model to it
you have a little what appears to be a
charger of some sort and then finally
the grant oh there's more in here
actually pump slip it on the bottom here
all night they actually give you an hdmi
cable with it i did not think he was
coming with hdmi cable and then the cord
to charge it
and finally last but not least how
things are so tiny your little Nintendo
classic yeah so that's pretty cool it
honestly is about the same way as your
TV remote so what one not the way of a
prick yeah not the weight of a Peugeot
driver e101 cuz that's right Dylan what
a cool thing about it is that the power
button presses down and an additional
process would be used which kinda nice
classic it looks really does look like a
min ified version of the old mess
classic so I think we're going to go
ahead and plug it in and get started but
so far quality wise I really like it
sixty bucks for about 30 games I'm going
to start with final fantasy maybe move
my way to kid icarus and then I think
April will jump into some of the Super
Mario Brothers eventually when i tire of
it but uh i would say it's definitely
worth your 60 bucks i don't worry baby i
got all week all week she'll have a job
it's dark blemishes here it is alright
so so good um a little bit more detail
about the next classic is they really
wanted to make it feel like you were
five again then you have to sit this
 called it up to the TV so one
thing that I probably will end up doing
is fine extension for this so you can
actually sit on the couch it's about two
and a half three oversight oh it looks
great on TV though scales well you can
change it to 300 views of basically
sizing ah but it's a 55 inch 4k TV it
looks great it feels great the buttons
are cool so if you up it took me a while
to figure out how to actually get back
to the game screen you hit reset it
would take you back here you can also
just go ahead and jump in and you can
have multiple saves outside of the game
I figure if they call you so you can
jump
at any point suspend pointless so you
actually have to go like save point not
all games album from their sold but
besides the short cord and the
hard-to-find talk of it right now I
actually am really happy with this the
short core is 0 is really killing my dad
