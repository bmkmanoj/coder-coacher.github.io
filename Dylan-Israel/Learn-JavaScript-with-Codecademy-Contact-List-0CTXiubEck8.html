structures contact list and as you can
see I've already completed this section
video quality didn't come out that great
so we're gonna just go ahead and redo it
so looks like what will be building as a
contact list you can see right here
we've created a object friends and we're
gonna name it bill Steve and basically
say these are what the values that bill
has of the friends class and then we
have a function that's going to I guess
this is just a prop and the object I'm
not quite sure that works but I'm sure
we'll figure it out as we go so let's go
ahead and get started so you can see
right here you know prints out the data
more or less necessary so we're gonna
reset this here so we're gonna create an
object called friends and it's pretty
simple it's just an empty object at this
point so we're safe our friends don't
forget the semicolon after okay maybe I
messed up so of our friends select one
object literal object constructor so
let's see here feel free to use either
object litter
oh maybe maybe they want it like that
large friends whoops okay
don't forget your equal there we go
alright so there we create our object
friends slip that and if you add a few
empty objects make sure your friend
named bill friend named Steve alright so
if you're curious is we're just gonna
add empty objects and our friends so
we're gonna have bill and this isn't
empty it's just like a listing in this
case parameters so bill and Steve and do
we need anything else nope
I don't think so let's go
Sehwa submit so we have two empty
objects in here all right so we have
bill and Steve give you to your friends
a first name last name number the value
of each of these should be a string
check the hint if you need help so I
don't remember if we could just put bill
dot first name and then set it equal to
something but I'm pretty sure we can oh
okay so they want us they want us to do
it like this so in here I think we could
do it the other way as well so the value
of you should be stirring so we need a
first name and last name and a number
okay so just set up the variable so say
first name and then that will be Bill
almost going on first name but we'll do
the last name and that will be Bob like
Billy Bob I guess and the number and
remember this is also it's going to be a
string so we will do nine and then we'll
do the same thing for see you again
first name Steve then we'll do last name
Martin and then we'll do a number and
we'll set this to 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
so we have our Steve and Bill which are
our friends and they have a couple
parameters at this point so add an
address property to each of you think so
in this we're basically going to create
it looks like an example here a address
that is stores an array
so put a comma and we'll do address and
just to save time we'll just do first
Street don't forget that these
constraints as well first Street and
we'll just do the city of first city and
we'll see it may want us to put it in
exactly as they have it there but it's
for me it's always like do you
understand that you're putting in an
array here and if you do okay cool you
can put in five more values and pause
the video so I just don't want to type
it all out to be honest so let's say
second Street and don't forget so you
get the quotation marks right and let's
go in a second second city rather yeah
so we've add in an array address that
takes the street and the city and we
could add even more and get it down to
the you know first state second state
and go from there create a function list
alright so we'll save our list equals
function if I believe the site if I
remember correctly function it takes a
single parameter and we'll say value or
in this case it won't key I think
let's do that and in the body write a
four four loop like so for variable key
in list we wanted to do some stuff and
then in the loop use console.log
to print out the key also dialogue print
out the key so say just keep no that's
right let's take a look at the hint real
quick I think that I think value and key
need to be the same thing so barlas u
equals function friends okay so we're
taking in our friends function here then
the key enlist use object key to access
so corresponding a console table I mean
straight bar ministry Mouse and call so
long Lester alright so we want to
console I don't think that's right
heartless it was I so list console dot
log key I think that's correct
nope looks like your list function isn't
printing out the right output so let's
call this one in search for answers
create function list
print out the key for example if you
only have been Sivas entry they should
just print out bill and Steve so for the
variable key in our list
they're real okay so we are calling that
a we're calling the variable within
itself it doesn't make sense we needed
to call it from friends and friends here
can actually be even though we have a
variable friends here if we want to call
list in the future we can input another
object for it and it should work just
fine all right now it wants us to define
a function called search so our search
and we're going to say that since it's a
function that takes a single parameter
named name and it's argument passed to
the function matches and you the first
names do some should log that's a
friend's contact so we'll say if thank
you so if our key and friends it's dying
the friend's function I mean the friends
object so what we're basically doing is
we're going to say if the name is equal
to the first name of one of the friends
returned that name else don't so we're
gonna say if name is equal to equal to
key
so if the key is right now for brother
this is supposed to be for Turkey and
then we'll say if go to keep right time
so stuck get a hint so I believe we're
doing our key if our else will put
something out so else console.log
semicolon and I believe that should work
the names on the national national match
gonna actually call it though
necessarily also stars search function
name
okay so take single parameter name now
we'll say four key function name oh it's
supposed to take our friends whoops and
four so it's a first-grade function
search this is how you create a function
and we want to input our friends into
there and then if the key for the key
and friends never say if that could you
know all right so here's it they
basically give you the answer right here
four key okay so I see what's going on
here now we had it right the first way
so we're gonna say our name parameter
and so I just ran off ah then we do a
for loop through that but we can't just
check for the key we need to call dot
first name so believe that's what's
going on so so if you see right here
they use a triple equals I thought we
can do stability goes so the key is
friends key dot first go slow we need
fix just equal key return
friends ki Dom person Oh
equal equal to name force C port of
Archaean friends if France key dot first
name let's try this triple equals but I
don't think I should matter and friends
key you should return the same thing
whether its name order but just because
that's what they want
let's go ahead and put that in there
make sure brackets are matched up so of
our search we're taking the input name
for key and friends if friends with the
key we check the first name for each one
it's equal to equal to name return the
friends key Oh doesn't want us to log it
all so maybe that's might be what it
looks like your search doesn't return
contact information for Steve
all right so really cuneiform see what's
going on here or key and friends friends
oh okay let's try calling this function
search oh I know there's gonna be a
search bill
lilyc in France if friends for shows
even me cause little flawed French he
returned friends
okay okay
let's hear it of our else statement
although we probably should have it
oh my god here it is I am capitalization
sorry about that guys a good example of
debugging your code I suppose oh so
let's just work our way through we're
done now with this one a little bit of a
hiccup there with not capitalizing the
end I hate when that happens because I
think we did okay the first time even
though we had to kind of copy their code
essentially but basically created our
object friends we stored an object in it
bill and Steve we set some parameters
here form first-name so on and so forth
we then create a list that will actually
go through our function if we need it to
and then we have our search function
that will check for a name and then like
we should be able to called list runs
here and I believe should list our
friends so in this case it lists just
the first name bill and Steve which is
our key she remember correctly so that
was our contact list next up we're
actually diving straight into the object
so it's a long section 33 parts to it
objects are very important so look
forward to that and just be prepared
it's going to be a little bit of a
longer video all right see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
