in how to manage or manage factors just
that VM for free code camp and what
we're doing right now is the is it
update yeah so we just did out date it
so we just saw how things are outdated
in this video we're gonna showcase how
to actually update it so it's fine of
course to explicitly check for outdated
modules and then we ran NPM installed to
pull them in however if you want to be a
bit more lazy about it there's a special
and p.m. command they'll update all your
dependencies Mac version loud can you
guess what that might be so the way to
update them all I've declares NPM update
so it's gonna update all our packages so
now when we do NPM outdated you'll see
we don't get anything back as we updated
our link Clark package to 1.0 0.3 now
it's saying here that you can also
reinstall it to the most current version
if you just want to do one but since we
only have one package to update we can
just go ahead and run NPM update but if
we had multiple packages the issue there
would be maybe some we don't actually
want to have the most current version
then we'll have to go back and install
them to the previous version or whatever
version we wanted it to be but um again
short video just keep in mind that the
NPM update again will update all your
packages but as always guys don't forget
to Like subscribe and share it's for my
own patron and I'll see you in the next
video
pretty straightforward nothing to really
go into detail here update your packages
if they break down or they're currently
not working or when you do update them
reverse it back to an older version if
that was the one that was working for
you special thanks to our sponsor dev
Mountain if you're interested in coding
bootcamp why don't you check them out
where they include housing alongside
their tuition so you can get up go and
immerse yourself in the environment if
