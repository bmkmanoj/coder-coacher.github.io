going to be talking about two soft
skills that I think are worth putting on
your resume that not only apply to tech
but I do think they have a special place
and I'll explain why but also are great
in general for almost any any position
because I mean that's kinda what the
point of soft skills writers they're
good for a lot of different things
before we do that I want to give a quick
shout out to our sponsor
tetra tutorials com they've sponsored
this video it's really cool that they do
that now what I like about them is that
they actually have a lot of good video
guides here for a relative price you
know thirty nine forty nine dollars and
they cover a lot of topics pretty well
that you don't see a lot of attention to
and they're really those hard skills
that you need like Jenkins Joomla how to
architect Android app so a bunch of cool
stuff if you're interested in that check
them out in the description below or the
cards they're annotation at the end but
let's talk about the soft skills that I
think are important to your resume now
when I was interviewing a our senior
developer in this coming weeks behind
the code she has answered a question
that I oftentimes could answer asked
what is the number one thing that you
look for when hiring a junior developer
and her thing was communication
communication is so crucial as a
developer that you may think oh man all
I need to know is JavaScript HTML CSS
but putting a soft skill a communication
on there and really when you get asked a
question like why's communication a
strong suit of yours you do need to have
an answer right and I think through
communicating you can communicate you
can explain how good of the communicator
you are right at the end of the day when
they're looking to hire somebody as a
junior developer as a developer in
general I want someone they can work
with and part of working with somebody
is communicating and that goes to the
two the second soft skill is being a
team player working with a team however
you want to phrase it just communicate
that you're a team player in that you
can work well with others those are the
two communicating and our communication
around
and working with a team now as a
developer you will are always working
with the team you may be working on one
aspect of this project they'll be
working on another you may be doing QA
they may be doing the front end this
guy's doing the back end and they all
kind of overlap little pieces here or
there and that's why you need the
communication you need the communication
to explain what you did what you need
help with how how to respond back when
you get that help or or you don't fully
understand something and you need to be
able to work in a team if you don't work
well with others
you're not gonna be a good fit for
almost any software company unless you
start your own so those are the two soft
skills that you really need on your
resume in terms of what other soft
skills you can put on there I don't
really think you should take up any more
of your resume space if you will with
any other soft skills but if you
