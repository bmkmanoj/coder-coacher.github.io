back in kiss guard dungeon closing the
distance we're gonna be using basic
syntax and variables on this level the
one hour here to survive the ogres got
to die and we got to get the gems I can
get down with that so here I move right
of our enemy recognized now attack the
enemy all right so we're gonna say hero
hero attack enemy one and we're gonna do
that twice because remember these guys
currently are dying with two hits let's
go ahead and run that make sure that's
working right tag this guy now we want
to hear it up move right twice and then
we'll do will define a new enemy so
we'll say actually let's do this here
would duh
move right and see I believe he'll
probably see within his line of sight
and then we'll have to define a new
enemy will save our enemy to is equal to
0.5 near summary because we have to find
a new enemy and then we want say hero
dog attack enemy to $0 TAC
enemy - and then we're gonna have to
move right twice so once we're done
killing this guy will be need to
complete the level and I believe that
should be it
so let's see here move right attack that
guy move right back this guy guys
whaling on me it looks like we only need
to attack them once so we completed the
level but it looks like the archers only
take one hit so in the future what we
can do is we can we can just note that
we only need one attack one less line of
code we got a new item as well a wooden
shield hopefully that would deal with
some of the damage that we just took
from this gentleman with this throw on
the spheres alright so this one we're
using basic syntax variables arguments
in wall oops
so survive a never-ending stream of
ogres with mentorship from two
experienced heroes so we're getting a
little beefier with our shield plus 50
now your hero must survive under four
statements
so this is us and we're just gonna be
attacking for a while so you're gonna
see what these guys are just gonna come
with us we're gonna do a while true loop
and within here what we're gonna do is
say look our enemy will save our enemy
is equal to hear about finest enemy and
then we're gonna say this dot attack the
enemy so all we want to do is find the
enemy and just attack oh excuse me hero
so you want to say is not this but
rather our hero dot attack enemy so BAM
lays out why there's an enemy continue
to attack the enemy that's you shadow so
far our other heroes are doing work over
here we're there we go we survived
though so we do under for statements our
hair survived life is good
collect our little gifts the final kiss
me so it looks like this really may be
the last last example here so basic
syntax while loops and variables
your hero must survive defeat the ogre
and navigate the maze and do it under
ten statements and collect the gems I so
find Eric's enemy move right move up
move right move down move down move
right move up so it looks like this
follows a pattern so we're gonna say
well true so we want it to loop through
so anytime you need something to follow
a pattern a while loops gonna need to be
made
so we'll say move dot let's move right
and then we'll say hero don't move up
and then we're gonna be within the line
of sight so we'll save our enemy is
equal to hero dot fine near Sena me and
then we wanted this dot attack enemy and
I'm excuse me hero dog attack enemy
and we'll say hero dot attack enemy
because I remember correctly it happened
to happen twice so we want to move down
move down move up all right and then we
want to oshu to hero that move right
arrow dot move down arrow dot move down
arrow dot move up so let's see 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10 10 statements I believe we
did that so let's go ahead and run it to
see what's going on your move right move
up attack twice move right move down
move down
move up and I think there's little
refresh things here kind of show you
like this is where your wall OOP should
end I think it's a little hint
Bam Bam and it kind of looks like there
she's moving back to her start position
but she's really just it's not a command
it's kind of just like look we never
told him to move he only moved out there
to go kill this guy so you got to go
back to where you're at for your code to
function properly which makes sense
there we go pretty solid pretty solid it
looks like we got a new item your deadly
infinite lay deadly crude builders think
so it looks like we are at the kiss
guard gates so we have a new thing
that's gonna allow us to build stuff so
we can either build a fence or a fire
trap and we have a that's what build
types build XY will allow us to build a
unit at the given example so we're
actually losing our attack we're no
longer gonna have attackers we're we're
setting something else up we're gonna be
using a different different methods and
functions with our hero
all right so what it wants us to do is
instead of killing these guys we're
gonna build a why we're gonna build
something right here
so here I'll move down I so we're gonna
move down and then we're gonna build a
fence to find so they told us right now
you can hover over so this is the first
one that we want to build one here and
here and then we need to get the hell
out of the dungeon all right so we're
going to say look tell our hero let's do
this build X Y what do you want to build
a fence and where do you want to build
it
36 31 and then we want to build X Y we
want to build it at 37 27 and then
so that should build our three fences
and then we want our heroes want to move
right and I don't I think this might be
enough so three and now oh we move right
maybe twice right here Oh God move right
so our Harold build XY takes in a string
that tells it essentially what to build
and then it takes in two coordinates or
two numbers to tell it where to build it
so very nice we're out of the dungeon
man I think I think that's it we've
completed twenty levels pretty solid and
now I think it's time to move in here
but let's let's actually head back to
the dungeon so there are two optional
levels signs and fortress this is
apparently a new level so we'll be doing
signs and portents and we'll be doing
kiss guard mastery which is a advanced
optional challenge in the next video as
