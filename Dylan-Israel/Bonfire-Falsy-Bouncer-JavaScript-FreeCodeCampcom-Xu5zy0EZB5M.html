subscribe that helps me out a ton and I
appreciate all the comments that I get
and all the questions I get in the
comments and I'm happy to answer them so
keep them coming and I'll see you in the
next we've been going steady with this
free code camp we are on bonfire falsey
bouncer basic algorithm scripting
working our way through the 50 hours of
coursework doing pretty well I think
we've done probably most of it in a
little less than two weeks so but let's
go ahead and reset the code here and get
started so what are we trying to do here
we're trying to remove as they call them
fall sea values in JavaScript so
hopefully you checked out the array
filter and the boolean objects and
there's a couple ways we can do this the
easiest way is to just use what they
tell us to use so they want us to filter
what is filter do so if you're like me
you like creating another array
instantly because a lot of a lot of
stuff does with array so I just create
an empty array not the most efficient
way but next we're gonna say look we
want to set this holder array equal to
our current array dot filter and we're
gonna put in a method here we'll just
put a pound sign for now and come back
to it so I was just leaving empty so
this takes some sort of function and
then we want to return our array so
filter allows us to filter through our
array one certain parameters and
typically do this with functions and
stuff like that so so let's call it
remove false variable so we'll just
write a simple and when we get a value
so this is our value we want to return
the boolean
of the value that seems pretty simple so
what does this actually do when we put
it through the filter the filter will
actually remove the false variables oh
we don't need that and then when we run
it and make sure everything's good then
we were running it will remove all the
as they put it falsely variables but do
keep in mind it it will keep the true
ones there as well so true values and
ones that are not not anything not
quote-unquote fall see the false null
zero nan undefined the empty characters
so all the empty sort of stuff goes away
when we when we filter out using this
sort of filter function so let's go
ahead and put in our code here and some
comments here calls filter to run remove
false our method this returns values or
only for all non and as they put it
false II variables now again there's
multiple ways we could have done this in
this case remove filter probably just
seemed the easiest way and you can also
use it's a good good practice you use
boolean here so sometimes maybe you'll
want to put ten less than nine to print
out you can just do boolean that or
boolean this and get a boolean value for
something so to keep that in mind and
throw that in the back of your mind it
may become useful at a later date but
this was bonfire falsely bouncy on free
code camp and the basic algorithm
