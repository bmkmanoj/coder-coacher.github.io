in free code camp we are doing the
advanced algorithm symmetric difference
so this one was some pretty hard just
because it got a little complicated
first off because I didn't fully
understand what it was that we needed to
do I thought we only needed to count
unique numbers which is why my first
couple tests failed
well we actually need to do is make sure
that we have a unique number in each set
so if you have multiples in a single set
but they're not in any other sets of
data it will still pass and we need to
take we need to put our code not to
accept two arrays but as many arrays as
we need now the way that I did this
first was I to get started was we needed
to combine all of our arguments from
here and we the way that I did that or
basically get all all of our arguments
into the same thing so we know how much
data we're working with I simply created
a variable and we'll put comments as we
go along that slices all arguments into
a single array that's basically what
we're trying to do here and so if we
were to run our code right now you'll
see we'll get will only get one argument
we're getting our first parameter here
because this is all that that's going in
which isn't what we need to do so what
we need to do is get all the all the
arguments all the parameters and so
we're just going to create an arts array
and called the array dot slice dot call
and then the arguments object this is
basically going to slice all the
arguments into an array and you'll see
right now when we return this let's go
ahead and throw this in here we now get
all our arguments which is an array of
in this case a race now it could be an
array of whatever but in our case it's
an array of two it could just be a
number and a string but we'd get it all
now the next thing we're going to need
to do is you is there's a couple
different ways we can do this the
easiest way is to simply create a
function and then reduce that function
reduce will basically run our code and
have it do some stuff or have it run
through each iteration of our code I
should say now the next thing we want to
do is create our callback function
reduce takes in a callback function a
callback function as a function that's
run after you have some data and then it
does some stuff our function so we're
going to call back I'll put some
comments here function to iterate
through through multiple arrays for
reduce and we're just going to call this
function we're in create our function
and we're going to call this simdiff
symmetric difference right and so we're
going to take in two parameters so
reduce always takes in or almost always
I should say takes in two parameters you
have parameter 1 and then parameter 2
you return a value or you do something
with that and then you move on to the
next one in the next one and the next
one and so on and so forth that's how
reduce work so when you set up our
callback function in the same fun same
way now what we want to do is keep track
of all the unique values in our data set
or in our arguments and then we're going
to make sure that they they don't for
that for each array they don't have any
values that match the other array that
we're comparing and so on and so forth
so the first thing that we need to do is
just go ahead and create something to
store those values in so this is going
to create a right to store unique values
and I'm going to show you two different
ways to iterate through and for loops
and for each loop and they both do the
same thing but in just slightly
different ways but just a showcase how
each one works in case you thought you'd
do it one way or the other but so we're
going to create this unique valves and
this is going to be equal to an empty
array now this is again it's going to be
where we store the unique values now the
first thing that we want to do is create
a for loop so we're going to have two
for loops here one two one to compare
the values that are in array
with that that's already in unique
values to make sure that it doesn't
already exist we don't want to add it
already and the second for loop is to do
the same with with the unique values to
or the second array excuse me
so we're basically doing the same thing
except for once for one array and one's
for the other so let's start with a
simple for loop so we're gonna have RI
is equal to zero and while I is less
than R 1 dot length because we're
checking through the entirety of the
first array so one of the is less than
that I plus plus a simple for loop and
then we have an if statement in here and
what we're comparing in our if statement
is saying look if the second value is
the second array dot index of meaning if
it's not contained or we haven't
actually put in index of the current
item we're iterating on our R one I so
in this case if it is R 1 0 it'd be if
one wasn't contained in a right index 2
and not contain being less than zero and
it's not in our unique Val so unique
Val's
dot index up and then pass in the value
that you're checking for which is going
to be R 1 I less than 0 so if if it's
not contained within here go ahead and
add that value to our unique values so
if it's not in our second array and it's
not in our our unique Val's array go
ahead and add that now we'll do this
like so unique Val's dot push and we
just go push that value now that this is
one way of writing your for loop we're
going to showcase how to do it in a
second way so in our example here we're
doing a simple for loop and now we're
going to do a for each loop now a for
each loop works by us say running
basically a callback function in it or a
function and we're basically saying look
an array two for each value in the array
do something with that data in our case
is a function that takes in the item
that we're iterating on
and this is basically going to iterate
through everything it's the equivalent
of us doing our for loop because this
for loop right here is going to iterate
through the whole array as we have it
set up same thing here iterate through
each item and then do something with
that item so we just have to write our
logic slightly different but still the
same logic so in this one we're get
checking to see if it's in array one so
if array 1 dot index up and then in this
case we're pass passing an item because
it's the item in the array is less than
0 and the unique value array dot index
of that item is less than 0 meaning it's
not in array 2 and not in unique valves
we're gonna go ahead and push that value
into unique valves so unique valves dot
push now all this may be pretty
straightforward at this point it's a
little complicated but if you could you
kind of it makes a lot of sense now the
last thing you have to do here in this
callback function simply return unique
valves at the end reduce always requires
a return to actually do anything and so
right here all we need to do is take our
original argument args array call reduce
on this function here and it's going to
return our unique valves so reduced will
iterate through our callback function
and give us a single return which in
this case will be our unique valves and
so let's go ahead and do simdiff pass in
our callback function and where did I
mess up our dot index
oh here we are so our dot index of
course it wouldn't be it wouldn't be a
coding tutorials 360 video without a
syntax mistake so that was the symmetric
difference now very complicated for you
know took me a while I had to get some
help online and look at an example of
true to fully understand what I was
doing wrong and I realized I was
actually not counting for duplicates but
again you want to come
pile all the arguments into a single
array of arguments you then want to
write your callback function here that's
going to be used in reduce which is
going to be iterated through and then
reduce gets the return value of unique
valves and then you basically check each
value until you're out of arguments that
this is correct and you'll push the
items and it returns that so pretty
complicated reduce those a lot of help
in this array.prototype dot reduce and
the symmetric difference was something
that you should probably should pay more
attention to but I hope you guys found
