be talking about view Jas we have Eric
who recently changes channel - Eric the
programmer is that right yeah program
with Eric program with ex-ira messed
this up I know it changed though and
it's the thought that counts but now a
two-time author the first book was on
amber Jay s and now you're a co-author
of a book on huge as opposed to title
that one view Jay s in action now what
is feud yes because as someone who
follows the trends of angular and react
those have kind of been the the two main
sort of front-end languages but now a
lot of people are seeing beauty is on
the rise we might kind of diving in -
yes sir vgs is a what they call it a
progressive framework as the slogan on
the website is similar to these other
single page or client-side frameworks
out there I was created by a guy named
Evan you in 2013 while he worked at
Google and he even described at the
beginning wasn't even called view he
just thought it was kind of a crappy
version of angular he wanted to try to
create his own version of angular with
it what he deemed more worthy and then
kind of history goes that it he was kind
of tinkering on it and then you finally
kind of put something together pretty
1.0 days of UJ at that he submitted to
hacker news you know that's a pretty
popular website that you can submit
links to the story you guys have number
one in hacker news the github for the
project went from like 10 stars to like
600 stars and if you don't know github
and stars kind of doesn't really tell
you a whole lot but starts can kind of
tell you if a project has a lot of
momentum or enthusiasm behind it so from
there it kind of got more and more
popular at one point no it was
completely rewritten and then that was
probably in early 2015 and
in 2016 2.0 came out beauty s 2.0 and it
was another complete rewrite of it again
a big portion of is rewritten and if the
momentum has just kind of been moving
more and more I guess it's gaining a lot
of momentum that's what I'm trying to
say in the last couple of years and it's
good now what why do you think that is
are people just sick of angular react
being kind of the two big bosses or like
hey we need something new and fresh or
what like what what do you think it is I
think I came out with what the idea of
you know batteries are not included so
it has it's a real simple progressive
framework and meaning that you can
easily add it to your projects if you
just have your own static website you
can easily add it in you don't have NPM
install 30 different libraries to get it
working you can either just included
within a CDN at the top or just
including your project really easily but
it's also powerful enough that you can
create a whole web app using VJ s to
have it do everything that has its own
router it has its own kind of data store
called view X which is cool very similar
to something called flux so it has a lot
of these things that that to make it
really powerful but it's the simplicity
of it is you can just add it right into
your project and get it working and it's
very maintainable so if another
developer comes in and they want to get
started and they see your code and it
has view in it it's easy for them to to
see oh well this is this is a V model
directive I kind of see this for loop
here I think I kind of see what you're
doing here so it's really easy for
people to get on boarded on new
developers getting started with it so
that's kind of some of its strengths and
I think that developer communities has
seen this and they in the last couple
years have really shifted away from more
these monolithic frameworks that do
everything kind of like ember jf did
back in the day maybe a little bit like
angular one and they're really like the
smaller faster lightweight frameworks
that can come in and do everything for
you I I will definitely show you that I
can agree with that sentiment because
when trying to tackle like angular for
I started recently diving into it and
the overhead for it if anybody's dived
into angular 2 or above when you with
the QuickStart has about 70 files in it
and it's kind of ridiculous yeah I mean
it's crazy it's and and this there has
been a shift towards all these
frameworks and libraries reactives more
of a library but definitely view is
pictured more of a framework from the
creator of having these CLI that build
everything for you and and make it make
it big and large and get you started
which is nice for a beginning developer
but then you get all this crap added in
your own billing of what's happening and
doing a lot of different things so you
can of course build it either way on the
view side you can just quickly add it to
a project or you can use something like
the view CLI which is a way to generate
a new project now as someone who's
interested in view Jas and I have done
very little research I just like to try
new things what would be a good sort of
learning path or a good way for me to
maybe start a project are there any
resources and I know your your book I'm
sure is one but what sort of projects
would be a good entry-level introduction
to view well yeah I love the community
of you they have there's a pretty
popular a couple of pretty popular
forums where everybody goes to get help
on view I think they even have a slack
channel on so double check the the
documentation for view I mean I love for
you guys to go buy my book and it's in
early access right now it's called Vijay
s in action and I think Dylan will
probably giving away a copy to Dylan so
he can give to you guys that are
watching either now or sometime later in
the future I'm not sure one but
Wednesday Wednesday when the video goes
out we the following day someone's
getting a copy so tune it awesome yeah
well but really the documentation is
really stellar on the vue.js website
they have a really quick introduction to
get started that if you
just spend like an afternoon going
through the UJS docks you're going to be
pretty far ahead when you get to the
bottom if you so that I definitely
recommend if you if you don't decide to
get a book or two definitely have my
books on more hand-holding I give you a
lot bigger scenario go on to more
technical details but if you want to get
started the vue.js docks are just great
they're really top-notch I'm excited to
hear that because as a rule of thumb and
I made a joke about this in a Facebook
group the other day about how I'd like
that the coding Ten Commandments that I
think the seventh one was that
documentation will always be the worst
part of the application and it's nice to
know that some companies and some people
are building out libraries are actually
taking the additional time because
there's so much to do that sometimes
documentation even testing goes to the
wayside so I'm glad to hear that yeah
absolutely they did a pretty good job
I've been in people up to speed and
playing the concepts of you now what
what sort of technologies would go
hand-in-hand well with you or is it is
it one of those that you can use with
almost anybody yeah that's kind of the
power power of you it's it's really
meant to be in place for anything you
you need it for so you can in your
existing websites if you need a special
widget or special special logic that you
need in there you can just throw in view
the life as a framework inside there you
just include it at the top or if you
need a credible web app you can do it as
well and if you do have some more
complicated user interactions and you're
talking to a back-end it needs you to
have different data and it becomes a
little bit more complicated depending on
the user action you do the area's from
go view X which I kind of touched upon
about earlier so you do have a kind of a
data layer that you can use to manage
your user interactions to the backend
and the data store itself this is nice
anything else that you would like to add
about why someone might want to use you
or its benefits that we have we haven't
covered
you definitely a just kind of hammer
home this point that is just the
simplicity of it all is just really
simple to get started this uses
something called directives which you
can inline right into your HTML to do a
lot of things that that other languages
require or other frameworks might
require more setup the VB instance is
really simple so it's just really easy
to get started and it's really powerful
it also has transitions kind of built
into the library too so if you're trying
to do some fancy animations you can use
what you just has built in to make your
animations easier to look at and so if
you're kind of dipping your toe into
this client-side framework angular react
world out there ember world I think this
is a good starting point I like that you
said the about the animations because
that's one thing like I don't know I
always talk on jQuery but jQuery
add a lot of cool little animation
functions built in to really make your
life easy and make your your your web
applications pop a little bit and a lot
of those didn't carry over to react and
angular and so it's nicely here that you
have has that built in yeah it has it
has some parts where it makes it easier
to write your own CSS and do transitions
for it but yeah that is part of the
framework so where can people and you
show your the book is in pre-release
yeah so it's in Manning's pre-release
program it's called MEAP Manning early
access program so there's three chapters
available right now you can actually go
to the Manning website and download the
first hacker for free to see if you like
it otherwise you can check out the full
book on the menu website I'll be
updating it about once a month you'll be
starting to see new chapters come up I'm
also really focused on quality so any
problems with typos stuff like that I'm
definitely getting those take care of
but also if there's any problems with
any of the code no I'm really interested
to hear what people think of examples
and then I'm going to be improving on
those examples to make them even better
and so I think that's kind of the power
of the early access program what that
Manning has
you can you get that out there quick and
you can get feedback quick so you can
mix it make a better book overall nice I
look forward to reading and I know
everyone watching is hoping they're the
lucky one that gets the book so thank
you thank you and everybody knows I know
it's not just you everyone you know a
lot of times a lot of people collaborate
on books so make definitely extend the
thanks as well yeah you're welcome
