Petersburg
so same Mari go far go soon be st.
Petersburg alright um so what were let's
get everybody caught up to speed what
were you working on lasting or so on my
portfolio page and I recently discovered
that what I was doing was unconventional
so I'm now using hopefully code that's
more cadential I have rebuilt a second
menu bar um looks totally different from
the first one did you want to see it
oh no not right now we'll wait a little
bit did you want to show it as are you
asking yeah okay
yeah well wait till you tell you then
you show it to me if you want some help
let it be a surprise
oh all right so uh were you able to get
to any JavaScript yet um wait mean we've
been doing JavaScript on your own though
have you been well I've been doing the
notes and going through it so so you've
been doing that all summer yeah I'm a
little bit behind from what we are doing
but I'm trying to catch up cool all
right so let's go ahead and continue on
the JavaScript lesson plan
so so last time we're talking about the
difference between double equals and
triple equals are strictly equal and we
are saying that it checks equality and
value and so that's the main difference
you remember that each variable has the
type that type could be boolean string
number etc and then it has a value the
value that's stored in it so when we're
doing triple equals or strictly equals
we're checking for both those values all
right so in this example uses strictly
equal operators so the functional equal
its values trickly equal to seven so in
this case we're checked with the triple
equals we're checking that it is equal
to the number and the value of seven the
type being number and the value seven
now there's also not equal so so far
we've only been checking that a value is
correct but sometimes we just want to
make sure that it's not a certain value
or if it's not that value run something
it's kind of like before we're checking
true and instead we're checking not true
or false depending on how you look at so
you can use this not equal operator and
this works similar to similar to how the
there's a not equals and there's not
equals equals and that's a strictly not
equals operator and then the not equals
operator works in the same way so in our
example here where one is not equal to
two that's true right now one the number
one is not equal to the character one is
false
gender Stan because the both the type
it's what we only care about the value
the string one so because
it's not a because it's a string it's
not considered the same yeah but because
we're saying that it's not equal to it
it is thus is false so this is this uh
so forget the knot for a second is one
double equals two string one equals
equals yes okay now is one so that would
be a true statement now one is not equal
to the string one thus it's false
because it is equals you get it so we're
saying they're not equal to each other
but they are thus it's a false statement
are you need not get it I mean I get it
I understand what you're telling me but
why why why what - cheap
because these are the tools that you use
when you're writing your logic all we're
learning our syntax right now so this is
something like something in your tool
set so you need to remember when the
time comes that this is available for
you to use when you're solving
algorithms or you're building your
project because it's true it's not true
exactly so it's a false statement so
it's like me saying heads is not equal
to heads well that's false because it
clearly is equal but the reason I show
you here is because they're using the
not they're not using a strictly not
equals there we're only we only care
here about the value not the type as
well all right so um
so add an equality operator that's what
this not equals is called an equality
operator and make sure it is not equal
to 99 so if it's not equal to 99 we're
going to return not equal if it is it's
going to return equal cool now there's
also the strict inequality operator
which works exactly like the Equality
operator except it's the opposite but it
checks the type and it checks the value
okay why do you need a non equality
operator um well this is one of those
more this is something that's a little
more unconventional in JavaScript so
maybe you don't care maybe so say
there's an input box by default usually
it's a string and say you don't really
care and you just want to take in the
number and say look all I care it that
it's a value if it's n that I it's if
it's seven string they meant seven
number it's all good
it's all it's usually considered bad
practice but it's fine because it works
yeah and this is something that's kind
of unique to JavaScript because
typically other higher languages would
never allow you to do this there you go
so testing is something that as one
Alexandre brings up testing you will
actually write tests to make sure that
your code is running properly and so
sometimes you'll pass a value in and you
want to make sure that that's actually
not true because it shouldn't be if your
codes running right
all right so exactly like we were saying
so three is not equals equals to
quotation three so thus it's true
because we're checking the value and
we're checking the type and three is not
equal to equals the three is false
because three is equals the three in
value and type all right so here let's
go ahead and apply what this is not
equals equals 217 I wish that they would
actually have everybody here type the
bulk of this out am I am i incorrect in
saying that I think that they should
have you guys - this out it might be a
little bit too much busy work okay so I
mean you're getting a you're getting the
VIP treatment right now this I call this
the free code camp special when you get
you know good you get my my tutoring so
FCC special let's go ah nice so um so
similar so we so far all we've been
dealing with is if things are equal or
not equal there's also greater than or
less than so these are called the
comparison operators they work exactly
as you would expect them to work in
algebra 2 is greater than 1 2 is less
than 1 is false right so 2 being greater
than 1 is true two being less than 1 is
false ok 5 is greater than 3 is a true
statement 7 is greater than 3 string is
also a true statement even though it's
the string it represents a number 2 is
greater than 3 is false and then we have
1 is greater than 9 is false 1 string
string 1 is greater than Icefall slaw so
good luck with your HTML godless monkey
welcome and then we have greater than so
in this case we'll use greater than so
if
the value we're passing in the parameter
is greater than 100 we want it to return
over 100 if the value is greater than 10
we want to return greater than 10 makes
sense
so there's also greater than or equal to
exactly like it would be in Mouse where
oh yeah my next question yeah so greater
than or equal to so six is greater than
or equal to six is a true statement
seven is greater than or equal to
quotation three is string three is a
correct statement two being greater than
or equal to three is a false statement
and string seven greater than or equal
to nine is a false statement as well so
it works exactly as you would expect it
would it compares the values not the
type just the values all right so here
we'll do greater than or equal to 20 and
then here we'll do greater than or equal
to ten
cool so you we also have the less than
operator so so far we've been doing a
grave any lesson it works in the same
exact fashion yeah this is great I get
all this yeah alright so if a value is
less than 25 in our code here if the
parameter passing in we're going to get
it to return 25 remember it's gonna
evaluate if this is a true statement if
it is it's going to run the code in yep
hola
I'll let me see if I can pronounce this
name dyani shield eos autumn s do you
think I got but I I got a lot of names
on him pretty Oh Mattie butchering the
left right help
I sometimes up my own name so I so
there's also less than or equal to I so
James she she's asked me to kind of
review this she's she's going through it
on her own as well so tomorrow the stuff
that we are doing now she'll be doing
also on her own so I'm kind of trying to
give context as well as explain the
concepts and then tomorrow she'll go and
or the next day
go and review it so everything we're
doing here is kind of a almost like a
prep work for her to go into free code
camp and start studying the JavaScript
so any questions she has I don't expect
her to remember everything we're going
over but it's it's more of an
introduction and as she picks up the
little bits and pieces and gets to the
harder part ah there you go James
Scott's got it yes this is more of a
lecture base in which she's going to go
back and do them on her own as well so I
don't think this is all it she's
studying two and a half to three hours a
day on her own currently working on the
portfolio project you know what if this
is all that it was it I would be a
 genius if I could just watch
someone else do it and be like yeah
all right so less than or equal to yeah
yeah I definitely have my own account
and I'm doing it all there this is the
beta guys there's nothing on here so
weird Cup some of the things we're
covering right now or just more concepts
that aren't even in the production
version so shook it she'll get a little
bit extra as well which is why we're
doing the beta and not the free code
camp current version right now so let's
enter equals to works exactly as you
would expect
meaning that same just opposite yeah if
it's less than or equal to the number
we're comparing okay and then the the
lesson sign and the greater sign and all
the nine those all go before the equals
sign yes so it always goes less it
always goes the less than or greater
sign then equals okay and I cannot never
is there a difference between switching
them it just won't work okay uh let's
see um what's this all about pleasing my
new Aurora I am helping one hour a day
for a hundred days teach my girlfriend a
code using free code camp as our
resources probably for the first twenty
days or so we'll be using free code camp
and mainly because my hands kind of
jacked up I had I wanted to do more but
we're waiting on that so I'm introducing
her to topics via free code camp and
then she spends about two-and-a-half
hours a day studying on her own um let's
see you know there's a Coney show on
YouTube called coding 360 I had no idea
what is it really let's see here
how new is that
okay young I look care now
baby-faced uh I probably I'm just gonna
get all my videos if I just search for
coding 360 they're all my videos I
thought you was referencing you Oh is he
I missed the point I did it go over my
head
I really thought that's what he was
saying and then when you said that I was
like oh did I miss the pocket let's talk
about your show I don't I don't really I
thought you meant like there's a podcast
or something all right
I ain't how guys uh beloved yeah he does
he spends like hours on those SEO tags
like for sure he wants those top spots
well I should you know what my
channel should have coding 360 in it my
goddamn name's coding tutorials 360 I
should have the top spot there's not
like it I'm competing with anybody else
any I gotta show a little bit of a brain
part thing apparently only fairly only I
thought he was talking about uh another
channel hey that's awesome man you I've
been following coding Torah 360 for
quite a while now I almost completed the
front-end part of freaking camp will be
helpful in it for me to follow this
hundred days of code it may fill in gaps
of what you're doing but I I don't even
know if she's going to need to finish
the front insert in a hundred days but
that's going to be the goal of these
next hundred Dave idios but you may find
bits and pieces helpful um all right so
let's continue on so we have the less
than or equals operator here that checks
is that if it's less than or equal to in
this case we're going to say twelve and
then hey James I'll answer your question
at the end yeah we at the end of the
video guys for less where did we do our
long videos and at the last ten minutes
it's a ama with April Oscar whatever
guys want or me for that matter um okay
so in here what are we trying to get
let's let's focus wheat you seem to
understand um about less than or equals
right it's just basic medical um now
it's not always with number or I guess
it it it is always no recent um in the
most part with the less than or equal to
right it's always with numbers almost
always for the sake argument we'll just
say oh please uh so uh so what are we
what are we trying to get we're trying
to get what type of value in here when
we when we when we evaluate Val is less
than equal to twelve what what is it
going to return return two types of
values they're two values see they're
smaller equal to well it's full it's
going to say it's gonna be true or false
a boolean value that's what we're trying
to get all this is doing is evaluating
whatever that is how do you know what's
the bullion value there's no blue
because Val let's say Val is 1111 is
less than or equal than twelve and that
is what true or false
sure so we get a boolean and this is
what this is actually equals this is it
see that it's evaluating in those
parentheses you're not returning it or
setting to anything all all if
statements do is they check if this is
true or false who is you have like a
string or you map if if Dylan is equal
to Dylan that's a true statement
if the number seven is equal to the
double equals to the character seven or
the the string seven that's a true
statement if it's triple equals that's a
false statement because that's type and
value but all that's going on here is
we're checking this and we're using
different operators to say less than or
equal in this case so it's like an
automatic
yeah well not automatic how to get to
the beta free cocaine beta free code
camp calm um so just like yeah that's it
okay okay the first thing that you could
probably guess would be how to do it uh
uh um so this makes sense so right like
all we're trying to see is yeah it makes
sense I just I was just curious yeah
like if they're all half so it's just a
given that it's gonna be a true or false
if you look at the statement if whether
it's gonna be a boolean or whatever it's
gonna be it's just a given that's what
it is
it it's it if you wrote it correctly
that is what it will do it is he value
anyway like I would say yes I do
aggression yes yes well I'm just saying
people their code up all the time
uh so um yes I am interested I have been
doing different types of versions of
this since I was like elementary school
because my stepdad at the time he was a
web engineer and he also built computers
and part of keeping the annoying little
bratty April busy was to occupy her mind
in building computers and typing code
out so um now i oq mine occupy her mind
with code and her body with other things
so anyhow anyhow so yes I am interested
it's just uh even though I went to
school for something else
still in his shemesh on her the light
boys show me the light alright so um so
thus far we've only been evaluating one
statement what's in here when we do Val
is less than less than five what we're
actually doing is we are um
weird that's called a statement we're
evaluating this statement the
entertainment evaluating is this true
but you can have more than one statement
and there's something called an and
operator and so maybe maybe we need two
things to be true okay so if the color
if this color is blue then this color
needs to be purple well that that would
be that wouldn't be in the statement but
if the color is blue is the statement
that's evaluating and then the color
would be purple you've returned set the
variable and what you said but let's say
if the if the word is sky and the color
is blue trick this trick that if those
are both accurate if both of those
statements are true we're comparing one
and we're comparing another we have two
statements that they both need to be
true or else it doesn't pass this if
five is equal to 5 and 4 is equal equal
to 3 it fails even though the first one
is right and the second one's wrong
alright so so here we're going to be
joining a couple numbers so we have the
hand operator combined two statements
into one statement so you'll see you say
okay well maybe you didn't catch on this
but you could actually nest exists
statements but there's no reason to it's
less code it gets less complicated so
what we can do here is we can actually
get rid of this if statement and we can
just use the and operator and this is
this is crucial to good because a lot of
people will this up when they're
getting started and they'll have ten if
statements that it's just is way too
confusing way too much code now if
you're editing code wouldn't you
to be like tentative stamens not a man
no no you refactoring in fact you do the
work very fast
all right see so combine the two is
statements in one statement which will
return yes it valves less than we have
such a good chat I just really love good
communication
so if val is less than or equal to 50
and the value that's coming in is less
than or equal to or greater than or
equal to 25 so the number if the number
we're passing in here if the number
we're passing in here is between 25 and
50 it's true interesting but if it's 51
it's false even though it's greater than
25 and that's true it's not true in both
these cases and it has to be true for
all the ends and we could do as many
hands as we wanted to get this to pass
so it is exactly as Manu is saying here
lesser code is better code it's easier
to read it's easier to understand now
there are going to be situations in
which you can't simplify your code or
it's already I'm actually having trouble
with that right now
I've been ivan like looking at my code
and i'm pretty sure there's like things
in there that I can like simplify I just
I was that was what was taking me so
long I thought I was looking into
simplifying it and I'm like well don't
don't don't worry about that because I'm
gonna review it with you just like we do
the first project I wanted to be perfect
the first gecko no your code will never
do for it the first we go alright uh so
we did that things possible alright so
we have the and operators that we can
use there's also something called an or
operator so it's kind of the opposite of
the and operator where we're um in this
case the and both have to be true in the
or as long as one of them strip it works
oh that's cool I was that was my next
question
it's crazy how they're on top of it yeah
um do you know a free cooking foot
accept code that you put on your github
for them to review for the projects on
the front end my understanding is you
have to put on code pin that's just what
they asked in terms of submitting it
although from what I understand they're
going to be changing how their back-end
projects go and a few changes with their
front end projects but they're still on
cocaine good luck with your python
godless monkey thank you Palace monkey
all right so good luck to you as well so
let's let's use the or operator the way
you do laura operator is with two
straight lines it's right above the
shift key right here yeah okay cuz I I
looked for for a while on our first guys
sorry what is the English major I use it
on so all right so if the val is a long
time like 20 minutes like 30 seconds
well a long enough time they memorize
where was that after that phone are you
Oh Julie takes about 20 minutes so in
this case we're going to do if it's not
between the statement is if val is not
between 10 and 20 inclusive inclusive I
guess mean equal to so if the value is
is not C will return yes only if none is
between 5 and 10 so if value is not
greater than 10
or how am i doing here I'm going full
retard for a second okay so if the value
is not between 10 and 20
so if val is greater than when they say
no 20 greater than 20 so if the value is
greater than 20 or val is less than 10
hey bit code Thank You Man says let's
get this party started with a $5
donation is pretty started it started
thank you I appreciate that man
another five dollars towards our 4k goal
parent I realized is that my hundred
days of coding is gonna land on like day
night for my birthday
that's not know your birthday is in like
two weeks
ah the optimistic Oh day nineteen oh
yeah
yeah is it hey you're close
yeah you're right Dave twenty it's all I
got
yeah um thank you for the support man if
you guys want if you guys want to
support the channel you can one of the
great ways through donation if you're
able to if not the patreon is also great
but the very least make sure to join our
Facebook group code tech and caffeine
the link is in the description you'll
stay up-to-date on all the greatest
coding news and things like that
and occasionally uh curious as to how
big code got his name cuz that's a
really a good name big code like it
actually is that some laughs final okay
so uh if the value is greater than 20 21
and above or the value is less than ten
nine and above this will work as long as
this one or the other okay so they're
asking
combine the two if statements into one
statement which returns outside if well
is not between 10-point so here we can
get rid of this one like so happy early
birthday Nathaniel yay maybe's your
Taurus you stubborn son of a all right
so so when an if statement is true the
block of code is executed we already
know that right yes combine the if
statements into a single statement so
what we can how can we make how can we
take this statement and I gotta feel
like that was the case so how can we
take this and combine it into a single
if statement with the an an I mean yeah
with the an or that war
what is it asking combine the if
statement into a single is oh I'm sorry
my mistake we're doing an else statement
so so instead of writing a bunch of if
statements sometimes we just have to
check one thing and if it's not that
it's the other thing right so in this
case if the value is not greater than 5
it's got to be less than 5 right greater
than or equal to 5
so we what we would do is we'd have this
statement followed by an else statement
like this you'll notice that it's not
there's no it's not evaluate anything
because if this doesn't if this doesn't
if this hits this never gets nothing
happens here but if it doesn't and it
fails it runs the else statement that
make says if that first one doesn't run
the else will run and what is the else
the else in this case is whatever you
want it to be in the UH
which for theirs what is the function of
else though like else what else else so
if this fails else we'll have code that
will run but it only runs if the
statement is false so like right here we
don't have to write a whoops I forgot
the else do I have an Instagram account
I do I think it's if you go to my
channel page it's on there although I'm
not very active on it
I'm mainly active just on Facebook and
YouTube and Twitter by just I do have
one although all my pictures would be
the same ones as I put on my thumbnails
for ask a dev all the time so it's so I
don't you've seen all the good stuff um
so here we say if this is true the
result is bigger than five if this is
false this is false skip this run or
else
get it
all right so let's let's play game um
ten are val is ten what what's the
result on the up statement yes what what
is the result
what is result equal to if our val is
ten our parameter is ten it's true and
it runs the if statement okay and if
it's for what happens as well as then it
runs the elston good uh did Erin get any
word yet on the positioning and fly -
not that I'm aware of
so there's also these things called else
if statements we just went over that no
we went over an else statement there's a
else if not it if else else if so I feel
like you're just trying to be funny
oh but it's a natural thing no it is
actual thing it's a big part of program
so I also save it so there's an if-else
and there's an else--if well actually
there's an if and there's an else but
there's an else if so there's three
things demand developers probably 90%
minute it all right are intact ah now
that I think that's anything to do with
it this is zoological free right now as
I was gone I it's just extremely tedious
tedious it shits like a gold mine they
used to have to put ones and zeros in
this bitch someone like me wrote this
kind of like if we all motion maybe like
sometimes I feel like it sometimes my
code word code would either work or not
work depending on if it was a good day
or a bad day
alright um so this is actually pretty
bad this is all just a really big joke
so don't no offense
all right so the ELSA statement the way
the LCF statement works is it's
basically a second if statement but it
only runs if the first one fails so the
else statement will run always if all of
them fail so let's say it goes if
statement so if it goes through your
tentative statements and they all fail
it goes something else yes and but is it
else first or else after so when you're
doing this you put all the else's or you
put all this well there's only going to
be one else ever because that's just
gonna be it runs when all the FS fell
now there's an else--if or say we start
with an F is that within a particular
score or can you what do you mean like
you have all these ifs so all right well
let me let me explain the elsif so the
way that else--if statement works is it
checks an if statement first you'll
never start with the helsing you'll
never start with the LCF okay
so the else will always be the final
ones that just good practice no no it
just won't work so it's good practice
also yes it won't worry it's good right
I know because good practice only
requires that you do it this like is
good not that it would okay so you
always start with an if statement if
that's what you're using so in this case
if the value is greater than ten
returned greater than ten now this
second statement if the value is less
than five doesn't make any sense why we
would run this because we already know
it's greater than ten okay so it doesn't
have to fail all of them is yourself so
okay wait wait what if one of them is
true does it else think that's that's
where the elsif comes into stage so we
only want this to run so if this returns
true we don't want to run our else and
we don't want to run any if statements
that are connected to it so the way that
we do it with the way that we connect
these if statements is we add an else in
front of this so similar to how the else
only runs if if the if is false same
goes for the else if so if this is false
go ahead and run the
now if this is true we're done um same
thing here if this is true we don't run
this so what wait okay so why does the
second one forget it if else--if and not
the first one or any of them for that
matter
kranji welcome thank you menu I'm sure
she'll she will do her best
Cheers thank you Cheers that's right
all right so you start with the if
because because you're checking that's
the first value you're checking you're
not comparing - there's nothing to run
before it so it's an if statement okay
so the if is your first now after that
if this if you have another if statement
that's related to this that you only
want to run if this fails you would do
an else--if and the reason you would do
that is so that your code would be
faster and there's no knees it there's
no reason to run it if you're already if
it's if the first one already passed
right so what if you have like three of
them out there you do another else if
and it would work the same way so if we
add another else if and we're saying
look so say we had three ifs if and then
else if and then if and then elsif if
you did that
those would actually be two separate
groups so if you did if else if those
these the first two would be related and
then the second two would not would be a
so no well no you could do another else
if like this as well but if you if you
decided to do a new a new if statement
what you're basically saying is hey we
have a new first one it's not related to
this other one so you can have multiple
elsif yes you have multiple use multiple
elsif but what if you had if else--if
else--if it along if is its own first
one the second half is his own first one
and that LCF is connected to the second
half and if there's a second L set is
connected to the to the second so if its
own thing then it'd be if else--if so if
that's if the first if that if failed
it checked else if if that else have
failed we check the next elsa
school and then SEP kron z AA bit code
have a good one man
thank you again for all the support on
what's your what's my point of view on
laravel lair Ville is probably the a bit
code thanks for the donation is the most
aimed demand PHP framework right now I
think if you're trying to get good with
PHP and you want to that it that would
probably be a good place to go
especially for the job market as well it
seems to be very well received when I
interviewed a PHP developer on my
channel he said the same thing and I
tend to listen to professionals for the
most part um but okay I think I think
you're getting this right yeah okay and
then finally say they all failed
you'd have s but remember else wasn't
true the but the house is always true if
it gets to there there is not remember
it's not evaluate anything it's just
running okay oh there you go companion
Aaron has not heard yet about getting
I'm sure he'll hear shortly though um
two weeks is the minimum three months is
the max I got hired in like four days
but also my work was new with starting a
software yet I feel like if they needed
someone ASAP now if you already have an
up and running Technology Center they
may take a little bit longer so yeah
it's not uncommon I would say you'll
probably hear within a week though
alright let's clear this and start fresh
so what we're going to do is we're going
to change this if to an else--if so it
only runs so it only runs if this first
one fails right okay yeah and then we're
gonna add an else that this only runs if
both these fail
okay how's your finger and I'll find out
tomorrow I get a life my hand gets
checked up tomorrow guys wish me luck
9:15 a.m. tomorrow yeah you guys
according to April you might be calling
me nubs now on is my finger in alright
um alright so this talks about doing
things in logical orders I had surgery
on my hand that's a long story I
probably do a video about it to show off
the nasty photos and stuff for fun we'll
see
so people are already telling him it's
gross on Facebook thank you like thank
you Nathaniel um 6:52 what time are we
you know well we've been going 43
minutes oh this looks like it's not deep
so so uh one thing to consider is that
when you're writing these statements you
need to write them in a correct logical
order so so that take this example right
here if I bare outlines to this is there
a good practice for I don't know what
you're trying to get out so like there's
this thing called chunking so I'm
wondering if there's like like already a
set like good practice for what you just
said the logical order oh well I still
me too um I a sleep next to it
I make her I make her kiss it before bed
every night I said I take off the
bandage I said baby kiss it and make it
better
my lines are magical I'd uh anyhow um so
well let's let's take the example we
have here when I talk about logical
order we want to make sure that we get
the most correct if statement like cuz
some may be some so there may be
multiple ones correct but we want to get
the most correct all right so in this
yeah the most correct that does it make
sense so um
10 is greater than so in this look at
this fat this so say we have 7 all right
now say we have 3 then our number is 3
and thanks for the sub um so if 3 is
less than 10 is going to return less
than 10 right so because it's 3 I'll say
you had a 7 the 3 would be more correct
no no I'm telling you about how we're
setting up our if statements the are
returning value so in this case you're
trying to tell me what the most correct
the most correct way
the return value the most correct return
value so just let's just let me walk you
through again so if we have the value 3
it's going to return less than 10 it's
never going to hit this else if and it's
never going to hit this else right
because we already got a true value
makes sense but 3 is less than 5 in this
case and less than 5 is a better answer
than less than 10 because it's closer to
it
laughing about stupid or Italy's
what is the problem so in this case we
want to get the most correct return it's
the most accurate okay how is that the
case that both listen because this is
less than 10 this is less than 5 we're
getting where it's closer to closer to
what closer to five than it is to 10 but
they're both if they're both less than
they're both egg if anything the first
one is more correct because it's way
lesser no baby that is a crazy thing to
say hahaha it makes no sense
yeah most correct that's not crazy so
just had it imperfect so when you're
setting up your if statements and your
else statements you need to make sure
that you put D you put them in logical
order the logical order for this example
is that you would compare the value of 5
first then you would compare the value
of 10 but it's switched on there it's 10
and then 5 yeah but we're gonna fix it
that's the whole point
ah that so so it is at least to greatest
well it depends on what your your your
code is in this case it is this is mass
correcting it
absurd so it's called
logical order sure it is yeah most
correctly to be using most correct well
we want to know what number it's closest
to right because that would make it most
correct yes it would hey Steve hey not
stupid it makes sense all right so to
fix this we would switch our statements
and our returns in this case you can do
something like this with this we put to
put in the logical order because the way
that you want it to work is you want it
to hit only one statement in order so it
should never hit true before it's hit
the it should fail fail fail till it
hits that true and there shouldn't be
another statement below it that's true
okay that mean that's that's false
correct because in this statement in
this case when we swap these values here
it's going to hit the first true value
and then there's a true value behind it
we don't want that we want to hit we
want it to hit everything in order
properly in the logical order
I feel like logic is now becoming
objective lot know is it's really not
it's closer to that number it's it's
extremely subjective
there's nothing subjective about it it
is I feel like logic cannot be logic if
it's gonna be subjective it's not
subjective though so if we're going to
find most correct is subjective no all
right what we're trying to find is the
number that if our if our task is to
find what if it's between less than is
it closer to being less than five or is
it closer being less than ten that's our
objective and in order for us to do that
we have to put things in the correct
logical order because a number like
three is less than than both but we want
to know which one it's closer to it's
going to be correct for both of them yes
but we want to know which one it's
closest to those we have to put it in
the logical order they both may be
correct
closest to the so preferred that it is
because the number that it's less than
so if you have ten and you okay okay
okay okay okay we want to find the
number it's closest to all right that's
all
I'm right that's all you got to
know god I rinsed off on that one guys
will take tick questions for a bit Thank
You Lee the most correct question all
right thank you to bit code again and if
you haven't already guys make sure your
joints for all the subscribes those are
just as helpful yeah you haven't already
make sure to join the Facebook group
I'll throw it up in chat right now for
you but the links also in the
description if you're watching this at a
later date um then get to it
how does April's portfolio work I look
do you want to show off what you got
sure she's friend of reworking it a
little bit I told her that gotta go with
the more standard portfolio and that we
would know we ended up deciding oh yeah
shoot reverse engineer their sample
that's right because that is also a good
way to learn and currently I feel like
if that is more doable than maybe
something that I would somehow bring up
in my
okay see full-page so I asked her to
instead of creating her own portfolio to
reverse-engineer the portfolio that is
on there read upon I said I asked I
didn't say I told that bitch to make it
okay so that is what it looks like now
but check this out I got fancy
oh she got the hunger effect going on
that's impressive he got the hunger
effect going yeah uh what should I do
after my unpaid internship my parents
want me to go back to school but I don't
have any passion for my major why don't
you get a paid internship I mean once
you start making your own money at the
end of the day you can really do what
you want another another up another
thing to do if you're interested in
software you could you go ahead and join
a boot camp there's a lot of free ones
out there that are hard to get into but
it's been if you're already talented guy
you know you do it do that or you could
do a paid one as well family science oh
my god kill yourself no uh that sounds
rough man I wouldn't have any what's
family science like the inner workings
of parentals and the inner workings
oh that shit's really interesting I took
a psychology class and they're saying
that everything that you learn at home
you automatically use it as a basis to
apply to the world seriously it's really
interesting but if that's not your thing
then it's not you and you know what I
was actually something his name is
Tony's a man that is a straight-up
woman's major 90% of the night that's a
woman's Taufiq family science is a
female subject and we wonder why the
role it is today you know uh um Shane
thanks thanks man we got somebody from
Australia nice what's the international
channel
not if you know that maybe only 50
percent of my audiences from America the
other 50% is from around the world
they call me mr. international so
they're calling me with all those kisses
on your passport yeah oh that's nice
um I need um Tony when it comes to
there's a lot of there's a lot of talk
about between passion
um and okay doing what's more beneficial
and they say that things that are more
beneficial last longer and obviously are
more beneficial for you and others
around you who are gonna benefit from
your benefit so I mean his parents don't
understand what he does yeah it's you
know I don't like me
let's not dive into my side of this
ambitious or go that um look it's your
life and if you're gonna sit there and
let people what regardless of their your
family it's about being respectful
if they can't respect your choices you
can at least be respectful towards them
but respect yourself at the same time in
fact it's probably more important that
you respect yourself good money
respectful towards them but they have to
understand and let me give you some
practical advice cooked everything April
saying is true about having respect
wanna but here's the practical advice
man is you you have resume experience
now with your unpaid internship and I
hope at the same time you're working on
your skill set which I'm assuming is
software um I also hope that those
skills that you're working on are in
demand in the market so that you can go
and get a paid internship now and you
can start making your own money and if
you work for a year and you realize hey
I'm having trouble or hey I want to go
back to school change your major go into
a different major go into a boot camp
but I think that'd probably be best for
you
if you don't like unless you have six
months away from graduating a year away
from graduating in your family sciences
I'd really suggest that you consider
getting the paid internship and doing
school part-time and CS if you still
want to go to school maybe doing a boot
camp just some more practical things
because life is short man as someone who
hated school I can tell you that I I
think I school so um you know what
here's here's here's a couple things to
think about that and I absolutely agree
if you can physically emotionally and
mentally afford going to school and
doing your computer science thing at the
same time if you can do that 100 percent
power to you do it do it do it do it
because just having some type of
educational thing on your resume is not
going to hurt you but there's probably a
lot of chicks in your class you can pick
up on yeah if I were to go back I'd be a
nursing major that's not a chick subject
I really all of my nurses I ever get our
 man I don't know if is they've
been taken over my I got nurse take care
of my hand ill nurses get paid more well
clearly that's gay baby um this is what
I had to deal with little day it's like
this but it's like a hundred times worse
when the cameras off he's really well
behaved April how do you like cutting so
far hey James thanks for asking that
question that's actually what I wanted
to get to next so appreciate it uh how
do I like coatings so far it is um scary
pain in my ass but it's something that I
really do want to conquer it is
something that I really do want to get
good at it is something that um I don't
know if envy is the right word but when
I see Dylan do it and I see how good he
is and
he's doing all these videos and helps
other people teach them it just goes to
show you like how far he's gone to be so
great at this and it's just like man I
want to do that too so um it's a leading
example for me and code it so hard I
 my hand up yeah I'm uh I'm not to
say that I'm not competitive or a little
cocky myself god knows what I am cuz I
called my cocky no I'm calling me cocky
I'm not coming I'm saying is like it's
gonna get to a point where I'm just a
better coder than he had so he's got to
enjoy a while loss I would love for you
to be a better developer than me cuz I
know because then he would become the
stay-at-home wife no cuz I don't love
nothing more than that uh recommend
getting into object-oriented toriel so
we're going to be hitting the
object-oriented section down the road by
that I mean that right now is a little
bit too much I think to jump to
object-oriented when there's issues with
logical order if statement I like
granted in the moment it's making a lot
of sense because we're going over it uh
but a lot of this stuff when it comes to
coding it makes sense because I'm here
explaining it work I'm pounding pounding
pounding it away it's making sense to
you guys right now it's making sense to
her let's let me bring her back here in
30 minutes and see if it's still
make sense all I'm really doing is
hoping that because the next day I'm
doing my own notes and that's what I'm
doing I have to recall it if I can't
actually recall my own brain I'll go to
our videos and be like those videos have
so many views on them simply because I
go back so many times
yeah well best best of luck with you
Tony man yeah best of luck as someone
who yeah someone who was in school and
 hated it
I as I'm guessing you're probably pretty
young you're probably some if I don't
guess you're probably about 20 maybe 19
um I didn't make I didn't drop out of
school until I was about 26 and it was
probably the best decision I ever made
but
everyone's life is different and I I've
had I'll be honest with you man I've had
to work harder than most people to get
to where I am and I'm not very content
with where I'm at and I still work hard
every day I come home I code I work on
YouTube I'm learning new things I'm
watching videos I'm working on side
projects and there's a you know like
goes into all this and it's helped me in
my career but it's a lot of work man and
a lot of people wouldn't be able to do
it so if you are going to be kind of a
self motivate self-motivated individual
and self taught just know that it is
just as much work but it may be a better
environment for you yeah so Dylan he
didn't thrive in the school environment
and for me I did so it really is down to
a personal thing like if someone wanted
to pay me to go back to school
 yeah 100% I wouldn't hesitate it
would happen like right now um if I
could career in being a student it would
and with him he is the exact opposite
so coming and understanding from both
sides of the spectrum it's every
individual on that note guys we will
leave you thank you um if you're on
support you can a patreon and join the
Facebook group we're actually at this
shit's grown pretty fast guys honor if
you know thirteen hundred and seventy
five members so we're gonna hit fourteen
hundred pretty soon and I should
probably do a giveaway of fifteen
hundred I think so
or let me wax your chest no yes no
everyone wants to see that nobody wants
to see that everyone anyhow it's got
nothing to do with coding this is not
gonna become a weird I'm not gonna be
that weird coding guy lets you wax his
chest you know
then do you want it do you want it do
you want to send us out baby antennae
see see see look at it yes flick hey I
read chat just stands out let's get
this chest waxed
yes on that note on that note code long
and prosper no oh my bet I got you but
you screw days it's done now
oh my god okay okay ready Oh together
one on two one two so long</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
