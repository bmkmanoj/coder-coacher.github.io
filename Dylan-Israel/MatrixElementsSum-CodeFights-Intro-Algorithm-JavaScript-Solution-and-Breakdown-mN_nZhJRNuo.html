intro doing matrix elements um so what
are we trying to do here this is a
interesting one I hate when they try and
give you these nonsense explanations for
this is one of the ones or essentially
we are in a hotel and there's different
floors of the building and once a
certain room number is haunted all the
floors below it are now haunted as well
what does that mean well we're trying to
add all the values that are accurate in
this case you'll see that once we hit a
zero all values below it in the same
index spot is now a a quote-unquote
haunted value and so that means that we
no longer add that value so this two no
longer counts and of course they are no
longer counts as well however the one
here counts the one there counts the two
counts so this doesn't count and then
the five counts and then we get a zero
and zero and it knocks out the rest of
that so we have to add all those values
together but excuse me who allergies man
alright so how do we go about doing that
well the way that I did it
was I created a band index array and
then I did a double for loop within
there that check to see if that value
was a zero in that spot if it was I
added it to the band index and of course
I'm just added to the the price total
we're calculating the total values in of
the room so let's go ahead and get
started with that example let me zoom in
a little bit here so again we have what
I call price total price total is here
to keep track and we initialize that at
zero of the price of the rooms we then
have our band total or band index excuse
me which is an array of the indexes that
we hit a zero on we then ban that index
so that for future values of let's say
the one index on a lower floor
or the next whole array we no longer
count that index value that's why we
have this let's start by entering
through the length of our matrix that's
feeding pass in and you know what we
should start using let let is es6 so
we're going to begin using let here in
future videos these are good examples of
what so while I is less less than the
matrix input dot length I plus plus and
then we have so that is for the row and
now we need a for loop for the column so
for here we'll say let J equal to equal
to 0 well J is less than u matrix dot X
is a matrix the current the current row
we're iterating through dot length J
plus plus okay now what we need to do is
we need to have an if statement here to
see if the value is 0 because remember
that that's what constitutes a haunted
floor
so we'll do a simple if the value that
we're iterating on matrix I object
so if the current row and column is
exactly equal to 0 what we need to go
ahead and do is add it to the band index
push that value
now we're going to push that index and
we can do a simple else--if here so
that's how we're adding the value to the
band index the next step is to check to
see if the current index were on is part
of our band index array we can do that
with the index up function so using
index up
index the jig specifically equal to
negative one meaning it doesn't exist in
the array we can take our price total
plus equals add to the current value the
value that is in the current matrix
exceeds the current row column
combination so 5 for instance or one and
then at the end we want to go ahead and
return price so let's run our tests
assuming I didn't have any spelling
mistakes that should be good again the
logic here is create a total to store
the price in create an array the store
the band indexes in iterate through the
rows and the columns if if the value is
not equal to they're equal to zero we
need to add it to the band index array
using that array we check the current
value we're iterating on to say hey it's
just equal to does this exist in our
band index right if it if it doesn't go
ahead and add that value to it that's
the logic there but as always guys I
always look forward to you posting
solutions in here this is just one way
to solve it I'm sure there's many ways
and many better ways at that for a lot
of these algorithms I'm posting I got
one posted today that was a great
example of how I could have bettered my
palindrome solution
I typically brute-force my ways but I
encourage you all to share your
solutions in the comments so that not
only can I learn but other people can
learn as well so thank you for watching
