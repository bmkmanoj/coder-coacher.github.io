hours a day should you code what
frequency how many hours a week you know
what are some ways to make sure that you
meet that goal so that you can learn to
code but you still don't burn out and
still keep it fun those are sort of the
questions I get asked all the time I
want a number Dillon I want a number I
want any of this well you know
the world is black and isn't black and
white it's great I want a number we're
gonna give you a number today I want to
take a moment to thank this video
sponsor project Alto comm they make a
focused bill and a mood pill and I
haven't have a chance to try the mood
pill but they did send me the focus bill
which is something that I'm actually
really liking I've been taking it for
about two days now and I plan to finish
the bottle for those you don't know I've
taken a lot of these sort of alert pills
or you know some of them are very
stimulant based to some actually do what
they're supposed to do is just sort of
just wake you up make you alert and
that's where the this focused pill from
also comes in they even sent me some of
these cool pins and in the mortal rage a
we're gonna tell you about it keep it
100 all right so you guys have no idea
what I'm talking about but um so if
you're interested in trying out there
they're focused pill so that you can
make sure you kind of just get that
little more pep in your step
wake you up a little bit keep you alert
make sure that you are focused on the
task at hand I would highly recommend it
I'm not jittery by it at all which has
kind of been my criticism of other
brands in the past and if you use coupon
code coding tutorials 360 your first
bottle for just six dollars alright so
how many hours a day should you code
right that's the first question that we
need to answer then we need to answer
how can we make sure that we accomplish
that in a effective manner while still
being sane and the the my personal
opinion is it's about frequency and it's
about time so it's a healthy combination
if your goal is to learn to be a
developer or learn to learn to code and
work yourself into a
developer position or you learn to code
and build a side project that it's gonna
be a business whatever it might be but
the objective is to learn to code that
is a daily task so that's the first
thing you have to kind of accept is that
you're entering into a domain of
something Simo similar to when you're
first learning math where you need to
it's uh as allen iverson would say we're
talking about practice all right so it's
about the practice it's about the
repetition in this case and so you need
to be coding daily so that's the first
thing I want to I want to kind of just
really reiterate that this sort of
learning to become a developer and when
you are developer lifestyle of you know
to become a good developer right so we
don't only well most of us I should hope
so don't only want to hey I got the job
I'm done with that coding outside of
work stuff oh you know these suckers
don't know what they got right so you're
gonna this is something that's gonna
sort of continue as you continue to grow
as a developer and on all honesty it's
gonna make you stand out I know it has
for me I've had interviews with I
haven't landed a job but I've had
interviews with Facebook I've had
interviews with Amazon and they've
reached out to me and part of that I
think is just they're able to see the
passion and they're able to see that I
am continuing to grow and that I the
type of person that they want to hire
and I want you to be that type of person
and so as you're getting started the
same mentality that you had when you
were learning to code while you're
really in the grind right not making any
money probably have a job that you hate
while you're learning to code you have
to have that same mentality post job and
it will do wonders for you so keep that
in mind so uh first first thing is daily
so how much per day well everyone's
schedule is different and everyone likes
to make different excuses there's a lot
of people I say well what I do when I
have kids and a family all you gotta
tell them they have to understand you
know what I do when I work full time
well I worked you know 45 hours a week
and a YouTube channel and I
you know put in four to six hours a day
on the weekends more right so it it just
depends so how many hours so how many
hours so you'll have to how you juggle
your time that's that's on you there's
nothing I can I can do about that and I
hope that you do hope that you fall into
the category if you understand that life
happens and that you are going to do
your best to accommodate your learn
learning curve regardless of what stage
of life you're in right one of the
things that I've I've said that about me
is that I'm glad that I didn't
necessarily have any debt and I didn't
have any any responsibilities outside of
learning to code in my relationship
because it would be harder right it's
not impossible it definitely would be
harder you know beau Karns is a good
example of somebody who you know he was
working as a teacher yeah I think he's
like two three kids and a wife and he
went and he finished his bachelor's in
six months and taught him to code and
did all the free code camp certs also so
it's definitely possible so how many
hours a day though that's we're kind of
gone I always say we're off track but
I'm trying to paint the picture right
where this is story of how you can
become a developer so I think on the
three to four hours would be what I
would say per day you know everyone's
gonna have the days where look I can
only do one hour today that's okay if
it's once a week I would say it's about
that repetition every single day and
about progressing every single day do I
mean three to four hours of coding
actual hard you know you're typing away
you're clicking and you're clacking I
don't really click and clack but yes
it's the idea no that's not what I'm
really saying although it could be it
definitely could be I am saying that for
three to four hours every single day you
are progressing as a developer that
could be going to meetups that's
something that I've talked about quite
frequently you know what you our meetup
could be to out your four hours for that
day why go to meet up slowly there's
networking there's people offering jobs
oftentimes there's people who you can
maybe find and become
mentors a lot of developers want to help
out right a lot of us remember the grind
and sometimes you offer your help and
they don't they don't either value it or
they just don't know that you're genuine
but a lot of times they're so like I'll
give you a good example I extended a
hand too so when I went to high school
with like hey man I see that you're
going to a boot camp I'm happy to answer
any questions you have
hit me up he never did which which is
unfortunate because I just want to help
and a lot of times there's same sort of
people at those meet ups so that three
or four hours that could be you doing a
demo tutorial that could be you just
watching an hour-long speech on CSS
variables or you know what's coming in
HTML six sort of theory crafting the the
idea here is for you to stay excited
stay motivated and keep learning as a
developer and that's that's really
something that you have to to continue
in order to learn to code because a lot
of you I know I should say a lot of you
but there is a large portion of people
who want to learn in code in a weekend
or want to learn to code in a hundred
hours so a hundred hours I'm a developer
no ands ifs buts about it
we are officially a developer hopefully
I got a job but I'll have that job in a
hundred hours of dedicated time it
doesn't worry like that everyone goes at
their different pace right so like I
have people who asked I said I spent
nine months on the free free code camp
front end certain to a lot of people
that is a ridiculous amount of time man
oh my god but that was what time that
was what it took for me with where I was
in my life to continue to grind it out
and do everything that I needed outside
of work and everything else but the the
goal for you really should be to put in
that three to four hours of learning
time and keep it fun keep it but every
day I have free every day until you have
a job until you reach your goal every
single day because say you do it for a
month
alright and I've talked about this sort
of before a lot of people can work hard
but how hard can you for how long can
you work hard right so let's say you're
you're in you're like got a month and
then I take a week off that week that
you took off just set you back two to
three weeks because it's all this stuff
builds on it what you what you're really
doing when you're learning to code for
the first time is you're reprogramming
your brain not only are you learning
syntax and concepts but you're also
reprogramming your brain to think of how
to break problems down into smaller
subsets and solve those issues to build
out the larger scope of the project of
the application whatever it is and so
all that forward momentum that you had
you take a week off you're really back
at like you've been doing it for two
weeks even though you invested five
weeks of time now and so that's really
why I'm a very strong proponent of you
studying every day so I'd say try and
find three to four hours a day and and
this has been backed up time and time
again I I do my mentoring sessions you
know with with subscribers and and the
the thing I have about fifty fifty
percent of people one that once you are
willing to put in the hard work and the
and the other ones who want to know why
they're not succeeding and and why this
other person succeeded and they take the
breaks and that that's the truth man I
just need a break man oh my god I had to
I just do this and okay well I don't
know what to say that because I you know
you you you ask for advice and I give
you I give you advice and I understand
we all we all are have the tendency to
burn out on occasion which is why I'm
not a post people take a one-day breaks
take one day that's it if you need more
than one day you got a you got buck up a
little bit because you're you're taking
on a hard task is it achievable task
it's totally achievable is learning to
code for most people for most people but
you have to put you have to understand
that when you are sort of half-assing
this and you're not going at it daily
three to four hours day if your goal is
really be a developer three to four
hours a day is what you're gonna have to
put in and and any intelligent
right I could be you know focusing on
all right I got to rework my LinkedIn I
got to rework my resume I gotta go to
this Meetup I got a code like I watched
some YouTube tutorials about watch you
some udemy tutorials I need to build my
personal portfolio there are a hundred
different things that you can do when
you're learning to code and if one is
sort of giving you down when I was doing
the algorithms and I was ready to on
free code camp or wherever and I was
ready to just start jumping out a window
because of how freaking stuck I was on
these things I started a project I said
look I hold up hold up hold up I may not
be here tomorrow if I keep going at
these algorithms so instead I'm gonna go
and I'ma build a you know some project
go in a different direction learning a
little something in that aspect the the
goal for you is study every day three to
four hours of progress in very sort of
dimensions as well just keep it fun keep
it informative and then make sure that
you don't get burned down in the process
and don't take a break longer than a day
that's my advice for how what sort of
frequency and how often you should code
hope you guys found it helpful we kind
of went on a couple different tangents
here but that's kind of how these videos
are all a lot of times as always thank
you so much for watching don't forget to
comment like subscribe share support me
at patreon and of course thank you to
our sponsor project ulta.com so if
you're nursing the focused pill stuff go
ahead and check it out I again I haven't
taken for about two days I plan on
taking the entire bottle during the work
days and on the weekends just to give me
a little excerpt I so see you next time
bye baby how many hours should you spend
learning the code
hey guys if you're interested in a nice
javascript course I just released my
second course and in here we're actually
going to be breaking down JavaScript as
a language as well as give you some
opportunities to solve some algorithms
and build some build up your github as
well as introduce you a little bit to
markdown there's a link in the
description to get the course for just
$15 if you're interested as always
thanks for watching I'll see you next
