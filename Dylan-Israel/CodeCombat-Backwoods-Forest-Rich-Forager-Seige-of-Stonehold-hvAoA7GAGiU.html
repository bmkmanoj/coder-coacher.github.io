in code combat backwoods forest and we
are on rich forger let's go to Joker win
for the win
whoo all right so the idea here is to
basically just kill and collect coins
let's see here I'll zoom in a little bit
so we are here and they kind of it's
nice if they kind of set this up so each
level doesn't take forever so happens
when I find a flag so happens when I
find a flag we want to move our hero or
excuse me um we're gonna pick up here it
up pick up the flag and then if there's
an enemy we want to attack the enemy and
if there's an item what do we do for
items we get find news item which is
here to move so if an item exists which
already singer if you want to move our
hero don't move
want to move them over to item dot
an X and item that pasta why yeah let's
go to submit this to see if everything's
working so basically we want this guy or
this girl really so I did you like the
best job don't want them to go ahead and
attack we probably should have set up a
cleaver to just speed things along turn
work our way over here Scott Auto on
here for the while loop continually
wants to lagging a little bit so I start
I'm sorry if that's affecting you guys
checking the video I'm not quite sure
what's going on what you know we're
almost there move into the final kill
zone here collect all the coins in the
nick of time finish nice
so pretty straightforward and finally
the siege of stone 'old so apparently
this is the last one it has a little
problem probably a harder one
let's see what's going on here so we
need to defeat the ogre assault our hero
must survive you strategies mix cleaver
coat and clever flags so where are we oh
we're right here okay so uh remember
they're not starting us off with
anything so we'll sing wall well true
cuz what we want is basically to just
have all the program of our enemy is
equal to find erode find nearest enemy
so we're gonna look to see if there is
an enemy and we're say if enemy if enemy
do some stuff basically attack the enemy
so if there is an enemy and if is ready
was it is ready let's look at cleave
again
so remember cleave we want to go ahead
and use this if it sounds like it's
going to be pretty big battle so is it
ready and we're gonna throw cleave in
here as well make sure to use our
special move will just say hero duck
leave don't really else
a hero attack now let's see what happens
when you do that I feel like this might
guess talking some we're gonna let
it play through oh maybe we have to
actually play through oh you know what
we should probably
hi there we go I feel like the winds
right cool so that was the last little
bit of Grande there's more levels than
everything but that was the last little
bit of backwoods force moving on forward
will be doing sahrvin desert so I hope

gonna do the basic minimum to get to
here I guess or wherever the end of it
is here and move on to the next area but
as always guys thanks for watching don't
