my patreon was to do a monthly blog if
we hit 75 dollars in our goal and three
people donated surprisingly $75 so thank
you those three people um next goal will
be to hit one hundred and fifty dollars
and if we do that I'll do a six hour
livestream we're all work on side
projects help you with your code and
answer any questions about me or my
channel or any any coding related stuff
but um so what we're gonna do right now
is uh not everyone is down for to read a
blog so instead I'm going to read it
myself for this video now let's go ahead
and get started it's been a while since
I've had the pleasure to write a blog
that I actually wanted to write it only
seems fitting that this first one come
from the heart would be a what be about
what's going on with me as a young adult
and content creator before we start
before we get started I just want to say
thank you to everyone who shares likes
and sports on patreon my channel is able
to flourish because of you and it is
appreciated more than you know there's
no greater compliment for a youtuber
than when your work is shared or someone
donates their hard-earned money to
support you thank you let's start with
YouTube has been a journey in every
sense of the word since I started with
my very first Codecademy Ruby video I
have since released a total of 275
videos in 14 months the progress I've
made not only in terms of video quality
but that is a program or something I can
be proud of where did my channel start
some of you may be familiar with the
realistic career advice channel
engineered truth well you may not know
is that man and I have known each other
since the sixth grade and up until about
two weeks ago live five miles away from
one another in all I see the more I
heard about Matt success with YouTube
the more I wanted to contribute my own
content I figured I'm already doing
programming tutorials daily might as
well record myself and start a YouTube
channel I started recording everything I
couldn't cook add me and before I knew
it I was doing with Ruby PHP HTML CSS
Java JavaScript Python and more in all
honesty some came out better than others
but for me it was a great learning
experience my goal for the Kadim
e-courses has always been to has always
been to do them leave my mistakes and
struggles in there and hope people can
relate and learn from them as I
eventually ran out of courses on
codecademy I started looking elsewhere
for content was at this time I stumbled
upon free code camp calm I instantly
know I had found a great undiscovered
resource one thing I had really stood
out for me was the skill level of the
material increased as you advance
Codecademy have been great I never felt
like I learned anything that helped me
to bring me to the next level I always
felt that codecademy was always teaching
you the basics and nothing else you
never had a chance to actually apply the
basics and solve things on your own free
code camp didn't hold your hand the
whole way through in the beginning you
would have the introduction courses
r.i.p waypoints but after that start
solving algorithms on your own why is
this so important my youtube channel
gave me unique insight to see the
frustrations and issues of those
learning to code we're having most were
never taught how to think like a
programmer I'll solve problems to force
up writing a single line of code how did
they got a problem and how to find help
when needed the algorithms r.i.p
bonfires and the project's r.i.p zip
lines are exactly what we needed to help
do that as a computer science student
myself the basic intermediate and
advanced algorithms are almost identical
to the majority of the coursework from
my first three coding courses now at the
time free code camp wasn't the boss ass
bitch it is now when I started making
videos
free code camp they had just 30,000
accounts created nine months later is
over 300,000 users to put this in
perspective with codecademy who has who
has as of august 2014 24 million users
is probably much larger just two years
later now I started with it when it was
just thirty thousand users because I
knew that what a great resource it was
and I had faith that maybe not at first
but soon the views would come eventually
I remember being lucky to get 10 views
on a free code camp video in a month
because it was still relatively unknown
in the JavaScript game flash forward to
the present and now for out of my top 10
videos for the month are free code cam
videos moving forward with YouTube now
as I move forward to the channel to
continue to do the tutorials for free
code camp and codecademy but i'll
continue to branch out and try to create
my own content i'll also be trying to
collaborate with other youtubers in the
future such as i've done with engineered
truth in the past i'll begin to
incorporate interviews and developer
with it i'll begin to incorporate
interviews with developers of all kinds
test out new series such as code notes
and eventually incorporate live streams
into my channel on a frequent basis also
be promoting code mentor where where
people can hire coding mentors of their
choosing to help solve problems for any
language you're currently learning they
have recently sponsored me with some
free courses so i'll be taking this
first one and react and sharing the
content with you guys this is also
helping me with the react section a free
code camp i hope to get that content out
soon I look forward to several upcoming
collaborations with various companies
and YouTube channels so keep an eye out
for that as well I appreciate this for
you if you're looking to help the
channel out a like and share goes a long
way this blog is a direct result of my
first patreon reaching my first
patriarch also thank you for the three
people currently support me we'll be
doing a monthly blog because of this my
next goal is to incorporate a monthly
live stream thank you all and as always
I'll see you guys next time
so as always see you guys next time I
hope you enjoyed this I'll be doing
about one a month as long as we are at
our picture angle thank you guys I
appreciate it ton a $75 goes a long way
pays for my website that i'm working on
it pays for the adobe premiere sweet
that i use to do my videos and edison
everything so it is appreciated guys
best of luck in your coding adventures
and keep coming back for watching the
video don't forget to check out my
collaboration with eric serve six going
over how to get started coding and if
you're looking for some coding help go
to code mentor using the annotation or
card and if you're looking for
internships or part-time jobs or
full-time jobs as a student or recent
grad check out way up com see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
