lot stuff going on in the personal life
lately normally if you're new to the
channel what I'd like to do is I like to
do a AMA try to provide any mentoring
any help that I can along the way I know
I didn't get too much help when I was
starting a study and I wish there was
somebody I could turn to to ask
questions so for every thousand
subscribers that that I gain I like to
take them on would say thank you we're
not actually we're about a hundred and
fifty away but I wanted to talk today
and so that's why we're doing a little
bit early there's a lot going on in my
mind
and I need to get it straight as well as
do our thousand subscriber AMA and just
kind of talk sometimes it just it helps
in life to air things out spread your
sauce something good mainly up mainly
all nothing bad mainly good things but I
find myself I find my mind rattled at
times by these things so uh thank you to
the 850 or soon to be a thousand
hopefully new members we do these live
streams every thousand so that we can
say thank you answer questions all that
sort of stuff this one's gonna be done a
little bit earlier and I'm gonna be
talking about a few things if there's
not too many questions I'm gonna be
talking about money I'm gonna be talking
about college going back to college
specifically and Reax nanodegree at
Udacity and my thoughts on it and why
I'm enrolling in it on top of that so
let me alone brave let's chat so I can
see if there's any questions real quick
before I start rambling here but so for
those of you don't know for those of you
don't know I um I've been I'm a
self-taught developer who who dropped
out of my computer science program about
a year and a half ago with the intention
of one day going back after I got some
some experience as a developer I when I
made that choice I my father at that
time my father at that time was gracious
enough to be paying for my education I
didn't have any debt so when I left I
had no debt and in a practical sense I
think if I did have debt I probably
would have been too scared to leave like
I had too much skin in the game even
though I was super miserable but I told
myself that if I quit I can't go back
and tell I can afford it I'm in a
position now where I could afford
enrolling into ACS program where I don't
have to take out any debt I can pay a
straight cash which is great right it
probably cost me the program I'm looking
at is specifically designed for a online
computer science bachelor's for people
exactly like me who it's a continuation
program where if you have previous CS
credits you can graduate in as little as
18 months and I think I'd probably be
that it would cost me somewhere between
twelve and fifteen thousand dollars for
the year and a half if I did that but
I'm not really sold on it
not not necessarily like the program's
bad just about going back to school and
that and this is where my this is where
my my my inner my inner my inner fears
come into play because I don't I don't
think I need to do it this is this this
thing I don't think I need to do it I
think I'm scared of being a situation in
which am I going to be am I going to be
like like let's let's just lay out all
the facts of course on paper on paper
guys you having a CS degree is better
than you not having a CS degree right
like I think we can all agree to that
that that if there's if we're not
talking about time commitment if we're
not talking about a money commitment
that you having a degree of any
kind is better than not having one so
the the the situation becomes well what
is it taking away from me I'm not
worried about the 12 to 15 thousand
dollars and I'm not worried about them
that money it would be it would be
something like $800 a month I am April
and I have been blessed that we have
kept our bills down I have no debt
except my car payment which is about two
thousand dollars all the debt I have on
me
is to build credit I don't like the idea
of taking out debt I never have so what
are the alternatives because the reason
let's talk about the reasoning for me
going back to to finish up my degree at
one time because it's been on my mind
ever since I stopped going even though I
was on the path I was executing my my my
goal which was at that time to work
myself into a full-stack role which I
have and things are going very well and
so what what what what it's changed my
understanding of why why I want to go
back has changed originally originally
my my thought process about myself and
you learned this as you get a little bit
older I and you you reflect more and I
think it's part of being an introvert
maybe you maybe you overanalyze things
but I don't think I'm overanalyzing III
I I've always felt that I've had a very
good understanding of Who I am in the
last two or three years and what makes
me tick and analyzing for the last 18
months as I stopped going why I wanted
to go back originally I thought it was I
had a chip on my shoulder and I thought
okay I need to prove to myself that I
can do this and that
can finish things and then I'm a
finisher essentially and I slowly
realized that that isn't it like I I
know I could finish this program and I
know that I could I'm not a I'm not
somebody that gives up I think there's
something innately especially on YouTube
as well when you've committed because
you two spent a two-year passion project
and so to me that that has proven to me
what more than anything else that okay I
can commit to something and David yang
says what about working at a local
university and pursuing the CS degree at
the same time that is another option
that is leading me towards not going
back as well is why am I going to pay
for it and I said this is this may sound
a little strange if you're you know if
you're just breaking into the industry
or you're just breaking into a
professional environment but why am I
going to pay for it when in reality
there's a solid chance that maybe a
future employer because uh the the
education benefits would not cover what
I need to at my current work but there
is a solid chance at my next employer
whenever that maybe could pay for it and
would pay for it and typically if you're
unfamiliar with that usually the they'll
pay for a certain portion as long as you
pass your classes and it's usually a
while your why we're paying for it we
expect you to stay for one year past
whenever we pay for your last course
right so if you if they paid the twelve
thousand dollars that I want them to pay
and I graduate in eighteen months
essentially they have me for that
eighteen months plus another twelve
which is fine I would totally be happy
with that I don't need to jump around
and whatnot so there's that in the back
of my mind and that is the path that I
am leaning towards many months from now
is I'm going to get an employer to pay
for my education and not pay for it
myself
which solves the money aspect it but the
time as well so there's three things
that I'm worried about
and that I think about when I do when
I'm when I'm analyzed in this situation
one is the money I'm not too worried
about the money yes I it would
definitely be you know fifteen thousand
dollars out of my pocket is not what I
would prefer to do I I save my money I
saved about fifty percent of my money
right now from my cheque seventeen goes
into a savings account thirty three
percent goes into investments that money
is there for when I need it
maybe I lose my job maybe I buy a house
those are the things that I am thinking
about not necessarily losing my job but
you know what I mean about having some
some a nest egg in case something bad
happens in life and as if nothing bad
happens and I happen to have that money
purchasing a home those are the things
that I saved my money for that would
become less likely I would be saving
instead of being able to say fifty
percent of my income I would probably be
able to save fifteen percent of my
income which is still solid amount but
nowhere near the same amount so now home
purchases are on hold and savings are on
hold so there's the money aspect the
time aspect nothing changes with the
time whether I go now or later so we'll
call that a wash for now the only
benefit the time is I can reap benefits
from it while enrolled and a wall I am
actively what a while I graduate so
you're saying well how can you reap
benefits
how can you reap benefits while enrolled
well there is something to be said to
being a working individual who has Drive
and is actively working towards a degree
I would I would I would beg to argue
that me applying as I'm pursuing my
degree is more valuable than me not
doing it at all that would be my
argument there but the final the final
part of it is it doesn't solve by me not
going back to school
and holding on to the holding on to the
the issue of me being worried why am i
worried well I I am worried
because that is how I am built to a
degree I am worried because I do
understand that it is harder to get a
job without a degree and I do understand
that there are certain employers that
will look down upon my resume and in
affect me if I don't have such a thing I
understand that I've never argued that
that's not the case what I've argued is
that that doesn't mean it's impossible
and then it's just a harder path and
I've accepted that and I'm okay with
that
to a degree I'm okay with it in the
sense of I am aware of it and I've
accepted that I put myself in that
position so how do I make sure that I'm
not in that position well I guess the
first thing that I could do is I could
expand my skill set which brings me up
to my next point which is if you guys
have been following the livestreams I've
been studying react in angular 4 and
real quick zu L says because this is AMA
what do you think about learning
algorithms with Java by the way I
finished all three free code camp
certificates I think if you finish all
three three code camp certificates you
should be learning whatever you're
working in or you should go get a job if
you're not working because you're you're
definitely ready as far as I'm concerned
so that's my that's my thoughts on going
back to school now here's here's so what
do so what do i do what do i do because
we've talked about the money we've
talked about the time we've talked about
the the pros and the cons of actually
going back to school and the my decision
to delay it now the the main thing is
how do i future-proof myself so that
even though even though i have put
things on hold with the degree i'm still
very concerned
about me making about myself making good
money and and from there I am now
learning reactor angular angular 4 and
I'm thinking about enrolling into the
recent release react.js program on
Udacity to supplement that so
why specifically react well it's the
fastest growing and one of the higher
highest paying front-end frameworks up
is around having spent the having spent
the last two or three weeks bouncing
back between react and angular 4 and
react and angular for react and angular
4 and I think I'm I'm leaning towards
react and I've been going back and forth
in all honesty so how do i how do I get
rid of this knee-jerk nasty feeling of I
just don't want to be in life
that's really all this I don't want to
be in life I want to always be in
a position in which the train keeps
moving and in the short term in short
term that is learn react which is why I
plan on enrolling in the Udacity react
nanodegree program now I could get a
course and I could do that route but I
decided to try ace ant and by the way
this program is about five hundred
dollars and last four months you cover
react reactor Redux and react native all
in the course it's about a 12-hour week
commitment so that's a rundown of course
he builds a couple projects in it do I
think the certificate is going to be
worth of some value yes and note I think
it's a conversation starter I think your
projects and it being on your resume as
well as with my own developer experience
will be what will will get people
interested hey buddy
but I do think there is some benefit to
that now here we go buddy
and good degree from actually University
and work at a big for company and won't
feel like you're I have very
little interest of actually getting a
degree to learn anything and III I would
argue that that the actual practical
skills that I need I will get I this is
the argument that I would make to to
Adrian right now who's saying get an
actual degree and work at a big for
company is that that's a very practical
thing of advice but I like to take
educated risks and the reason that I
would get turned away from a lot of jobs
and I say this is somebody who recruiter
sends jobs to all the time is not
because I don't have a degree it's
because I don't have years of experience
and I'm not working with necessarily
with I'm not working necessarily with
the latest technologies because because
of where I'm at and I so that's where
the react is coming in but that that is
the decision that I have made of which I
will be learning to react over the next
four months and then I will decide what
I'm going to do last time aster chat was
working learn from home or internship I
would say internship is probably your
best bet I get that resume experience
I'm still in high school can't legally
do you think I should do competitive
programming data structures of
algorithms or do freako camp nonprofit I
think if you do free code camp nonprofit
you can put that down as experience what
about checking certification classes
offer at community colleges I really I
really am not too interested in
as someone who's been in the computer
science program up until their junior
year I could tell you that that from a
practical standpoint I don't think I
will get a lot out of it I get a check
mark on the resume showcasing it yes I
this is and this is the thing I could
tell you 100% that if I had a degree in
the most thing on the planet
the most you know underwater
basket-weaving legit underwater
basket-weaving I would not even consider
going back to school it doesn't matter
what I would have a degree and because I
I know that it makes me skeptical back
going back do I have a rival a coding
rival no I don't think so
I if I have a rival it's probably with
my own insecurities in life just trying
to beat them it's that I don't know if
that's too deep or too shallow but that
would be what it is um but I and one of
the reasons that I'm skeptical about
going back is that and I mentioned this
that the reason is I need more years of
experience and in a work environment and
and I mean I need react is what I think
I need to kind of push me to that next
pay level so I'm bringing this up
because this is what's on my mind but I
want to I want to make this statement
not out of a sense of cockiness but not
out of a sense of hey look at me
executing a game plan but out of a sense
of this is what's concerning me this is
these are the actions I'm going to take
and within six months to a year from now
see the results of those actions pay off
that's why that's that that is the point
of the last 20 minutes of conversation
is thinking through your options
thinking about your reasons for doing
either option understanding yourself and
making that plan that you plan to
execute to be where you want to be don't
just hope it's gonna happen but hope
what I want in the next year so I want
to make thirty thousand more dollars
that's what I want to happen and I'm
going to do that and when I do that do
do that I will hopefully have a school
did this just think I want between ten
to thirty thousand more dollars a year
and I want a company I thought tend to
pay for my education that's what I want
to happen that it that is the the
ultimate game plan and I and I can tell
by the and I could tell by the the like
the dislike ratio because it's it's for
likes the three dislikes that perhaps
people don't like what I'm saying and
that's okay I don't have any issue with
that prep perhaps they are in a is it
back end more lucrative full-stack is
the most lucrative and but I'm more
worried about the front end skills
because my front-end skills are in
legacy code essentially which is
angularjs so as I say that we get a
couple likes that those guys but uh
but to the three people who dislike what
I'm talking about
let me let me explain to you guys
because I want to explain that I don't
consider one better than the other
necessarily I I consider what's best for
me and what's best for me is to execute
a plan based off of what I know to be
true in my situation and that as I
mentioned it's the years of experience
and it's the how do you determine which
skills will give you a race for sure you
did a little bit research on it I think
if you were to look up what skills are
most in demand and what languages are
growing the fastest you would see in
terms of front-end development its react
and having talked to recruiters on a
weekly basis and give me a spy
recruiters on a weekly basis that is the
one skill they keep asking me to have so
that is the skill I want to to bring up
I've never been asked about a degree
I've never I should say never I
typically don't but it's all about this
skillset in the experience so I could be
I could definitely go down the
self-taught route of teaching myself
react react or dogs react native but I I
for a while I've been wanting to try one
of the Udacity nano degree programs and
$500 isn't that much to somebody who's
already working right I get if I get if
you are just breaking into the field and
are trying to get going you don't have
the money i 100% understand that you
need free courses or five or ten dollar
courses but luckily enough I can I can
pendous I could test out a program for
five hundred dollars and it's not a huge
deal I haven't talked to programs who
work at the position that you desire yes
I have I have talked to numerous react
developers and I have an idea of what
they make as well as if they enjoy
working with react so and I like node
better for the record go to get mountain
I don't need to go to dev Mountain I'm
gonna spend five hundred bucks on the
react course unless they decide they
want to give it to a brother for free
who sent an email about it but I don't
think they're gonna say yes because it
happened in the past
but I will be doing the udacity I'm
gonna give them a few days to respond uh
but Zhu Li do feel scared for the future
because I don't have a degree and for
that for the reasons I've mentioned but
I don't I think I can prove my worth
with a skill set and experience without
having to have that degree but I do plan
on going back because it does scare me
right so I am worried about it you know
I and my current game plan is to get my
income up get somebody to pay for it and
then I'll go back and do it if somebody
wants to pay for it I'll put in the time
I can't say no then how do you deal with
algorithms I suck at it you just keep on
pounding away at it every day man that's
it you just pound away at it
now I I tend to agree with Eisenberg
here who says are efficient I don't know
I said Eisenberg will say Eisenberg
Eisenberg neither it's sexist on any
categories you categorize as us
college-educated or high school yes I
think but I think software is when the
unique fields in which you can prove
your worth without AC s degree and if
you look at if you look at the job apps
a lot of them say or experience
equivalent or equivalent except you're
excited cetera and a lot people are
looking to just get something in there
with qualified skills and can do the job
what tools do you use for testing I do a
lot of front-end testing although we're
starting to implement back end testing
as well but we typically use Jasmin and
karma for the front end and that's for
unit tests for end-to-end testing we use
protractor and we're getting started
with our PHP test soon as well so but I
feel good I have been going back and
forth on this for a while now and and
what I what I've what I've learned is
that at some point and for awhile I mean
like two weeks and what I've learned
what I've learned is that I think I got
through the hard part the hard part for
a degree this is all I'm trying to say
is I think I got through that part where
the hard part was getting my foot in the
door into the industry and that would
have been what the degree would have
done for me but I did that on my own now
it just it can get me added benefits how
long will the degree route take 18
months roughly I'm actually
so as I say this I climb out enrolling
in the I plan it
I plan on enrolling into the the Udacity
react nanodegree program that starts on
July 25th but I'm also starting the
enrollment process to figure out exactly
that how much is it going to be and how
much is it going to cost and I may be
doing I may start at the end of the four
months in which the nanodegree finishes
I'm going back and forth but I'm gonna
get it set up
at which point that four months from now
it is an option for me to get going if I
choose to do so
but but that is where my mind is that
that is where my concerns are that is
where my stress is and part of the
reason I'm doing that as well and this
one counts on mastery is my blood
pressure has gotten pretty high lately
and not super high
it's like prehypertension and I need to
get the things off of my mind that
bothered me as well as change my diet
and exercise patterns it's about 140
which is about 40 more than my
girlfriend's so I need to somewhere
between 136 and 142 fen when I do it
which is it isn't great it's not it's
not super bad and I don't necessarily
think it's the food related I do think I
do need to eat better and I have started
that and I'm getting rid of I'm getting
rid of a certain things like I used to
I've been so for about nine months now
I've been eating pizza every day at work
so David yang gasps how long will I work
for the company if they pay for my
school it depends on the company but for
what I've seen from what I've seen
rather it's about a year since they pay
usually a year longer than when they pay
so I am going say it takes me 18 months
it would be a near pass that so I'd have
to work for a company for two and a half
years for 30 months which is in a super
long amount of time
but on a side note because I am doing
the react nanodegree program allows the
react tutorials in the near a couple
months oh please try to run me everyday
I happen so last week we started I
started exercising with a for a little
bit more and now I'm jogging what's your
end goal money early retirement my end
goal David is to eventually gain $50,000
in residual income that is what I want
out of once I have my 50k year and
residual income and very low bills I
will start my own project or start my
own company to give you an idea of where
I'm at right now
I'm at about ten that's that's a year
and that's YouTube I call you to account
YouTube as a residual income and a few
investments but 90% of that is YouTube
my short-term goals in the next five
years is to get into the six-figure
category ideally I want that to happen
in the next two years which would
require a which would require a about a
30k bump which i think is plausible I I
want to purchase a home and I want to
continue growing YouTube that's really
my next goals over the few years and
there's sub goals for that such as
learning react and its various libraries
getting a degree and going down that
path and Adrian battlezone says if you
know what you knew now what would you
tell your 19 year old self I am 29 years
old guys 29 I would be 30 in October in
about five months so if I was 19 which
I'm guessing you're 19 because that's a
very specific number maybe not so much
for you it's at 18 I would have told
myself too
well assuming I don't know the future
other than what interns is my life I am
going to tell myself to do what I know I
should do and not to listen to my
parents that would be go down a
self-taught route stop wasting time in
school stop working stupid jobs and to
teach myself everything I needed to know
and get the value out of it and save
myself time energy and money with
college that would be what I would tell
my 19 year old self no one ever told me
that sue L says by the way what do you
think about the engineering truth
channel stagnating so hard why do you
say it's stagnating how is school a
waste of time if you can get a CS degree
in three to four years well most people
can't get a CS degree in three years but
I would say it's a waste of time because
you don't learn any practical skills and
the amount of money and time that you
would spend in those three four years
you do so much more on your own that
that would be the argument I would tell
myself and part of that it's not saying
that it's a waste of time for everybody
I think that's where the dislikes come
from is that everybody is different it's
a waste of time for me because I don't
need it like I I can I could go like it
help like it's not the environment I
thrive in I thrive in a I'm gonna do
 my way and I'm going to go down the
self-taught route and I like learning
things that are much more practical
things I'm actually gonna use so that's
that's the route I thought I thrived um
how long did it take you to get your
first job that's an interesting question
because I've talked about this before my
previous job I worked at a software
company that made student information
system software and I was working as a
technical writer there a technology
trainer and
and my game plan was to become a
developer there but it didn't look like
it was gonna happen in the time that I
wanted it to happen and I dropped out I
dropped out and I I dropped out when I
got that job and continued working so
when I dropped out I worked that job for
about nine months before I took on my
full-stack role I have now so that's
what I that's what I would say
so as you also have user Lowe's videos
are just ads people unsubscribing
average circuit views at 250 K channel I
was well I I don't know I know for a
fact most that's probably not true cuz
his channel has never been doing better
financially at least I don't know too
much about his views but and also I mean
what I would tell myself is that I'm not
going to be happy going down that route
and I wasn't and I was very I'm a much
happier person last two years or so then
I was ever in school I hated it I hated
every minute of it I would actually I
would actually probably if I if I was 18
one thing I regret not doing is and this
makes sound kind of crazy as someone who
someone someone who has no experiences
and it's kind of ended this is I I would
have loved to experience the military
because I think I think you come out a
change individual and I don't know how I
would have changed but I I would that
would be one thing that perhaps I would
be interested in at that time of doing
it to see what sort of man I would be if
that was my life
but III don't know I don't know I have
right when I when I was 18 I come from a
family that that doesn't miss no one in
my family has ever been in the military
and what's going on Josh yeah Matt so
Matt is I can agree that Matt definitely
doesn't like the criticism that he gets
didn't you say I get a degree given the
opportunity from it if fret I'm talking
about now code import Emporium Pat in
the past tense
the only reason I'm even thinking about
it now is because already have units
completed but that's that's the advice a
waste of time in terms of for me man
that that's the thing is there's a
wasting time matures for me I for some
people they need that traditional path
they don't have the they don't have the
the the ability to go the self-taught
route in the beginning and that's okay
not everybody does and I can't even say
that I did because I was in school right
so that maybe that means I don't have it
either and I had to gain it through just
pure misery what sigh so I don't think
I'm contradicting myself when I'm saying
that I would get a degree now cuz I
already have units completed if somebody
else would pay for it but if I was 19
knowing what I would know now would
never do it do you have any pointer for
someone who's living in third world who
doesn't have CS agree how can I tap you
in the market with only free code camp
mdn project start your own business
I know I can't really speak to a third
world country cuz I I mean that's not
something I've ever partake tin I guess
whose maths competition I can't think of
other career best channels I don't know
either how do you deal with doubts when
you are learning a new language /
framework well I could tell you how I'm
dealing with it right now because I have
been trying to learn react and I've been
struggling and I have been trying to
learn angular 4 and I've been struggling
and what I'm doing right now is I'm
enrolling in the react Jas Udacity now
to agree program to learn react I'm
committing 4 months of my time and
energy to knocking out the program
building some projects and finding it so
that I mean that's how I'm doing that
this time
can you add me on Facebook sure as long
as you don't do any weird stuff man
RSV questions all the time there's a
Facebook group for that you guys
wouldn't believe some of the people
ask me talk to me about you know they so
well free code can't be enough to get a
friend a job was for me but I used other
you know free resources like YouTube as
well but it also means that you have to
be an interesting candidate it means
that you have to have build projects
learn frameworks keep moving forward man
yeah my email sure man yeah I got y'all
gonna miss me without with these two
that boys are gone how many months left
on the braces let's see I think probably
it was ten months in total I had to have
them and I think we're probably five in
maybe four in so somewhere maybe five to
six months have I ever thought a
machine-learning note or a I know uh did
you go through CTC I know I don't know
what that is uh for me so for me um a
convict my my thing is I like web
development because I could build things
of my own if I wanted to I work in that
work PHP and cakephp in at home I work
in I work in node have you seen the
video a YouTube video of the
fourteen-year-old coding project I work
about myself man how many dogs that the
fourteen-year-old that stumps you dude
oh man I need that in my life
how come you only need them for ten
months is usually longer I've had braces
in the past now what happened was I
didn't wear my retainers and over the
years my teeth shifted so I'm getting
them a second time or have them I got
them a second time I should say but
that's why it'll be nice to have them
off
I don't really write I don't really
notice that I have them on except when I
go in and tighten them and then it hurts
like hell for a day or two I appreciate
you guys letting me vent man I don't I
don't normally like I don't normally try
to vent but I thought this was some
something that maybe I could share with
you guys that's going on in my head and
it was relatable enough to coding that
we could we could talk about it because
because I would imagine there's a couple
people in chat and on the channel you're
probably thinking about similar things
and you know it's for me for me what
heads up happening is I can't do nothing
if I do nothing I start feeling I start
the worry gets worse
the anxiety gets worse the depression
gets worse start feeling bad about
myself so instead of doing nothing and I
know this about myself I do something
and what I can say is that no matter
what choice I do as long as I've
stepping forward towards something
that's going to help us a little or a
lot
it helps me handle the situation and so
I I generate a game plan and I begin to
execute the game plan but that's where
I'm at man it's uh
yeah I don't know for that that's what's
going on with me what's going on with
you guys huh I'm telling you man like I
feel stressed out stressed out just
thinking about the stuff so
how does sleepless eye sleep at least 20
out of 24 hours any suggestions you need
to go the doctor who sleep in 20 hours
I'm going starts full stack development
course in Udacity soon what are your
thoughts about so I recently did some I
I did some research about Udacity and
their full stack program seems a little
flawed from what a lot of people are
saying one second someone brought up
something Oh Joshua jerk says do you
think that in the year 2020 there will
still be a great number of coding
physicians not feel that there are so
many coding online resources teaching of
code yes because even though it's just
like exercise even though you know you
should do it doesn't mean you will let
me show you something real quick guys I
want to show you I want to show you
something that I'm gonna share with you
guys right now there are they're here
this is the job this is indeed 2017 jobs
the best jobs that you can have number
one full stack developer in between 2013
to 2016 let's zoom in a little bit there
was a hundred and twenty two percent
growth with an average base salary of a
hundred and ten number two was data
science a hundred and eight percent
growth average of a hundred thirty
thousand jobs alright continue on
development Salesforce you'll see
everything on here except about three
has something to do with technology has
something to do with software so when
you say hey do you think that you know
given six years from now we're going to
have the you know there's going to be a
jobs yes 100 percent because other than
perhaps nursing which is number twenty
and we all know how everyone thinks
nursing is the best profession on earth
are one of the best it's number 20 and
the other 10 above it are engineering IT
engineer and rather development or tech
this is the 2017
stuff of actual job postings on on
indeed so I understand being worried
about it but just because everybody at
least I think everybody knows you should
go into tech and software for the most
part if you are just looking for a solid
profession that makes good money and
that there will be in-demand jobs you
know there's not many other choices that
will provide you of a better situation
is what I'm trying to say I started I
started swimming recently and II that
helped a lot yesterday I'm trying to
exercise more I just have I think I have
a fracture in my hand I have to I'm
getting checked out a week or so if
you're applying to a software
engineering internships what should you
email or career after submitting an
online application you should just
submit a little something about yourself
why you're interested in the spot why
you want to work in the company and that
if there's anything that else that you
can submit letters of recommendation
references or or portfolio or better get
submitted with it or a link to it all of
that if you if you want to do that I see
a lot of developers struggling it's a
lot of contradiction between people
saying there's lots of deaf jobs but
lots of people are out of work er with
crappy jobs I think what you're seeing a
lot of the times are shitty developers
that are very vocal it's kind of like
it's it's kind of like politics to
degree you have about 20% of people 10
on each side who are very loud and very
adamant why the other 80% are just
living their life and letting let the to
scream at each other that's how that's I
see politics I think the same is in the
situation you're talking about I'm in a
predicament as well not pretty much
finished my bio degree not sure if you
want to continue if I want to continue
on the metric or to go down self-taught
right what i can say is i i would say
that for you for any
buddy like let's take you as situation
is if you already think that you're
gonna be unhappy in the job that you're
going to either your degree in you need
to perhaps think about because I I'll
tell you what sucks what sucks is just
selecting a a job right what sucks is
just working a job for a check and
that's gonna get old real quick you
might be able to do that for three or
four years but you're gonna be miserable
and unhappy and so if you're happy going
down a self-taught route if you're happy
learning software even if it's going to
set you back a year or two in your
career and it very well might right I
think long term will probably be what's
best for you and let's just because your
job is not finished with the project
years or more expectations no we're only
about a third of the way through our
project so our our our map our our so
our uh our roadmap if you will for our
project goes all the way till the end of
this year so we just we just basically
got to the one third point and I I
subversives I remember three years ago
when people are saying petroleum
engineer what's one of the best and
highest paid careers I don't think
engineer truth the saying that I don't
know anyone who wants to be in tech
where I look that's ok though but like I
mean the proof is in the pudding man
like if I if I wasn't in software let's
talk about this right now if I wasn't in
software and I wasn't in tech me not
having a college degree would be a huge
disadvantage but because we're talking
about hard skills because we're talking
about high salaries that go with those
hard skills and because we're talking
about a limited amount of developers for
a lot of positions they're live
developers jobs that do not ever get
filled because there's not enough in the
skill set in the years of experience to
fill it
I probably be screwed if I wanted to do
I'd be an English teacher I don't know
whatever whatever people do that
is this software I have no idea right
but because of the field I don't have to
necessarily always worry about that even
though I do worry do you think that when
people are trying to get a technology or
programming job with a company that try
to they tried to Google the interviewer
with too much technical jargon that has
a turn-off to employers I have no idea I
I would say that you it's it's a that
you should have no issue on your resume
listing your technical achievements and
your technical skills but there you do
need to be somewhat of a human well Matt
started his started his degree Erik
starting his channel rather in about
five years ago so it very well could be
that he and by the way stem degrees are
still one of the best to get it just
happens that a lot of degrees suck in
general and that starting a suck into
the stem degrees because there no
there's not as many new jobs being
created but there still is high pay it's
just harder to get your foot in the door
and those are those are fields that you
must have a degree in ninety percent of
the time let me get some ice to you guys
I'll be right back happy fourth of July
by the way I know we're early but happy
fourth
oh man whoo I've sort of been doing man
I I don't know if he was fired or
technically encouraged to quit format um
Matt from what I from what I understand
with Matt and man I talk all the time
but we don't really we don't really dive
into that stuff cuz it's so long ago but
he just hated it man
he absolutely hated it and if you're one
of those people that hates your job
you're not gonna excel at it
so he hated it man he really did and
that's why that's why I suggest seem
like hey if you already hate a biology
don't do it to yourself
is a BA not a BS in computer science
worth it I didn't even know there was
such a thing as a BA in computer science
what stops you from applying a from
applying job app to Google Facebook etc
I probably don't have the skill set
quite yet to work at such a thing be
honest with you I mean would I like to
work at Google and Facebook of course I
would who wouldn't right who wouldn't
want to work at one of the premier tech
companies of the world right the
Google's the Facebook's the the PayPal I
guess PayPal doesn't really count but
you know I'm talking abit big name
companies right I would love to do that
but I have you know I don't have enough
experience to probably qualify or to
beat out these super genius master
program kids yeah and yeah I mean just
really does bring up a good point is
that you have to study for like a year
to pass the Amazon interview and so on
and so forth what was my skill set when
I got my current job I could do
angularjs
jQuery JavaScript HTML CSS that's
basically it I mean I mean I was a
friend developer when I started my job
that that would be how I would describe
myself ah a happy Independence Day
so what do you guys think about my
decision
of enrolling into the react.js down
degree program and then essentially
essentially my plan is to enroll in that
and then figure it out later
ever thought about doing konk Academy
style videos like with algorithms I am
doing algorithms breaking them down
piece by piece from code fights those
are coming out what's the average per
hour salary of someone new junior
developer without experience so defend
are you are you a front-end or a full
stack developer or back-end for that
matter it depends but it fits where you
live also if you're living in New York
or like Silicon Valley it could be much
higher
I've gotten I've gotten recruiters that
have asked me about physicians in San
Francisco and I I I want $30,000 more to
go because of the amount of money it
would cost me to live in San Francisco
and California taxes so you definitely
get a higher salary there you're
surprised I'm not interested in machine
learning I am a nurse I'm back in what I
think about react native I'm very
excited to learn react native one thing
I want to do is build a couple Android
and iOS applications but I've never
really had the time to fully dive back
into Java
coursework I had in college and I
basically to read read relearn all that
and then I then I have to learn the
Android iOS framework so so I I'm very
exciting to learn react native for that
exact point and I have a couple small
like document I want to create a video
documentation site for the things that I
like learning and go from there and
maybe I'll make an app that goes with it
are most my coworker self-taught know
most of people I work with FC
yesterday's my my boss and my main
co-workers SES degree and the intern I
work with has a days is pursuing a CS
degree as well those are the three main
people I work with on the project what
Craig succession did Craig's List
section did I use to get jobs the gig
section for the most part
also one of the reasons I want to start
studying react now and I'm executing
this plan is you guys have heard me say
time and time again that one year at
your job put yourself in a situation
where if you don't get a raise or if if
you don't get a fair raise in software
development to leave but to do that you
need to be prepared to leave and you
need to be half value study those
algorithms gain those skills that are in
demand all those sorts of things so you
may say $500 for the announced act
degree yes but if I if I leave for a
$10,000 raise I just made $9,500 you
think the Greece important long term I
think that there's an argument to be
made for it that's for sure but this is
this is another thing that comes to mind
is my parents are getting older right my
parents are getting older and my father
has been very responsible with his money
he'll be okay he did very well for
himself he saved a lot he invested my
mother is the opposite she she's a nurse
she has debt though and she's getting
older and she's gonna have to retire
eventually and I don't think she's going
to retire when she wants to
I think she's gonna retire when she
quite literally can't work anymore my my
brother and I are the are the two
children in the family
and my brother is traveling Chile he
just got back from traveling for ten
months he has a degree in uselessness
and I yes a degree it's not actually
uselessness I forget what it is but he
has a degree he is kind of a hippie he
lives in Portland Oregon that's why he's
saved up all his money through college
and he travelled for ten months and he's
he's back home in the los angeles area
for now and he is uh he's you know he's
coming down here with my mom they're
visiting in a couple of weeks and and
from there what's going to happen is
he's going to at he's gonna stay for
about a week and then he's gonna fly to
Peru he's gonna travel South America for
six months until he runs out of money
why am I saying all this well one of the
very real things that's coming up is I
am fairly convinced that I will have to
take care of my mother financially in
about five to ten years depending on how
Howard how she ages maybe fifteen my
brother won't be in a situation
financially that he can contribute not
for a while his last job was working for
he graduated he graduated and he worked
for AmeriCorps for a year making below
minimum wage he doesn't have any hard
skills and it's gonna be hard for him
when he gets back so I can't be
impossible is gonna be hard and I don't
see an instance of where he makes enough
money to to help so that's another thing
I stress to me on this I I I essentially
will have to be the head of the
household right you got and this way
shallow weird thinking about this but
knowing my mother's finances in somewhat
detail her pension and Social Security
won't really be enough for her to live a
good life so I need to figure out how I
can make more money so that I can help
help her which is why I've been racking
my brain lately and and just going back
and forth and back and forth and back
and forth
well my father helped help I know that
my mother what anybody made clear my
mother and father have been divorced for
20 years like my father my father
remarried when I was three my dad
remarried when I was three and so they
they are separated long long time not
daleks going towards my mom so I have to
I have to prepare for that cuz I mean
that's that's your mom right what are
you gonna do you're not gonna you're not
gonna just not help
you're not gonna say sorry mom you know
I didn't I didn't work hard enough to be
able to to help I didn't you know I
didn't I you know I'm sorry I was I'm
sorry I took it easy the last five years
so I mean this isn't something that's
gonna happen soon you know but on the
worse time five years from the best time
probably 59 my mom 60 plus so I have my
younger brother it was I and I got know
by the way I got I got no problem with
my brother living out his dream and
doing his going down his path I'm a big
believer and everyone take the same the
path that that is right for you take it
don't get pigeonholed into whatever you
think society and life is telling you to
do so he is he has taken a path that is
hey he's gonna see the world the next
two years instead of working and then
he's going to go back and work a
probably a low-paying job my mom doesn't
own a house now
my mom we've as I discussed she's not
good with her finances
she was credit card debt I don't know
what's going on with her she's just not
one of those people men um so she's any
off so I know I know
I know this and I could tell you right
now that I could probably make the same
amount of money that I make now and be
just fine for the
my life my brothers two years younger
than me is 27 years old he'll be 28 I'll
be 28 in October no I don't yes don't
plants going back to school that I'm
aware of you might go to a coding boot
camp because he's pretty practical he
already has a degree he doesn't need to
go back to get one but the point I'm
saying he doesn't have a degree in
anything that's gonna make him any money
he doesn't have any experience or hard
skills that's gonna make him any money
and I don't know how that's gonna turn
out and his old game plan is to travel
for the next six months come back get
some jobs save up again and then travel
again it's which is fine but it's not it
is not it's not a successful plan to
make the money and go about it so I
knowing that I I mean I've talked to him
I've talked to him about it and he has
suggested that like our aunt will take
care of mom and my aunt's getting up
there too and she don't want to do that
 she got her husband and her family
and and I'm not I'm not trying to
put that on her so now we have to we
have to be the grasshopper man we got to
we gotta save we got a plan we gotta
invest in ourself but that's that that's
let's that's what's kind of brought this
all upon me it's just kind of the
realization of of you know your parents
getting older you're not gonna be able
to work too much longer and and all that
stuff I know I got a little deep there
for a second but I mean that that's
really where all this stress comes from
when did you start coding and what was
your first dev job my first official
full-stack role is the one I currently
have which I've been working about 9
plus months started coding about four
five years ago
when I started doing coursework in
software what did i do before web dev
the only relevant job I really had
before my web dev was I worked as a
technology trainer at my previous ba one
second guys hello happy early
Independence Day
yeah yeah sure
you
you
um I I mean if it's a year contract I
would be open to it
you
all right happy fourth of July
thank you bye it's an Isis recruiter
I've ever dealt with by the way so uh so
uh if you guys think I'm bullshitting
you about recruiters calling all the
time
how often do I stream and get a call
from a recruiter man anyhow that was a
recruiter who I've no issue in taking uh
and insane I accept phone calls from
recruiters
I'm not they call me man well you want
me to do um but um but yeah so uh that's
called wish me happy 4th of July
asked if I was still interested in
potential roles if she came across a if
I said yeah you don't hit me up whatever
you got and we'll take a look so sorry
let's see I missed some stuff I finished
my boot camp recently that means I have
a unique viewpoint and you should give
me an interview all right shoot me an
email
Dillons email through a gmail call
our coding boot camps worth it if you're
willing to put in the prep work before
and you're willing to put in 80-hour
weeks and be in the top 10% you can
excel at a coding boot camp I personally
think I would do a great job so I forgot
what we were talking about man I I think
I was getting kind of emotional talking
about my mom do recruiters send you
gifts like they do in Silicon Valley it
depends on the recruiter but not like
that now the only gift you may get from
a recruiter is a hiring bonus so
sometimes a lot of these recruiting
agencies if you actually accept a job
they'll give you they'll give you three
to four thousand or like thousand
dollars fifteen hundred dollar bonus for
for taking the job mind you they're
getting like 10 grand
am I still doing rap yes so we were
talking about this earlier I'm enrolling
in the Udacity nano degree react program
to get those skills in order and build
those up so yes I will be learning react
through their program I emailed them
yesterday asking if they would let me
enroll in for free if they say yes great
I'll make some videos in exchange for
for that if they say no I will just
purchase the program outright but that
is the I am 100% learning or react react
reduc say react native move it forward
man I wonder why this was a one of the
more controversial strings man what
about reactors Stephen grinder my only
issue with that and by the way I have no
issue with Stephen grinder because he's
actually given me a copy of every one of
his course for free to give to you
specifically huh
so we will be giving a thing so he's a
real cool dude so I have a copy of all
Stephen grinders courses that I'll be
giving to you guys and I can probably
get one for myself if I wanted to I just
want to go through a nano degree program
and I want to have that on the resume
and I want to I I want to partake in the
program I just need I want a more
structured environment for this I want
to - here's the thing guys I'm tired man
I've been going for every day on my own
for the last year and a half last year
and a half I've been I've been blazing
my own trail to the best of my ability I
haven't bought a single course on
Udacity I haven't bought a single course
on udemy I've never bought a course a
day in my life not one never
bought it have free ones I've had
courses given to me I've never bought
one I've never gone through one and I'm
tired man so this will be my first dive
into a program this will be my first let
me see what I can let me see the
nanodegree system let me give you guys
the correct feedback what did I learn
what did I get out of it was it worth my
money is it worth your money I'm tired
man yeah high blood pressure now I can't
be doing this
so here we are man
just once I just want to follow I don't
want to leave man I just want to follow
this time I'm tired I'm gonna follow and
I hope that the udacity react nanodegree
program is a good leader man I just got
to follow this one time it's so here we
are man
here we are I mean I don't know what
that makes me less of a person to want
to follow steadily this one time but I
think I need it and I'm okay except in
the help so data science is big man
data science data scientist number 2 job
only on indeed 108 percent job growth in
three years so don't don't feel that
once a more time just I don't know I
mean you guys understand the grind man
I've been grind in some of you guys
think I'm but I've been
grinding every day in every way that I
know how and I'm gonna grind in a
slightly easier way this time at least I
hope it's slightly easier
well I mean that's what that's where I'm
at man I feel like I'm 80% done with the
free code can't cert but I feel like I
know nothing
is this normal no did you cheat did you
copy videos or did you struggle through
it and build it from scratch Victor
listen because if you built it from
scratch and you didn't cheat and copy
videos you would realize that you know
allotment but you got struggle through
it man that's the truth of the matter if
you do if you just copy code and you
didn't fully understanding and build it
from scratch I would be very surprised
and felt like you'd learn nothing but if
that's the case and it can be you should
you should start first you probably hit
need to sell some algorithms go to code
fights calm go to hacker rank go to code
Wars all these sites and study
algorithms every day struck getting
better with those functions start
thinking more like a developer fall code
that was taught on the video by day trip
do you tried to do it before him did you
try
hi Victor listen this is what this would
be my advice to you is every project
you've already written going to leet all
that code right now delete every little
bit of that code don't
go on YouTube and then go and rework it
because if you did it you should be able
to do it again in about a third of the
time you got it you got it so that would
be my advice man because even the way
you say I followed the code that was
taught on the video but I didn't rip it
off
the basic I'll fingers are harnessed
like it's hard getting starting
algorithms man that's the truth of the
matter so augers up stuck when everyone
had something like look at that cats see
the cats are they so cute man do you
guys wish you had an orange or black cat
no stripe fun yeah I like cats
oh all right man
I think I'm gonna leave you guys I
appreciate you guys all for watching man
we answered some questions we talked a
little bit about where my mind is and
where I'm going what concerns me in my
life you know whether that be making
more money so that you can support your
family down the road we're just wanting
to live a better life that's where I'm
at man so
all right guys thank you so much for
watching and I know we did this 22 K
early subscriber video yeah I know uh I
know some of you and I've had this say
it said to me before and I it happens
quite often some people tell you hey man
what's your problem man you're white guy
everything's great for you right and
look man everyone's just trying to do
better I'm just trying to do better the
words up out there the last thing
we need to do is start bringing racial
identities into it and I've had that
happen that hasn't happened this dream
but I've had it happen the last two and
so what I want to say man is let's all
just look at people like people let's
start there and I just wish everyone
works hard everything works out for you
I'm trying to make sure that works
out for me and by most people's
standards by most people's standards
financially I make more than the average
family in in America the average family
in America makes $55,000 I make more
than that but does anybody here want to
be average does anybody here want to
average first I can't pay for his mom
average average person might be able to
let their mom live on the couch with
them in their family average person
doesn't own a house average person
doesn't have health insurance the
average person
help others when they need help because
they can barely help themselves the
average person can't pay for their
children to enroll in sports the average
person can't pay to get organic food or
whatever food you value the average
person doesn't get to have a nice
retirement the average person doesn't
get to have an office that they can do
their YouTube channel in the average
person can't give the woman they love a
proper wedding the woman that they
cherish and dream about can't give the
person the woman that makes them
happiest the woman who told them that
hey you know what
as you were there feeling shitty about
yourself as life in your mind was
falling apart and all you needed was one
more person to tell you that you know
what man you're a loser and that would
have crumbled apart that that woman that
came to you and said you know what baby
I love you you're gonna do it I have
faith in you you're trying your hardest
and I know you can get there the average
person can't give that woman that they
love or ma'am the type of life that they
deserve for that so
my point is this so I don't strive to be
average and you shouldn't either because
the average person is a up life
I'm not trying to be average and I
doesn't mean I have any problem with
someone being average it's just I've
been poor I've been okay okay and up is
better I can help people but I'm not
average I can I can buy food on what
average God knows you don't want to be
below average so it's up out
there the average person has do you do
you know do you know something do you
know one-third of the population did it
take a single pto day in the last year
one in three people didn't take a single
day off last year in America that's
average you can work to the work to the
 bone that's average the average
person right there that refreshin might
get three days pto because the law says
that they can't give you less in some
states sometimes you get none
I mean how hard do we all have to grind
man did not to be there it's hard it's
hard it's tiring but if you do go that
extra mile if you do work you'll get
there do you know one of the saddest
moments of my life yeah oh oh and by the
way thank you neil floyd the average
person in america has something like
$60,000 in debt
the average student has $40,000 in debt
graduating twenty seventeen thirty seven
that's the average right there
the average student will probably
graduate with the job that pays fifty
thousand dollars if they're lucky so
 up saddest moment of my life one
of the sighs you guys know me a little
bit right I've been on here for two
years now
the recent year so I've been putting
myself on more camera telling a little
bit more about my life
why am I talking about being average if
you don't want to be average because you
have to know what it is you don't want
to be so that you don't become it
because it's easy to fall into those
pitfalls of everybody else does it why
don't I that's why you should be very
aware of what you don't want to become
because the average is an average for a
reason it's what's socially acceptable
and what it's okay
and if you're okay with it you'll be
your choices will change once you're
okay with it
my cat this is you guys know I'm an
introvert to a degree I'm out here on a
public forum but I'm also on the
Internet right I've met a couple people
I've met probably about five to six
subscribers in my lifetime not very
stuck I don't have bad communication
skills I just don't necessarily talk to
strangers all that often in person when
I go places I'm kind of awkward I used
to be much I used to be much worse than
I am now all right especially as a child
I was always shy as always
awkward but but I always had my cat my
cat baby you guys never saw baby because
she died before first our doing YouTube
she died um as you know I have three
cats up
I've always connected very well I talked
with my cats all the time by the way
come home say hello and it comes from me
talking to my cat as a as a young youth
and just enjoying it because I was too
awkward to interact with other people um
but I was going down the I was going
down the the traditional path the
computer science the the college path
April and I were April myself and her
youngest sister we took in were living
in a very small one-bedroom apartment
April and I had the living room when we
gave the bedroom to her sister at that
time we had we had two cats Milo make
certain we yeah we have my loan and we
had my cat baby baby was 19 at that time
and and I love my cat to death I still
do but one of the things that finally
got me to kick my life into gear was
when my my cat passed away this years
old oh and 19 is pretty old for a cat
it's just a matter of time
but but I was very upset with myself
that I couldn't we couldn't afford to we
couldn't afford to get her the to
essentially get her medicine so she died
and that was one of the one of two or
three moments in which I was disgusted
was myself which I had to change the way
that I saw life and I wasn't in any
situation I probably wasn't better or
worse than most college students I know
if you guys know this but there's a
study recently in which one in five
one in five community college students
for that matter are homeless they're
actually going to school and living in
their car or couchsurfing or something
like that you know I actually have a
bedroom they don't have a home they go
to so I was probably better off than
most at least better than that 20% but
you know here you are
probably the the person yeah my cat
person one of the people in your life
that you care about the most you can't
afford the medicine they want or you
can't at least put them out of that
misery because you don't you know have
money for groceries so they suffer and I
was probably immature have to talk to
him ature at the time to fully realize
what was going on and maybe I've been in
denial that my cat was dying but it's
times like those that I look back and as
an adult and someone who's probably
matured a lot in the last four years of
their life or so I think back about how
I don't ever want to be in a situation
like that again and part of that is
is thinking about what I don't want to
be and so when you say if you don't want
to be average why don't you want to talk
about being average because because I've
been there like I understand what I
don't want to be and I understand what I
can be
you know I understand what the world is
very black-and-white in what works and
what doesn't work sometimes now the path
to that black and white is your own but
I think most people can agree that in
order for you to live a comfortable life
you have to have money for the most part
it's a general rule there's no absolutes
in this world if you have money you have
that money pays for simple things like
food shelter housing health insurance
you know as we get older we need health
insurance just little things about so
when you're when you're joking you know
if Tai Lopez was here why is this guy
talking about himself so much it's not
that I enjoy talking about myself but
and you're probably just a little bit of
younger guy can appreciate that
somebody's opening up to you about the
experiences that may be scarred him when
he was younger when he was your age and
the decisions that that the things that
changed him for the better but still
hurt in the process so that maybe when
you have that moment in your life you
don't need to get that scar and you
could say you know what let me think a
second about the choices I'm making and
the direction I want to because we're
where do you want to be when you're 30
when you're 25 are you thinking about
that are you thinking two years ahead or
you just kind of live in life there's
something wrong Oh with that just
understand there's gonna be consequences
so here I am about to turn 30 that are
often probably most above-average career
got a cool YouTube channel that's fun I
got a girlfriend who loves me
could have had all this five years ago
and then some right I could not have to
be worrying about taking care of my mom
five years from now ten years from now
15 years from now about helping my
brother out whether he wants it or not
when he gets back from spending all his
money traveling in Puerto Rico I just
want to be in situation do that man so
that is why I'm talking about myself
other than the fact that it's my
channel do every one but that is
why anyhow guys I'm gonna go spend some
time with my cats I'm going to cook the
woman that I love dinner I'm gonna go
swim some laps because I've made a
commitment to focusing on my health I am
going to continue moving forward one
step closer every day as I hope you all
are I hope that I hope that whatever
your dreams are you achieve them sooner
than later
