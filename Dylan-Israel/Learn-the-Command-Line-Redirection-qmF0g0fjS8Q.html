command line redirecting input and
output redirection so let's get started
here so up until now we've been using
input and output in the terminal so
let's go ahead and try it
echo echo is usually a command just for
print so the echo command accepts a
string hello is standard input and
echoes the string back that's standard
output so now you're familiar standard
put standard now for the senator let's
try our first redirect we'll see ya
echo hello hello dot txt and I think
this should go ahead and put that into
the hello dot txt let's do a cat I will
txt knows so I believe we're gonna find
out that it prints it out or it prints
out the input of the file let's see here
alright so the cat come in outputs the
contents of the file to the terminal
cool so let's try it LS myself so this
will tell us everything that's in which
I put Alice nice one
so that tells us the files and all their
parameters so let's see cat go see
what's in oceans txt continent TX you
can't view the continents TX a nicer cat
so that's going to give us all our
oceans
sir with it now we'll see all our oceans
is output cool so now we're going to
lets you take the center up on his
command hey Constance I'm sorry it's
okay
glaciers txg towards the rivers txt and
now we want to view cat rivers not txt
and we'll see both the rivers and the
glaciers cool in the terminal type lakes
dot txt let's see what this does
so it looks like this is just going to
get the lakes then here some redirection
commands in the terminal we got cat
volcanoes dot txt WC so 1726 204 I still
we still don't know exactly what this is
doing
we'll find out next slide
there you go make sure you use the half
correct spacing and then use cat to
output islands txt so you can see that
it's still the same where it's now the
same as the Poconos
a few commands are particularly powerful
and combined with three direction let's
try them out first use cat on lakes dot
txt so that's going to take the input
under legs now we'll begin with short
legs dot txt so it looks like it's sorts
all that alphabetically that's pretty
cool then we output the contents now the
cats sorted - legs
txt yeah so this actually I believe it
takes the lakes and we saved a menu
sorted after we sorted it saved it in a
new sorted lake so taxi so let's try
this you want to get our deserts by x2
yeah so let's see unique so good keyword
a new command we want to sort I will say
I don't necessarily like having to wait
a page to find out what this stuff does
someone decided that they thought this
was best
they probably know better than me like I
just prefer that we would have all our
explanation before we do the commands
but uh let's see here it looks like we
basically just transferred it over with
the unique command and then maybe just
unique creates a file that's unique -
let's see here ok so unique
gets rid of duplicate values
right so this case is cat out the
mountains dot txt we then want to use a
new clinical grip mount mountains dot
exe and then we're going to prep - i
things dot txt all mountains grip oh all
right and grip stands for global regular
expression print i searched as files
that matches a pattern and returns the
result air grep searches for mounting
mountain-sized x okay so this is
checking for mount - i makes a case
sensitive so mouth is capital in this
case looks like dirt mount is you can't
have a lower case mount mmm mount for
with the line side all right stick slash
home so I should say see user slash
workspace see my so small
Oh make sure your - art design space or
write a song / they see you
oh why is it work one more time see your
grip - are slow down Arctic well that's
why didn't work let's see an Arctic /cc
work space / geography there we go
so this prints out everything that has
Arctic that contains the keyword Arctic
it looks like and so let's try this one
more time
crap - color 1 RL brother
and that's Arctic / Oh
/ - see you in the in this file path and
if we put - r1 it looks like it only
prints out the files not the actual the
contents that contain it cool
all right so let's use cat again to
display the contents of forests txt
alright and now we're going to use a new
command sit said yes / no / /g Horus txt
now let's see what this command does
stands for stream editor it's always use
when using sitcom so we always have to
use this s we do it the search string
the text affine so we're looking for
snow and I replace for ministering rain
so we're taking we need the s we're
looking for snow or in place you know
with rain and document okay and then
just uh it looks like we're done it goes
over a few of the keywords here and once
I get my site up and running I'm gonna
make cheat sheets for all this sort of
stuff so that you can retain it a little
bit easier and just have like one sheet
with all the commands so I'll put a link
to that probably after this video is up
but I'll see you guys in the next video
it's our last final section for the
learning the command prompt and I hope
you're enjoying these videos I know
they're a little quick this whole thing
is only about an hour but at the end of
the day just get familiar with it that's
all you can really expect from free
online courses so I'll see you guys next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
