connection so I'm not gonna touch this
anymore I apologize for that guys um
hopefully hopefully we can get this
going again so hopefully people come
back up relatively soon
I apologize for anyone who had to make
this transition but what we were talking
about a little bit was learning to be a
little bit more fluid in our thinking
learning to be a little bit this thing
it's things I need a little work we're
gonna need a little work with this we're
having a little bit of technical
difficulties can it looks like you guys
can hear me though by the microphone but
what I was trying to say was that there
is a bit part of life in your personal
life in your morals in your professional
that you need to have a certain part of
I don't give a a certain amount of
that what that amount is varies by
individual various by job but there is a
certain amount of I don't give a
that you need to have really and so what
you you know this is a very
unintelligent way of putting this but as
someone earlier mentioned you have to be
able to care about the things worth
caring about
and on top of that that you can have
impact have an impact on and not care
about the things that aren't carrying
about that you don't care about and you
can't have an impact on so that was sort
of my starter to this section and I
already we we really talked about this
in the the other video but does anyone
have any questions I know we just lost
like 30 or 40 people but I was leading
up to let's take some questions
so the
then about the essential oil diffuser
which I'm rocking I'll be careful not to
knock this out again there's really no
benefit to me using this so I think
since it it's a little bit more finicky
I'll probably just use the live huh
yeah and I'm guilty of this as well so a
lot of times I think when you're giving
advice or you're talking about things
like this because that's really the the
channel is an infotainment channel and
part of the channel is to be advice
oriented and sometimes when you give
advice you can you can talk about you
give you can come off as a know-it-all
as somebody who doesn't understand
doesn't preach what they practice and
most of these topics are things that
I've learned the hard way things that I
wish I knew earlier so any any advice
how much how much can you bench not very
much I could probably today
bench like 70 pounds but give me like
give me like two weeks I'll be up to 100
and then two weeks a so that'll be up to
like maybe 125 I haven't been working at
all
so probably not very much I keep trying
to teach myself react which I just keep
falling off and have any advice yes
create a schedule stick to it grind it
out and just make sure you stick to your
schedule a lot of times people don't
have any schedules every morning I wake
up I spend about hour to two hours
working on stuff it's just far my
schedule I need to I need to do that for
the gym also I need to figure out a
schedule for the gym stick to it and
continue to do it after the first two
three four weeks it's just part of your
life son it's much easier just you just
gotta stick to it and it's something
that I'm struggling with right now I am
not as hungry as I once was
and it's is something that
something that I find very strange
something that I don't know I don't know
what to do for it I have I have do I
still work hard at work of course I do
but it's outside of work where I've
always really prided myself as an
individual it's um doing the extra stuff
because the extra stuff everyone's
working a job it's the extra stuff that
gets you to that next level in your
career right and it was much easier
there's like a piece of something float
in my water it's disgusting I'm gonna
dig my hand in here and get it right
there is a witch so everyone's working a
job and it's the the extra hours outside
work so I used to up until about a month
ago maybe a month and a half go put
three to four hours a day in on various
things side projects watching videos
going to meetups so on and so forth and
right now I'm not as hungry as I once
was I am spending about one to two hours
a day between YouTube between coding I
trying to go to more meetups but I
haven't really committed to that I'm
reading so so um so one of the things
that I'm trying to counteract that so
I'm trying to do it different make it
fun so I'm reading books I just finished
the complete software developers career
guide is 800 pages I have speaking if
someone's asking how to get better with
JavaScript algorithm so you can go to
sites like code fights and practice
there I might I also recommend cracking
the coding interview which is another
book I bought which I must start playing
around with a bit but it's a it's a
strange place to be in my life because I
don't have any hobbies anymore this is
something I realized recently is for the
last 3 years I've been so much in the
grind I don't really have any hobbies
and I don't have any friends here to be
honest with you it's just April and me
and
which I'm fine I'm a solitary creature
so I if I don't have the and one of the
things I love about moving across
country is being able to isolate myself
so that I can focus on that but I'm not
focusing I have two to three hours a day
where I'm just kind of watching YouTube
now and that's upsetting so I'm in a
very strange transition period where I
have to figure that out and I feel like
I the reason I bring this up it's not to
talk about myself
but because I think a lot of people can
get content and especially after they
get you know some experience and life
gets too easy
you know or you know however you want to
put it like I in terms of the one stress
a lot of people never eliminate from
their mind is money and so if that's a
lot of people's biggest stress in life
for me all right I'm good I like to make
more money but in terms of money being
something that stresses me out anymore
no longer a factor never felt better
all right so I encourage you to I
encourage you all day to get to that
point in your life and it comes through
not only just be being paid well
it also comes from making great
financial decisions zero debt between
April and I cars paid off no credit card
debt credit scores we just make it smart
choices right not like we always have
been but in the last five to six years
great got money in the bank all that
good stuff so there's a certain level of
content miss content miss is that word
content we're gonna say it's word
content miss that like the feeling of
being content content Ness so I'm still
working one to two hours a date but I'm
not working three to four hours a day
which is what I wanted to do till 2020
so I gave myself five years or so that's
ten five years of working three or four
hours a day and and it's a very very
strange thing to know to have your goals
know what you want to do know what it
takes and still fall short
and and going and still fall short and
realize that you're not doing as much as
you can so the reason I bring it up is
that if you find yourself in that how
I'm trying to solve it I can't say this
is gonna work 100% but how I'm trying to
solve that feeling of complacent is I am
changing it up I am change you up in
several different ways I'm also trying
to be very conscious of what I'm trying
to do with my life and so health is
something I'm gonna focus on a little
bit because I think I think part of it
is I just feel unhealthy and it's hard
to to put in the hours I want also so if
you're feeling like that change up a
little bit but let's list enough about
that let's so let's go ahead and answer
some more questions I'm learning
JavaScript so far so good I've heard a
lawyer a lot of bad parts can you
elaborate on that topic a bit yeah so
Java scripts unique in the fact that
JavaScript was written in ten days and
so it's it's come a lot farther than it
has before but there are some strange
things in JavaScript that language is a
little bit more thought-out would not
have falsey values are a great example
this where an empty string would return
would be a faulty value where an array
type of arrays object very very sort of
things that you walking's in JavaScript
as as a part of the language that's a
lot of what people don't like about it
that there's dynamic types and said
instead of being a statically typed
language and type scripts trying to help
solve that a little bit but there are a
lot of things in JavaScript now with all
that being said javascript is an
excellent language to get started with
and as to learn part of the reason why
is because part of the reason why is
because it's the most common language
used like it is an excellent learning
because a ton of company is working in
the majority of jobs
are in web development and the majority
of web development is in JavaScript at
least in the front-end so that's why
it's excellent do I have two different
colored eyes so I do
they are both blue and and so one this
one it looks like it's darker and this
one is lighter so for those you don't
know I got laser eye surgery and it I've
always had two different color eyes but
a lot of people have been commenting on
it and so I got laser eye surgery and
they basically scraped my eye and this
eye is a little bit lighter than it was
before and so I've always had two
different ones but it seems to be more
noticeable ever since I've had laser eye
surgery it might be because I'm not
wearing my glasses cuz I don't need them
anymore but something keep in mind I
like that you don't want to get
complacent keep it up yeah it's you need
to be aware of your surroundings and
aware of you and what it is that you
want to accomplish right so how many of
us want certain things in life and we
just say well I'm gonna work hard that's
a shitty way that's a shitty plan and so
you need to sort of keep yourself
accountable and not only that you have a
an actual game plan to how to get there
so I say 2018 what is it that I want to
accomplish well my salary to increase I
want to be better educated I want to
have better portfolio how am I gonna do
that I read books gonna meet go to
meetups conferences I'm the network and
then I start saying what books am I
gonna read I have a list of books what
courses if I can do I have a list of
courses what a conference is am I gonna
go to I buy the conference's tickets
I've set up planets all that sort of
stuff so um when you say that you want
goals don't just say it act on it create
a game plan and work towards that game
plan currently doing a web program of
course in college only it's only two
weeks under officers yeah welcome to
college where the courses don't matter
and you don't learn but you still
get a degree and get over the HR
firewall
I am realizing how much effort it takes
doing the the tree house Tech degree now
and thinks it's a hard time yet
it's a codeine is something that is a
it's this is what's so strange about
software is when you're just getting
started it's about understanding how to
be a software developer now as you move
on it's not about how to have a code and
everything like that it's about how well
do you know framework how well do you
know the language and go from there
that's really it
it's and then it's just about expanding
the skill set out and becoming more and
more familiar with the tools and I would
say that's probably what's happening
with me right now my life is I don't
really code anything super complex
I don't code anything that there has
ever been there has never been a project
in the last two years I've been a
developer so where someone says hey we
need you to do this and then I was like
oh I don't know how to do that no
it's all right yeah I can do that no
problem like now it could be I don't
know how to do that in the amount of
time then you want click like I can't I
can do all this can I do it in a week Oh
probably not so that's interesting bit
code with the five Daleks thank you man
I appreciate that I saw your comment on
the free code camp video I guessed it on
I appreciate the support you oh but life
has been treating you well um do you
feel you're lacking an outside
encouragement that's probably common for
most people no um I do not so I find a
lot of encouragement from subscribers
even though on a large platform you're
always gonna get a certain amount of
hate I get comments on a regular basis
hating on me and and just being rude and
nasty and then but I would say 99% of
people are very supportive and it's very
encouraging that that's the case
did you ever get around is finishing
free code camp
I finished the front insert and I finish
pretty much all of the micro services
and the react projects that are on beta
so there wasn't really anything left for
me to do I'd never did the full stack
application so it's just too much time
which I'm not enough reward why did I
have a late laser laser eye surgery so I
didn't so I could see the type of
surgery I needed from my one eye here
was just $400 so it was completely
affordable and it's soft I would save
the money for from paying for I'd save
the money just in sorry I'm looking for
just in eye exams and glasses so $400
can't beat that yeah good for you Marcos
have I looked at code calves meet these
new course I'm Alexa I know they have a
new course on Alexa I haven't gone to it
I would so here's my thing although I
would love to code something for our
LexA my entire house has Google home
like tiger farm a school home and two or
three Google home minis so now to go
Google home menu so I've three three
things with Google mini and so it's kind
of like where's the Google home code man
I'll probably get around it make it
something I like to play around and
things I'm getting kind of bored of
angular just because I do it all the
time it works I'm starting I'm thinking
I'm gonna start picking up something new
that might be something that that's also
something that I'm not 100% committed to
I started recently learning I bought a
course that I started like three four
days ago that involves me learning
selenium
slid iam solidity I figure it is but the
theory of contracting language so I'm
working through that course slowly but
surely and going from there so I could
learn view here's the thing I don't want
to learning a framework a JavaScript
framework and go from there so is it
still what like one framework to Nellie
it's I'd rather learn something
something different and I think that
might be what I do here back page
restiess today what would you do if your
company website would cease oh my god
panic I I don't have any good advice for
that thank you so much change for the
for the support the house Western
Governors University I dropped out three
weeks ago how many lines of code do you
write in typical day well since I do
front-end web development I don't know
if you count html's lines of code and it
depends on the day
in a real productive day where I'm it
depends on the day is a it depends on
the day every day is different if I had
to give a guess somewhere between 100 to
300 but you know you're building models
you're billing services uh going from
there
how what was on your portfolio on how
much it's so that's a question that's
hard to answer I can tell you about
sixty percent of my time spent writing
code I think that's a better answer for
what you're trying what you're asking
because lines of code vary right if you
write a lot lot of lines of code you're
probably doing a shitty job oh I think
is the few of the lines typically the
better and the more simplistic and
easier understanding of code it's free
code camps designed for ambiguity
once it's time to build projects feels
like you're being thrown out as wha I
think so but it's very hard to hold your
hand through a project and you have
other resources to help you out but that
that's sort of I think
trying to emulate the real world to the
best of their ability that would be my
understanding and honestly there's very
few places I ever tell you to build
projects and and I think they give you a
good idea and on the beta they actually
guide you a little bit more so whenever
they release that I think it might be a
little bit more helpful how can i
memorize what I learn like functions
arrays etc practice practice practice do
it every day every single day use it
every day and eventually it becomes
second nature uh yeah job touch I'm a
Python person thing and doing deep flesh
just our history going along rituals I
don't know about that either
its data analysis job good yep one the
best why did I drop out it's a
combination of a few things one who is
making me miserable
that was absolutely number one - I felt
like I felt as if I was paying $1,000
for a udemy course which made me which
made me really upset so that was
something I was not super happy about
but most importantly of all I felt like
it wasn't the best utilization of my
time I felt like the amount of time that
I was putting into it it wasn't hard and
in two months or so two and a half
months no one was I did 2 weeks 3 weeks
3 weeks so was that eight weeks and
eight in eight weeks or two months I had
finished three courses something like 13
units and I had two other courses I had
started so so but I felt at the end of
it that if I took the time built courses
if I took the time went to conferences I
took the time wrote a book all these
sort of things that I would enjoy it a
lot more and they would have a better
impact on my career that was what it was
but also it's just it was miserable
reading stuff that you knew was wrong
but you had to memorize to answer the
questions on the test and then it was
really kind of soul-crushing it was it
was it was just a rehashing of
everything I hated about college in the
first
place was it but it was not tough going
to school and working at all I just took
my two hours in the morning two hours
after work and I applied it to school
and that might be something that caused
me to lose a little bit of money my
rhythm a little bit of my grind just
changing it up to the point where I'm
going back to school and gently sinks I
don't know if that was the case and and
causing me to lose a little bit of my
fire but I can tell he definitely
affected me
you know I struggled with deciding to
drop out yes yes you did baby
April supported me thoroughly but I did
struggle James $5 says I hate a minute
but the cook Adam II paid 10-week
program you may do another one holds me
accountable some people need that and
that's part of so I have a video a very
controversial video talking about should
you drop out of college this is
something people ask me all the time uh
whenever I get like emails it's always
people in college super unhappy trying
to understand if this is the right path
for them and so I it was it's about 17
minute videos pretty long but I sort of
give you my mentality about it and
explain to you and one of the things I
talk about is some people need that very
structured environment because they need
to be held accountable one thing that
happens and a lot of people a lot of
people might disagree until they've put
putting in that situation but when you
are given freedom because that's what it
is you're you're essentially given
freedom to act and do and learn how you
see fit and no one's gonna hold you
accountable if you want to wake
up hit that bong keep hitting it
hitting and hitting it pop in
call a duty and not do not do anything
all day
you can do that there's no teacher in
class gonna say Amen
you know you do man your test there's no
you're not paying any money to go to
college and do all this you can do that
you may not accomplish what your goals
and dreams are and you may have issues
with it but you can do that but a lot of
times when you get that freedom when you
get that extra oomph what happens is you
don't know how to handle it it's the
truth it's kind of like people who have
lived in like very traditional
and then they finally go to college and
before you know it they're you know
they're doing like gang bangs and
they're there and orgies and non all
sorts of drugs and they like because
they've they've never been able to have
that freedom and they just sort of come
wild and and it's it's kind of crazy but
a lot of times now to say James is out
there having orgies and things but what
I'm trying to say is sometimes you need
that accountability and for a lot of
people when you're like look I just
threw $300 down on this you best believe
I'm not wasting that $300 that's really
what I was trying to say I don't know
why I went with or cheese and stuff but
you get what I'm trying to say how's my
sea shark journey going not very well I
did three C sharp courses and then I
haven't had a chance to do any at work I
just kept getting front-end work and so
here we are what should I learn to be a
professional data analysis I'm not
really qualified to answer that question
but uh probably something like Python
are tensorflow
all that sort of stuff Marco says take
care get done as much as I like to stay
unless I have to get back to my coding
class I want to be where you are I
appreciate that man I
I can appreciate wanting to be where I'm
at I want to be somewhere who's above me
right I want to be on like Quincy's
level I want to be on Johnson mez level
I wanna be an engineer truths level and
being like you know and then when I get
there I want to be somewhere else yeah
so always to always have a goal in mind
have you ever thought about starting a
business based on creating websites for
small business now there's very little
than no money and creating anything for
small website small businesses that has
already been monopolized by things like
more WordPress Squarespace Wix that's
what all that's about those content
management systems those are the small
those are the business small websites
that's what they're there for
yeah so I have no interesting that
what's it guys ever use the bathroom a
little boy's room I'll be right back
uh don't I have to take Visual Basic in
college Jesus Christ why why why why
learn C sharp after the class over C
sharp would be an excellent language
learning as well as JavaScript let's see
here uh uh then we got the human in here
go hard I've been learning JavaScript it
seems there's a way more dotnet John
Mayer should I stick with JavaScript or
dotnet for a better shot getting job
well JavaScript will be good for the
front-end net will be really good for
the back end and in middleware and all
that stuff so you can learn both
although it might be a little hard when
you're just starting out I do have to
read books about JavaScript why I'm
learning a free code campus so what
books do you recommend I don't
I only recommend soft skill sort of
books the most recent book I read I
think there's a link in the description
as well if you want to help the brother
out with some affiliate money is some
programmers Booker Johnson misses
complete software developer secure guide
I think technical books for the most
part of a waste of time what do you
think about professors that are teaching
outdated that are out professors that
are outdated teaching coding classes
teaching out dating coding classes I
think it's a crime I think I think you
should absolutely when you're paying
good money and you're supposed to be
teaching metric teaching skills this is
the thing with college nine and ten
degrees aren't teaching these skills
when you're teaching a computer science
class when you're teaching a software
development class you need to be
teaching current things and that's one
of my biggest issues with college
so I think it's a crime I think honestly
schools should even be sued for it
whether anyone's going to do it
it's another another thing right but it
is is discussing or the best items
including portfolio projects something
is unique something that includes the
in-demand frameworks uses api's can you
elaborate more of my internship
experience oh yeah if you want I've only
had one internship ever it was for a
company called Dali Web Design in Rancho
Santa Margarita which is which was two
hours away from where I was living and
so back when I was developing my plan to
drop out of college and go and become a
developer I said alright
step one before I drop out going at a
internship so the very first thing I
apply for internships and eventually got
one by posting my resume on Craigslist
and so I was like hey we're looking for
a summer intern blah blah blah it's like
hell yeah let's go so I took the
internship where I was working at this
web design shop it was a two hour drive
there to two hour drive back I basically
did a bunch of content management a
little bit of HTML a little bit of CSS
and that was pretty much it at the end
of the day and after three months or so
they hired me to do some freelance I
started making $12 an hour then they
hired me for freelance for about three
months or so for $20 an hour and then I
was an internship it was doing a content
management WordPress HTML CSS set that
was it though wasn't anything super
exciting it wasn't really all that
valuable no disrespect to the people
there I appreciated them very much bye
and learning a thing and I was one of
the things I remember I did like my exit
interview if you will and I think they
were a little bit offended when I said I
didn't felt like I learned anything
which is
but really I should say get the resume
experience so I was okay with that I got
a letter recommendation got a little bit
of money got a little bit of resume
experience all those things helped to
get to me where I am so I am grateful
for the opportunity know how search for
skills and area efficiently rather than
shifting through job postings what else
you want it the job postings are exactly
what people are looking for say you want
to be a front-end developer in Tampa
Florida look at the front-end developer
roles for a week in Tampa Florida and
see what's there
just in that area though it's not gonna
be that many there might be for a week
50 and go from there now finishing
colleges are one of your goals what's
your goal for this year I want to go to
at least one conference I want to
continue to work on the YouTube channel
I don't really have any courses I want
to build at this time I might build more
down the road maybe an algorithm course
because I'm going to be reading cracking
the coding interview but reading more
books I've actually changed up my
learning pattern a little bit where I'm
watching a 30 minute talk thirty you
know any SOR ten some are 60 minutes on
coding Tech which is an excellent
excellent YouTube channel I've started
doing this this week and I'm very happy
with that I have is they have basically
all the conferences that people go to
give talks and things like that they
have them up on their channel and I
watched about a 30-minute one at the at
the longest because I show up 30 minutes
early for work or I go from there I also
I'm looking into building block chain as
well as release my very first web
application I would like to write a book
as well so those are the goals this year
those are are the goals right now
did you say something about MVC Model
View controller I know the concept of it
I just having gotten to the practical
implementation where to start thank you
so MVC is sort of the modern
architecture for a lot of front-end
applications and even back in
applications and so the model is
essentially your data model the view is
the template how it's gonna look and the
controller is your your logic a lot of
times and so the controller manipulates
the data of the model and the and sends
it to the view and so that's really hit
at the end of the day you have models
which are how your data is supposed to
be right you have views which are your
your templates your HTML documents and
how it's a rendered and then you have
the controller which takes the model
data does some stuff within the logic
and then sends it to the view so that it
can be rendered and so that it can do
that right so a very basic example let's
say you have a user object that keeps
track of is a user logged in well it's a
boolean right is logged in true or false
and then that data from the model
they're your mom's list of your
structure the data is now in your
controller and it's it's sending this is
okay cool controller maybe we do
something with it we set a variable it
says logged in instead of that it said
true right doesn't make sense once they
logged in and then BAM
in your view it's it gets that it gets
that data it gets look at the controller
tells the view say hey have this users
say logged in that's it that's a very
very basic example it suggests of it
dotnet seems to me getting big dotnet is
definitely exploding c-sharp is
excellent language learn mean stack
developers still viable of course it is
note is actually it's so there's more
jobs in dotnet but it's a viable
absolutely note is uh notice one of
those things where it's actually being
picked up law for aetherium contracting
and block chains
but it would be excellent idea of
looking in c-sharp specifically done
that is your quiz I put on hold I don't
know what I want to do for the back end
of the quiz app this is the issue I'm
having and I've lost a little bit of
steam but uh it is in development but
yeah sort of put on hold as I'm sort of
figuring things out but it's not
something that is dead at all
you know I wash my hands mofo
ah someone asked me for my email I'll
type it in the chat here are you guys in
chat alright uh how are you not an
engineer it's true slowly just youtubing
me uh yeah a little bit of a little bit
of the YouTube grind a little bit of
that of that hustle I'm just talking
about people more successful than myself
people I want to be like and folks like
he also does a lot of things better than
I do when it comes to YouTube he does a
lot of things better than I do in life
he is excellent with fitness he exercise
daily
he makes and he goes to conferences he
does a lot of things behind this behind
the scenes to become the person he wants
to be I want to I want to be a little
bit more like that there are a lot of
traits that people can have good and bad
that you can admire right how many
conditions are too many when using the
ternary operator the legal limit is two
you have two conditions for the ternary
operator after that you have some
spaghetti code get that out of here
that's it
all right I noticed a lot of videos to
stress we should think like a developer
when looking at problem can you explain
what that means yes it it means I mean
it's quite a few things depending on
what video but in general what it means
is breaking a problem down into the
smallest pieces and then building out
each individual piece one by one and
seeing how they connect so a very basic
example is a lot of people get
overwhelmed when they open up a text
error the you know earlier we're talking
about the free code camp project seems
overwhelming right I don't for beginners
so we get started it's because you're
looking at a completed project you're
saying oh my god how do I get it here
when in reality what you need to look is
like how do I get the heading there
these are thinking I have an h1 tag
right I know I remember this heading
thing how do I put text on a page even
you don't remember headings do you say
how do I put text on a page in HTML and
you start breaking out piece by piece by
piece so start breaking
your problems down and I honestly think
it's an excellent way to look at life a
lot of times start breaking your
problems down analytically into the
smallest pieces so that you can succeed
and that's how what I really mean when I
start saying and think like a developer
so what the doctype you actually put the
the dollar sign and call in the
backticks are actually supposed to be
outside of the curly braces and you did
one on the last thing it doesn't matter
but seeing how in case anyone was
looking at that so what's that half of
that was a done right half of that
waster it doesn't matter because here
what the doctype is an excellent name is
it makes up for it sounds like we have a
lot to catch up on let's talk soon yeah
for sure I still owe you a video you
came on the channel and never released a
video and I feel guilty about it so come
over the video talk topic let's if you
want Christian let's do it let's do a
video on the channel um dad was it dad
dad
so apparently dabbing is just where you
hit yourself in the forehead and look
down with your bicep or forum most about
it that's all I got
why don't you quit the CS degree
recently I just talked about that maybe
10 minutes ago I'd say it's in here this
video would be up Chelsea other if you
had a business degree would it be worth
going to WG you first yes or sta certain
career so I would never recommend anyone
going back to college I don't think it's
worth it you have a degree you already
checked that box now you just knew the
skills that that's that's the truth of
the matter so that's my personal advice
on that
I think you'd benefit better by going to
a bootcamp honestly if you need that
structured learning path
how could someone be a JavaScript before
they move on Amy we should be able to
work with the language she should know
of a function Street string methods
number methods how to use them basic you
just have to know the language at the
end of the day angular react those
things they're used for Dom manipulation
so what do you think about internships
one in payment on voyage I think if
you're desperate you take them and
immediately on day one you still start
applying to other jobs elsewhere that's
what I think
loyalty is in bought with minimum wage
as far as I'm concerned but yeah
sometimes it's better get the experience
no nothing at all thank you inspired me
and Josh through the best Thank You Man
thank you Yusuf how many different
companies have you worked for and what
time frame professionally not counting
my internship I worked for six months
for dolly web design as an intern
essentially after that I worked for nine
months at a student information system
company that were a software like
blackboard or Moodle for nine months as
a technology training you can kind of
think Technical Writer with a mixture of
business analysts and then I worked a
year for a defense contractor writing
software and I've worked eight months
for a multi-level marketing health and
fitness company so whatever that added
up to any cool conferences in Florida's
year not till later in the year you have
to check it out
a webform sorry pain yeah don't do what
for gotta get the research learned data
structures honestly
cracking the Cody interview is probably
gonna help me with that because I'm not
the best at data structures either how
long does it take you learn JavaScript
everyone's everyone's different I'm
still learning I'm still learning we're
used to see the future webdev going I
don't know this is something I think
about from time to time we've had some
consolidation I see JavaScript continue
to evolve which will be nice which means
that we're gonna need transpilers our
compilers I see typescript continue to
be great
I see the swing to react which i think
is gonna swing back to angular I could
be wrong but really I don't know I don't
know I see I see JavaScript just getting
a little bit more mature every year
do you need to learn computer science
topics like big o-notation via web
developer now you might need to need it
for some technical interviews I know
when I've been interviewed by Facebook
and Amazon they're much more heavy in
those computer science topics ideally in
the concepts of program for learning
JavaScript where you jump right into a
layman I'm a little different because
I'm computer science program but I
wouldn't say I ever really learn the
concepts of programming would you
recommend CI CEU program courses at
university how do i CEU is a sea
what books you recommend for those
starting out I don't recommend books I
recommend courses and building projects
when you're actually trying to learn to
code yeah as about that full-stack wicks
life look forward to Monday's dull on
video part 2
vhari for 12-month contracts work do you
have to fulfill I can just leave me a
better offer your stock you've probably
just leave I've never worked contract
girl but typically you can just leave
yeah what's my schedule like lately I
wake up I have one to two hours in the
morning I spend an hour working on about
you know checking emails answering
emails doing YouTube stuff responding to
comments I so I spent probably about 30
minutes actually on YouTube stuff in the
morning and then and then from there I
go and I'll watch about a 30 minute
video and then I'll watch about 30
minutes at udemy after that I go to work
from about 8:30 to 5:30 and then come
home I watched a little bit YouTube do
about 30 minutes of studying not as much
as I'd like I go to bed to again have
you seen a job that requires an
applicant not have a CS degree and never
hurts yeah it's always so CSR II prefer
to see after here you're acquired does
that mean that you have to have it no
does it help absolutely absolutely
can I take engineer truth in a fight not
right now I'm out of shape guys I know
you see this you so that's a handsome
 man right there
I mean ladies I know gentlemen you you
know you might you might you might
consider it you know but contrary to
popular belief I am not in the best
shape also Matt like trained in
jujitsu for a while so he probably you
probably wrecked me oh no careful kitty
we got a sensitive microphone oh it will
help in every situation a computer
science degree verse no computer science
degree will help in every single
situation
now whether whether it's the best for
you it's up for debate how much money do
I make
uh well is it rude to say how much money
I make do you guys think I should answer
that question I mean I don't have a I
don't know uh all right I'll tell you
this I gave I give you a little taste a
little taste all right um I'll give you
I'll give you a taste so this year this
year by the end of the year with YouTube
and everything else I will I will be in
six figures so that includes salary
includes YouTube the bulk of that is
clearly my my my my income but there's a
decent amount that is YouTube there's a
decent amount that is investments so not
a decent amount YouTube is the other
side so between YouTube and and the
career I will be in the low six figures
how much does YouTube back it's just
soda ducked in it inside now put this in
perspective I have one year eight months
experience as a developer not counting
my internship and not counting my
technology trainer do there's just like
 my why I must have grabbed the
dirtiest cup so yeah
I don't have so here's the here's the
thing guys I don't have any issue saying
it but I've been told by developers who
are fans of the channel that I shouldn't
say it and these are people I respect so
that's my only hesitation with it how
much my cat makes not very much the cats
make an equal amount to an April name
those jobs have to whisper like me
they're coming in here bitch laugh and
be on the live stream on time 18 months
right
what do I invest in right now I'm just
saving money but I did have some Kryptos
I invested in uh ain't make any money
right now off those curve tails do that
much
what's more important it is how much
money you make I'm not quite sure what
you're trying to say that Ryan will blur
you're in your 30s right I am 30 exactly
what I think about bootstrap my only
things that's producing ugly redundant
code please just just for CSS really so
I use it all the time for the column
grid system but I'm going to try and use
I'm going to try and use CSS screen more
moving forward so that I need to get
better with was the reason part of it is
to protect yourself for negotiations
part of it is sometimes when you talk
about because I saw I make good money
especially for where I am in my career
and it's only going to get better I make
more money than the average family
United States the average family makes
$55,000 in the United States I alone
make more money than that and
significantly more and money is not a
concern of mine anymore
I'd like to make more money because I I
can't do all the things I want to do and
who doesn't want more money right but
sometimes when you talk about money
people take it the wrong way that's just
true than that all right does
essentially a diffuser yeah it kind of
calms to me down relaxes me a little bit
when you feel when do I fill this time
start freelance work I've been some
freelance work from my old work stuff
like that how do you keep pushing
forward you got to find what makes you
happy and when it stops making after you
happy you got to find a different way
find something else
Hayes's on I I don't mind I don't mind
an occasional joke at Matt's expense but
you have to understand man I have been
boys for 20 years so you know after the
third or fourth engineer truth stroke
I'm probably gonna put you on a timeout
man so just chill out he's not here man
if you want to talk to Matt he's
got his channel he'll respond to you
he'll tell you to suck his dick or
something or just block you oh so just
selling that out there uh what YouTube
software do you use also also when the
reasons I'm not investing right now is
I'm saving money in the bank to buy a
house it's something that is a
consideration and you need to have you
need to have a certain amount of money
sitting do that so um what is the
difference between a map and for each
and JavaScript map returns a brand new
array with values altered for each just
iterates through right what YouTube
software you use to make your video I
use Adobe Premiere
do you ever get tired of coding no I I
get tired of not coding more than that
if that makes sense I get tired of the
the realistic aspects of of being a
developer the the stand-ups the meetings
the the having to talk to non-developers
those are the things I get tired of but
the coding aspect nah man just leave me
on my code alone and that my people that
divestment I'll just say that I don't
like people who aren't developers or
anything like that but that would be
what my where I would more so lose my

electri oh I'll check it out uh do you
only a lot of people you know to add you
on facebook or could I add you to you
can add me if you want
I don't publicly shoot my thing out
there but I do have a Facebook group
called code tech and caffeine if people
seem to find me and add me I have like
three four hundred people and you guys
are crazy as I have to unfollow
half of you because you're posting crazy
 on on my feet I say I need this in
my life
I don't block you but I do unfollow you
guys all the time if I was just gonna
starting what would i do i'd go into
blotching partly because there's such
high demand and the money is better it's
something like 15 per k's 15 percent
more than the average job at the same
pouring your career and better benefits
where's Matt
I believe is in the Philippines or
Panama or somewhere he's just at a
conference if I donate $100 what would
you do answer my question
yes I would answer your question for
$100 with it but here's the thing fresh
boy May so everyone who says something
like that is a broke five year old and
never has $100 to donate I guess you
know what I would do I would be stunned
that's what I would be because I expect
you to be a seven year old on a keyboard
thirteen year old because you get your
in all caps you got seven exclamation
points so I should ain't that sure they
ain't gonna happen because you're broke
you ain't got no money
well no one has ever done he's like well
I was gonna do this mmm I guess it's the
same thing every like as a kid was like
your brother your sisters being a dick
and they're like well if you weren't you
know such a baby I was gonna give you
the popsicle or whatever same thing some
 children do Oh Mac or PC I use PC
if I couldn't code what I do instead I'd
probably do something that requires a
computer that I could do anywhere in the
world
and that I could do for myself do i no
see now yes most browsers for t-shirt
see CSS great excuse me
don't think gassing the animal degree I
enjoyed it when I was doing the react
one I regret not finishing it I do get a
job in angular so I had to James
might change my thing changed my my my
study habits and what I needed to
accomplish so there's a reason for it
but I did like it
was the communication like between
someone who doesn't understand coaching
like a client first in your work area uh
for most where it's pretty fine a little
bit of hand-holding a little bit of
explanation but you know I'm sure they
say something like these dance just
don't get business requirements these
dads don't understand how would this you
know so I I you have to have it you have
to be able to put yourself in their
shoes so I get it
but part of being a developer is having
good communication skills to be able to
communicate why this is a large thing
how we can communicate this and why like
I'll give you a very basic example we
have a component library where we build
components that we are going to reuse in
multiple projects so they asked me to
change the color of the component and it
release of time sense the thing I said
yes but I know this is gonna sound crazy
but it's going to take two hours to
change that color from the standard blue
to green and there's a reason for it not
because I'm being lazy or anything cuz
we all know CSS we can change color but
when we're to do things the right way
sometimes we not just changes the color
this component had default colors now
what we're gonna do is as a developer
now we have this requirement instead of
just going and changing this to green
what we're now gonna do is create a
theme property that's apply CSS classes
dynamically to get the objective they
want while still writing reusable code
and so it's things like that where you
just have to say look let me tell you
why I'm gonna make this so that if you
come back to me in three hours and say I
want to change the whole style of it and
I want to do this this and that and I
don't want it green anymore I want to be
yellow I can easily do that and it could
be different in multiple applications
and it's not gonna break its gonna be
backwards compatible so you have these
little things and sometimes you have to
explain that sometimes it's very easy to
jump to conclusions as to what is easy
what is hard especially if you're not a
technical person or you don't know it so
good communication is key in every role
it's also very key when you're drilling
people aren't devs and who are dense so
I live in Michigan so extra pair chance
of landing a job still shot
we're tech businesses our sister Stamper
where you are there's not that many tech
businesses in Tampa or is it more
difficult gives you the other job so I
came from Los Angeles there's a ton of
competition anywhere else this seems a
lot easier Jenna Miss California I'm mr.
Mexican food
I might miss my mom and my dad a bit at
times yeah do YouTube help you make
deference no no definitely oh yeah you
know talked with Kristen Rickie
Eric on a semi-regular basis
traversing media on occasion Brad simple
programmer so sort of the the youtubers
out in the world where can I learn
blockchain programming udemy what games
you make I don't make any games I'm not
familiar with how rail said that I I'm
we're so talking about angular
components and doing that I wanted to
take me into the grass spaces JavaScript
maybe six months I got moola ain't got
 fresh boy you broke Sun we all know
it it's all right dude anyone who says I
got moolah moolah now I think you're
like 70 you 70 over here thinking you're
gonna ball hard with your Social
Security check
Oh moolah
how important tool in Photoshop is
running developer not very smart of a UI
you actually if your sister will you do
for cutting when you select close I
don't man I have all the answers I
figure it out most difficult part of
your job other than dealing with people
is dealing with unrealistic deadlines
how do I get better CSS you focus on you
practice on you take courses on design
and build things you learn you you put
active effort into it if you got a great
offer fresh would you consider offer
yeah I would did Matt getting useful for
you I don't know what you're talking
about is this super Decatur your
education to a specific company yes
my counting a job knowing but not
proficient HTML CSS JavaScript no I mean
you can is it gonna be hard yeah it's
gonna field near and possible probably
you're probably gonna need to pick up
get you're probably gonna need to pick
up angular or react you need to just
start building some projects I've been
my advice
I'm looking in the Tampa area what do
you think on see I think you need to do
C C sharp
friend of use html/css no you still use
html/css way you not you're not always
worried about UI and making pixel
perfect designs and things like that
that's more of the UI UX web design sort
of field not always but usually
alright guys with that being said thank
you so much for watching this is our
weekend weekend livestream I appreciate
y'all I hope you enjoyed it I apologize
for the earlier technical difficulties
it has been a it's been an experience
I'm going to go have some dinner
spend a little time with the missus and
hope you guys are as I am someone
currently at my point in my career
struggling to have the same dedication
that that I had before I was a developer
you know I'm doing one to two hours a
day I want to be doing three to four I
told myself I'd work every day for five
years I'm not working as hard as I want
so that is what I'm going to be focusing
on and I hope that whatever it is you
are trying to solve your harsh with
yourself and you are trying to you're
trying to move forward and accomplish
what it is that you want and working
hard at it to accomplish that so I
appreciate it guys that's a little bit
what's on my mind see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
