for our quote generator here now we will
in do the CSS because even we're just
kind of working them in order we set up
names but we don't we're not doing
anything with those names so probably
the first thing I would want to do is
change the color the background color to
black so the easiest way to do that is
just to declare the body here and say
background - color black very cool now
this is a little hard to see this dark
grey so for me I just changed it to
white so how do we do that typically you
don't want to just target elements but
this is a single page sort of thing so
we can just say h1 and we give it a
color of white and then I don't really
like that font so let's change the font
to family to something like maybe Times
New Roman that change okay yeah so we
change this font a little bit there to
something a little more standard a
little more a little more pep in stuff
even though Times New Roman is probably
pretty standard in my case I didn't like
how close this was to everything it
looks so jumbled right now so the next
class I kind of messed with we can do it
in order actually let's go ahead and
mess with the paragraph we'll just do an
order so my body's kind of there then we
did our heading now let's it lets adjust
for the paragraph so in the paragraph I
wanted to give it a color of white as
well and then I wanted to give it a font
family of Times New Roman and I also
wanted to give it a font - style of
italic I really wanted to kind of look
like it's being whispered and it's lit
it was a little too small for my save so
we increase the size to 20 pixels
all right so it's like it and this h1
could be bigger so let's go ahead and do
font size to make it about 50px cool so
there it is there it's looking very nice
we don't have but again so we're done
with that more or less and we want to
see a man this this is this is looking a
little too jumbled for me how do I get
my image to you know have a little bit
of padding so you can just declare the
image class and in this case we're just
gonna give it an all-around padding so
that we don't have any issues on the top
or the bottom of 20 pixels so if you
apply just it like that it's gonna give
us a little more here so it gives a
little bit more maybe we can go like
maybe 25 cool it's looking pretty good
so if we've worked our way down the bot
you know let's just say this was the
body we've adjusted the h1 we've just as
a paragraph we've now we're at our
button so I I don't think I really
messed with the button I just kind of
left it alone but uh if you wanted to
change it it would be as easy as
declaring the class and going from there
let's get let's get to our div class
quotes so this was the one that needed
to be stand out a little bit more
because this is where all this is
supposed to be going and you can see
right now that's kind of the last part
all this right here looks okay
everything else is kind of looking like
trash so we want to get rid of that
trash so we're gonna do dot quotes and
how did I start it um I actually put
background color black we don't need to
worry about that but uh actually we
let's do a background - color and we'll
do great let's see how that looks okay
so there is that and then you want to
set a width to 33% because we want it to
be like a box but then it gets it does
that and it shifts it to the left so how
do we fix that
we're gonna do margin - Auto and we're
gonna put that
or margin - right excuse me
and then the auto and then margin - left
auto and I should Center it just
perfectly like that cool so what do we
want to do one had a border color and we
will say that's white and then we can
add a border - style and we'll say
that's solid so you can see right there
until we gave it the style of the color
the border color wouldn't matter and
then if you're like me you always have
to have the curved corners I'm not a big
fan of the box look at all I think I
think it's kind of the general consensus
in terms of styling so five pixels is
typically enough to just curve the
corners a little bit right here and here
so that's cool all right what did I want
to do I don't want it to be exactly on
this new quote over here huh all but
tonight and what not so we're gonna do
margin to top 20 px and that will give
us 20 pixels of space right here and
then we have it we have a little bit of
space what else can we do we can give
some padding to it you know it this is
we want a little bit of padding on top
in the bottom so we can just do padding
- we actually just put it generally
around it so because we don't want it
even though it's hello world we're gonna
change the font size on the inside and
once it expands to the size so we don't
want it to go right to the side so we
can just use general padding so we'll
just give it 20 pixels and then we want
to set it so that the height will adjust
automatically we would only know this
because we did it beforehand and they
didn't show up - well the reason for
that is because the that the it the
words and the sizes you need to set the
height to be adjusted accordingly or
else the words are gonna get too big and
it's just go outs for you it's not gonna
look good at all and then finally we
just want to set the color to white
and now we have white text the white
font and I think we're okay not having
the background color gray I think I
don't think I like the black better it's
much more clean so this was our CSS not
that oh I'm sorry I forgot the we also
have to a spam class quote in this vent
class author so in my case we're not
gonna see it quite oh we will actually
so let's say dot quotes is when it
actually probably a bad name to have one
name quotes and one name quote in this
case all I did was I changed the font to
the size 30 PX hello world the world and
we could probably change the text at
Times New Roman but let's do that now
ideally we'd probably want to add this
just to the body and then everything in
the body which have the font Times New
Roman so there we go
so I'll make our life a little bit
easier so everything's got time sitting
around we don't have to add it to
everything so we add a font size of 30
pixels and then we want to do the one
for the author and we can go ahead and
go dot author and then we'll all I did
for it here was I gave it a font size of
20 pixels and now we have a font - air
font - style was that what it was
yeah font - style and I made this italic
as well so you can see pound - the world
should be capitalized okay
so let's save it so let's take a look we
have our we have our styling
everything's kind of looking good it
looks like a so this is clickable but
it's not doing anything so the next step
that we're gonna be working with is the
JavaScript and jQuery and we're going to
basically say when you click this choose
a random quote and we're gonna dive into
that next
