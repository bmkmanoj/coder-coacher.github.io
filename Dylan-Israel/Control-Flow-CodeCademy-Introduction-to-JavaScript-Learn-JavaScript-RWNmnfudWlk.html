back in free code camp ancient excuse me
code Kadim II entry sometimes you go on
autopilot man its introduction to
JavaScript we're in the control flow
section control flow now what is control
flow when we're talking about
programming it's gonna be if statements
else statements things that are
basically basically gonna lead our code
left lead our code right or lead us down
various paths of success or failure so
that's a probably the easiest way to is
to take a look at some examples and go
ahead and do it you'll see on the right
here saying if this statement is true
print out finding coffee else keep on
keepin on meaning if it if this
statement is false or if this variable
is false go ahead and do the false
statement if it's true do the true
statement so we're gonna go ahead and
create a variable here called Harry
Potter fan which I'm going to assume is
true cuz which one of us is not a Harry
Potter fan now what we're gonna do here
is say if Harry Potter fan now bite is
not actually setting this value it's
just checking if it's true by default
we're going to see if that's true do
this then we want a console dot log
mischief managed
else so this is going to be for our the
else statement is going to be for when
it is false or if it is false we want to
go ahead and put a console dot log I
lead
muggles so you'll see right here cuz
we're trying to put this this extra
quotation we need to put a a backslash
into it like so so that the so that the
the IDE is just saw our JavaScript knows
that this is a quotation within a
sentence rather than a quotation
denoting a new creation of a string if
quotes are very important another way of
doing this is we could use double quotes
on the outside and seeing a single
single quote on the inside and that
would work as well
let's go ahead and run this so we should
get mischief managed which we do right
here so this is true so therefore it it
puts out the true statement now we can
go ahead and change this to false and we
would see I lead a Google's life our
muggles life so when dealing with our
if-else statements we're not always
checking just a straight true or false
value sometimes we'll have to compare
some things and that's when we're gonna
use a less than greater than less than
or equal to greater than or equal to and
that will return a true or false value
within our if statement and from there
we'll will do our our code so we're
gonna go ahead and create a variable
called hunger level we're gonna set this
equal to five now we're say if hunger
level
is greater than seven we want to console
dot log time to eat so is this me it's
saying look compare this whatever the
value of this is to this and if it
returns true do this if it doesn't do
nothing so we're gonna go ahead and
change that do nothing to do something
our else statement saying if that
statements false do this and we just
want to go ahead and console.log let's
eat later and again we're gonna be doing
the forward slash gonna run that run it
once you'll see right here that it's
gonna say let's eat later not that
hungry but now we're gonna go ahead and
change the hunger level to ten so that
we can see that our code works you'll
see right now
it displays time to eat cuz now this
evaluates the true so we're only we're
only doing one of them where while
you're doing an F or else statement so
don't forget that in the way that we're
setting it up right now so we're gonna
go ahead and create a variable here
called moon phase and we're gonna set it
equal to a string with the contents of
full
now I'm just going to run that
so we're gonna go ahead and write it an
if statement this says if moon face is
equal to this string we want it mm-hmm
we want to console dot log out some
stuff what is it that we want to lock it
logging out we want to log out how with
four WS and three L's and two
exclamation points but if it's not equal
to full or in our else statement we want
to call us about log I swear I am NOT a
werewolf so this basically is just
saying that this is evaluating the true
because we're checking the value of this
and we're check it returns full now it
looks like we're going to go ahead and
get a little more complicated real quick
so if the moon is mostly full log arms
legs are getting hairier okay so we're
gonna do a different statement
we're gonna use a new new control
control flow element called elsif so
else if only runs is the the
if-statement before it fails so once we
hit a true statement even we have a
hundred else if it's not going to go
through the rest of the hundred else if
statements because we already had our
true statement and it breaks so let's go
ahead and continue on so if the moon is
mostly full so we're gonna do an else F
here just else--if else--if the moon
face is equal equal to mostly full we
want to say console dot console log
arms legs are getting hairier that's a
very detailed the moon is mostly new so
we'll do another elsif here and we want
that to say so if the mean face is
mostly new I'm gonna go ahead and output
back on two feet
and then if someone enters an invalid
moon phase make sure it's gonna run this
first I think it wants us change sell
sooner right else if statement for if
they would face is mostly now I did so
we have full mostly full mostly mail
else
mostly now down to feet
let's see what happens when you change
this to mostly due back on two feet
mm-hmm
so I think our last statement here it
needs to be invalid moonface I think
that's where it's breaking interesting
so somehow our logic I don't think our
logics breaking I just think so that's
weird going on here it's one of those
things with ID e is being weird so let's
go ahead and see what we're doing here
so this is good so we have my own face
at house Elsa mostly full oh it wants us
to use triple equals here so the
difference between double equals and
triples equals is double equals checks
the value for instance let's say we have
a string with the digit 5 into it and
then the triple equals we'll check the
valid and double equals would return
true for comparing those and a triple
equals will not only check the value but
it will also check the data type so if
you have the string five and a number
five and use double equals it will
return true however you if you have a
string five and number five you use
triple equals because it's checking the
data type and the value will return
false and it looks like that's what they
want us to do here there we go so we
want to go ahead and set the moon phases
to mostly mostly she's been mostly full
so let's go ahead and change this real
quick and then we want to change this
mostly new and now we want to set moon
face equal to a solar eclipse since
there's not a statement issued returning
invalid moon face which it will very
cool
let's continue on here alright so now
we're gonna kick up our if statements
else if statements up a bit so let's go
ahead and create a new variable called
foggy night and it looks like we're
gonna set this equal to a boolean of
true it's gonna run this the next thing
that we're gonna do is is start adding
and conditions or or conditions now in
an AM condition it's all the conditions
connected with the and must be true if
one of them fails they all fail and the
statement is false now an or condition
if any of the statements are true it
passes and it's true so we could have a
hundred ORS and a single if statement
and if just one out of the hundred it's
true that statements gonna pass so what
is it then the first condition is to
make sure that moon phase U equal to
full and foggy night is equal equal to
true so this is a hand condition it's
gonna run that so just the one condition
do you set the moon face to full I did
not so it's gonna set this to full so
this is gonna howl out because this is
true and this is full so we're gonna go
ahead and change this to false and now
that will fail so we're gonna invalid
moon face cuz we don't have a full in it
else if statement you can also put a
knot in front of in front of this this
would be not equal to true it'll check
for that and we have our condition as
well we'll probably dive into that in
the next section here
so it looks like we're gonna be doing
switch statements switch statements are
used when you know what the values gonna
be it's say you're gonna have a switch
which is gonna check a value and then a
case which is going to say look if that
value is any one of these things go
ahead and do this sometime in it in our
example or even go ahead and log out the
value log some stuff out or it may rent
some code it really just depends on what
we're doing switch statements are really
great when you have a lot of things that
you're checking that you're just
checking that what the value is so let's
go ahead and convert our werewolf
program to a switch statement for now
let's also delete foggy night so we'll
get rid of that and then face will be
the condition for the same so give me a
second I always forget yeah switch so
we're gonna start off with a switch here
and what are we switching on we're
switching on the moon phase this is
basically the variable that we'll be
checking for our cases so we have let's
see we have full mostly full mostly new
so we're gonna have a case here of the
value so the first one's gonna be full
we want to go ahead and take this
console dialogue and throw it in here
now with switch statements you need to
make sure to break the statement as well
so that's something that you're gonna
have to do in switch statements then we
have a case here of mostly full so if
our if our moon phase is mostly full
let's go ahead and do some stuff as well
and what are we going to do we want to
say our arms and legs are getting
hairier and then again you're gonna have
to break the statement and then we're
gonna say mostly now and back onto feet
here
now where's the case is going to be
mostly new so if our if our moonface is
mostly mean we want to do this and then
we're gonna break that and then similar
to our else statement we have a similar
to this we need to have a default
statement that's basically our else our
if all else fails go with the default
here
I'm gonna go default I need to break
that as well
I believe me break this so that's how a
switch statement works you have one
value that you're checking and then for
each case is basically an if statement
if it's this value do some stuff you
break it and then your default is the
kind of the hell statement if all else
fails do the default so we're gonna be
using the math library we're gonna
create a variable so called random
number we're gonna set it equal to a
random number between 0 and 100 so if we
call the math library and then a random
then we times it by 100 this will
generate a number between 0 and 100 math
dot random by default generates a random
number between 0 and 1 and then when we
multiply that number by a hundred it
goes between 0 and 100 we also need to
go ahead and console dot log that out
so you'll see right now we're logging
out a random number now we don't want
these decimal places so we're gonna use
another part of the math library and
that's the floor function and when we
call map thought floor it will allow us
to eliminate a set amount of numbers for
math tough us will eliminate some of the
it will allow us to eliminate decimal
places what I'm trying to say and you
can also it takes in a parameter so if
we wanted to go ahead and change that so
that we wanted it to be to the second
decimal place or anything like that you
could do that with math the floor as
well it looks like they just want a
whole number in this case so that was
our control flow what did we learn from
this we learned if and else statements
if true do this if false do this we
learned how to how they it's kind of
related switch statements as well check
the value then check the cases and then
the default is kind of like that else we
also learned the comparison operators
less than greater than less than or
equal to greater than or equal to we
learn the logical operators which is and
or not equals
well we'd actually use them not equals
but it's basically it's checking to see
if it's the opposite of something if
it's not true not equal to true would be
checking if it's false we also learned
how to generate a random number using
math dot random and how to get rid of
decimal places using math dot floor a
lot of stuff in here a lot of the core
building blocks of JavaScript so
