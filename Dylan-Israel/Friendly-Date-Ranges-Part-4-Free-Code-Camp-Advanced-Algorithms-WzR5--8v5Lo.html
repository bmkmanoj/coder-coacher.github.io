date ranges back and free code camp also
so what are we trying to do in these
next two cases well one we're trying to
do it when it's a year ahead or at least
a year ahead and the months are the same
we want to format it like this so how
can we do that we used to an else if
statement right here actually we're
going to do it above this so remember
this checks if they're in the same month
we want to check we want to kind of do
it for most complex the least complex so
we knock them out because they're going
to kind of borrow some of the same
checks so we're gonna do elsif here this
is look if these dates are the same so
let's start with that meaning if the
months are the same and the years date
to 0-8 10 meanie the result of the years
is greater than or equal to 1 meaning
that there's at least a year gap we want
to return date array and we haven't
added or formatted data right yet let's
go ahead and make sure we're getting the
correct thing and nothing broke very
cool so it looks like our logic is sound
here might as well if say month but
different years so put a little comment
in there so we have to to format this it
looks like we need the month the day and
the year all right I think we have that
somewhere I believe this is it month day
in here let's go ahead and see what
happens now sep tember 25th 26 second
alright cool i'll wave to do next is
output the sep tember fourth it's going
date or 80 foot
and we can go ahead and take out all
this change the values here we're going
to push the month shower 5026 very cool
so there we go now our last case that
we're checking is make friendly dates
2022 so these are the exact same day but
different day on the year and they want
us to display it a certain way all right
so let's go ahead and take this and make
sure that we're calling it so we can
check as we go along too so right now
it's formatting it so it is passing one
of these else if statements so we're
going to do it right above this because
same month but different years that
which this is what it's formatting it as
what we want is same month same day but
different years so we're going to do an
else if that's going to say look is date
one meaning the month exactly equal to
the months of day two and is date too
index2 exactly equal to date 1 and x 2
are the days equal and when we take date
tues year and we subtract date ones here
is this greater than or equal to 1
meaning has a year pass return date
array let's go ahead and run that so we
should get an empty right cool now all
we have to do now is format it to the
way they want it so I believe we can
just go ahead and copy this let's jump
down to here we want to put the month
name followed by the day change plus a
comma plus date one let's make sure run
it September fifth 2022 without knowing
it looks like I perhaps click the wrong
line of code enter in it it's been known
to happen so what we're trying to do
here is simply output right here at same
month same day but different years sorry
about that and we want to output we're
actually going to type this up date
array dot push month names what do we
want to push out for month nice we won't
put out push out date to index one and
then we want to concatenate that and we
want to put so we put the space then we
want to put day change
and on here i want to put date one all
right date to excuse me index two and
then we want to put a comma and a space
now we're going to put date to index
zero and return the year let's go ahead
and run that and I believe we should be
done oh my god we did it we did it yeah
yeah all right guys it's been a couple
rough videos um it's a lot of code going
on here maybe I'll do a review video how
to make your code better but this should
get you a core understanding of kind of
solve it in your own way definitely some
stuff we could have proved upon but we
did it boys we did it keep struggling
through it and eventually you'll do it
too if you haven't done it already as
always guys thank you to everyone
