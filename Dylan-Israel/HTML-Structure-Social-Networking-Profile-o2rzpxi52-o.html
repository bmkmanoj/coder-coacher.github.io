HTML structures and using list social
networking profile this is last section
had gone through uh so after this will
stop resending the code but you see
we're going to be linking all stuff that
we did before together what's so
complicated just right here but it
really isn't so let's get started so
it's going to ask us to put a title and
we're going to say social networking
profiles and then put picture yourself
or anything alike between the body and
body tags if you can't think of a good
picture we can use this ninja all right
just save a little bit times go ahead
and use this ninja so let's try and
remember mhm SRC equals and round foot
the end / so there is our ninja alright
so create paragraph below your picture
that mentions your age in our hometown
don't get too carried away we'll get
your interest favorite things okay so in
the body below the picture yeah we're
going to create a paragraph remember the
P and the NP and say my name is Taiwan
we're done I'm a male frigate sup
alright so they're young so the only
time so picking a topic you like
you should include at least four alright
so wants us to create an unordered list
all right so um I've been doing a lot of
gaming stuff so much will keep with it
my favorite my favorite games yeah we're
unordered list yeah and so then we
create the /l here and then in hair will
create l mode and what's just simply
release for you can go one by one or
sometimes i just prefer to type out the
HTML ahead of time so i make sure for
all the texts it's in there and starts
confusing things up that you have at
least have your code in the correct boss
so my current favorite games 3 11 um by
the car stone I'm not putting around
there um sir playing final fantasy
settlement so like maybe two months ago
is that was cool um playing boom beach
on my phone made by people make clash
plants and uh 2048 I guess mobile games
this is a really bad list but uh we'll
keep it going for what it is right now
so cool so our thing is increasing so
next it wants us to go nuts it's a list
of lists the only requirement so you
have at least one unordered list 11
ordered list want unordered list so this
is our
unordered list so now let's create an
ordered list so unordered now let's go
to ordered very well and with three
interests extras gonna say so maybe one
game up so let's see here and we'll say
say well favorite class subjects will
say HTML let's say this enough I'll want
to unordered list inside your go nuts
list the only repressor you have at
least one ordered list and one unordered
list
all right and maybe we have to create
another UL here so just copy and paste
this and we'll change this to cities and
we'll say la new york austin and also so
they get city SE portland so let's see
what we're getting stuck on memory
unordered list work like this so we have
our ul and rol i'll list will then list
so it wants us to do you will hella
interest
save us some time here all right so
there we going to make sure you have at
least one on unordered list inside
beuliss okay so we're going to switch
this up right now really wants us to do
someone order this we have on our least
favorite class subjects and I will do
will do another UL pure science mammal
to see if that works all right now we
need one ordered list in our stuff so
we're actually going to get rid of that
and then in here will be hello should
see this you see how it's indented Bam
Bam and we should be good to go thing so
a little bit confusion there for the on
all we did just fine so spice up your
profile different fonts sizes and colors
you can do any combination like as long
as you use some say so we'll just do
this style equals aunt x 20 PS and we'll
do this style equals cuddling with what
you read and then we'll do with style
equals 0 dash family over aerial then
we'll save the submit and bam you can
see slowly changed our stuff a little
bit there
how many uses up to misuse it looks
strong and released once so let's go
ahead and use strong here because it is
going to be the main ordered list title
I guess so that would make sense and
then we'll use em here for whatever
reason so italicized and don't forget to
close it BAM so let's go ahead and take
a full screen look at what we have here
so we have our image we have a just
quick paragraph in our header i believe
and then we start a list this is an
order inning see that we alternate with
some styling and then we made this bold
we made this italicize and these are all
stacked lists so let's see what's going
on in the next course have to offer HTML
3 HTML basics three so um so far we've
learned how to set up the skeleton will
nicer stuff but it looks like we're just
gonna be taken to the next level so next
video will get a little more in depth a
little more complicated and we'll start
using table divs and spans so i'll see
you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
