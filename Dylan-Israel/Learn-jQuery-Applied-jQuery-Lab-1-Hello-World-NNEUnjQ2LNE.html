some doing something a little bit
different I really loved the jQuery
course and I makes me want to get more
involved in web development so i ordered
a I didn't order I went to a bookstore
when I was visiting my brother in
Portland at some books dark old pals or
I don't remember but I did basically
their first introductory lap and so
every is I really like this book it's
only 200 in like 50 pages it's all in
color the pages are real nice and that's
kind of why I got it all those I don't
want a 700-page book so it's called
applied jquery development design by jay
jay blanchard if you're interested in
going along with me but what we're
basically going to do is create a hello
world app that also uses a click event
that adds some subtext basically it's
going to say hello again hello again and
once we have a third or fourth one well
we're going to be able to that I mute
I'm using eclipse to do this and the way
we're going to test it in the browser is
simply by having our file paths so make
sure you have the correct file path to
where your HTML file is to test it
there's ways of setting up in the
browser but that will be for a different
video so if you're unfamiliar with the
clips the way you're going to want to do
is go file new JavaScript project you're
going to want to name your project and
then just click finish and then you're
going to want to add your files so you
could do it this way go to other and
then web HTML file and go file new
JavaScript source file and you then for
CSS you just go new file and then dot
CSS so as you can see we don't have any
CSS and we don't have any JavaScript all
we have is our basic hello world here
hello world dash jquery style is the
title that's basically the title of the
page you can see up at the top here what
we also have here are telling it what
scripts to run so this is a text in
JavaScript and this is a link to the
jQuery library that we're using there's
other links for a bigger library but
this one should do just fine and then
this is our link this is our script link
to the right here there's nothing in it
but we need that for it to work and then
this is just our link to the style sheet
so now that we're all in the same page
there's a couple things we're going to
do we're going to have two divs and a
span and they're each going to have a
different point so try to remember back
we're going to name this first div we're
going to do pound first just first
excuse me and the goal here is to write
as as little code as we can in this div
so what do we want our first div to do
in our script jss we need to get our
document ready else nothing's going to
work so try and remember if not just
follow along we have document dot ready
and I i will I've already completed this
so it's kind of a little bit easier for
me but I'm also looking at my notes as I
go along so it's I'll try to do this
quickly and explain as we go along so
this function is basically just saying
hey do some stuff in here and you're
going to have to initialize that so we
haven't done anything so what do we
first want to do we want to actually
just have it right something to the div
so we need to select the div first and
we want to say dot append we're staying
in here do some stuff um just to show
you that remind you that you can
actually put HTML elements in here we'll
put a hello world hello world will do
world capitalized from the YouTube the
YouTube and don't forget you have to
close it like you would any other thing
so we up first there's our first
appending so let's go ahead and you see
we don't have anything here when we
refresh it hello world from the YouTube
maybe not the best grammar but
hey is there an exclamation point on it
so it seems to be working it's always
good to do a quick test see what's going
on here so what do we want to do next we
want to we want to create a link so
we're going to be doing a second div and
actually we don't need to do that let's
do this first so we want to create a
link and we're going to just say click
mean we want it be intuitive or its a
href equals and this we don't want to
actually leave the page so just put an
ampere sent or a pound sign or hashtag
is too young in the selection call it
now it is and we're just going to name
that link you can name it whatever you
want and it's going to say click me ! ok
so our a channel is going good now check
our work one more time shoulds have
click me there it is perfect everything
is looking good and what do we want to
do with this we want it to print
something out so we are going to select
that link but because we're calling an
event handler on it like a dot click and
we wanted to do something it needs to be
a function as well so we're going to
exactly like our document dot ready
except it's with our link and we're
saying when it's when you click click me
it's going to run a function that we're
going to define right now offer your
silicones so in here we want it to do
something so what do we want to do first
thing we want to do is have something
called greeting we're going to create
another div actually we use a span here
so that's what I did last time so we'll
create a span and we'll give it an ID ID
of hello
so hello again so this is our span ID
hello again so in here we're going to
say select our span which is pound hello
pound hello again and what do we want to
we want to append the hello again
basically we just want to say hello
again one work for every time it hits it
we want it to say hello again one more
time so hello comma again that's it
that's all we want to do right now so
let's sit and make sure we save let's
make sure everything is working click me
and oops so something broke so let's
look at our code
and we also wanted to make these in h1
element as well / h 1 so what do we do
we clicked our link we selected the link
on the function said pound
hmm
I think we may oh I think we let's try
this is how they did in the book and see
if the sizing effect so I think perhaps
we might need a place to put our span
I'm not one hundred percent sure but
let's just roll with it for now like all
things it's sometimes you got to test it
out all right so that's what's going on
there so you can see right there we can
infinitely add it and when we refresh it
should go back so the span can't be by
itself is what it looks like so
everything is working properly so far so
what else do we want to do we don't want
it to add infinitely and so we're going
to use a little bit of logic but before
we do that why don't we style it a bit
just to see what we're working with so
so far we have h ones and we have a tags
and we have a 10 HTML so let's just give
the whole document so HTML and we'll
just give it a background color of black
so background dash color and black all
right and what else do you want to do we
let's change the we can change our
anchor tag to be a little bit it's a
little bit small compared to everything
else so we'll give it a will say font
Josh size will say 35 PX and which is
probably around what each one is and
then why don't we change because we're
getting the background to color will
will do h1 and then we'll do color red
so save that let's see if our codes
working nicely refresh okay so it's not
working why isn't it working all right
so we have this named improperly let's
see if it works now there we go so you
see it's working it's looking a little
bit cleaner we have a different
background color we're not going for
professional we're just messing around
with things so
we don't want it to go on forever so
let's use a simple count so when we
start this function we want to create a
count variable and we're going to
account equal to zero because when you
load the page you haven't clicked
anything in and that's what we're
keeping track of how many times have you
clicked so there's couple things we
could do we can do if count is less than
let's just say three three times is
probably enough to say hello because
you're going to say hello once then
you're gonna say hello again twice we
want to run this loop and then if we
just want to say one last thing like if
count is equal equal to three we just
want to print one more thing that says
it's just going to say something
different like what did I put last time
I put hello three times is enough
alright so
so let's save that and it looks like we
are done with what we came to do so
click me hello again hello again hello
again hello again up so our code isn't
working oh and the reason because is we
didn't ink increase count each time this
happens so what we want to do is say
count + + and I should do it just fine
actually I this is easier for people to
understand we aren't familiar with
coming so we'll do count plus one so
count is equal to count plus one so
let's go back to our browser refresh it
Bam Bam and then hello 320 so we have an
air here so there's a couple things we
can do the easiest is probably just
increment count again one last time but
we want to do it right here and that
should that should kill it soaps so now
we just put we put the where we counted
it once there so now it works fine we
refresh it it goes again so we did a
little bit of CSS we did a little bit of
HTML and we basically created our first
jquery dynamic web app so it wasn't too
bad and if you have any questions
comments or concerns the lab is
basically this is just a little bit
souped up from the hello world they did
I added this last part here and i'll be
doing the labs and jquery as we go along
and they're going to be getting harder
and harder so this is introductory one
the code will be on my github and as
always questions comments concerns and
anything else is appreciated and I'll if
you go to my website I'll actually have
a quick lab write-up for this and the
link will be down below and that way if
you don't want to watch if you want to
have like a checklist of what you can do
this is a good thing to do as well all
right but anyhow guys thanks for
watching and I appreciate the support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
