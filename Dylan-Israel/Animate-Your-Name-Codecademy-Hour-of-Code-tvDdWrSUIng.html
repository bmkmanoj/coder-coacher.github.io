of our the code which is coming up in
about a week we're back at codecademy
we're going to be doing some of their
past hour of code challenges so first
one we're going to do is animate your
name so this is kind of going to be a
brief sort of introduction to
programming program I've done these
before just for fun and I didn't do the
video form but considering our code is
going up I encourage everyone to
volunteer if they have the time do it as
well but uh this is basically what we're
going to make real quick so this is
using javascript and probably a bit of
HTML somewhere so you can see right here
it's just kind of it goes crazy and we
can sorry i forgot i don't need the
headset anymore but what are what's
going on here so we have a variable my
name and then we have some some colors
that we're setting up using the RGB an
array list of RGB and then letter colors
and then we're calling on the draw name
function which we don't see here but
apparently we have access to let's go
ahead and just get started so instead of
writing write your name within quotes
like this so I resets code so originally
said Codecademy so let's go ahead and do
some selfless promotion and put good
coating tutorials 360 that might be a
little bit too much so we'll just put CT
360 counterterrorism 360 cool and we
didn't really change anything else here
so let's go ahead and move on so we want
to we're going to start from the
beginning so document dot write and then
what are we put in here we're going to
be boops excuse me guys we are going to
be putting our
which still Dylan last I can remember
and now what do we want to do so what is
the length your name so now we're going
to be looking at how can we get the
length of my five letter five letter
word here Dylan so in this case we can
just call on we can do it a go two coats
like it so we can say Dylan dot length
so I'm going to submit it's going to
return back five what you can also do
here in these document de right dot
right to not only you evaluate strings
to come out but we can also put numbers
for instance and instead of printing one
plus one it's going to print out too now
if we wanted to print out one plus one
for whatever reason we would need to do
that in quotations but that's not what
we're asked to do here Oh multiply two
really big numbers oh excuse me so we'll
say four times four it's going to return
16 first write the string i'm coding
like a champ let's go and reset that all
right so we're going to write a string
remember against a string we use
quotation marks to let the computer know
its work because the computer stupid it
only understands instructions and if
there's a mistake it can understand how
to fix it so we're going to write i'm
coding like a champ cool then find the
length of the string like you did here
then Perry strings like see if it's
greater than 10 so
coming like a champ dot length great his
hand okay so they wanted to see this is
length of the string greater than 10 and
that should return true so we're
evaluating this is the strings length
greater than 10 and if it is returned to
cool and we have let's go on air
okay so I got a looking for you so we're
back to the beginning right here so now
we're going to actually be using the
draw name function so Dylan but it's not
looking all that spicy so now we want to
add the color blue so your computer will
know certain words in this case blue is
one of them all your basic colors blue
red orange green stuff like that so in
this case we're going to again switch
out the name name of dylan and then we
also wanted to set some colors here so
above us these are RGB so this is zero
so I forget how it goes 0 red green blue
0 100 I think these are to be stuff that
they were passing it but let's go ahead
and just get started on line 8 we're
gonna declare set my name equal to your
name again when you create a name so we
need to create an array called letters
colors and we're going to set it equal
to and remember they set in an array so
we're just an equal red orange green and
then of course we end it with the
semicolon to let it know that we're done
let's see if that's I'm just like there
it is so make sure you have the correct
spelling of your words as I often don't
okay so in this case we want to change
the shape of the bubbles from circles
the square so online 8ad bubble shape
okay is equal to square and let's see we
probably have to declare that ooh I
don't know about all that I kind of like
the circle better all right now we're
going to be working with if an else
statement so if you're not familiar with
it and bring a very quick run down a
half if else statements an if statement
says if this is true do this else do
this so let's say I owe you five dollars
Dylan do you have five dollars no so
let's say that's false cuz I'll have
five dollars to give to you so your else
you don't get paid your money back but
if I do have five dollars I'll probably
give you your money back but it's just
supposed to be an infernal statement
think about a quarter flipping if it
does this cool if this is true do this
else it's always going to be false it's
always going to be tails that's kind of
a way to look at it and its most
simplest form alright so delete I said
delete this square cuz we wanted to look
good and not bad basically replace it
with an if-else statement alright so if
evaluate here else evaluate he'll cool
used to the house on your own imagine a
robot walking now if so if
okay they just wanna if true bulb shape
is equal to again make sure your case is
correct while the shape is equal to
circle else bubble shape is equal to
square so you can see right here because
we put it's true it's going to work
because we just hard coded in so that if
Sam is going to be true we could have
also done something like if 10 is
greater than three if you wanted
something a little bit more logical add
the function bounce name as the last
line of your program after drawing so
they have a function called bounce name
that they have written or it's already
built in and what it's going to do is
I'll we're doing is calling it here and
now you can see right now it's it's it's
shaking it it's dropping it like it's
hot as the kids would say perhaps all
right replacement bounce thing with
bounce bubble so we have a something
called bounce bubbles and it's probably
going to this is a good example of
naming convention so what does bounce
bubble do probably exactly what we think
it does since we've already been playing
around with this nice and that's it I
mean this is how easy it was to do again
we could change this to a lot it we
could modify this in our own ways so I
hope you enjoyed this hour of code
animate your name section no I stumbled
a little bit but it's uh yeah that's all
part of learning give your mind woken up
and getting going so I hope you enjoyed
it I hope you volunteer for our code
like I am go our co.org or our code calm
and volunteer if you can to help out
those who are less fortunate and you
maybe help just kind of getting their
foot started and coke Adam is a great
place to do that and that's
I actually really like this site so i'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
