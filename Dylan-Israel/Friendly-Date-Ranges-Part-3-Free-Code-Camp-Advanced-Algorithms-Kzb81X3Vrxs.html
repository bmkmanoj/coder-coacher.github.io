back in the date friendly date ranges so
we're going to do a if statement
basically what's going on in this is if
they have separate and if they have
separate months but are in the same year
that's what this case is and we want to
format it a certain way so the way I did
it was I simply put another if statement
and I made this an else if and this an
if statement and I said look if if the
months are greater than one when we
subtract a meaning if they're not in the
same month so if date to 1 minus date
day 11 is greater than or equal to 1 and
a 2 year minus date to the day 1 year is
exactly equal 0 meaning that they're the
same year do this so let's go ahead and
make sure that's working by returning an
empty array it should go a Rick data
race should be empty for and when we run
and will know that it works cool so our
logic is sound this is the only one
that's running so now it's just a matter
of formatting the data properly so just
to explain this because this is going to
be the main point is because we're
checking in the same year the number in
the following month so October and then
December December will always be greater
than October so when we subtract them as
long as it's greater or equal than one
meaning that as long as we're in the
same year and the month following it is
larger this is what this is how we're
going to format the data
so here we're just going to take our
data wreck and we're going to push out
the first value now what does it want it
wants the month the day and the year now
if i remember correctly we already have
this part so this is month and day it's
going to month and day and then we just
have to add the year so that was a space
or where they do a comma then a space
plus the year which is date one index
zero let's go ahead and make sure our
codes working as we want it to there's
march first 2017 march first 2017 cool
after that we can go ahead and just copy
this and take off date two and change
the index values so all work all we're
going to do here is add the month and
the day and we just have to change the
values here target the second index and
there we go pretty straightforward up
next we have a see if the dates are
exactly equal so we can do an if
statement here for that and we can also
make this an else if so if so do if date
10 is exactly equal to date 20
we are going to go ahead and log that
out so we uh so that we're basically are
the years the same and now we're going
to an interest a time copy and paste to
change this and are the months the same
so I and are the months the same and are
the days the same so these are the exact
same date so in this case let's go ahead
and return date array which should be
empty we have to change what did it
change our our call here go down to the
bottom change our call so my colon so
assuming are so there's our empty array
ok cool our logic is sound so we think
and all we have to do is take our gate
array and push out to it the new value
or the formatted value so we have our
month names and then we're going to take
date one and then here where r month is
index one and we're going to go ahead
and add that plus the
plus de change and we are going to
format the date so we have date day one
on the day and then we're going to go
ahead and have the arrow oops here we're
going to do the comma space let's date
one and then index 0 is the year and
let's go ahead and see if that fixes
what we're looking for BAM ah there it
is so up next we'll hopefully be able to
finish these next two in the next video
