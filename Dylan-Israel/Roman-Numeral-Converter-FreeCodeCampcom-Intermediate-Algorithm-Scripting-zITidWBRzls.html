intermediate algorithm scripting bonfire
Roman numeral converter and this is by
far I've kind of I kind of worked my way
through this one is I've even done it in
Java and I remember struggling with it
back then so if you struggled with this
it's okay man just keep keep trucking
forward I kind of did the same thing I
had to go online to find some solutions
and you know compare it dive pull up my
old Java one and so anyhow uh the
solution I can't really take full credit
for it I got it off of like Stack
Overflow and other people's examples but
the important thing is I understand how
they got there so let's slowly work our
way through here so what we're going to
do is just create a blanket variable
that we're going that's going to be our
Roman numeral and so that we're gonna
return so we'll just say a Roman numeral
and we'll set that equal to an empty
string for the time being so the next
thing we need to do is create two arrays
one for the Roman numeral values and
another one that's going to be the whole
integer values of the Roman numerals so
let's create a let's just rename this
Roman so let's create another variable
here little storm create an array in
this case and let me zoom in a little
bit I've been trying to zoom in a lot
more for these videos per request so
we'll say we'll create a an array called
Roman numeral so in this case in this
array we are gonna be storing from Roman
numerals go all the way up to a thousand
and we're gonna that's M so we're just
gonna start at the high point and work
our way down and it'll become evident
later on why we do it this way instead
of this starting from the smallest and
work on the way back so the next one is
CM and that's 900 C is 100 M is a
thousand and then we have D and then we
have C D so these are the the cases
where you have one right before like the
IV is four
setup fee is 5 and the 3i so the root
that's why we have to do it like this
then we have C then we have X C then we
have L and then we have X L then we have
X and now we should have 4i IX and
finally we have right here after IX we
should have V right so 5 and finally
we're at 4 and finally last but not
least we're at 1 for their cynical so
those are our room and no new Roman
numerals from 1000 is to 1 and now we're
going to create a in array then in their
case it is going to be their
counterparts so we'll just save our
numbers are equal to and then we'll just
work our way down we have a thousand we
have 900 we have 500 we have 400 190 50
40 10 no I'm just 9 comma 5 comma 4
comma 1
so we have our equivalent numbers array
now what are we gonna do for this so we
have to do a for loop that iterates
through the numbers and then a while
loop what's in it that's saying while
our inputted number is greater than our
array of numbers the index event so if
it's greater than this greater than a
thousand do some stuff and that self is
we're gonna add to the Roman numeral
string and then we're gonna subtract
that number from from from our original
number so that's all so let's say it'll
make more sense once we get it all out
and we put some comments in there so in
this case we're gonna start off as a
typical for loop we're gonna say we're
gonna do this while I is less
then our numbers dot length increment I
so next we're gonna say wow our original
number because we haven't even touched
our original number is greater than or
equal to our numbers oops
numbers array I what we want to do some
stuff what is it the stuff that we want
to do in our case we want to take our
Roman numeral we want to set it equal to
Roman Roman plus Roman numeral I so if
it is and it's only going to do it each
iteration so if it's so it's just a l
and then we have to decrease our while
loop will never ends and then we'll just
set our number is equal to the the
numbers i num so our number - no my
there we go I'm just gonna run that so
returns zero so let's check everything
and in this case we want to return Roman
so that might be what what's not working
there there we go so a lot of code I
struggled with I spend about two hours
trying to figure this out finally I
asked for help and I even looking over
my old code that kind of helped trigger
it but what are we doing here so let's
let's let's see what's going on here so
in this case empty create an empty
string then we create a array of
possible RNs we'll put our inframan
numeral up to 1000 here create an array
of possible possible number values here
we iterate through our numbers iterate
for a length of our numbers array and
then here wall original number is larger
than our inputted numbers array
I shouldn't do it like that but uh okay
why it's larger than our original
numbers array so let's say this is ten
and why it's larger than any of this so
I would start here and then it would you
know we'd minus one from the numbers add
its equivalent and that's why we go
through each one of these so whatever
the I value is when we work our way down
like this so if we start at a am this
equivalent is right here so we are going
to add the equivalent Roman numeral to
our original empty string and then we're
finally going to subtract the value from
original number to n while loop then we
return it so that was kind of this
convert into Roman numerals and again if
you struggled with it I don't blame you
they offered a lot of index of splice
and join use any of that so there's
probably a better way of doing it this
was the best solution I was able to find
and I was struggling with it
so I hope I hope you found it helpful
again you can see right here I have
about eight comments about one for every
line of code and this is really gonna
help kind of solidify okay maybe I
didn't completely come up with this
option on my own and that's a fair
statement but I at least understand how
this is working and I think I could get
back to where it was so I hope you found
this helpful as always comments
