gonna be interviewing someone a very
special on who I'm a huge fan of Quincy
Larson from free code camp who's the
creator and founder of free code camp
calm he also has a very popular tech
blog on medium it's actually number one
in Tekken number eleven on the entire
website so he's killing it over there
very interesting guy I always enjoy
talking to him we're gonna be covering a
lot of things we're gonna be talking
about internships specifically for high
school students and those in college
we're going to be talking about code
coding boot camps and college CS degrees
we're also going to be ticket we took a
subscriber questions at the end so we're
talking about the Udacity nano degrees
and you know the team treehouse degrees
his opinion on those and we talked about
I believe this university 42 as well so
recover a whole mess of things that a
few things I left out enjoy I had a
great time talking to him and learned a
lot I hope you guys do too so I talked
with some simple programmer about a
month back I talked to him about how to
get a how to get a programming job was
like a good portion of it and I really
um I watched your you're like um you
know how to become a better at coding
video that was on Matt's channel right
it's great and so I didn't want to I
want to kind of stray away from topics
so you kind of covered because he took
by the way which was my idea let me just
Larry tell I was like I was like yeah
I'm gonna interview Quincy about this
topic he's like psych I'm gonna do it
first right so what I what I want to
kind of cover is a get a little bit of
insight on internships and like the
younger crowd right so the people who
are in high school or maybe even younger
than that so I think that's what we're
gonna focus on along with um you know
maybe how to get a job as well just
because that's I get I get that question
a lot and I feel like you might you can
definitely share some knowledge as well
as people have been asking for timelines
and things like that like all everyone
wants those hard dates like when are you
know when is this coming out
free code camp what's it gonna be like
yeah I hate to sound like I kind of like
I don't know the answer is those will be
available when they're ready we don't we
don't practice deadlines within free
code camp or volunteer-driven
organization and I used to set like
ambitious Elon Musk style like we're
gonna make it to the moon by 2027 you
know instead of doing that what I've
found works much better when your entire
team is volunteers basically is to just
encourage people to continue to
gradually make progress building out
whatever component they're working on of
the overall platform and curriculum and
as a result things are progressing it's
just that we things are getting done
about the same rate they would normally
get without all the stress
what deadlines generally do is they just
add a whole bunch of stress and they
manage your skill like they can be
accountable to their managers and their
managers like freako camp
of course the we're all just accountable
to the campers to the community itself
so is there any anything in terms of
will be coming out soon if you can say
that like we want to tell you the the
general progression of content so we're
getting ready to ship the reactive
fighter platform which will be much
faster we have a tremendous volume of
features that are trapped on that on
that branch basically because like react
is like a complete you know blood
transfusion of the platform so we pass
wordless authentication improved user
profiles and options multi-language
options where you can basically have you
know if you if you prefer to do this
Spanish challenges in Spanish or Chinese
or some of these other languages we're
working on incorporating them and it'll
make it a lot easier for you to
contribute translations and then them
just to go live next time we push so
we're gonna gradually bit-by-bit
translate the entire free code camp
curriculum into many world language
is nice that's that's definitely helpful
because I know I look at my analytics
and about 55 percent of my audience
isn't from America so I'm sure people
will definitely appreciate that yeah I
looked at our well I looked at so the
best place to look in my opinion is
Wikipedia you look at Wikipedia right
there it's very easy to create a it's
not very easy but it's relatively easy
to create a new article on Wikipedia and
basically they have every major world
language you look at the the breakdown
of their traffic about 50 percent of all
traffic to Wikipedia is to the English
version and 50 percent is to the
longtail of other world languages let's
let's jump over to internships I was
just gonna say I don't know how it is
now but in a lot of industries the
interns actually get a lot of the major
work done and a lot of other people are
up there too busy and important of
meetings and stuff so I would imagine as
an intern you will get to work on some
good hard problems and learn a wide
range of skills and get exposure to a
lot of different things
yeah there's a guy named Jonathan Z
white who interned at Airbnb he's a
second year university student and he
has worked on all kinds of things he
would be a good guest for your show I
would recommend what would you what
would your advice to be to let's say
someone who's about 18 about to graduate
high school and they're trying to get
that internship they're trying to get a
little bit of resume experience how how
would you say they should go about that
well first of all I would strongly
recommend everybody go to university
I'll just throw this out there I think
everybody who's 18 years old should go
to a an inexpensive public university if
you're here in the u.s. because that
opens a tremendous amount of doors and
more importantly it doesn't it keeps
several doors from closing people will
like the culture is you should you
should have a college degree yes there
are plenty of developers who don't have
college degrees however
I think that if they had gotten a
university degree and done etana
internships throughout their university
studies they would be even better off
than they are now I'm not saying that
university is necessarily tremendously
useful you will learn a lot of stuff but
but it's just part of like the hiring
culture and everything and it's gonna
take look to change really even though
you can you've been able to learn
everything you wanted to learn online
for 20 years and universities are still
as big as they've ever been
right so so I would strongly encourage
everybody go to a university that they
can afford without taking a lot of debt
community colleges are great even if it
seems like kind of joking you're not
learning a lot basically treated as an
opportunity to socialize and learn a
couple things that you wouldn't have
otherwise learned because you all have
to do that through the general ed
classes then as many internships as
possible like if you could do an
internship every summer or you can even
do internships while you're you know
still carrying a basic course load you
can intern at local companies you should
definitely try to get internships at the
big prestigious companies like Facebook
is a big one I know Google offers a lot
of internships and then like Airbnb and
uber and a lot of these other newer
unicorn companies also have good
internships and a lot of them have very
strong engineering culture you can learn
a lot from yeah I know um just a side
note about internships is um hackathons
also guys I only - I hope to go to more
but at both of them that there were
companies that at the start of it said
hey we're looking for interns so if
you're you know a lot of people don't
know where to apply online or how to go
about it
a lot of times just showing up it's -
introducing yourself and say hey I can
do basic JavaScript and I'm hungry to
learn and they'll be like hi
there's minimum wage but here's the
experience that's really what you need
sometimes yeah and if people are paying
you to program even if it's you know
minimum wage or whatever I you know
to learn what you need to learn and
practice what you need to practice so
it's really a win in my opinion that
said you know you'd be amazed at how
lavish a lot of the internships you can
get are as a developer I mean people
make like sixty thousand dollars a year
the equivalent while working is maybe
seventy or eighty thousand depending on
the company working as entrance yeah
well the internet artwork II is a second
year computer science student and I
believe he's making like twenty dollars
an hour so we're gonna like twenty hours
a week and it's helping to pay for a
school but he's he's building actual web
applications and things like that so a
lot of valuable experience and again
like there are so many employers
everybody's experience is gonna be a
little bit different but if you can get
an internship at one of the more prized
companies then I can pretty much
guarantee that you'll be learning a ton
the entire time and you know like I
think Facebook and Google like actually
hire some other interns so it can
basically be a fast track to a to a job
at a good tech company now I think it's
only like one in five people that
interns there actually get tired but
still it's a lot better than just
sending in an application it's not
better than zero in five absolutely one
other thing I'll say about internships
is a lot of it comes down to who you
know you should absolutely be buddying
up with every college professor you can
you don't want to be like a total you
know teacher's pet or whatever but
basically just talk to the proactively
don't wait for them don't expect them to
seek you out among your tens or hundreds
of colleagues classmates and and choose
you is the sky and the Anointed One
who's going to be their star people you
need to proactively reach out to these
people these professors and make it
connections also you should join student
groups you should join the ACM which is
the Association
of computing machines I believe is what
it stands for but basically it's the
professional like it's it's the club for
software development and it goes back to
like the 50s or 60s it's a really old
organization but that looks very good on
your resume and a lot of hiring managers
will see that think oh okay this isn't
some guy who just you know smoke weed
and played halo throughout college yeah
he was actually meeting people yeah he
smoked weed and he played halo and he
went to computer meetups ACM was
something I was involved and I was a
member while I was in school and I ended
up being secretary for a little bit so I
like to mention that it was something
that when I was applying for internships
that I would get interviewed and someone
would you know I had one or two people
say oh oh you part of this you know what
you know how is it running at Cal State
LA and so it little bit different
everywhere but it's definitely a great
resource to be a part of I know I know
free code camp is um you know goes over
JavaScript and web development
specifically is that what would you say
that's probably the best area to get
started in if you're you're a novice and
you're like look should I should I learn
web development should I learn some you
know back in should I learn should I
learn mobile what would you kind of say
is a great entry-level place to get
started absolutely web development in
JavaScript in fact I wrote an article
about this two weeks ago it's been used
like more than a hundred thousand times
on medium basically the title of the
article is what programming language
should I learn first I actually chose
the term of what programming language
instead of which programming language
because they looked at the Google Trends
and significantly more people were
typing grammatically incorrect version
yes so one of the maximize our
likelihood of finding my article instead
of finding some of this random kind of
you know business insider spam type
stuff so basically the the real reasons
the arguments for JavaScript are it's
very well document like there is taught
there are tons of resources okay freak
Ocampa just
on Khan Academy teaches JavaScript code
can be started out with just JavaScript
that was like their go-to language there
are a lot of other like Jafar Husain has
like a cool functional programming thing
and it's all in JavaScript and it's
interactive you can do it in the browser
of course note school teaches JavaScript
so there are tremendous number of
JavaScript related resources that you
can choose from and mix and match only
casei to create your own prefer blend of
JavaScript learning there are a
tremendous number of great books many of
which are completely free by the way
Kyle Simpsons you don't know Jes you can
get it for free online I recommend you
buy the book to support Kyle Johnson
Kyle Simpson but but you can read the
entire HTML version of the book for free
online and it's it's just a treasure
trove of deep thoughts about JavaScript
and then so learning resources is one
the second thing is it's a high level
scripting language you can do virtually
anything with it makes that no GS you
can do internet of things if you want to
like program your dishwasher you can do
that with JavaScript you can write a lot
of games in JavaScript and they'll just
run right in the browser the main
important thing about JavaScript I would
say above all else is it's very easy to
sense your progress it's very easy to
create an artifact you can quickly share
you just share the URL the code pan RJ
has been or whatever and people are like
going in and playing with your stuff and
giving you feedback instantly you cannot
do that with Python generally you cannot
do that with Java they tried the Java
applets for a long time and they just
recently would hire them if you remember
those from like the early 2000s I tried
everything I know about Java I'm just
done with that one creation
yeah it's Java is not a good beginners
language I don't know why it was taught
at university was a huge mistake it's
certainly not for CS 101 classes Java is
a powerful language obviously that's why
it's still so widely used but it's not a
good beginners language Python is a good
beginner language but again you're
basically just doing math and science
programming you can try to build some
games in Python but it's just it's it's
not very portable and it's not really
designed with that in mind like in my
opinion Python is great at doing
statistics and data science and in other
types of quantitative work one other
thing I'll say about JavaScript the job
market for JavaScript developers not
just the developers you know JavaScript
but people who've actually don't deep in
JavaScript much more favorable than
Python or Java and don't get me started
Ruby Ruby's like completely saturated
there like so many people seeking a job
for every single job posting uh I can
share my screen and show the chart uh
yeah let me see here just yeah okay cool
so if I go to medium doc free cooking up
my comments are medium
it's our medium publication if I scroll
down here for a while probably in here
you guys should definitely if you
haven't already signed up with their
emails to the medium publication I read
them all the time usually they're pretty
quick and if I remember correctly you're
always kind of which one things I really
like is you actually say how long of a
read it is so I if I don't want to do a
ten minute read I want to a four minute
read I'll choose it based off that I
like that a lot right one thing I'll say
like there's this cool looking which
programming language should I learn
first infographic this looks cool and
it's fun but please do not use this to
make such a you know big decision I mean
this is just kind of it's it's cute but
I would not put any weight on it so I've
gotta like a lot of cool web comics and
stuff that I've learned in here but we
get to the job market stuff okay so this
is the job market for various languages
so you can see that there are 2.7 job
seekers for posting for Java here like
the chart it's kind of obscured by this
legend but you can see Java definitely
has the highest ratio of job seekers to
job postings meaning that there are a
ton of people in know Java but there
aren't a whole lot of employers that are
looking for Java developers at the
moment
pythons not as bad Ruby's not as bad
Android and iOS and PHP are pretty
saturated as well and then way down here
you have JavaScript which there are 1.7
job postings per job secret meaning it's
like it's so low that they had to flip
it you know so basically if you
specialize in JavaScript there are 1.7
job postings out there for you on Irish
and everybody else who's looking for a
job so you're much more likely to find a
job there's much less competition and
also because javascript is so new very
few people like it's new to actually be
like a viable programming language like
a lot of people rip on JavaScript but
they don't realize how much JavaScript
is you know how far JavaScript has come
within just the last few years yeah so
that was that was actually really so I
like as a JavaScript developer and that
makes me feel very good looking at
something like that because it's I mean
I didn't realize there was such a huge
discrepancy yes people have I mean like
like a vast majority of coding boot
camps are still using Ruby on Rails I
think I think it's more out of them not
wanting to have to update their
curricula than anything but you can do a
lot of stuff with Ruby on Rails but I
certainly wouldn't begin it recommend it
to a beginner Ruby the language itself
is very easy to use but again like once
you learned some basic syntax with
JavaScript you can you can coach just as
easily in JavaScript as you can and uh
and Ruby more or less what so if I you
know my short-term memory sucks but if I
remember correctly Java was the most
oversaturated one or closed tethers way
oversaturated and that is the number one
language taught in at the universities
which is crazy
so recently recently Python past Java we
should I talk about my article and it's
at least a top computer science program
so they switched over to teaching Python
but I predict I predict that in the next
three or four years even slow
universities are gonna come around and
say like we should teach JavaScript yeah
I'm a slightly different opinion about
universities and versus coding boot
camps but uh so I I know will tell you I
mean I won't tell you that most of the
people who I know who went to a coding
boot camp also graduated from the
University I haven't met that many
people who didn't go to university who
went to a coding boot camp who wouldn't
I got a good job like it's just less
likely and I think this is evidenced by
the fact that most boot camp
participants have a university degree I
think that they they have a strong
there's a strong selection bias they're
like they want to select people whom
they think are going to be like 90% of
the way there so they can give them the
last 10% and get them a job
yeah it's I don't even get time we
spritz this is like political for me so
I'm talking about if you want I don't
have like emotional feelings but I have
rooted in statistics as somebody who's
worked in higher education for the last
ten years you know I have perspectives
on that maybe I'm biased by virtue of
having spent so much time at the
university yeah I mean I I'm of the
mindset that it's good for certain
people right it's some people do need
that they need that structure they need
that four to six years of I just want to
learn a little bit of everything and not
even necessarily focused on coding you
know obviously we're talking with
computer science and software
engineering and so people need that some
people I'm one I'm of the type someone
who's done that and I still have a year
left on my degree I'm debating if I want
to finish online or not but I'm of the
type that believe that it works for
certain people doesn't work for others
like I I didn't work for me I had
absolute missable experience I think I
would do more much better being
self-taught and doing you know online
resources but it's just different people
work in different things
the thing that messes with me is the
fact that you're teaching someone with
people go to school most of the time to
get a job and you're teaching the
students things that as we saw on the
graph there is saturated with other
with languages that aren't necessarily
you're gonna have a harder time getting
a job so you should be teaching
JavaScript you should be teaching
something that's a little bit more
people actually want to hire you for and
that's what really upsets me about it
more than anything else yeah well I will
say that like the main thing you learn
in like an undergrad computer science
program if you even do computer science
I know a lot of people who did math or
philosophy is actually really useful if
you like for thinking about stuff for a
moment his philosophy is useful for
everything economics any sort of
quantitative heavy degree will kind of
give you that mindset to solve problems
and understand like the underlying
causes and stuff and and just kind of
give you practice at it and and make it
a little bit more intuitive when you're
actually coding I would say that a lot
of people think that university has to
be this like oh you you wave goodbye to
your parents at 18 and you you move into
the dormitory and then you emerge four
years later after having drank you know
thousands of beers and you know it's
been spent countless hours doing you
know goofing around and stuff instead of
actually getting work done but but I
think like what is going to become more
typical if it isn't already more two
quarters in this country in the United
States is that people will work
throughout college like I worked at Taco
Bell you know before I got a job at a
newspaper I worked as a teacher like
teaching English to to school children
wallow still in undergrad and you know I
think that that's how it should be I
think people should be working the
entire time and they should be doing
classes part-time I think the the
college experience where you do nothing
but like sit around this big open campus
and meditate on life and try to discover
your passion all and so I think it's
like completely overrated and it's not a
very good use of people's time I think I
think with me oh yeah
I mean that's one of the big things is
like even living on campus like like
universities have been designed for
residents not for commuter students but
in fact commuter students are still
paying all these fees to subsidize these
other people it's kind of I mean man
don't even get me started it's such a
huge mess the the American University
system no just around the topic of
education let's go a little bit more of
a new school route I got asked this
earlier what is your opinion on like
Udacity is nanodegree or like I think
team treehouse has like these degree
programs as well I think that they
should be used in conjunction with
traditional university degrees I mean
also I think like like certifications in
general they're barely worth the paper
they're printed on like I would not
expect for any of these to just be like
make you a shoo-in for a job you're
still going to need to do whiteboard
coding probably you're still going to
need to take some decent sort of take
home assignment or pair program with the
hiring manager so they can make sure
that you can you know code your way out
of the proverbial cardboard box it like
what I would say is you know III don't
think Udacity is like if you read the
fine print on Udacity where they
guarantee you a job and I've read it it
basically the threshold for getting a
job is so low that like you could
basically go ahead and get a job at
McDonald's and you would no longer be
eligible for a refund and but I would
just I would just urge you like not to
believe the hype and not to believe that
these nano degrees are tantamount to
getting a four-year university
first of all they're like three or four
hundred hours of coursework the edge you
know free code camp is 1,200 hours of
coursework plus a whole bunch of
nonprofit projects like basically you'll
be contributing extensively to open
source large teams and and we're
building we wrote about this recently
but it's called open source for good
so we're transitioning from doing
smaller one-off projects to those
one-off projects basically creating an
open source further extended me maintain
for the benefit of other nonprofits
mmm-hmm any thoughts on team treehouse
and they're kind of set up yeah um I
mean I think the content is good from
what I can tell it seems to be more
lecture driven I don't know how much of
it you can do in the browser the the
main beef I have with treehouse is that
the CEO treehouse had these ads on
YouTube a while back where he was
basically like you don't even gonna call
let's just go to treehouse and I thought
that was very irresponsible I I think we
have an obligation as educators to to
maximize our learners fitness for the
job market maximize the likelihood of
them having a good result and telling
people they shouldn't go to college is
irresponsible
yeah and III kind of look at it similar
to like some of these certificate
programs it's really what you get out of
it like can you take you know free code
camp you build all these applications
now can you go and build your own and go
from there and like do all these sort of
things and you should be able to take
this core foundation and do something
with that core but if you're just
reiterating what's out there you're
gonna have a harder time do you have any
advice for people in high school that
are trying to hit the ground running
yeah I would just there should be some
sort of computer science club if there's
not start one you know your school
should definitely have some sort of
programming club and you can be the
president if there isn't one you can be
the the only person in the room and so
get together with your classmates and
code work through existing stuff solve
project Euler problems work through free
code camp work through some some of the
excellent classic textbooks on computer
science if you really are bold the ACM
has a huge list of classic books most of
which are from the 70s and 80s but
that'll really give you a good
understanding of the theory and and
where things came from I know another
good resource if you're in high school
is just going meet up there's always
usually on this very any any sort of
city I've gone to tons of being up so I
always learned so much I learned I meet
so many people some of which have
offered me jobs down the road
well so and internships and things like
that yeah I would absolutely second that
I think that like don't be intimidated
because you're a high schooler like to
give you an idea
age is just a number right like on our
core team right now we have several
campers who are 18 years old we yes we
have one can't prove 16 and we have a
camper who's 14 and they're on the core
team with serious responsibilities
within the free code camp community um
where do you feel all these JavaScript
frameworks and library are going is it
okay to kind of focus on libraries or or
like what is your kind of general feel
about because you know they feel a
little joke one is oh I create a new
framework and like I do every week right
right I mean first of all don't worry
too much about like the newfangled toy
like shiny new toys I was strongly
recommend you just focus on basics learn
learn JavaScript learn functional
programming learn object-oriented
programming because even though it's not
like fully supported in JavaScript it'll
help you if you do other programming
languages later and you should
eventually after you've mastered
JavaScript you should branch out and
learn Python probably and maybe learn
you know some of these other more fancy
languages I would say if you focus on
the fundamentals you'll be very well
equipped to adapt to a rapidly changing
framework landscape use frameworks as
necessary don't like I wouldn't seek out
like oh I think I'm just gonna
arbitrarily go and spend the weekend
learning angular like you could spend
that time and said you didn't really
good with JavaScript and that'll help
you everywhere um any I don't know are
you familiar with 42 University yes what
are your thoughts about it I think that
the guy who is running it his hearts in
the right place but I think it's a
mistake if you had that kind of money to
not have teachers yeah it's a huge
mistake I don't believe that people are
gonna spontaneously teach each other as
well as if they happen to also have some
people who already know the subject
domain who can help them so there is a
lot of research around peer learning and
that's what freako camp use this free
code camp uses a similar model to what
42
but I'm not a I'm not a telecom
billionaire no and I'm not like like I
look at that office and it's just like
thousand-dollar monitor row of
thousand-dollar Apple monitors after row
of thousand-dollar Apple monitors and
I'm thinking like man like if you really
want to make a difference just I have 1
or 2 actual teachers you know hire Kyle
Simpson or somebody they like come over
and actually teach instead of just
saying here's all the content figure it
out
it was basically what they're doing I
mean I think it'll work because they're
big again just the same reason why
Harvard works and why the most elite
boot camps work is because they always
choose the very best people from the
beginning they filter out everybody else
so these people are gonna succeed
regardless but you gets credit you know
what I'm saying like
that's how selective organizations work
the smartest people go to Harvard so
everybody assumes that Harvard is the
best you know University when in fact
they're just the best at selecting the
smartest people to put in there well I
want to thank you for taking the time is
there anything you want to tell people
to go check out like anything promote
your your blog media and whatever it may
be
yeah I would recommend checking our
medium publication here's a good place
to start
it's useful for everyone when we publish
articles about Python or Java and stuff
like that on there too we also publish
articles about design about data science
basically anything that's technical that
we think is related to people or
practicing coding or learning to code we
publish there and it's right now it's
the largest technical publication on
medium and it's the 11th largest overall
publication on medium and it's growing
pretty rapidly so there will be a very
good very relevant content on there just
go check it out medium pre-cooking com
well thank you again think of everyone
who tuned in and I'll be chopping this
video up and putting it up pretty soon
so again I appreciate the time Anna
everyone was very excited myself
included I love what you're doing that
free code camp I've been a big fan for
assist I saw it and it's only getting
better so
thank you um one thing I will say that I
totally forgot we're on YouTube right
like free cooking does have a YouTube
channel and the one of the people I was
talking about earlier I told you all
that there's a 14 year old kid who
basically contributes tremendously to
our core team I just want to give a
shout out to him his name is at Jonathan
like 80 Jonathan and he's just super
cool and he he does all the like the
back behind the scenes YouTube editing
and deals with like closed captions and
making sure all the metadata correct on
the videos he's a huge help so if you go
to youtube / free code camp you can
check out we have a lot of conceptual
videos we generally tend to focus on
like the whiteboard explain explanation
for theoretical concepts and stuff so
you may find that useful hey guys I hope
you enjoyed that interview with Quincy
in the description I wanted to include
two links so you can kind of get a feel
for his writing whether it be on Korra
or whether it be on medium the first one
was the link to the blog that we covered
which was what is the most what is the
first programming language I should
learn the other is a Korra answer that
Quincy gave which is who is more
hireable someone with three years of
work experience and no degree or someone
with a degree but an internship and an
internship as experience so these are
the type of things you can they expect
from Quincy and it's writing and as I
said I I read some of these on occasion
and all of them are great reads and I
highly encourage you to check it out
he's the number one in tech on medium
for a reason you know so check it out as
always thanks for watching don't forget
like subscribe and share special thanks
to you who support me on patreon it's
going above and beyond and I appreciate
it I'll see you guys in the next video
thanks for watching the video special
thanks to our sponsor dev Mountain
definitely check them out at dev
Mountain comm if you're looking for a
boot camp that's in front-end
development iOS or UX go ahead and give
them a shot tuition includes housing so
you can get up and go and fully immerse
yourself in the program as always thanks
for watch
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
