about typescript what it is why you
might want to use it and why it's here
to stay I know sometimes people think
certain technologies and libraries and
frameworks are all very temporary and I
don't need to learn it I think you're
doing yourself a huge disservice not
learning typescript it's got a lot of
really cool great features that are used
and utilized by a lot of web developers
and a lot of projects and we're gonna
talk about what some of those some of
the pros of typescript are and some of
the few cons but generally speaking
we're just gonna give a quick rundown of
typescript for those of you who may not
be super familiar with it and then in a
separate video I'll actually do a
tutorial going through it and how you
can get started and breaking it out
piece by piece all right so let's dive
into types herb what exactly is
typescript typescript is what's referred
to as a superset of JavaScript and
superset basically means that it can do
everything that is it's sort of original
programming language in this case
javascript can do and then some if this
was a superhero Superman would be a
superset of man he has the ability to
see he has the ability to touch his the
ability to eat and urinate and all the
other stuff that we do but he also has
super abilities in the sentence in this
case heat vision and the ability to fly
and so that's basically a very brief
rundown what a superset is and so in our
case the reason that you use typescript
is it gives you a lot of versatility
that you may not necessarily be given in
just traditional JavaScript in there and
you're saying well that sounds a little
bit risky like why so we gain all this
new stuff but there's got to be some
some constant not too many really other
than learning you know typescript and
having to compile your code and whatnot
but the reason that you also use
typescript is we we get these new
functions every year in this new
workflow write es6 is a great example of
that but you have people who believe it
or not are still using
and safari and these awful awful
I mean safaris like the new ie but
nothing's ever gonna top ie but you have
a so you have these if these people are
using these awful web browsers and
they're like look we can't run es6
that's a real thing and so typescript
once you get installed for the most part
and you install a compiler it'll
actually compile your code down all the
way down to is three that's that's the
the goal anyhow and so it brings it back
so you're writing the new JavaScript
basically if you want to think of it
that way and they will compile it into
something that works for these
bullshit-ass for web browsers and so
typescript gives you this functionality
and some of the functionality that it
gives you and some of you may not be too
familiar with object-oriented
programming but that is something that
is very very big in most higher-level
languages like JavaScript and and
c-sharp and C++ and typescript takes
that idea that's not super well used in
the past in JavaScript because it's kind
of a pain in the ass to do and it says
hey we're taking this we're making it
more familiar so it's less of a pain in
the ass to do but we're essentially
letting you do object-oriented
programming
quicker and faster and it makes your
life a lot easier it also applies the
type and typescript is it's really the
bulk of what type script is used for and
that allows us to assign so to dive into
the JavaScript a little bit without
getting too too bogged down javascript
is a dynamic language and what that
basically means is that if I have a
string I can turn it into an integer and
a lot of you who maybe never coded in
Java or any of these strictly typed
languages would never know that that's a
big no-no like that doesn't work you
have to call certain functions that will
allow you to do that and so typescript
allows us to actually assign types of
variables to our like nor in Java you
would have a VAR int and it would be
number and then you assign it to five or
whatever you wouldn't be able to sign it
to hello world you get a compiler and
it'd be an issue
and the reason for that is you have
these that's a strictly type language
watch JavaScript just like hell yeah
Party won't give a shit about datatypes
let's go baby and so it sounds like oh
well Dylan aren't we giving up some
flexibility from dynamically typed
language to strictly typed because that
strict we're being strict it's it's
pretty as many things are that aren't
direct correlations that word accept is
literally strict so we're restricting
ourselves and so you are giving
flexibility up but for good reason you
are essentially allowing yourself to say
look I'm going to make it so that I have
less bugs in my code and so when I'm
expecting a string it says here I'm
expecting string when I'm selecting a
number it says here I'm expecting a
number and it gives you a lot of
flexibility in that in that now you've
excuse me it restricts your flexibility
and so now you say look I'm expecting
this when this is here and because of
that you're able to catch errors and
avoid errors a lot easier than you would
in other circumstances and I'm gonna
show you a quick quick quick example of
how you might do this as well as of how
you would assign ants very simple let's
go ahead and take a look at that right
now
so what we're looking at right now is a
angular 4 application
don't worry about any of that stuff
right now but what I want to show is
here we have this function called get
client and in our get client we're
expecting one parameter it's an ID in
this case well what may happen is
traditionally speaking maybe you have a
number being that ID but we actually
need the ID to be a string and so here
this colon string we have now said hey
this ID has a value of string like a
type of string and if it at any time
gets called and it's not a string it's
going to throw us an error and that that
doesn't that if you're not too familiar
like well why is that really important
your your event you're essentially
making your code stricter so that you
can catch more errors and you don't have
to run it back and try to catch these
these type errors hence type scripts
right and there's a lot of additional
functionality as
well and this may be a little too much
to dive into for this video but you can
also define additional types right in
this case we're defining a type called
client that we've defined and what that
basically means is we've created a class
of classes in this case we'll consider
it a type and we're saying hey when you
pass in this client class I'm expecting
it to have certain things client in this
case is an object that we have now said
hey it's taking in a key it's taking in
a first name a last name an email a
phone number and a balance don't worry
about this question mark that basically
just means that these are optional
parameters which may or may not be there
but in here we're saying when we pass in
our client object that we've defined it
has a type of string that's associated
with a key it also is the first name of
string the last name is string and email
is string a phone is string and a
balance of number so if if we have all
these items great if we pass in a number
or a string for our number we're gonna
get an error hey there might be
something wrong with your client object
take a look at it now it'll still
compile but you're going to end it's
going to run most of the time but it's
going to allow us to catch more errors
and it's super helpful in that fashion
so one other reason that we haven't
really touched on typescript and this is
more of a practical reason why you might
want to pick it up as I mentioned this
is an angular 4 application or just
angular right I think it's just say
angular angular application and all the
documentation everything is in
typescript in angular and that's the
direction that the web is going and it's
going to continue to to allow us to have
these these additional functionalities
that aren't in es5 es 4 because we want
to make JavaScript better but the issue
with with making javascript better not
that it's not amazing we love you
javascript but we can always do better
the problem with that is that web
browsers are notoriously slow for
updating second you update you break
some stuff and here we are so what we
basically get is hey when Ekman script
or JavaScript updates their their
language and we gain new methods new
functionality all this sort of stuff
we can now use typescript to inherit
that and then just compile it into
something into an older version of
JavaScript that the web browser can
understand now you angular is a good
example of that we actually you don't
you don't actually output typescript
files your typescript files then compile
turn into JavaScript and go from there
type serve just pretty I'm sure this is
all if you've never worked with an
object-oriented language it may be a
little wonky for you but you'll pick it
up pretty quickly typescript is really
used in general for angular development
although there are other applications
but it's always used in angular
development and thing note about
typescript if not self-evident is you
can just do basic JavaScript you don't
have to do that there's also additional
functionality I haven't covered such as
being able to return a type here on your
function so you can even say hey you see
here I'm returning something right this
stock clients dot remove I'm actually
returning this and what this basically
means is I can assign a type of void I
mean hey I'm expecting a void avoid
something that doesn't have a type to
return or here or I'm expecting a client
to be returned here I'm respecting a
expecting a string to be returned so
there's a lot of great functionality
it's not just about passing parameters
in and creating classes and things like
that or creating your own your own types
but a lot of additional type checking
for JavaScript which is a dynamic
language to make it into a stricter
language another great example of this
is the fact that we have classes and so
a lot of people maybe are more familiar
with object-oriented programming now can
code in an object-oriented way without
it being such a hassle and if you
actually ever go and look at what the
what the typescript compiles to you'll
see how much at like how how much how
hard it would actually be to write this
funny I'm sure it looks very
intimidating if you're not familiar with
with JavaScript syntax but in this 35
lines of code or angular syntax you
would probably have closer to 75 or 85
lines of code by the time that this
compiles if not more and it's very
confusing very hard to follow and your
just will be thankful that their site
scriptures you try to object-oriented
JavaScript so that's today's video guys
a little a little rundown about why we
use typescript in web development and
why it's important as I mentioned I'm
going to try and do a video going over
in detail a more sort of tutorial
going through typescript introducing you
so that you can get up and going and
I'll probably do that in an angular 4
sort of environment just because that's
more than likely where most of you are
going to be using it and then we'll show
you how to get that started and my goal
is to have it in under 30 minutes you
can cover quite a bit in 30 minutes but
that's kind of what I want my tutorial
lengths to be but as always guys thank
you so much for watching the video don't
forget to comment like subscribe and
share support my patreon join the
Facebook group all that sort of stuff
and let me know if you are if you like
typescript as much as I do
I have always liked it and now that I've
been using it professionally for about a
month I have really just fallen in love
with it because it makes it so much
easier for you to follow things and in
terms of object-oriented programming
what you're doing with angular with your
components it is so is the development
time from what it would have been if
you're doing object-oriented JavaScript
to typescript is is night and day and
I've really fallen in love with that so
thank you so much for watching I'll see
you guys the next video bye quick
shoutout to device plus comm if you're
interested in the latest IO tease hacks
do-it-yourself projects revolving around
Arduino and Raspberry Pi there's some
great how-to guides I highly encourage
you to check them out and thanks for
