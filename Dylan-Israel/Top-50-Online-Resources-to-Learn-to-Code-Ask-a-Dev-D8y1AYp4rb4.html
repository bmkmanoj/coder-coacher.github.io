it is 50 websites resources whatever you
want to call them for you to learn to
code for you to become a better
developer all that sort of stuff I'm
giving you 50 reasons 6/6 to succeed in
in a world in which you could have a
million reasons to fail but here we go I
hope you enjoy them I'm going to try to
go through it as fast as possible just
because there's 50 of them might we
start off this wonderful video by
thanking our long-term sponsor dev
Mountain comm give yourself another
reason to succeed by going to dev
Mountain comm and starting your career
in software development web development
Quality Assurance Salesforce and much
more that's dev melton dot-com alright
now that we got the sponsor video out of
the way let's jump into the content so
free code camp Tory
is a open source online boot camp you've
seen me do a lot of videos and it's how
I got my start in web development one of
the main reasons they're currently
updating their curriculum
they are going to be pushing out new
content that's gonna be react focus on
the front end they're going to have a
quality assurance certificate currently
they have front-end quality assurance
and excuse me they're gonna have a
front-end quality assurance responsive
design micro services and javascript
algorithms all of which are several
hundred hours of coursework I couldn't
recommend it more free code camp dot org
check it out guys
udemy udemy what do we all know about
udemy hopefully udemy is a online course
platform so there's a lot of free
courses on here there's a lot of paid
courses on here I is it currently you'll
see here if we go to my courses I'm
currently working through the angular 5
course by Maximillian that is 25 hours
of coursework I think I paid $12 for it
you can't beat that sort of stuff you
see right here my previous angular 4
front to back with budget versus media a
lot of stuff on there I have my own
courses on there building projects I'm
gonna be releasing more so if you're
interested in my course will be a link
in the description down below all right
next up bootstrap
get bootstrap calm I think I put this on
here I don't know why the site's down
but I think I put this on here because I
think it's important for you to be
familiar with bootstrap because a lot of
workplaces use it you know as a basic
you know column grid system as some
basic styling so that you know there may
be in certain circumstances we're
listening you're building an
Administrative Tools we don't really
care about what it necessary looks like
it you know there's no there's no you
know detailed pixel perfect wireframe or
anything like that
just make a button that looks alright
boot straps are great examples that I
think it's it's worth bringing up to get
familiar with it now another site
unsplash.com these are all beautiful
free photos as they say and they are
beautiful and they are free and they're
high-resolution free photos the reason I
bring this up is I use this for
resources for thumbnails I've used it in
the past when I've been doing projects
web design based projects where I need a
filler image so you have all these
high-end free resolution pictures
completely free you don't even have to
make an account just click it download
it and you're good to go definitely
worth checking out
Udacity Udacity is a the online learning
platform in which they have these nano
degrees now they have free courses but
really what they're selling are these
nano degrees which are feedback giving
courses and they're usually three to
five hundred dollars depending on on it
and they've recently released a lot of
new ones including design sprint
foundations Google AdWords which is
really cool in my opinion because SEO is
something in digital marketing is
something that has been exploding for
quite some time so definitely check them
out but they have free stuff on here
take advantage of the free stuff I know
five hundred dollars for a course is
quite a bit but keep in mind that with
that five hundred dollars you get
feedback from people who you submit your
projects to and they'll say oh here's
another way of doing this essentially
doing code reviews and I think that is
worth the five hundred dollars my
opinion because you get so much feedback
from that do you know how can I do it
like a pro instead like Anubis I kind of
look at it alright code Kadim II the
good old days code Kadim II actually
just released some new content recently
on Express
and I want to say another javascript
brace library off to try and refresh my
memory but coach CAD me is another
interactive learning platform similar
free code camp I personally think free
code camp is great and code Academy is
great that that people always want you
to choose one or the other
and if I have to I choose free code camp
but what I'm telling you right now is
that you should learn both both or you
should do both because it's gonna
reinforce the things that are important
and not every course is is the same it's
worth diving into code Academy it's a
little bit more on the easier NY free
code camps a little bit more
intermediate I would say if you wanted
to think of it that way but I think it's
a great way to be exposed to things and
learn you can see right here these
various courses I've touched a little
bit so this is just some of them they
have a ton they also cover a ton of
different stuff free code camp is a Java
Script only base curriculum while you
can see here they have they have web
development programming data science and
some partnerships such as the Amazon
Alexa and Watson API so something to
look at w3 schools probably one of the
most favorite documentation sites of any
one and you call me a noob I know so lie
so here's a little thing a lot of
hipsters senior devs like to pretend
like w3 schools isn't legit its legit
boys I'll tell you right now all these
hipsters seeing your dad's just like
hating on these things cuz you know the
junior devs do it the reason I'm saying
that is in AU there's a lot of great
examples of documentation in here it's
very up-to-date also when you actually
they have this try yourself aspect which
is kind of nice where you can see the
code you can then edit the code so
instead of color white for instance we
got to make it red run the code and this
is very helpful I think this is one of
those things where like often times you
read something but until you do it and
you change it and you run it yourself it
doesn't make a lot of sense or doesn't
stick and so here's another site that's
great at that so w3 schools comm is
another great resource a lot of
documentation there in JavaScript and
all the other various frameworks and
languages that it covers so developer at
Mozilla
org so the reason I I bring this up is
it's very similar w3schools except it
doesn't have the run the aspect of it
which i think is important but also
w3schools does go a little bit light on
the documentation meaning it's not going
to go into as much detail and be like
all right well this reverses an array
it's gonna show you it reverses an array
but it's not going to show you five
different ways how it may be used and in
those you know 99% in time you're just
gonna reverse it array that one percent
of the time where there's four different
use cases and you're going to dive into
the optional parameters of function
calls our method calls fire the Mozilla
Doc's are great for that and so I wanted
to bring them up code combat another one
that I've done quite a bit I think it's
a lot of fun now I think it's a lot of
fun where you get to essentially play
out a role-playing game through their
system and entering commands and you'll
see right here you have your code you're
putting in and then you have to cross
levels you actually build out your
character you you get to equip them it's
like a RPG coding game and it's there's
a ton of content I've done like 200
levels myself I haven't touched in a
while but I've done about 200 levels
myself and I think there's about 700
more so if you're looking for
essentially with what are many
algorithms I encourage you to check it
out especially you're just looking for
something a little different something a
little fun I definitely enjoyed myself
while I was doing this and it's a it's a
it becomes a challenge very quickly code
fights you guys know I love some code
fights so code fights calm is a
algorithm solving site and it's
something that I use particularly when I
was trying to get prepared for job
interviews this is what I was using it
for because a lot of times you're doing
white board algorithms you're doing
algorithms on the internet you're just
doing algorithms you're never gonna do
an algorithm on the job but you're doing
algorithms in the interview and you have
to be prepared for that and so that's
what I did it here you can see I self
ninety three of the the algorithms here
and there's different sections I even
have a database section of Python
section now you can solve these
algorithms in here and about 40
different languages one thing to keep in
mind that's kind of cool is that they
actually once you get a certain level
they'll actually interview you to see if
you want to take on any roles or
anything like that so they also have
interview practice these are actual
questions that are from major companies
like Google for instance first duplicate
and and so they try to prep you that way
as well alright so we should go without
saying that youtube.com if you haven't
heard of it it's a great site
specifically the channel coding
tutorials 360 no I so the reason I bring
up YouTube is it's it's probably the
greatest online free resource cuz it's
all free it's not like you can buy
anything on YouTube not aware of anymore
but there's a lot of people are very
passionate such as myself I have I have
a video talking about the top 5 or top
10 coding channels you should follow I'm
big fans of a lot of the the other
coding channels and I think it's a good
opportunity for you to basically find
whatever you want because a lot of times
you're trying to learn code and it's
hard to find that up-to-date but stuff
but when you see something got uploaded
to three days ago or a youtuber that
fits your learning style who you can
understand when he's giving explanations
or she or she all right and YouTube is a
great platform for that another thing up
next code or code org I have volunteered
through code or code org has its own
resources and it's they're really an
organization trying to get children to
code earlier and more often and they
have a lot of things a lot of resources
here for you to review one thing I will
say is I volunteered through code org if
you are somebody who's you know got a
year or two experience on your belt or
just passion a computer science to it
whatever it is you can volunteer through
them and put yourself into a database in
which people will reach out to you and
you can help speak I I did it when I
first got down to Florida I'm doing it
again pretty soon where I'm going to an
elementary school and speaking to the
kids for a couple hours of which last
time they asked how much money I make
and do that code minecraft so I'm I'm
suspecting kind of the same thing but
you can volunteer make some kids a
little bit more passionate about stem
and software development and just said
do some good in the community
code.org is a great resource as well as
just you know they have other
resources here if you're trying to teach
your kids how to code all right let's
continue on pram pram is a in a free
open-source interviewing platform like I
said I'd studied I did algorithms but
sometimes can you do algorithms why
someone is there staring at you ever so
awkwardly judging you every moment of
your algorithm tests I don't know maybe
but pram gets you prepared for that real
world situation
so check check it out pram come you can
sign up it's completely free you get
matched with someone who you're looking
to say you have an angular interview and
you need you need to make sure that
you're ready for angular the test your
angular you have JavaScript interview
they want to test you on JavaScript you
kind of get the idea from this picture
here but they'll set it up all right the
University MongoDB comm so something
I've used if you're interested MongoDB
the craters a MongoDB have their
University and they have free courses
for you to take the teach you the ins
and the outs of MongoDB who's better to
teach your courses on MongoDB than the
craters and the people who are coding
MongoDB so check that out if you're
interested in MongoDB girl develop it
this is another one this is a platform
for a a organization that oftentimes is
trying to get women involved in coding
girl develop it comm they have they have
a ton of organizations in there they're
in both those cities I see them all the
time in st. Pete most their courses I
see our paid so if it's like an
eight-hour course it'll be about and
it'll go like all Saturday it's gonna be
about a hundred bucks so if you're
interested in that but they do have some
free online courses and online aspects
of it as well but if you want to be you
know maybe a little intimidating right
being the only woman at a meet-up this
is kind of something to ease you in and
so it's how I think of it I I kind of
don't like necessarily when
organizations have specific gender and
ethnic attachments but here's an
organization that's not I it's me to
share it's not my opinion
anyhow girl develop it calm if you're
interested in that
check it out LinkedIn is next so a
couple things about LinkedIn one get a
LinkedIn because you need a you need a
LinkedIn portfolio in today's working
world to the F they have free courses on
here LinkedIn is trying to launch their
own they not trying they did I don't
know if it's all that great but I
haven't had a chance to take the courses
but they have linked in learning in
which often times I'm getting emails all
the time that they're giving away free
courses essentially LinkedIn learning is
creating their own Udacity the udemy
platform and it's on a a month to month
basis if I remember but you can you can
kind of see here there's multiple
courses just going down here and they're
gonna cover things other than other than
just than just software they're gonna
cover things like thinking like a leader
which is just as important although for
the 80,000 people who watch this I wish
you could have there's nothing there's
nothing worse to think like a leader
than following a video I guess I'm
trying to say but something something to
consider
alright Tut's Tut's plus calm or code
Tut's plus calm tons and tons and tons
of ebooks courses check them out I'm not
super familiar with this but I have a
friend who loves it and it's very clean
site by the way I love I love the site
design but uh you see right here a
thousand courses 25,000 tutorials quite
a bit on here a lot of projects
documentation all that search stuff
check it out
hacker.com challenges algorithm
challenges projects I haven't used
hackers too much but I know a lot of you
guys do and are interested in it I would
check it out just another resource to
practice do some challenges alright
fonts google.com so this is a great way
to make your website spicy as I like to
say to make your web application a
little bit spicy and and go ahead and
get some fonts from Google and they have
this nice very this
nice drag-and-drop tool it will drag and
you kind of filter through this through
the fonts to find what you want and I
got a little bit more slant in my font
but yeah so fonts Google comm to get
yourself a little bit more spicy of a
font I think it's a great resource I use
it all the time
jas beautify org so this is a great one
oftentimes I find myself having to get
this minified code medicine minified
JSON whatever it is and I need it to be
able to be beautiful again I need it I
need it to be a dime piece for me and so
Janis beautify org essentially makes it
so I pasted in this this long a string
and it will organize it for me so that I
can actually read it and it's readable
code so check that out uh I don't think
this was supposed to be on the list
Heroku so Heroku is a platform as a
service so let's say you have a
server-side application and you such as
a node.js application and you need
somewhere to launch it and you're not
quite sure you're like can I do it there
go daddy I don't ain't I don't I don't
know what to do Heroku does it for you
and essentially it allows you to launch
your application whether that's a Ruby
on Rails whether it's a PHP back-end a
javascript back-end
karoku is great in that and I believe
it's been a while since I've used for
Roku I believe that up until a point is
pretty much free
so like unless you have like a yeah
right here so free so essentially you
can you can have it going for free for
most of all of your projects unless your
projects pick up a little bit of speed
at which point it gets very it's pretty
cheap and affordable but it's definitely
something to consider how so especially
if you have a back-end application that
you want to not just show the code but
you actually want to show it working
check out Heroku comm code school
another another another online platform
to learn
most of code schools courses start off
free and then continue on to be paid
courses but you can see here they have a
lot of stuff going on HTML Javascript
elixir Android php.net not a lot of
dotnet courses out there I'll be honest
with you I uh I recently am making the
transition from front-end at my job to
full stack and I will be doing C sharp
and dotnet and so the interesting to see
what C sharp and dotnet courses I can
find online for free I'm having a
feeling your boys dropping a few bucks
on you tell me the iOS get electives I
don't know what electives are but
database I mean I know it electives I
don't know what they are in this context
but so code school comm a lot of
different courses they're similar to
code Academy and it's delivery method I
definitely suggest checking it out
alright PageSpeed developers on Google
slash feet slash PageSpeed slash
insights so have you ever wondered how
fast your page loads you want to say
Amen I don't know if I have a janky web
page or not this is just one great tool
to do that and there's a bunch of great
developer tools this is just one that I
think it's kind of cooler where you can
throw your page in here it will analyze
it and we can do something real quick
let's do uh let's see what my webpage
loads at this is where they tell me I
made a janky angularjs page which I
probably did because uh it was my first
thing so low 52 out of 100 and by the
way they show you how to fix some of
this some stuff they give you
suggestions on how you can optimize it
that's kind of cool that they actually
loading the phone here though right and
so uh but they'll give you suggestions
so you just won't tell ya is
they'll say eh it's but let me tell
you how to fix that a little bit so
that's the page tree on developer tools
slack slack is an amazing resource for
when you are working in a collaborative
environment where you need to have a
group chat and you want to get messages
with someone messages to you on slack
I've used slack for a number of projects
and I honestly wish I used it more but I
just don't like
with other people I want to in my
personal projects their personal
personal meaning just me so I don't use
slack as much as I used to I learned
that when I started trying to do group
projects outside of work that I just
like working by myself I don't know it's
nothing personal to the world but slack
is a great resource you'll find that a
lot of organizations have integrated
slack into their platform into their
website and I think it's great
so Trello is a how would you define
Trello Trello how do they define Trello
boards lists and cards all right so
Trello is a board listing card platform
where you can essentially define your
tasks that you have to do and this is
really helpful in my opinion because a
lot of times you'll be having a very
similar board in the workplace where
you'll have some tickets and you'll need
to move it along as it's getting done
right and that's kind of how I look at
Trello but a lot of times people just
use Trello to share resources maybe
you'll have a you know the best 100 or
the 50 web dev resources someone might
make their own version on Trello for
instance so I think Charles are great
resources so let me check out in the
future all right
gerrae oh my goodness I bring this up
not because I necessarily think it's a
great resource but because I think it's
worth mentioning so JIRA is by Atlassian
comp by as part of the Atlassian suite
is a is a a paid for ticketing system
and management system in software and
and it allows the it's essentially the
real world version this is not the more
popular version of a ticketing system
used by a lot of organizations and I
just wanted to bring that up for a JIRA
there's a lot of ticketing systems and
workflow systems like this and I
encourage you to review that just be
familiar with how the development
process goes because a lot of times this
is something that gets overlooked you
just sort of get a job and like tell us
all this I'm just going to write code
but
there's a little bit more to it than
that in terms of a business side of
things
my minna fire is not working
github tried github do so a lot of times
people are very confused by git and
there's this wonderful site called try
github dot dot that has about 15
challenges to help teach you github and
what they think is important so if
you're a nurse in learning github a very
quick interactive tutorial it's I've
done it before it's very helpful I
encourage you to check it out I also
love this cat I don't know how this cat
octopus thing came to be but meet
whoever the creator and I this are on
the same wavelength because I love
everything going on here
so but yeah if you're a nursing learn
github check that out all right we're
getting there we're almost there
jsbin jasmine is a JavaScript HTML
output so sometimes you may want to test
some things and then run your code and
and run it with j/s and preview it you
can have all that ability in jsbin it's
really helpful a lot of times where you
can choose what you're going to put in
if you're gonna have HTML CSS turn it on
turn off and run it to see it a lot of
times you'll see in documentation
sometimes links to jsbin or or just to
give examples be like hey here's what
you need to do here's a Jeb in to
showcase that which brings us to our
next one jsfiddle which is a equally
great resource it's very similar Jasmin
honestly people there's so many of these
sort of run your JavaScript code run
your front-end job front-end code sites
that there's probably five more that you
could list in the description below that
would that would take that might even be
better than these but those are the two
that I've used the most I'm probably
leaving one out all right something a
little different CSS - tricks calm oh my
goodness
if if you could understood how many of
us web front-end web developers were bad
at CSS you understand why this site
exists and why it's so great so CSS
tricks commerce something I use all the
time when I want to make things spicy
when I want to I mean look at this I
couldn't do this I couldn't I couldn't
this is just a box jumping up and down
and expanding that's next level I can't
do that so it's it's one of those things
that you get exposed to a lot of
different things in CSS and there's a
lot there's very few great next level
CSS sites so CSS tricks calm is a great
resource how could we how could we have
this list not have Stack Overflow if
you're unfamiliar with Stack Overflow
then you probably don't code that's
probably the only way that you're
unfamiliar with Stack Overflow the Stack
Overflow is a essentially a organization
that people post questions about code
and issues they're having and then they
get answers that's really the gist of it
or hopefully they get answers so a lot
of times when you're running into a a
problem with how to write a c-sharp
program to detect duplicate code or you
have a you know you have a instance how
to how to calculate someone's agency
Sharpe you'll get uploaded things since
and see examples like so and get
resources oftentimes you're just
searching google and nine times out of
ten their response the the top one two
three four five our Stack Overflow
responses so you shouldn't you should be
pretty familiar with Stack Overflow up
skills course calm learn to code for
free
premium web development courses what
else needs to be said about upscale they
add new content monthly they have a
bunch of free courses that are worth
checking out a lot of times we like that
free stuff you check your course library
they they mainly focus on web dev and
you can see all these sort of courses
and not everything's free but you give
it you give a start
get to see that you know you know let's
start knocking things out piece by piece
get get exposed to a lot and go on this
is a this section is pretty solid but
check them out at obstacle courses calm
all right Coursera another great
platform now I traditionally have been
using udemy but I know people some
people like Coursera it's worth checking
out if you're interested in programming
you can see that they have about 800
courses here just in programming you
know and a lot of them are excuse me all
of them as far as I know are from
universities which make them stand out
so if you're interested in the MIT sort
of program courses and fundamentals you
see these are all from organizations and
universities so that that kind of what's
makes them stand out similar with EDX
which is they had their another learning
platform that is all about the
university is being behind these courses
it adds a special little bit of flair
that goes into a online traditional
platform online education supported by
the traditional organizations will leave
add that I get up today not cover get
hub it no I did not so github is a git
and github for that matter is a great
resource for you to keep versions of
your code live or keep versions of your
code and be able to have people look at
your code pull branches down or pull
pull repos down rather and make their
own changes and play around with it and
just organize your code and be able to
check out other people's code I did a
really bad job explaining github let me
start over
git hub comm is a place where you can
store your code and other people can
view it other people can edit it if they
if you allow them to by pulling it down
and you it's a great place for you to
store it so that you can show potential
employers that's as good as it's gonna
get right now it's 7:30 in the morning
I've been up since 5:00 all right
cut me some slack so Khan Academy is an
OG some of us back in the day we're
really all over Khan Academy before
learning platforms are really things
kind of edgy learning platform where
this is going to cover a lot more of the
traditional education stuff such as
algebra geometry even early on you know
early math eighth grade level but it
also has a lot of computer program and
computing computer science does an
excellent job and it goes into other
things college related it is a great
free platform I definitely encourage you
to check out Khan Academy dot-com hacker
ranked if you like solving algorithms
hacker ranks got a buttload all right so
if that's what you're into you can go
over to hacker Inc and start playing
around with with their with their
practice tests with all that sort of
stuff they have so many it's it's really
ridiculous I'm not logging in alright so
another great places to do this is code
Morse code Wars allows you to
essentially battle other developers to
the death and you assert your dominance
when you win code Wars is a great
algorithm site you can see right here
that they have a ton of different
programming languages and it allows you
to solve algorithms which i think is one
of the harder things to do as a
developer the Odin project ok the Odin
Project is a online open-source boot
camp that smoke is focuses specifically
on Ruby on Rails it's a lie I've yet to
dive into it because I have no interest
in Ruby and Ruby on Rails but people
seem to love the Odin project it's worth
checking out it's one of the very few
resources for Ruby and Ruby on Rails in
terms of online interactive programs
check it out team treehouse dot-com so
team treehouse is a is a online learning
platform they have a ton of videos
they're about twenty-five to fifty
dollars a month they also have practice
prod
interactive and you're in little little
badges to show that you're in you solved
the project
it's basically a $25 a month to $50 a
month learning platform but honestly uh
in today's world unless you really like
the people are working at
teamtreehouse.com them for about the
same amount but it is worth noting that
they are very high quality courses and I
think they do a very good job and they
have over a thousand videos on there and
that's just including their practices or
anything like that all right
font awesome the icon God Himself they
just released a fun awesome five but fun
awesome is a icon list here it's
probably the most popular one where you
have a bunch of open source icons so
let's say you want a back button you
could do font you could use here's back
and I'll show you what icons are
available it's just an external resource
I highly encourage you to if you need
icons go to font awesome dot IO are you
talking about bootstrap code pin how can
we talk about code pin how can we do
this without talking about coachmen co
pin is a great platform for you to see
other people's front-end projects as
well as to create and store your own
right so github you store your code but
let's say you want an actual working
version of your project you can go ahead
and throw it up on code pin and allow
people to jump through here as well as
just see how much better people are than
you on CSS and in general it's really
quite impressive like what is this CSS
3d converter Matic there is no
JavaScript on those guys did you see
this this is how much better this guy is
than me right now this is how I feel
that's but you can cope there's a lot of
great stuff I've seen so many
interesting things on code pin that it's
hard to it's hard to even put in words
like this this is just a great example
of such a thing so meetup.com meetup.com
is a place for you to find meetups I go
to me I went
me up last week where they were talking
about blockchain they're talking about a
node and and react and in there there's
three separate companies taking resumes
so if you're looking for a job
meetups are a great place to go as well
as to educate and learn right I'm not
looking for a job but I'm there to learn
but meetup comm you'll see a lot of you
know I don't know let's let's change our
thing and every organization is
different every area is different but
let's say we wanted to do JavaScript so
you'll see right here how to test smart
contracts I'm going to that that's about
solidity which is a cerium contract
billing thing building apps with
Salesforce and then I believe I'm
already signed up for a building a view
j/s app so so it's a great way for you
to get familiar you can see right here
66 people go into this I think it's a
great way for you to get introduced to
network as well as to learn all right on
that note angel hack dot-com this is my
favorite hackathon organization they
have great hackathons now the problem
with them is that they really are you
they're far and few between but it's
worth mentioning because I think they
put on such a tremendous hackathon that
they have hackathons in various cities
although apparently none right now
what's going on here I don't know if my
Internet's going slow but angel hack
hackathon it's about usually they just
have like a $10 cover charge but they
they'll feed you like three meals
unlimited drinks you'll get t-shirts
stickers like cups it's ridiculous and
it's just a good time you meet a lot of
people and you you uh you usually
they're giving away you know thousands
upon thousands of dollars and prizes at
every one I've ever gone to
I've yet to win a prize so I fit to win
a prize you guys are too good out there
majorly ml H dot IO Major League
hackathon so if your college student in
the US there is the major league
hackathon in which they have usually two
to three day hackathons at various
campuses in various cities you can see
this is all that's going on in
20:18 there is a ton of them and I wish
I went to more when I was in school now
I feel like an old man so I don't go I
can't although technically your boys
back in school I'll show up stat
establish my dominance and then leave oh
but yeah check it out if you're a
college shooting you're interested in
going to hackathons look sure and I
arrest me it's great way to network a
great way to make a little bit extra
money and have fun in the process so ml
H dot IO live edu TV if you ever wanted
high quality live coding building out
projects live edu dot TV is what it
where's all that now they cover more
than just development but that is the
bulk of it right they'll cover data
science and game development design AR
VRA our program I saw I guess I all can
fall into development but they are an
education platform that's focused on
development and I encourage you to check
them out it's a great organization you
might have known them by their old name
