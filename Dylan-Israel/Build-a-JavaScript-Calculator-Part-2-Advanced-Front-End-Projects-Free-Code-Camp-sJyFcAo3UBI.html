back in the calculator JavaScript
calculator from freako Kemper jQuery
calculator that's how we did it
so this video we're gonna be doing the
styling we're gonna make it look a
little bit cleaner a little more
professional so that we can kind of
showcase it often it's easier to work
with sometimes when you do it like that
the first thing we're gonna do is we're
gonna go ahead and change these these
fonts they're they're kind of ugly and
generic so I went over and used Google's
API fonts and we're just gonna go ahead
and import our font into the top of here
like so and we are importing oswald and
prompt now let's go ahead and jump into
the CSS this is where we're gonna be
making the bulk of the changes we're
first off what I did was they're just
gonna change the background and the of
the HTML and the body to black so this
is just a preference thing definitely do
whatever you prefer
this I don't really do too much styling
I'm more I'm more enjoy the the
JavaScript aspect of it the styling is
just kind of a for funsies thing if that
makes sense the next thing because we
change everything to black we want to go
ahead and change our h1 tag or our title
essentially to white so that we can see
it a little bit cleaner and then we're
also gonna go ahead and change the font
family that we imported to Oswalt so
font family because this is an imported
font and not a default one in the
browser we need to put in the quotations
like so so that looks a little cleaner
and then we're gonna go ahead and target
our h2 tag as well and this is going to
just same thing we're gonna change the
color of it and we're going to go ahead
and set that to white
we're also going to go ahead and change
the font family to prompt I personally
think when you have like a heading and
subheading it always looks a little bit
better when you are
when it's different different fonts to
say the same thing but that's just a
preference so we have this so far it's
looking a little cleaner now calc output
that is this zero in this line so we got
this is we're gonna have a lot of stuff
going on here let's see if we can set it
up first I'll try to do it in order that
makes sense so we have our couch output
because it's a ID we're using the
hashtag-- dots are for the classes the
first thing that we want to do is set a
background color so we can see exactly
where it is so we're gonna set
background color equal to white and
we're also going to need to set a height
and a width of this or else it's not
gonna display properly so we're gonna go
ahead and do height I did 75 pixels let
me make sure my HTML is targeting
correctly calc see right here this is a
class we need to an ID which is why it
didn't display properly I thought it
should display it so you'll see right
here I if you watch my first video make
sure you make uh make that change so
we're gonna go ahead and give it a width
of 250 pixels now this will be the same
as in the calculator aspect so keep that
in mind that if you're gonna change this
at all as you're doing your own code
that it may be off a little bit so then
we have this height of 75 px you can see
the line right here now pretty cool so
the next thing that we want to do is add
a little bit spacing on the top and
curve these corners a little bit so the
way that you curve a single corner is
you do border - radius excusing border -
what what if you undo top or bottom and
then if you want to do left or right so
we'll do the the left one first and then
we're gonna put it at 2m it's just so it
may be a little hard to see right there
then we're gonna have a borders top -
right - radio - radius excuse me that's
why we couldn't see it there we go so
there's our curved corner now it doesn't
change the total area of the div but it
changes the the border it changes that
what it look
like what's visible so we're gonna do
the same thing to the top right corner
as well it's just a little bit of
styling at the end of the day and then
because we want this to be in the center
we're gonna do margin - right
Auto and then margin - left
Auto there's that so we're getting there
and then there's a little bit of this a
little too close for my liking so we're
gonna go ahead and say look margin - top
and we'll put 20 pixels give this a
little bit of spacing and then we'll do
padding - top this is for our output
it's a little too close to the top so
we're gonna do another 20 pixels for
there you'll see our ode drops down to
somewhere in the middle so this is our
top part of the calculator a lot of
little things going on here but uh
alright let's go ahead and jump into our
calculator div let me check to make sure
I didn't put that as a class no I did it
very good so we have our little top of
the calculator now let's go ahead and
define the bottom part again we're gonna
be using a hashtag because it's an ID
that we're targeting we're gonna set a
background color and we're gonna do
background - color and we're just using
default one gray I try to keep
everything as simple as possible
definitely take the time to make things
as creative as you can so we have we're
gonna do the same width that we did
above width:250px and then we're gonna
set the height excuse me the height
we're gonna leave alone because we're
gonna set Auto but we're gonna do some
padding our buttons are like right up on
it so we'll do pea - top 20 pixels and
then I did padding on - bottom 30 pixels
30px the reason I did a little bit more
there is because we're gonna curve the
bottom corners and it looked a little
funky if I remember correctly so similar
to how we did the the curve corners on
the top we're gonna do it for the bottom
now and we're gonna do border - bottom -
left - radius and we're gonna do to em
and then we're gonna do Bop border -
bottom - right - radius and the same
thing
- am and then we want it to be centered
with everything as well so we're gonna
do margin - right Auto and then margin -
left
Auto so our styling for this is coming
up quite perfect yet the next thing that
we want to do is go ahead and edit this
output so it's a little more it looks a
little cleaner than what we're trying to
do so that uh it's not so small so we
called that steps again we're using a
hashtag because of the it being ID we're
gonna just go ahead and and shoot it out
from the left a little bit so we're
gonna do padding I left 50px so you'll
see it's right there a little a little
better and we're gonna do a font size to
em we just wanted to be a little bit
bigger so there's that a little bit
easier to see now if you remember
correctly we said that we wanted these
buttons to be a little bit bigger I kind
of guesstimate it at what I would want
this to be oh well actually let's go
ahead and do the actual buttons first so
we're gonna all these are anchor tags so
we can just go ahead and target these
like so and we'll go ahead and say
margin and we're gonna give this about
five pixels put a little bit of space in
between everything we want everything to
look nice and neat and then we're gonna
set a width here equal to two point six
of the view window this is just kind of
like a Auto formatting so that
everything looks similar if you need to
know more about this like I've just
learned about this recently I definitely
suggest checking out w3 schools so
you'll see right here these are these
are looking very nice and clean and so
finally we
our big button class and because this is
a class we're using a dot big button
like so we're gonna go ahead and just
give these some widths that I defined of
93 pixels and there we go so everything
is looking pretty pretty clean so far
why is that so big in here hmm
that's a little bit off so oh it's
because of we're zoomed in yeah so
that's one of the things you're gonna
you're gonna see it sometime when you're
zoomed in just gonna mess everything up
so we're trying to keep everything as
clean as possible all right so this is
our CSS and our HTML so I hope you guys
found this helpful in the next video
we'll be diving into the jQuery and the
JavaScript so that we can see the logic
to get everything to work properly
