web page section of introduction to HTML
again just to remind I did work through
this another time so I will be resetting
the code and working through it again so
in this case up is just kind of showing
us their little mini sandwich web page
example what we're going to be building
alright so the web page is blank as
blankets the day was born so we need to
set it up so if you remember the doctype
HTML and then we need our HTML text slow
their closing HTML tag and then we need
our header tag and our closing head tag
and then we need the title and the
closing title and then the body and the
closing body this should be good to go
so you basically got it set up you can
probably just put this and copy and
paste or if you have an HTML editor that
you're working with if they'll probably
give you something a little bit standard
to that so going to reset this code so
credit h1 tag inside your body and
closing h1 then type your name for all
to see so a form please my gamertag so
if you're assuming anywhere I'll I don't
really play games too much it's a poker
guy alright so insert three paragraph
tags after your h1 tag
but before closing bug jogging right a
little bit about each yourself all right
so first thing I like to do is just kind
of create the tags we need so that's one
paragraph two paragraphs break their ups
and we'll just talk where's cones at a
gaming theme RPGs are my favorite games
I love leggings as well on homework one
more gaming related thing uh I am
excited for the final fantasy 7 ps4
remain cool so that is should be what
we're trying to do there we have our
three paragraphs we have our are heading
or not are heading our h1 change to
everything that so let's go to lose zip
code inserting image between your body
tags feel free to put it anywhere we
think it's like best after the h1 tag
but before your very eyes X so let's
just go ahead and see what comes up we
type in pizza poker guide will go to
images so we get a lot of some some of
this is a piece of faux fur guy this is
my whole stream icon so let's go ahead
and copy this image URL it's also my
Twitter for my Twitter account all right
so but before your paragraph it makes it
a sexy so alright so we'll put it in
here and if your let's try and remember
its image SRC equals and just as a
reminder
but if you're ever struggling was trying
to remember syntax and stuff like that
but you understand the concept there's a
lot of great cheat sheets if you want to
call them that that have kind of
examples and just print them out bring
them with you and you know eventually
you'll remember eyes everything but you
have to know so much nowadays that you
know made me forget exactly how to close
the SRC or you know something more
complicated down the road but it's
always good to kind of get into the
habit and be like okay well I understand
it I just need to see an example real
quick I saw it once said two links to
the webpage you can turn an image or a
bit of text into a link you can turn the
part of your text and type of treats
like all right so let's go right here
and we'll say a href equals pair then
we'll just say we'll just create for
whatever reason this takes us to google
and we'll have this and a lot of clothes
in here and if we scroll down you can
see it turned our paragraph text right
here into a link and then we will just
create our own image link and I don't
remember I actually rarely on Twitter
but we'll do the same thing here so
we'll set this up to my Twitter account
which i believe is weather.com /
canceled oh good guy 87 I believe if it
might be something else my GPS poker guy
so we have to close off the ending tag
and you can see right now this is now
our link and we're good to go so that
was kind of just a quick run through of
our basic HTML tags you can see we
created a mini web page I guess and next
we're going to be going into HTML basics
to now we're going to be working our way
through it so hopefully a little bit
getting a little more in depth with what
we've been working on
I'll see you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
