gonna be talking with Stephen my you who
is a self-taught full-stack developer
we're going to talk about how he learned
where he learned which was why he was
teaching English in Korea we're going to
be talking about advice to get a job as
always we'll be taking subscriber
questions at the end and we got a lot of
good ones and we should cover you know a
little bit of how he got his job is his
interview at Google when he did that a
little bit everything so hope you guys
enjoyed I had a lot of fun and I'll
probably do a follow-up interview with
Stephen down the road hey what's going
on hey life is good man congratulations
on the developer job I know it's
probably been about five weeks six weeks
a little less than that maybe maybe
three or four weeks but yeah thank you
thank you it's been a wild ride so far
nice man what do you uh what well like
what are you doing are you front-end or
you back-end full stack what are you
working with a full stack it's for a
consultant web consultancy in Austin
Texas so we do client work and right now
I'm working on a lot of different
projects one and react native last week
one in Ruby on Ruby on Rails I think in
the future are going to do some PHP so
it's all sorts of stuff nice man I was
really excited to hear that I know I'm
this you're like first developer job
right the first like real official yeah
the whole shebang
like I'm only a month before you it's
exciting right yeah kind of scary and
intimidating but you know it's a it's a
lot of fun too it's really exciting yeah
I know I know like for me I I don't want
say I had a panic attack but I was like
I was a little concerned like cuz you
you know they're paying you real money
now right so you're going in there and
you're like I have to deliver like am I
actually competent enough that I can be
a developer or am I gonna show up and
embarrass myself like I was something
that went
my head mm-hmm oh man but uh I I'm I'm
glad to hear that so I I had a few like
topics that I wanted to cover and if
okay if you don't if any of them are not
off limits or anything we'll just skip
over uh but uh I wanted to talk about I
know a while back you had said that you
interviewed with Google I know I did
work out but I'd love to talk about the
interview process okay sure I would like
to talk about also you know your your
new job maybe how you what some how you
applied my cap your whole kind of
thought processing advice you'd have for
people as well
okay and then um I would like to talk
about a you were teaching a overseas
English right yeah I was teaching ESL in
Korea and if I remember correctly uh you
taught yourself basically how to code
during that time yeah that's right
that's right and and I'm a big proponent
of that if you're a young person and
you're not really tied down anywhere
yeah go to Asia go to Korea you make a
living you know supporting yourself as
an English teacher and then all of your
free time just teach yourself the skills
like programming and in one or two years
you'll have a nice you know sack of
change saved up and and you've got like
job-ready skills so I'm happy to talk
about that today okay great let's start
there so was it a one-year program is
that is that typically how these like
teach overseas programs go yeah every
place is different but in Korea you
usually sign like a one-year contract
and I was there for two years so I went
there like summer 2014 and I didn't
really become interested in coding and
take the learning seriously until until
the end of my first contract and then
from that like I thought okay one one
more year in Korea and I could totally
find a job whenever I get back
and so that's whenever I started hitting
it like really hard every week okay so
did before you actually move to Korea
did you kind of have a thought process
planned ahead of time or was it just
like something you picked
or were you like look I'm gonna go I'm
gonna teach English and the whole time
I'm there my plan was like I'm gonna
start learning some skill maybe
programming maybe something else are you
just like hey I have this great
opportunity I should learn a skill I
didn't really work out for you well I
mean I've been a professional English
teacher my master's was in teaching
English and and I had been doing that
for several years before going to Korea
so I thought that you know I would be in
teaching for a little bit you know
longer heading over there but you know I
think I was just getting tired of you
know moving around all the time you know
if you're a teacher that jobs are
broader more plentiful and more
lucrative than they are at home so I was
getting you know tired of that I kind of
felt like well you know this is some
really challenging or you know like I'm
like sort of plateaued I'm not learning
as much as the teacher anymore so so
what can I you know what career move
could I prepare for that would require
like minimal funds maybe you know no
loss of time going to like you know back
to school what could I do on my free
time in Korea and so you know after a
bit of you know brainstorming I realize
that like computers I've made a few
websites for my teaching endeavors
before like on WordPress and enjoyed
that process so so I decided you know
why not let me learn programming and
I'll be a programmer like a whenever I
go back home what did yeah so so once
you kind of came to that decision how
did you kind of get started on your
Learning Path like did you start doing
coke aadmi free code camp or did you
start hitting the books always kind of
your process yeah I you know I started
you know watching my friends learn how
to code on Facebook they would you know
post you know some links or you know
some links to their projects or links to
tutorials so I started there with with
code Kadim II I kept seeing that appear
like on my Facebook friends list and and
just want Google sort searches and like
I went through all those tutorials
really quickly so so at the end of it
yeah I don't know I
I still couldn't like make a website but
but someone had mentioned free code camp
and I started learning alone with with
their platform online and and I really
liked how they have an entire sort of
path that could take you you know an
entire year with with all the skills
that you need to work in the startup in
the United States so I really like those
already mapped out they have like tons
of practical projects and there is sort
of like the community like online and on
the ground people you can interact with
so shortly after I started learning with
code Academy I jumped into free code
camp and that's what I've been using for
about like you know I'm gonna say 60 or
maybe 70% of my learning resources just
all the free activities and projects I
had to do to get my free code camp
certificates yeah let's see a lot of
people are like well you know is this
really gonna help you it but I would say
most of my successes come from free code
camp also yeah yeah I agree
learning that it's it's more so like not
that I didn't know I could make projects
it was just I never actually liked the
project section specifically was I never
sat down and made anything before like
it's all algorithms and like homework
and stuff like that yeah free code camp
gave me was something to showcase
employers to be like hey man I made
these ten one-page applications I can
actually code something and they're like
huh now that and sometimes it's just
enough to get your foot in the door yeah
what I like about those projects too is
and it's what I like about it is maybe
something that other people don't like
about it I think it's like a personal
preference but the projects they go
slightly like above your current ability
like like not like super like way above
your head but just like slightly above
what you already know so that kind of
like pushes you to you know go on google
or Stack Overflow and find those answers
and I found that like when I was
constantly in that state doing a task
that was slightly above my
current ability I mean boy like that's
how like I learned and and you know it's
not easy it's sometimes like very
frustrating you know this working on a
project on your own or with a group of
people but but yeah there's those
assignments and the algorithm challenges
and the projects front end and back end
they just prepare you for the types of
problems you'll you'll encounter in the
real world so if for that I love it I
know other people they you know they
want more guidance or they want to be
like 100 completely percent you know
prepared before starting a project but
for me I'm comfortable with a little bit
of uncertainty and kind of jumping into
the deep end well I mean in reality when
you become a developer you're not gonna
have anybody to guide your hand the
whole time when your boss is a I need
you to do this you do it and there's not
like there's not gonna be a you know
your channel or my channel doing a guide
how to build your project you're right
exactly
so I mean unfortunately I'm have a small
enough company and and everyone there is
super helpful and they encouraged me
that ask a lot of questions but you know
I try to balance that and try to you
know work it out on my own or you know
find a solution somewhere but but you're
right I mean the specific language or
the specific projects that you make I
guess we're not that important it's just
developing that problem-solving skill
and you know learning how to remain calm
you know don't get too frustrated and
just sort of process of elimination
trying different things I think that
sort of skill it has to be taught or you
have to pick it up in some way to be a
software developer yeah definitely how
many how many like people are on your
team software lives so there's there's a
one on my team there's another full
stack developer and a front-end
developer and then we have our project
manager and that's it on on another team
they have only one full stack developer
- and one front-end engineer with with
the project manager so like for the
whole company there's like you know six
or seven of us okay so very small all
right that's good that's kind of similar
to my work there's basically a senior
dev who's kind of full sack but he
basically just handles back in there's
myself for the front end another guy for
the front end oh cool
though we have an intern and then we
have one remote full sachdev that kind
of is part-time but yeah it seems to be
it one of the things I really like is
just having another program or to bounce
ideas off because I don't know how many
times your before hours in and your
brain is kind of a little foggy and
you're like what the hell am I doing
wrong here like yeah we haven't haven't
like another person just uh you know to
help you plan or to answer your
questions especially they have like more
experience than you you can't replace
that I think that's so valuable pair
programming and just brainstorming with
other people and and yeah you're right
it's frustrating to work on something
alone for so long but you start talking
it to it with another person and then uh
yeah how come I hadn't thought of this
you know like earlier yeah yeah I love
that you no reason for it to this
talking with other programmers I find I
find myself asking a question and like
you a lot of times you know when you're
coding something right you'll you have
to explain what you're trying to do I'm
trying to do this this is what's
happening and before you even like
finish this is what happening for me
it's like oh irony just solved it
right now like just exploded it out
yeah just even the action of just
talking out loud and you know some
people say like buy a rubber duckie and
talk to your rubber duckie and I think
just you know it's saying it out loud
and and and trying to like understand
your problem lucky yeah you're right
link most cases are you know it happens
just like that you're you're talking or
explaining to to somebody and then oh
yeah had thought that like thanks for
listening and then you go back and do
your work yeah yeah I have to
the me all the time now did you ever did
you ever consider working remotely or
were you always like look I'm gonna work
at a company to start or you have any
thoughts about that
well I wanted to you know my first job I
wanted to work with the team especially
with experienced developers you know I
know there's like advantages to working
remotely but I had spent most of my time
learning programming on my own and and
you know going and working remotely you
know that that would have been great you
know I'm not commuting the work but just
constantly like siloed I wanted to shake
that up so so I've decided to you know
join a company and you know get some
experience working alongside you know
people who are more experienced than I
am but that might be something I'd be
interested in the future working
remotely I can see why a lot of people
you know like that yeah I find that like
when I talk with people who haven't
really got their first job they're like
yeah I'm gonna work remote that's my
first job and I'm just like thinking
myself that's an awful idea cuz you need
you need other people because even the
remote devs work with other people
mm-hmm you need that experience as well
I've just I'm gonna pick up as much as I
can even for a couple years and then go
and mode but everyone has this like
glorified I must stay at home I'm not
gonna wear pants and my coat all day
well I like yeah you read about it like
a lot of these you know a great blog
post of digital nomads and they're
they're going to Thailand for for three
months and then to Vietnam and you know
all of these like great places and and I
think a lot of people they they you know
a lot of young people and people not
tied down but that's what do they want
to do they want to be digital nomads
it's a it's a very fun lifestyle and you
know being an expats really fun I was an
expat in Asia and yeah it's just you
live in
in a different country different culture
or even just staying at home yeah most
of the time that's like a lot of fun but
I agree I think in the very beginning
you know even if you you know have
taught yourself a long time or have gone
to a boot camp you're still you know
really junior like like I feel like I'm
still very junior you know I'm only a
month on the job and I have like lots to
learn and and I feel like you can just
accelerate that if you're in the same
room as you know other programmers you
know doing it remotely or working for
yourself you can still learn just maybe
not as quickly as somebody so some some
of you like us who go to a company how
was your like application process with
like when you're like okay I think I'm
ready to start applying places I feel
confident enough as a junior developer
when did like when did you know and then
also how did you go about it when you're
looking for work so - for the first
question when I started applying I
didn't feel like you know like 100% like
yeah I'm gonna show up on the first day
and be like a like a badass developer
you know I still had doubts and you know
confidence issues with that but you know
I had like one more month in Korea
before coming back to America
and I thought okay well ready or not I
should hit the ground running and start
working
whenever I get home so let me just start
applying now even though I don't
personally feel ready and and you know
like that let's just get the ball
rolling in and you definitely you know
I've had like some bad interviews where
you know walked away like feeling
terrible I've got like some really good
technical interviews to where where I
like have a huge boost in confidence and
you know helps convince myself that yeah
yeah I could really do this I could
really make it happen
so so even if you feel like you're not
100% ready I mean to just just do it
just just apply to places or we're
trying to get in touch with the hiring
managers and and
well you know if you can sneak in like a
first interview and get invited to a
technical interview that's just you know
more practice for you you know even if
they don't wind up hiring so I wouldn't
worry too much about it if you if you
could you know honestly you know you
know if you can honestly you know answer
by am I qualified for this job or you
know could I learn and fill in some of
the gaps on the job and just go for it
you don't have to be like you know a
badass developer right off the bat know
how when so after you got done it after
you decide like I'm gonna start applying
was there any sort of sites that you use
was how did you kind of go about it okay
so yeah I looked at a couple of websites
but but without too much luck you know
like I've used indeed and I think I had
like some some accounts set up like at
Stack Overflow and a few other places
and you know I would send out like you
know maybe maybe 10 or 20 applications
in a weekend just BAM down more often
than not those places you know didn't
respond to me maybe maybe one out of 20
applications that I applied through a
job site
somebody got back to me so that was
really tough to crack the the best the
best method for me at least was
contacting people directly on LinkedIn
and just initiating a conversation with
them the way I got my current job I
didn't apply formally and I didn't even
know they were hiring but I I had
noticed someone viewed my profile on
LinkedIn and in that he was a project
manager at this company so I said hey
what's up you checked out my profile do
you guys need any developers right now
and so through that conversation that I
initiated we went back
or I learned more about them and they
said yeah we're always hiring and
looking out for good so you know let's
have this like a first interview to see
if it's a good fit and you know boom got
my foot in the door with that company
and I didn't even apply put together my
resume or anything like that
nice yeah I always tell people when they
like start applying some people don't do
the basics right like you have to have
your Linkedin together you have to have
a look like you're a developer as much
as you can right put anything on it that
shows your developer and take take the
initiative when people are scanning your
pages go ahead and shoot them a message
is helpful like to also a lot of people
don't realize that if you sign up for
like the LinkedIn premium your apply to
jobs it becomes it goes to the top of
the list and you know a lot of these
jobs get hundreds of applications
sometimes that can be a value as well
it's interesting though so you're just
like a girl I saw you looking at my
portfolio yeah yeah exactly that that's
exactly how it went like hey and I see
you checking me out let's take this to
the next step to the next level and they
responded well to that so they said okay
you know what's your good hub or send
over your resume okay you don't have any
experience well well we can work with
that let me give you some coding
assignments and and see how well you do
with those and so yeah like don't be
afraid to reach out the worst thing that
will happen is they tell you they're not
interested at the moment or they're not
hiring at the moment but yeah that's
what LinkedIn is for for for networking
and connecting to people like
professionally and one of the things I
found very interesting what's the realm
of like good sounds like it sounds like
you you got high freq but like me I had
so many different programming challenges
and like different types of interviews
the own interviews email interviews I
had video chat interviews at coding
challenges that were like very basic to
like you basically want me to build an
entire web application no it was it's
crazy
depending on the company that you apply
for how vastly different the interview
process can be yeah oh yeah for for mine
at my company first it was like a
general
interview then then I had a coding
challenge that they that they gave me
and funny story is the they first gave
me the challenge while I was still in
Korea and yeah I was working as a
full-time teacher and I had some gaps in
knowledge at the time so so I couldn't
finish the the challenge and I submitted
that incomplete they said okay yeah your
front-end is good but your back-end
needs some some some work so um you know
we're not ready to hire you but that
like really upset me because I thought
dang yeah you know a lost some time I
didn't have like yeah I wasn't at home I
was working so I'm gonna redo the
assignment and like submit it to them
again so I did that a month later and
that really like caught their attention
because they had never had an applicant
like redo a coding challenge after you
know after getting rejected so they they
were like wow that's never happened how
about we give you another coding
challenge you know now that you're back
in America you have more time to do it
and then you know we'll go from there so
I did that one had like a final
interview and and yeah I was offered a
job like on the phone like on the spot
yeah and yeah it's just like happened
like really fast and suddenly I was like
oh yeah so you had to just just reach
out the people talk to them young you'll
you'll never like yeah yeah like I was a
surprise fight like how quickly
everything worked out and how yeah how
open people are to you know talking to
you on LinkedIn nice now let's jump over
to I I remember that if I remember
quickly a friend of yours who works at
Google set you up with an interview yes
what you want to share a little tidbit
about like that the process and anything
that you thought might have been
interesting about that yeah totally so I
have a friend he's a he's a linguist and
so he works he's not a software
developer although he does know some
programming but the key
he used the Google like referral program
so Google employees they refer their you
know friends or family to to Google's
like hiring pool and and I didn't ask
them I just asked them like general
questions about like you know working at
Google and and what it's like and he he
offered it to me he said oh I'll totally
refer you just uh you know get you
through the side door and when he did
that a Google recruiter reached out to
me we had a we had like a 30 minute
phone call and you know he thought okay
well I think you're ready for a
technical interview so we scheduled that
they gave me like three weeks to prepare
for it and then I have my technical
interview which was totally not what I
was expecting and they were they told me
you know to read certain books
yeah they recommend things like cracking
the coding interview and like really
computer science heavy like books like
that to brush up on my interview was a
little bit different and I can't I can't
go into it like to details because like
I had to sign document saying I couldn't
like reveal like exact questions and
things like that but man that was just
like really intimidating really scary
there were some general questions
followed by a coding challenge and I I
couldn't finish the channel it's like
during the phone call but like a week
later I thought let me try the coding
challenge again and like I finished it
in five minutes and I was like dang it
like like I was just like so nervous and
and I totally you know screwed up my my
chance to you know to do well on that
Google interview but but you know maybe
next year or in a couple of years I'll
try again and and just remind myself
that keep it cool and and yeah don't
sweat that the technical interviews too
much all right nice yeah I always
wondered like what the it sounds like we
can't get into the details too too much
for you
yeah we're all the interesting but I
always wondered like damn I wonder what
sort of ridiculous challenge you'd have
to be to get a developer gig at like
Google or Facebook or one of those
companies well they they stress and a
lot of the recommended videos and
resources they give you to prepare for
it
there's like a recurring theme that that
like getting it right the first time
or like even finishing it it's not like
a hard-and-fast requirement basically a
Google like interview where they want to
hear like your thought process and they
want to hear you thinking out loud
asking you know really good clarifying
questions and and solving it you know
quickly without you know it's speaking
that could be even be like perceived as
negative like during a Google interview
so you so you say yeah it's a it's
challenging and Google that they're
doing their due diligence to find new
good developers but it's not like it's
not as crazy as you know one might
imagine it would be nice I'm applying
today no go for it man yeah one day one
day all right guys
in about five minutes or so we're gonna
if anybody has any questions for myself
or Steven go ahead and type them out in
chat and we'll answer them
how do you how do you like living in
Texas yeah Texas is great I live in
Austin which is like a it's a it's a
progressive city and it's unlike any
other place in Texas it's sort of like
you know if any any viewers are from
like the south I'm originally from
Louisiana another conservative state but
you know like New Orleans is sort of
like open and intolerant and party
central Austin this is sort of the same
thing in Texas it's a it's a really cool
place and there's like so many companies
here you got Intel you got Dropbox home
away
you know it's so many great companies
big and small yeah I really like Austin
so far I uh Albert Ramos asked since
there are almost no dev jobs in my small
town should I list a different city to
get on people's radar I'm guessing
stalking like only is LinkedIn or
something well man that's a that's a
really difficult question for me like
I've always become accustomed to to you
know moving around and and letting you
know employers know that I'm open to
relocating I'm not you know sure about
the personal situation of this of this
viewer here what I would say to them is
you know a location or casting a wider
net might be a good idea they couldn't
hurt but also have a friend or a mentor
give a good review of your LinkedIn
profile for me changing that your title
or sort of that subtitle that you have
on your profile when I changed it to
full stack web developer I started
getting like more abused to my profile
more people asking and requesting to
connect with me being very specific and
like writing out like really concise but
like measurable and descriptive some
sort of phrases for your past jobs and
projects I mean this is the stuff people
are looking for so yeah get a good
review of your LinkedIn profile be very
specific include like measurements
display your hard work and call yourself
full stack web developer for a year for
your LinkedIn profile and that for me at
work that perhaps recruiters you know
you know search for certain terms like
like that and and yes so yeah just just
change your title there's something else
I know oh go ahead I know for me when I
was applying so I'm in Florida now and I
was applying I was willing to move
anywhere in the United States basically
yeah
I love Florida by the way now no income
taxes sold me but in terms X is June
yeah no income tax hey one of the places
I was looking at but in terms of if
you're willing to move around you need
to have that kind of on your resume if
you submit a resume because I know I
know that I got considered much more
when I just put like my little statement
like you know working hard developer
willing to relocate for a great
opportunity you just put that willing to
relocate in there yeah those people will
tend to look at your resume much more
than your out-of-state yeah the state
yeah that kind of worked of both ways
for me when I was talking to recruiters
you know a lot of recruiters they'll
they'll hire locally or regionally so
it's it's a it's a little unusual if
you're far away and they're like okay
well why did you apply through you know
my recruitment agency or over here and
like Maine but you want to you want to
talk to us in Colorado so you just have
to explain yourself like like you said
you know very very clearly because yeah
that can be confusing to recruiters
because they often you know look you
know kind of like short distances and
and and you will get turned down by like
recruiter agencies that only do in-house
interviews so know exactly personally
because they happen to be a bunch of
times where they were like very
interested and I'm like oh you live in
California well we're in Texas do you
want to drive out I was like do you want
to fly me out cuz I do that drive yeah
yeah alright let's see let's see you're
good question by the way I'll break I
like that one yeah thanks comfort
Where's Waldo asks when you first
started coding did you tend to forget
elements or functions or did you get it
right away a lot a lot of a lot of
people seem to have like a hard time
remembering syntax and for moon yeah
when when I first started out I was
making like flashcards using like the
Anki and in like on my commute to work
on the subway I would go through the
flashcards to review the syntax but I
stopped doing it because it took a long
time to prepare those flashcards and
and I found that yeah just working on
tons of projects like all the time you
know you do it like again and again and
again eventually just like it's this
muscle memory and if I ever forget
something I mean that that's why we have
Google in the docs I don't remember all
of the bootstrap classes but I use you
know a handful of them like a hundred
times by now so yeah just by like lots
of repetition you'll you'll pick up and
remember things for all the other stuff
you know like yeah things that you'll
need on it like on as an eBay --ss it
just just look it up so don't don't
worry about like remembering things that
there's there's just too much damn stuff
to remember and it's constantly changing
have the attitude of okay go with the
flow just just just build if I need
something look it up stop playing with
me asked which is a very strange name by
the way I thought I feel like maybe this
dude got dumped her was strung along
yeah that's that's for another
conversation stop playing with me man
yeah that's not funny with me how do the
big companies view applicants who
learned via boot camps rather than
traditional college degrees so I mainly
interviewed with the smaller companies
but but generally I think the consensus
or I think like the general like
attitude is that that you know like yeah
let me back up here a lot of a lot of
job postings you know they have that you
know computer science degree like
required or preferred yeah I think
statements like this is just to kind of
discourage people to shorten like the
number of applicants who apply those
postings are usually written by HR a
specialist or project managers not
really technically you know minded
people
so yeah whether or not you have a
computer science degree you've gone to a
boot camp or
I think most companies they are you know
looking for individuals who can
demonstrate that that they have that
they have the ability to learn new
things quickly that they can assimilate
into the company culture they can
demonstrate you know they have a wide
range of skills by by showing you know
applications and projects that they've
built but by showing work that they've
built like alone and with the team so so
I think you can get away and and find a
job and be successful in your job search
without having you know spend having
spent you know thousands of dollars at a
boot camp or for a computer science
degree at a two or four-year university
yeah you just have to hustle a lot and
and definitely you know meet people try
to reach out to them and initiate a
conversation but yeah I think most
companies have the attitude that do you
have the skills that we're looking for
it can can you be a badass developer in
the making are you a promising candidate
and I think that's totally okay for most
companies other companies like Google
well that they are looking for you know
someone with a solid like foundation of
computer science skills but a lot of the
smaller mid-sized companies I think they
give people like us a chance people who
have changed careers a chance which is
awesome I think you brought up a good
point about the recruiters because I
know when I was applying I didn't put
get or like github on my resume I had in
one dad three phone interviews and all
three brought it up to me and then like
I was out of my mind for not putting git
or github on there but it's because even
though we're gonna use git it's like a
lot of recruiters just have this
checklist like do you have this do you
have this yeah this anything they're HR
they don't know what hTML is they just
say hey you didn't have it on his resume
so we're gonna shoot that sky aside
exactly exactly right if so
yeah just you know go through your
LinkedIn you know I have a friend or a
mentor look through your resume too and
don't be discouraged by these like
seemingly like you high barrier sort of
you know job postings that it was not
written by you know technical people
just go ahead and apply and you can
clear up anything in the interview or
the email correspondence my advice when
looking at job apps if you meet 50
percent of the requirements you're
probably in the top like twenty percent
of candidates because some of these
funerals are like absolutely ridiculous
that the perfect candidate is already
hired as a senior developer somewhere
else like you're looking for a junior
dev and you fifty percent of canister
probably have pretty good shins yeah I
think so too
absolutely oh let's see here any other
good questions see all these others are
a little too specific yeah anything you
wanted to talk about why we require here
I think we've discussed everything that
I kind of wanted to cover today yeah
look guys I mean if you really want this
if you really want to make the move and
to you know change careers and you
possibly you know turn your life around
and you know make some more money or do
something you know worthwhile if you
really want a career in programming it
can happen it's not going to happen
overnight yeah it may not happen you
know over three or four months but but
it will happen and you just have to keep
hustling and working and practicing and
encoding every day we have to stay in
touch with people meet people you know
start groups help other people
contribute to projects but eventually it
is going to happen so don't give up
don't feel like you'll ever you won't
ever be ready I still feel like that now
but you know according to my co-workers
I'm doing a pretty good job so all of
that doubt and fear that you have it's
mostly generated by by you yeah that's
this all in your head
so just do it remind yourself of the
reasons why you're doing it and and for
me that gave me that the fuel to keep
going for a long long way
remind yourselves why you're why you're
doing this while you're getting a new
career nice if anybody wants to follow
you where can they they go your YouTube
or Twitter or anything like that
man I'm all over the web you can find me
at my youtube channel I am mr. Steve
Mayu and and I'm sure we'll share the
link with the years the viewers another
time you can find my free code camp
tutorials and other tutorials there you
can go to Twitter and I am at ESL hip
hop and I said that's my old teacher
account but I still use this yes l hip
hop is that is yeah that was my first
website it was a wordpress blog and and
I was teaching English using hip-hop
music so that was my first sort of a
kind of delve into the programming world
using WordPress but that's my Twitter
handle as well
ESL hip-hop it's a pretty cool website
man you know when I chopped this video
it still up the website yeah yeah you
can go to when I chop this video up
later on we're definitely gonna have to
