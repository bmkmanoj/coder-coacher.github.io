in our final section let's see where is
it trigger building cash register
objects - so we're gonna create a new
object here called cash register what's
a total initialized to 0 so create the
object called cash register should be a
hint here
oh it just says you don't know by now go
back and look so we want to create a
function cash register brackets and
actually let's do it this way of our
cash register equals new function our
new object rather and this new object
has a total property
actually you know okay and we'll say
cash register dot total and then cash
register dot total equals zero
and then cash are just totally equal
make those two point nine nine there you
go so we create our cash for sure we
gave an initial total of zero and then
we reset it with two point nine nine all
right use the add method is somewhat the
cost of following four items let's see
our ad so we're basically the say our
total plus item total all right so call
the add method on our items so we're
going to say cash register dot ad and
then we need to put in 0.9 0.98 then
we're gonna say cash register add and
you could also do this and one method
like doing a plus maybe we'll break it
up here it's a plus four point nine nine
and then we'll do cash register dot add
the only reason this problem might not
work is if they wanted us to do it a
certain way so what we should get the
same toll all right so let's check this
one out
maybe they don't want us to do it like
that
so we have cash register dot ad and
we're going to add oh if we only call
the method once it only add the first
item so add the cost of how many times
will you have to call them ok so
apparently they say this one add so
let's do actually let's just let's
experiment a little bit here let's try
some brackets here so and then we'll do
plus 4.99 this should work
oh my god doesn't work all right uh
scratch everything I just said we'll do
it one more time I in theory it should
work though that's it's certainly off
here but it this could just be part of
their their program where they want you
to do it a certain way and it doesn't
work so those are 7.65 for whatever
reason it was given us a longer decimal
but uh don't worry about that right now
I suppose alright um right the add
method which has a single parameter item
costs and item cost so the total so
insert add method here so we're gonna
have guys we are going to restart this
section right here because I was
stumbling on anyone put up a 15 minute
video of me just stumbling over a comma
but that's basically what was happening
so we're gonna we have to add a function
here and it's gonna take in a parameter
item cost and what I was doing before is
putting a semicolon here and the issue
with that is there's more functions so
semicolon ends the additional function
so that's why that was causing an error
and you know let's let's just continue
on so we have this dot total equals this
total plus item cost and then from here
we want to add two case statements one
is for magazine
then we want to add the VAT the price of
that which is four point nine nine and
then we want to break it little one more
case statement chocolate and this dot
add zero point four or five and then we
want to break it as well
and then we want to scan two eggs and
three magazines so we're going to call
the scan function on eggs and then skin
finish in on magazine oh and scan
function eggs one more time
save us mythical have you scanned eggs
twice the magazine Elle magazine three
times okay so and have you scanned eggs
twice a magazine three times yes
scan two eggs and three magazines scan
is not defined let's cut this out and
see what's going on here your bill is
zero
I believe we have to have this in here
in quotes huh
I'm generally stopped
so we're gonna take this copy we're
gonna go up to an example here let's
flip a new page and we're gonna see
what's going on here see if anyone
oh okay I see what simple mistake
basically we needed to because this is a
function that uses a object it's an
object function you wanna call it that
so we have to call the dots can I forget
that we're working with objects now all
right so can can't just call it because
it needs an object to run to run it say
if it's a Makonnen there we go bill 1693
a little bit of a brain fart modified
scan method so such that if we tell it
the quantity of each item it should be
able to add at the right amounts as you
currently tell scan nothing about
quantity and may be used to create
another parameter that is true want want
it t all right make sure it's fill
spelling it right so in this case so you
even cleaned up our Oh
alright our scan function so we're gonna
put x quant 2t
and I like spacing this out
actually
you don't need this
and then and now scan each item four
times all right so we're gonna need our
cash register again we're gonna call the
dot scan method and we'll just do it in
order first we have our eggs that's our
item parameter then we have our quantity
4 then we have our cash register again
not scan and then we have milk and we're
gonna do that four times as well and
then cash register not scan and then we
have our magazine that's four and then
we have our cash register scan and
that's our chocolate before and now we
should be good to go BAM and then we
have a thirty dollar bill cool
we need to keep track of how much the
last transaction was modify the admits
that keep track of the amount in the
last transaction should be tracked a new
property last transaction amount
all right so modify the add method all
right so I wanna my I modified the add
method and how do we want to do this
so first thing first let's do what they
tell us to do last transaction amount
the code chosen a shorter name you think
add a method called void last
transaction all right
had a method called void last
transaction this attracts the last
amounts all right why are we adding this
and we'll say this dot last transaction
amount equals item costs and then from
here we will add we need to avoid
- transaction and this is going to take
in the parameter from last transaction
actually this is our gonna take any
parameters it's just gonna do something
I believe I believe
and in here we're gonna say total equals
total excuse me this dot total equals
this not total
- loss transaction that amount
I don't think we did this right but
we'll find out in a second here so we
want to avoid the last transaction so
you want to just call void last
transaction and then we want to add then
at 3 instead Adam and then use a new
method so we're gonna then call cash
register dot scan and our last item was
chocolate and we only want to do 3 so
let's go ahead and see what air we get
cuz we're gonna get an air reference
error void last transaction it's not
fine looks again code check their
message for more details wait the last
transaction
modify the Edomites they keep track of
the amount of the last transaction
so when we add an item it's going to
increase the total is then going to so
as we need this parameter I just don't
see how
souvenir like this flower
all right so I'm a little confused so
just go to the Q&amp;amp;A forum see what's
going on here you see some examples
we're on five of seven it's an odd
function item' cost' this not last
transaction equals item costs okay yeah
so that makes sense
and then last transaction
all right so we're gonna say this dot
last transaction amount equals item cost
from there when they avoid the last
transaction we're gonna say this dot
total equals this dot total minus last
transaction amount yes that should make
that make sense to me look at another
example
this is the same thing we wrote let's
compare it to make sure so avoid last
chance
we have our function let me say this not
totally Eagles Oh
it's not last transaction
to a little first at your property ad
so avoiding it oops dang and I think we
may have made the same mistake yes we
did
okay so we're searching for stuff for
errors that aren't there when the air
that is we have to remember that we're
working with objects again and that we
need to avoid the last transaction with
the cash register object so you create
an object constructor like staff member
which takes two parameters all right so
we go
just say what's the name so we have
Sally and Bob so we'll have how about
bill bar bill equals new staff member
this is how I prefer creating objects
it's just simpler to me so for the name
can objects are called staff members X
two parameters name and discount percent
alright so we'll just have name comma
discount percent
I'll show you I can channel flies
animals gonna say I created object
concern staff member which takes two
parameters name discount percent okay
and then have the public properties name
and discount percent equal to so let's
say Phil dot name I don't know why this
last one is throwing me off so much
okay there we go so we're creating a new
staff member so of our staff member is a
function that has a discount okay so
we're not creating new stuff and we're
creating a variable and this is gonna be
equal to a function with the name
parameter and the discount parameter or
discount percent rather and in here
we're gonna say that these are we're
basically just gonna say this saw name
equals name and this discount percent
equals discount percent and then we are
going to create a new instance object so
we'll say VAR me equals new staff member
those new staff member and we're gonna
set the name to Dylan and we'll have a
20 percent discount
well we don't actually do anything with
it
a lot of code here on line 10 credit new
object called me so I've army and of the
type South R equals a new staff member
and in here we'll call them Dylan and
then discount for senator 20 create a
new method called apply create a new
method called apply staff discount in
the cash register object alright so in
here we're gonna add a new method fly
staff discount and this is going to be a
function that takes in employee
all right
and
should apply staffers discount percent
to
the total all right so
under the common apply your staff just
you calculate percent discount employee
discount okay so we actually I was
thinking we might have to alter the code
completely but all we have to do is this
so we can do like this total times
employee got discount divided by 100
they're real 1718
of discount percent
oh let's look at the example here is a
stout 12 times employee discount percent
divided one hundred under the common
apply your staff discount
oh we forgot to apply here so we'll say
me dot so that's object me dot apply
what is it the name of it staff just
account under the comment apply your
staff discount by passing the meet
object color your noose supply discount
past the object to me so in here we need
the cash register dot actually so we're
gonna say cash register
dot apply staff discount will save me
there's a problem with your syntax so
let's cut this out and see if we get the
same error here false cash register we
call the apply staff discount for the me
dot not discount percent okay so let's
take a look at an example real quick one
seven two seven cuz I think this right
yes cash will apply staff discount done
just me as we had it before
Bam Bam five staff discount
just for the sake of argument let's put
this where it needs to go and I think I
see where our air is right now so what's
going on here is excuse me we need to
apply it down here BAM there we go
your bill is 344 now why is it saying
oops
try again false so we saved discount
percent twenty divided by hundred so
employee discount percent is 20%
so let's see if how they declared their
function
damn sure sure
it's not tall create a methane fly staff
discount function employee
hmm
what should our bill be so we're buying
one eggs which is 0.98 plus one milk
we're just one point two three plus 15
for the three magazines minus three
cents that's 14 21 and then you get a
20% discount so we times that by 0.8 so
should be $11 and change or it should be
like 14 so let's go ahead and take this
out and see so there's a 17 point one
eight so 17 point one eight times 0.8
equals 13
all right so 1375 five basically
- oh sure to apply staff discount me
there's a problem with your syntax
hmm
all right so a section seven of seven
going
scan function item comma quantity void
less transaction fly staff discount this
dot toll
all right I think we may have declared
this wrong going off their version there
we go so don't use their discounting of
course it because it was working we were
just getting the wrong input and we
finished JavaScript last little section
stumbled upon but hey we did it up next
for JavaScript I'm not actually gonna
jump straight into jQuery I know a lot
of businesses are really interested in
jQuery if you can get good with this in
JavaScript you shouldn't have any
problem finding a job but what we're
what I'm gonna do over the next couple
days it's do some API so there's quite a
few api's in JavaScript
Appaji I don't know how is that the
YouTube one though I've never heard that
rather YouTube I'll probably that'll be
the first one we do SoundCloud is a good
one and yeah so there's what there's
like three API for API is in JavaScript
alone so next section we'll be doing the
api's and if we look at like if you go
to your profile
let's see view my profile just some of
where is it they have a like your course
thing yours you're like oh it's what
courses what they recommend you takes
course overview I can't find it right
now but in the next videos look forward
to the YouTube API s and the other API
is in JavaScript and once we get through
that will probably start jQuery so I'll
see you guys the next video sorry about
the stumbling around here but hey that's
just part of coding sometimes you got to
work through it and as always anything
constructors always</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
