talking about free code camps 2017 new
coders survey I haven't actually taken
it yet it's completely anonymous I don't
know what the questions are but it's
literally a 5-minute survey for people
who have been coding seriously for five
years or less which is probably the bulk
of you has already had 17,000 people
filled out and with how great free code
camp is and and I'm sure they're gonna
use all this data to improve I wanted to
kind of do a shout-out as well let
people know that this existed you know I
didn't know until someone tweeted it at
me and I found out I was like cool let's
talk about it let's do it and let's jump
right in so let's see what sort of
questions they're asking I'm already
working as a software developer yes I am
is this your first software developer
job yes it is which online resource have
you found helpful w3schools is great
well we'll give em damn good free code
camp stackoverflow codecademy and it
looks like a hotkey tal that which is
pretty cool um that's about it for me
other as well um actually I guess I
haven't had any uh I guess just youtube
youtube videos is its kind of my main
thing on here alright cool uh if you
have intended any in person coding
related events before which ones we
found helpful they do a lot of women who
code I haven't done some free code camp
groups some workshops as well meet up to
com events hackathons I know we can boot
cancel I'd like to I haven't gone into
any conferences although I would like to
as well um that's about all that I've
done in terms of in-person stuff
if you listen to Cody related podcast
before which once if you found helpful
none of these hey Quincy where's my ass
cadet know where is the behind the code
now I'm just came in ah although one day
one day we'll be on this list voice I
hope so but actually don't listen to any
podcasts so shame on me for that I have
done that so I i'm going to select other
actually all right just like any and I'm
i hit enter that I haven't listening if
you watch Cody related YouTube's Video
which channels have you found helpful I
have watched coding train once code
course who I'm interviewing soon I've
watched some of his when I was looking I
have watched also google developers I've
watched Learning Academy the New Boston
I know of level up that's when I haven't
watch this Derek bonus is a good one I
don't really watch free code camp too
much Hey look at your boy right there
hey I like that shout out the engineer
truth as well Oh some fun function dev
tips all big guys would i add up I've
been watching the other videos um 11 guy
i will put in here is Trevor see Trevor
stream media apologize if I think of why
there that's another one that i have
that i've used how many hours you spend
learning each week if you count the
amount of Valerie's i spend at work
which is 40 and i would say it's
somewhere between 10 and 20 so we'll
stay 50 5 10 and 20 10 and 20 hours at
home or so we'll just say somewhere 55
say it's about 15 how many months have
you been programming for
so in total probably like 48 so we'll
say 48 from the beginning 48 months I
might end up full time coding boot camp
No aside from university tuition how
much of each spent learning to code so
far in u.s. dollars I've hired a tutor
twice for thirty dollars an hour another
tutor for ten dollars an hour so that's
70 uh try and think I think 70 bucks I
chose you think is expend anything where
I've paid for courses and i usually
don't buy courses not that you shouldn't
but I just haven't so seventy seventy
dollars save and next awesome they're
gonna learn more about our background so
these are all pretty cool questions to
kind of get to know people who are
learning code what resources are using
on how to move forward l damn i'm 29
years old i am male what country I of
the United States of America countries
currently living in odd States of
America how many people live in your
city I think I don't know how BIG's
Tampa population of st. Pete Florida
249,000 hi coat so so we're between that
and that are you ethnic minority in your
country I don't think so we just weak
english which slice agree i have some
college credit single never married do
you financially support independence
technically no but i am financially
supporting the girlfriend do I have any
debt yes I have twenty two hundred
dollars in debt on my car payment
student loan know regarding employment
status are you currently employed for
wages self-employed I I guess this would
be employed for wages like full full
time what Phil do you work in software
development in IT how much money did you
make last year ah last year I made
always had a salary of 45,000 I worked
out for nine months and I had a salary
62,000 for the last three months so I
plus YouTube have probably made like
55,000 this year I should make about 75
so it's been a good year for me why you
need to stay focused with coding as well
so that you can do very well for
yourself coming minutes to the thing you
get to work 15 to 29 minutes do you
consider yourself under employed I'm
glad they put this because this is not
what I thought underfoot look so under
employment means working a job that slow
your education level I don't think that
I I thought underemployed was going to
be like you needed more hours like your
part time you wanna be full-time um I've
not served in the military I did not
receive disability benefits do you have
a high speed internet your home I do and
we are done so um if you guys want to
check out the the survey and contribute
you can in the link below and you can
review the live results let's see if we
can see some results real quick about
what's going on it's all I'll have this
link in the description as well and you
get everyone can check it out and see
what's going on actually let's see here
let's do the outcome section here let's
see what's going on I think I like I
find this stuff very interesting so we
did the survey you saw what I answered
you learned a little bit about me I
encourage you all to fill out the survey
as well let's see what's going on so 20
one-fourth of us who filled this out of
the 17,600 our software developer
is the other three forts are aspiring
software developers is this your first
software developer job fifty-eight
percent said yes so out of those people
uh sixty percent of us are just getting
started oh that wasn't supposed to sound
so cool uh um I don't think I got asked
this question I think get asked this
question either maybe maybe only got
this if that skip over this or maybe I
maybe I only get some questions um with
you oh maybe these are questions for
people who who are not developers
already you'll see only 8,500 people
answers meetup.com / events in the most
common in person and you can see here
online resources of course is going to
be 70 suffers a pre code camp because uh
the other day this is a free code camp
surveyed be very surprised if most
atlantis a free code can um Kody release
rated podcast twenty-nine percent said
other interesting so they have a lot on
here that people don't have listed um
hey let's see you did your boy get any
love hey we got ten percent of the vote
a man we got make it top five though
baby top five is where we're trying to
go um that's dope though I feel good
about that hey let's screenshot this bad
boy we're screenshot in it for the
facebook group I like that all right so
uh number one free coke camp I don't
really watch free code camps youtube
videos but I can see how that could be
helpful I'm surprised to see that a lot
more people watch the google developer
channel and the New Boston learn code
Academy Derek bonus needs to be higher
than dev tips in my opinion but whatever
have you done a full coding boot camp
nine
you for a percent no I'm that's uh that
is a astounding number which ones out of
those the number one was General
Assembly iron yard they do that in so
you can see right here that the bulk of
these are split up from this 900 amongst
various boot camps have you finish it
did you take out a loan to pay for the
boot camp thirty-one percent said yes
seventy percent said no so seventy
percent of people are paying this out of
out of pocket just straight up it's on
your boot camp would you recommend this
to a friends so about eighty percent
would say yes and the rest would say no
and I don't care too much about the
demographics as we we just went over
once similar stack overflow but uh it's
kind of interesting so I hope you guys
still out the survey and as always if
