in manage packages with NPM we are doing
the started project in this video so
let's go ahead and open up your
workspace from the c9i oh boy that's
right I'm going to it go ahead and open
up a monster real quick and I'm going to
take some of my study juice pills a
brain for ease of product and just take
some of these trying to get a whole lot
done YouTube wise today so
monster focus alright if you don't
already have this menu up all you have
to do is type in how - - NPM you can see
I did it right here and go to start a
project so NPM helps you build project
but NPM might not be able to do that but
for IBM to be able to do that you need
to um feel a little bit of a project you
tell about like create a file called
package JSON so every NPM every every
project is gonna have this package JSON
so remember how we created user name
mine with CT 360 now we're gonna run
we're gonna do NPM an it we're gonna
initialize it right this - - scope and
then equal CT 360 and replace user name
with the username this will create our
package JSON file so cool um now let me
do that we can simply run LS oh whoops
so I may have messed up so you'll see
that it gives us a bunch of other things
right here that we can or and then we
say how do we go No all right so we're
gonna abort it you see how I entered
that last right there let's go ahead and
do that one more time that was NPM
in it - just scope then equal to RC -
360 ok so we want our workspace to be
this name right here so hit enter the
version that we're gonna start with is
1.0 description we can leave that blank
entry point index ijs test command git
repository keywords author license hit
enter if you're ok with that
we can now go ahead and hit LS here and
you'll see that we have our package JSON
file created we also take away that
there was a bunch of other stuff that we
could add it that wasn't necessarily
required to get going here so to make
sure that we did everything correctly we
should go ahead and run the NPM command
how to NPM and then verify your solution
is not correct it looks like you are in
the wrong folder and then try again so
uh wrong folder so let's see how to NPM
and p.m. print let's see our
instructions this will create a package
JSON file how - to - NPM verify package
dot JSON looks like you're in the wrong
folder please CD into a Bhutto workspace
so LS we are in the correct folder um
let's see what's going on here so far
yeah we're in here we're in here with
this our workspace MERIS dude so we're
having a little bit of an issue here now
I had something similar happen where I
had to actually close this and then open
it again for it to take effect so let's
see if that's what's going on here
all right so how - - - and p.m. verify
okay it looks like you were in the wrong
folder so what are we doing incorrect
here CD into home on boot to workspace
so CD so it's CT 360 okay now how - to -
NPM verify oh it looks like we may have
actually done it in the wrong folder so
see how we're our workspace we want to
actually do it here I believe easy
enough we go ahead and create to do the
same thing how to NPM and then choose
not how to NPM NPM in it - check scope
equal to CT 360 so just go ahead and
enter like we did before
okay so now our package JSON is in the
correct spot and we'll probably need to
go ahead and remove that so let's go
ahead and make sure we did this correct
before you move on how to - NPM verify
perfect okay so really wrong we we we
went we created a package like JSON
correctly we did in the wrong spot so
let's go ahead and jump back a spot by
hitting dot dot and then we want to say
NPM RM package dot JSON this should
remove it so
so you see no repository filled now why
didn't it remove our package.json we
also just delete it from here by by
doing it like so oh cool so you just
manually delete it as well by
right-clicking and calling it a day and
then now when we run how to - NPM you'll
see that we have completed this and
we'll go on to installing a module in
