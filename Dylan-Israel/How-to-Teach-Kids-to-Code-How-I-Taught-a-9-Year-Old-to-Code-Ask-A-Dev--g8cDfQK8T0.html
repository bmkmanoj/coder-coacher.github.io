teach your kids or young kids or maybe
you're a little brother a little sister
how to code and what I've learned
tutoring people that young right so I
tutored a eight-year-old for about six
months and I made some mistakes in the
beginning I had some successes in the
mid partner by the end things are really
really going well it's actually really
fulfilling going there and it was a
different different stage different
different thing that I expected so first
thing before you get sorry I want to
mention this it's a limited time only we
have about probably by the time this
video goes out to be eight days and
what's on here is it's a humble bundle
and use my link below so you can support
me at the same time to the affiliate
link it'd be appreciated but you can see
for a dollar you can get five books that
are going to help you teach your kids or
children to code and we're in talks
specifically about scratch jr. but what
I can say is that more than anything
else especially when you're talking
about young young children I'm going to
talk about like 15 16 year-old and yes
you still are children right so look
that always kill me when my parents
would call any children that is 15 and
16 but hey I get to do it now but up but
um the thing is to keep your kids or
your these young young kids interested
right and so one way of doing that is
doing things with like Minecraft right
Legos and going down top you'll see
right here they have a manga guide
there's other stuff as well more Lego
Arduino inventing games with Python a
Lego animation books oh and a bunch of
other stuff so I just wanted to mention
that because they're for a limited time
and at very least for a dollar or more
you can pick up five books for you for
yourself or for your kids and for 15 you
can pick up 15 books so basically a
dollar a book and you always have the
the opportunity to choose how much and
where your money goes to as well if you
wanted to give it all to me I'm going to
hate on you if you don't want to give
any to me I'm going to hate on you it's
just there for you support and whatnot
so with all that being said let's talk
about what I what I learned personally
teaching children and essentially at the
end of the day teaching 32 bright
because that's kind of what we do
doesn't that wasn't necessarily the goal
that's kind of what we do more
importantly so I I was tutoring this
eight-year-old for about maybe six
months uh once a week I would go down to
her parents law firm in Los Angeles and
I would I would tutor for uh in in they
lived above the law firm and I would
tutor tutor in the the study first thing
that I tried to do was in college at the
time and such a teacher job this is by
far the dumbest idea I think I ever had
the time teach an eight year old java
part of the reason for that is oh good a
year old learn Java yeah sure stay here
oh this is the codeine Einstein of the
century perhaps but the in reality the
average eight year old doesn't have the
analytic ability to completely visualize
the code and a lot of it comes down to
being able to memorize it and so I spent
the first two weeks trying to do that in
sheets you picked up a few concepts
which is good you kind of expose it but
I could tell that she was born
uninterested and didn't enjoy it so from
there we moved on to we moved on to HTML
CSS JavaScript and this is when things
and I could see that she start getting
interested right so her big thing was
she was very interested in Pokemon
everything was Pokemon she would show
I'd show up she talked to me about
Pokemon and I think she really liked the
fact that I'm kind of a dork and I could
talk back to about Pokemon but you
always have to keep them on track right
the parents own the parents don't pay
you at that time I was getting paid a
premium because I was a tutoring session
I think I was getting paid fifty dollars
an hour and I was there for ninety
minutes a week and trust me I needed
that 75
so I had to be pretty professional all
right not just wasting time but so what
we did was we built a kind of the free
code camp tribute page if you will and
we built it with a pokemon tribute page
I believe it was a Charizard right
that's always everybody's favor his
charge all right actually no it wasn't
charged our I said Charizard she said
one of those new the new
Pokemon which I it's all about the
original hundred and fifty or however
many of their work might not if they
come on the Raider blue disk it doesn't
count all right so yeah that's what
that's what we did and that was when she
started liking it she could visualize
this she could understand that this
moved this here that moved that there
and it you know there's a lot of help
but she was enjoying it she she could
tell that I still that she she wasn't
just hating her life every time I was
there I was a big thing
part of the reason I just say to you
guys is finalist meetups find those
those groups find those things that you
enjoy so that you can enjoy coding long
term right because it's truly really
important for you to to be successful at
this is you have to go and find what
makes it fun for you and that for me is
YouTube and it's and done very helpful
in my fashion so eventually after
spending about a month on here while we
have we decided to go down the scratch
jr. route now if you're not familiar
scratch jr. scratch jr. is a a free tool
that you can use on a tablet or PC I
believe
yeah and a PC because we're doing on the
PC so essentially what it is is it's a
drag-and-drop coding interface for kids
and it's interactive right so you can
see here they're like building a game or
you know you're basically building a
small game using this and I it's built
by the some guys at MIT and it's uh yeah
the MIT Media Lab
and it's probably the number one way
that they teach young kids how to code
now they're not actually learning
JavaScript or anything like that but
they are learning concepts are learning
how for loops work they're learning a
little bit of terminology and more than
anything else so the stuff that I preach
is they're learning how to think like a
developer they're learning how to to
take concepts that aren't that aren't
that complicated in terms of what they
do also what the for loop just repeats
things what that statement means if you
have five dollars at six dollars you
can't go forward so that would be you
know they just break it down piece by
piece and make it enjoyable in the
process right so they can share their
games to play their games and so we step
that's what we started to and I have to
say and you can see right here so like
these little puzzle pieces are dragging
and dropping instructions together that
would be bits and pieces of code and I
have to say that it is pretty well put
together for what it is and at the very
least I can really testify that she
loved it and and so I think there's
three books on scratch jr. here so
definitely check that out
if that's something that you're
interesting because it's it really is a
great resource and that's really what
you should hope for when teaching your
you know younger brother or sister or
your son or daughter or anybody else
what to what happy you shouldn't teach
you shouldn't sits sit high goals of hey
I want this person to start coding
websites that's a night at such a young
age you should teach them to love it and
eventually they will get there right so
even if at age eight all she does is
scratch jr. by the time that she's 12 if
she decides that hey you know what is it
that you're coding you know mom dad
brother sister why is it so much
different than mine well this is you
know what they use in the working world
and then also like can I get a shot yeah
and then you teach them that but the the
the hurdle of having to reprogram their
brain
that sink like a developer Ilana is
going to be gone now it's going to be
just something new right a new tool say
it's kind of like you've already learned
JavaScript now you got to move to the
Python is yeah there is not going to be
perfect but you've learned how a
language works you learned how
programming works and in that that's the
hardest part in my opinion so it might
the summarize a scratch jr. is a great
tool also try and do something visual
have them build something when we
finally switch to building that pokemon
tribute page it was so much fun for her
she enjoyed it she even understood
object-oriented programming right I was
like all right cool so we're going to
design this lits today we're building a
pokemon right we're going to design
we're going to design this and why'd you
I don't do very good with children so
like I'm super uncomfortable around them
because I don't have it I know I'm the
youngest in my family my brother and I
the most part of my mom's like nine
brothers and sisters and so all their
kids are older and we never had like the
young cousins or or anything like that
running about they all have kids now I
don't see them too often but they all
have kids now and I'm uncomfortable aura
around them because I just haven't been
exposed to children and the ones that I
do are usually screaming and yelling and
at Walmart that's not that's the best
excuse but in this it's kind of fun
right so you get to all right you got to
relate it right after relay it's like
alright well there's this thing called
objects in programming and what it
basically means is that we're going to
set parameters for a pokemon today so
ever Pokemon class and what does a
pokemon have and she's like it has a
type unless you named types and again
they added to types like Dragon
and fairy and stuff like that we all
know that the original we talked about
the fire the ice the water the plant the
rock the psychic I believe are the
ghosts so the og types but alas okay so
she wants the Dragon Type O so all right
we'll go with the Dragon type and then
it's like okay well
I named this Pokemon so that'd be what
is that a thing oh that's a string and
you know okay we have ability what's it
but you have more than one abilities so
you store that in one array because
that's a list right
they start breaking it down and stuff
that they find enjoyable and that they
they like long term so that's my two
cents guys about about how to teach your
kids out of code as well as some great
free restock free but low cost rather
resources available for you for a
limited time for this video we'll do a
giveaway traversing media was kind
enough to send us some copies of his new
bootstrap 4 course with 5 projects so
we're giving away one of those and all I
want for you guys is to like and
subscribe and can the new keyword I I'm
getting kind of sick of keywords I want
people to tell me if they have an
experience with teaching others code
this I have to be children necessarily
or teaching yourself code so just give
me one sentence about that and you'll be
eligible to win that way people can read
it and they can learn from it and it
better than just me saying you know
scratch jr. something like that so thank
you for watching the video don't forget
to comment like subscribe share join our
patreon and the link for all these books
are in the description below see you
guys next time bye hey guys thanks for
watching the video special thanks to our
sponsors dev Mountain if you look for a
coding bootcamp for tuition and housing
is included definitely check them out
appreciate it
I'll see you guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
