about a couple different things this is
actually part one of a two or three part
video in this first video Brian
by the way is a senior developer now
does YouTube full-time specifically
focusing on iOS development his channels
let's build that app so I've been a fan
of his for a while he usually does like
a stream a week as well so you can see
right now that he's actually streaming
live as I'm recording this talking about
is iOS development real programming and
he's got 200 people watching which is
pretty good so I'm pretty impressed by
that
and typically building out apps like
right here you're building out Twitter
from scratch and in iOS but we're gonna
be talking to him today in this in part
one about the importance of side
projects iOS development essentially
obviously and then we're also going to
be talking about these hybrid apps such
as react native and his thoughts about
that and in a future video we're gonna
be talking about it's going to be a
little bit more of a fun dear craft in
part 2 where we're going to be talking
about our thoughts about self education
and traditional education which is
something that I I kind of struggle with
myself thinking about so that was a
really enjoyable talk for me make sure
you check out his channel and subscribe
and enjoy the video that's all right
here we go so again thank you for taking
the time I know we're trying to schedule
this and here we are finally yeah yeah
thanks for having me always good to talk
about development coding all that good
stuff yeah no I am so I start watching
your channel cuz I I caught a a live
stream and I find that there's not just
like one of the reasons I like last year
is I get to kind of talk about software
and unfortunately one things that's
lacking at my work is like no one writes
a single line of code out of work so I
have to have to go out there to meetups
and stuff like that
does it does it have like is that
anything that you enjoy like is it just
something that you kind of do to build
the channel or do you actually like
having these sort
of philosophical conversations about
code ah that's a good question
every now and then it's good to take a
break from coding is what I feel and
doing it all day every day it gets a
little you know little tedious after a
while and then you start to wonder why
why are you doing this in the first
place yeah I should share those thoughts
I can understand that because I know I I
have not even a year of like
professional experience under my belt
and you're a much more senior developer
than I am so maybe maybe I will get to
that point but I I am just totally
infatuated now I mean I I definitely
still let the code like I can do it all
day and you know sometimes getting on
live stream is fun right it's just this
is something about it that's just fun so
that's kind of why I do that Thanks now
are you doing YouTube full tiger's eye I
sent you a message on LinkedIn I noticed
that you don't have a current employer
yeah yeah so currently doing YouTube
full-time trying to make the most out of
it and trying to figure out what I
wanted to do with the channel at the
same time
and as you know it's a bit of work
that's where there's a lot of work right
try to trying to build something and
yeah I'm not really looking for anything
else other than just building out the
platform right now okay it's it's an
interesting process and not obviously
your channels much larger than mine but
the the process of growing a something
you're still trying to meld what that
something is and you kind of have a
picture at least this how it is for me
you have a picture of what you want it
to be but it's still kind of blurry I
don't know if it's the same for you
it's it definitely started out to be
something else than it is right now even
though it's fairly close to what my
vision was like I started in about a
year and a half ago
and the vision has kind of it's remained
but some new additions have have gone in
there and it's it's slowly but surely
materializing into something that I I am
trying to maintain for the next couple
of years so yeah nice
now what was something that kicked it
off because I always feel like when
people make you know it's a pretty
drastic change when you go from
essentially being an employee to your
own boss and truly your own boss when
you're starting something from the
ground up was there was there something
it was just that time or was there an
event where you're like you know I want
to try something different yeah yeah I
get asked this question quite a bit and
there's really no like you know super
like surprising answers to this question
basically I had this boss that I didn't
want to work for anymore and I also had
wanted to start something else that I
could own and call my own and so I was
working on this company of like two
years as a iowa's developer and then you
know the boss wanted me to start doing
some rails work first I don't know why
because I really suck at rails so I
didn't really like doing it and I just
quit my job and started doing YouTube
instead awesome I like that I like the
let's make a decision and I'm going to
choose not to break it down to one thing
but happiness I want to be happy and I
don't want to do rails because I feel
the same way about PHP I work in PHP and
I hate myself for it so well I kind of
struggled with that decision for maybe
half a year what's a happy year and then
I finally decided to well there are
other events that led up to that final
decision but yeah I just decided to quit
and do my own thing now what was um what
was kind of some of the ideas going
through your head for that because
that's a very interesting thing because
I mean I it's something I I feel like I
can relate
two of sort of being like hey I'm gonna
try this new thing and you know there's
a little bit of maybe fear maybe
apprehension about doing any anything
that you're like a little bit worried
when when you finally you know made that
decision after six months any worries or
concerns no I guess not not so much on
my side because I typically like doing
things on my own
that are kind of new and weird like past
ten years I've been doing that pretty
much constantly and so things really
never kind of worked out in the past
like they never gotten past the first
half a year to a year of that projects
existence and so this was just yet
another one of these weird random
projects that I wanted to start so just
I just did it and then now it's been a
year and a half so I hope it's gonna go
on for a lot longer but we'll see what
the what the YouTube gods had in store
for me so who knows what you guys have
in store for any of those if the strange
five for a minute changes every couple
of months maybe couple of weeks yes it's
uh I I'm so I'm very interested in like
YouTube news I don't know if you follow
this or anything but recently there was
a large court case with a channel called
h3h3 productions and alright so you're
familiar with the case and essentially
it's a fair use case at the end of the
day yeah I think they won the case yeah
they they recently won the case and did
you have a chance to watch the video the
case was about I haven't but I think
that video had like four million views
are you yes and it's the most
cringe-worthy video and it none of it
makes any sense this is we're kind of
getting off topic here but it's a very
strange thing that I watched the video
and at the end they recommend you go to
the guys Channel and subscribe and I
find I find it all very strange the only
thing but the important thing is fair
use I don't think it's so much an issue
on coding channels cuz a lot of time
you're creating your own original
content and going from there but other
channels is a bigger deal yeah I I do
have fair use concerns with my channels
intense because behind my channel is to
build out something that's already in
existence in the App Store or the Play
Store sometimes I do worry about what
are these big companies gonna come after
me for I don't know writing an app
that's very similar to theirs and
showing it off I don't know yeah I mean
that is a I I mean I didn't really think
about that but if you built essentially
a clone of an app and then somebody
followed a tutorial and then built a
similar thing add a couple more features
and all of a sudden became their
competitor I could see how they would be
pissed off yeah it's a strange place to
be in like I'm gonna sue you for writing
open source code so I'm not too worried
about it but it's it's a little bit of a
concern every now and then yeah
now what no obviously I'm sure YouTube
is your your biggest sort of side
project or project if you will do you
have anything else outside of YouTube
that you're working on so the things
that are outside of YouTube well there's
the website that I build out which I
sell like premium courses off of and
that's kind of like the other thing
that's at the same time it's still very
closely related to YouTube you're
probably fully aware of the at the
business model where you have your
marketing through YouTube and then you
fund all that to your website that's
basically it and instead of me funneling
it to something like you to me or
teachable whatever I just funnel it's in
my own direct website so it's a big
project and trying to work out other
things at the same time like watching I
own an app pretty much building on my
entire platform so nice I'm always in
order to see what people are working on
it I'm glad we kind of brought up like I
know you'd mentioned that's another
project set for whatever
install or halted because I just got I
actually just got done doing a live
streaming one one person was worried
that they were sort of failing and a lot
of times people don't realize that
you've - it usually takes a couple times
and you kind of learn from your previous
things what makes good choices what
makes bad was there it was there
anything in a previous project where
kind of stood out of okay maybe this
projects not gonna work but I learned
something valuable from it mmm-hmm
that's a strange little thing that I've
noticed with people where they consider
things like failures or things that were
not successful you somehow label them as
failures but you really think about it
everything that you do in life you you
do it for a reason and then you get
something out of it and those projects
that were you know failures you learned
how to build out an entire platform
entire system from that project so I
don't I never see those projects as
failures for myself they're always
that's the stepping stone towards a
bigger goal that I when I get to you so
in the past I've built out these these
projects where you know learn how to use
the database learn how to put a website
on Macleod learn how to store things
learn how to use like Amazon Web
Services is learning all this stuff I
mean it's eventually it comes in handy
when you want to build your own website
that actually works so those projects
that never went anywhere like they're
all those skills they are in play now
for a current website so yeah nice now I
know you do more more than iOS I just
wanted to kind of pick your brain about
iOS because III know nothing so I'm the
Jon Snow of iOS development if you will
so one of the one of the things people
hate about web development and love at
the same time is that there's you know
Java scripts changing every week it
feels like and there's new tools or new
frameworks so what not how is sort of
the the world of iOS is it a similar
path or is a pretty strict and kind of
you know steady updates but kind of slow
and steady wins the race
yeah it's a good question I hope so I
was just having this like comment debate
with a user on my channel you know how
those go sometimes they get very heated
right and you're like no you're right no
you're wrong whatever and so there's
this guy that was bringing about
bringing up this this topic of how I
personally don't explain enough in my
videos I was thinking about it some more
and I feel like most of the code that we
do in iOS development doesn't actually
but you probably don't need to
understand like 90% of that code because
it's so it's so boilerplate I feel like
everything I do in iOS is just a copy of
someone else that wrote it out before
already and I never really had to think
about what I'm doing like this is just a
code you build up this list and you put
things on the screen rarely do I ever
say huh what's what's really going on I
just feel like it's so the coding is
like very basic and in terms of like
comparing it to website building in
JavaScript it's like JavaScript yeah I
think a lot more in terms of like how
the views are being rendered up cuz you
have to deal with so many different
sizes of browsers and styling and all
this stuff
whereas iOS is like it's so
straightforward there's only like one
way of doing it now do you happen to
like that or do you happen to like a
little bit more of don't used to work
complex but so a little more moving
parts I don't know I think I've done a
headless torso long it's gotten boring
and every time I touch the the browser
there's so much flexibility in
JavaScript that's why I liked doing
JavaScript programming more these days I
just feel like iOS is just super strict
and not flexible at all
what do you what are your thoughts on
now you have these think react native is
one sort of these hybrid JavaScript web
applications that can compile if I
understand them correctly I'm about to
start grack native in like a month but
compiled down into an iOS or Android app
what it we're doing your thoughts about
that something react so I used to react
yes for my website it's like a it's like
a really easy to use framework that
turns your typical spaghetti code
JavaScript into you like componentized a
little guess a little libraries I can
reuse everywhere and trying to work that
style in in native I guess I wasn't an
Android application building it seems
like a really good idea huh I haven't
exactly done it so much to say like it's
a clear winner but from every article
that I read about it it feels like you
can develop a lot faster because all you
have to do is you change one line and
you hit the refresh it just makes for
changes come up and I feel like
everyone's ready to hop onto the train I
don't really care so much who goes where
because there's always going to be
native developers and there's always
still going to be cross-platform
developers and even the strange thing is
that even facebook says that if you want
to be a good react native developer you
have to be like a good iOS Swift native
developer or a good Android native Java
developer Kotlin or whatever and you
have to have those basic prerequisite
skills in order to like really know how
to use react native that's what they say
I understand that makes sense because
there is a thought process of especially
you know designing and and user
interaction on a mobile application
where if you're not used to kind of
thinking in that way if we're garde
lished so what tool you're using you
know the app may not be to its full
um capabilities yeah yeah there's always
those those newest api's that come out
every year and you have to wait for the
react native team to like push out the
new packages that make it compatible
with JavaScript like let's say a new AR
kit libraries right I'm gonna have to
wait for the react native team to push
out new react native libraries for that
now
excuse me in terms of I Oh Susan I guess
thanks for watching the video if you
happen to be looking for a boot camp I
couldn't recommend dev Mountain any
higher they also include housing with
their tuition so you can get up and go
and get started right away thanks again
for watching and I'll see you guys in
the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
