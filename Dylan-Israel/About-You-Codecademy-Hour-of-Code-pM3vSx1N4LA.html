hour of code week we are doing some code
Khadem use our code you can get to these
if you go to cook Academy comm / hour of
code or just go down to the general
courses and pull everything up so we're
gonna do an about you section so we're
gonna just kind of do it about me I
guess and I'll be explaining as we go
along so in this case this is called a
heading a heading is you declare it with
the h1 tag and a closing h1 tag and
we'll just do it based off whatever my
youtube name is coding toriel's 3 6 so
you can see right there
are heading change and there's also
various headings so we can give it an h4
in obvious that we need and you can see
right here that these actually will
adjust in terms of size so h1 being the
largest I believe it goes all the way up
to h6 and it's later down the road when
we're doing styling this will be very
important because you'll constantly be
targeting these things so your h1 may
have a very specific purpose and so this
isn't heading basically and that's the
way to think of it is just kind of a
title that's kind of how I think of it
next we're going to be adding a
paragraph and this should be pretty
intuitive it's just a P tag and then a
closing P tag and in this in this case
what are we gonna add we're gonna say we
have almost 1000 subscribers
I think I'm at like nine 70 right now
when I make in this video so that's
pretty cool to me so let's continue on
right here
sorry if I'm resetting is only I did
this in the past with somebody I was
tutoring we were doing on Pokemon so
it's kind of what you're seeing so we're
gonna add an input type email so let's
go ahead and we'll say input type is
equal to email and then we're going with
a another line we're gonna add a another
line says input type equals submit
don't forget your quotes for this so now
we have a submit button you can see cuz
we haven't put any like line breaks that
it's gonna be on the same line so if we
wanted to down a line below we could
throw a line break with that be our
slash but that's not a constructed so we
have a boxer or we're gonna type in an
email and then we're gonna submit it we
haven't really told it where to go with
all that yet but we're about it later so
there's also your input type can also
have a placeholder a placeholder is kind
of that that grayed out text in in like
input boxes where it says like put your
email here or anything like that
so we're gonna give it a placeholder
yeah we're just gonna put email so
people know what to put in there that
way we don't have to have a title we
still could but this might be a little
more intuitive so cool
so what what else are we doing here so
right now they want us to create some
styling tags so we're gonna have style
slash style and inside here typically
you would probably just use a CSS
document but right now this is how
they're having us to it so in our style
text we want to target our h1 so what do
we want our h1 so we need to declare the
h1 and in here is where we're going to
put our style so there's something
called text special line and as you can
guess this is something that's going to
align the text so we're in this case we
put Center and you can see our the
output right here is now centered you
know pretty pretty intuitive there's so
much you can do with styling and it's
it's definitely something it good at
because even if you don't want to go on
to learning maybe JavaScript or anything
else say you're really big with graphic
design learn HTML learn CSS and styling
would get you everywhere you want to go
so in this case they want us to set all
our paragraphs to inherit the
the P tags we want that to have the
align text as well so we're gonna go
ahead and align this I'm gonna put it
Center so now our Texas Center just like
our heading pretty cool alright so on
the new line add your style at a body
tag all right so we're gonna add body
and typically we would probably be
giving our inputs names and classes
instead of overriding all H ones but
that's not what we're worried right now
about right now
then replace your h1 and P selectors
it's a new body selector and we're set
the text line to Center for your entire
body so I think what they want us to do
right here is just do a body and we're
going to so there's something built in
called body and this is kind of where
the bulkier code goes bulk your HTML and
in this case we want body to inherit
everything here and then we actually
want to take this text special line
their wooden body and we want to I think
they want us to take this out so let's
see so you can see right here now
everything is centered because we said
look everything in body align that
Center we don't have anything that's
interfering with that
alright so wrap a set of head tags
around your style tags so in your HTML
document the head is kind of where all
the data goes that isn't displayed so
maybe we're importing some files that
are gonna be CSS files or maybe
bootstrap files or anything else all the
stuff that isn't going to actually be
displayed on the page it's typically
what we put the head tag in and that's
why we're we're just putting our style
tag in there as well so
we're going to add this doctype dot HL I
wish I could tell you why this is the
first first thing but I actually helped
give them before this comment I guess
but this is just something that I know
needs to be in the document
I do not place here do not place your
head tag you need to add two doc type
HTML before it all right let's see
what's going on here soon some sort of
air and let's get rid of this comment
there we go I just assumed that comment
had to be there cuz this isn't thing in
the first place BAM so add a new style
roll to the body set the background to
by so again this is another parameter
that we can use for our excuse me for
our body element so what we're going to
do is we're gonna say background and
then we're just gonna give a color with
certain colors that are built in black
is one of them
okay and then so we're setting the
background to black but that kind of
blurs out the text we can't see it now
anymore so we also want to do is say
anything a body that takes in color we
want to set that to white so you can see
right now now all our fonts and all our
all our text is now in white so we can
actually see it so let's say that we
want to actually change what type of
font we're using so this is where we put
font family and we're gonna give it the
family of hell medaka apologize if I'm
not pronouncing that right oops
one too many E's and then you can see
right now this changed cool so that's
how you change the font make it pretty
so let's see what this so they want us
to show how to insert a a image so the
way that we insert an image is we let's
put it at bottom actually let's put it
between the character so in their course
they have a little Vincent van Gogh
thing so what's going on here is we're
saying look further simatech notice
there's no closing tag for image that
our source is this URL so let me we're
gonna go to my facebook page real quick
now we're gonna copy image address and
then we're just gonna put in our own
what we get mature so in this case we
got me right here from a h1z1 YouTube
space la event and then we have in this
case we set height and width to 250 so
if we take this out it's gonna get much
bigger what we wanted in there because
we want it somewhat small we have almost
1,000 subscribers so cool so that's how
you insert an image again notice that
you have no and I depending on what
version you may want to put a slash at
the end I believe either way should work
replaces the h1 tag with the image tag
oh all right so we're getting rid of h1
save and submit
so no more H ones so now we want to
change the background to something so
let's see what you do it so in this case
um instead of saying background black
we're gonna say URL then we're gonna
have this and then we're gonna put a a a
background color into it so let's see
what they have and see if we want to be
working with that so they have a Vincent
van Gogh one let me go ahead and find
mine real quick alright so I found a
nice background let's go ahead and just
add this one I got this from unsplash
it's a great sort of resource to use so
this is the original background as you
can see here all these images are high
resolution and copyright free so if you
ever need any sort of oh I want an image
alright unsplash.com un s PLA SH it's a
great great site I use it all the time a
lot of times when you see stock photos
and things a lot of companies will get
it from unsplash I've seen it myself
personally so yeah so we don't want the
background to be tiled and so what are
we going to do we're gonna add something
called the background - size and cover
so here we go background I don't think
well this will affect it too much
because of the size of the photo is such
a high resolution so we're gonna do
cover and so you see right here what's
actually going on is that it's going to
cover the the image is changing it's
basically going to cover the width of it
the best it can and that's kind of the
point of it so we also want to
background - position center it so let's
go ahead and have that as well
great background - physician and if
you're curious why there's - those are
the X&amp;amp;Y coordinates that we're targeting
if I remember correctly I think that's
correct so Center it on the X and Center
it on the Y cool and then finally we
want to set it so that there's no tile
on it's not repeating so we want to say
back ground - repeat no no repeat why
you may be saying like why are we
worried about that because there are
multiple nowadays we're dealing with
tablets watches even phones televisions
and 4k 4k TVs and all this sort of stuff
so more or less the reason is that we
just need to it we need to address all
these things not because it's an issue I
know but because it could be down the
road and that finally the background -
attachment fixed means that our
background when we scroll up and down
isn't going to be adjusting so pretty
cool so let's go ahead and save and
submit this not bad so there's also a
way that we can target the font so we
can so in this case they want us to
actually target the paragraph cuz we
want to only have the paragraph change
the font - size so as you can imagine we
set font - size we are going to put it
in pixels here so we're gonna say 24
pixels so you can see this gets better
we can also I believe let's see if we
can do this
200% so we can do it in that or we could
do like 1.5 m
so it's 1.5 the normal size and 2.0 so
in this case we're just gonna do 24 so
there's a couple different ways we can
do it I prefer to do it in size of
emphasis or M just because
I believe it scales better when you're
trying to do responsive design later on
alright so add a new style section
called input so remember our input tags
the email and the button here so we're
gonna set input and we're also gonna
give it a border so imagine everything
has kind of like a box that out lies it
and so when we when we grab in all our
stuff here you can assign this kind of
see a box on here we're actually gonna
put a border around these things so it's
a little bit easier to see in this case
we're gonna give a border it's a border
of zero which shouldn't give it a border
at all
so you see nothing nothing's changed
there's no border right now unless there
is a border beforehand
yeah it looks like it took a little bit
of border that was on there off so
apparently by default there's a tiny bit
of border so it looks like the next
thing we're gonna be talking about is
padding so what is padding padding is
kind of the diff it gives space between
the element you're targeting and the
kind of the box around it so in this
case let's go ahead and I think we're
supposed to add it to the body let's go
ahead and do padding so look at the
right here the space right here and
we're just giving general padding so
it's gonna apply it to all sides oh
there we go so it's actually packed I
got that confused with margins so
padding is the actual element margins is
the elements around it so you see right
here that our padding we just added 12
pixels of padding in each direction so
on the right side the left side the top
side and the bottom side and we can
actually target
I think it's padding - left just to
target the left and the right and all
that sort of stuff so which do they just
want it they just want it and on the
input okay so we want our box to be
bigger so it's gonna submit that all
right so next thing we've added some
padding and we're like oh our font here
is a little bit small let's go ahead and
just target that and make it a little
bit bigger now we're gonna set it to 18
px and you see right now our fonts a
little bit bigger enough pretty cool
so set the input types colored black so
we have a type here called submit and a
type called the email so in this case
let's go ahead and just copy this over
we're gonna be much more specific so
what you need to know about this is
you're going to inherit everything from
input and anything that is more specific
will override it so in this case we're
gonna say background color to black and
because this is the most specific it's
going to change if you spell background
correctly
there we go and then we want
excuse-me color just color to black and
then finally we want to also change the
background to lime green background lime
green which I didn't actually know is
the thing so our font here is is black
and our background color for our input'
type submit'
is lime green the probably easier way is
just to give this a name or a class and
go from there so pretty cool so make
this your own page upload your own image
imager and include it there so I think
that is the end of our thing here and
we've already kind of done our own thing
and it's not too bad so we learned a
little bit about padding we learned
about headings we learned how to do a
little bit of styling and CSS and I
think for for what is supposed to be an
hour sort of introductory course two
hour of code it's it's not a bad thing
to just show you like oh look at look
how easy this is we've written 41 lines
of code most of its styling and we're
able to make a little basic web page so
I hope you guys found this sort of hour
of code basic video I know it just only
about eight minute video should take you
about an hour but in reality I've been
doing this a little bit longer than most
people who are watching this video so if
if I'm going too fast just pause the
video and try to understand it I'm
always sort of messing up but I'm always
sort of learning and that's kind of how
this goes sometimes so I hope you guys
appreciate the video questions comments
concerns - anything constructive is
always appreciated and I'll see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
