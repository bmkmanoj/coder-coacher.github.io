interactive website unit to JavaScript
so let's get started here so it's just
showing us a few if statements you
should be familiar with if and else
showing us about how to do variables
should be familiar with that showing us
out it that we can change things with
math operators pluses and minuses and
fractions and all that sort so that
should be familiar as well it's just
basic math so let's see create a
variable named Jordan and set it equal
to 23 so why are you donate goes 23
there we go don't forget the semicolon
your variables can also store a pieces
of text called strings during your
sirness are gonna be texas quotes so we
know what strings are there's our tweet
semicolon to end it okay dot length look
at the total length of your string or
whatever else you're trying to get the
length up all right you know that here
are comparisons greater than less than
equal to not equal to all those sort of
things again this is all it should be
somewhat review if you've taken any sort
of programming language oh excuse me why
spell monster on my face
by the way monster please reach out and
sponsor me
yeah so create a variable name topic
instead of equal to JavaScript and
jQuery so of our topic equals JavaScript
and jQuery semicolon there we go
cool we can use comparisons to write
programs to ask yes or no questions say
we want to write a program so that you
in your name is longer than seven
letters it the answer is yes or song
with the other long name so if we're
just using those operators to do if-else
statements again more variables with
if-else statements
so we can extend the fail statement to
ask else if so if name is greater than
or equal to 15 Prentiss and if it's not
else if if it's greater than eco so i'm
princess elsa princess so else if might
be the only confusing thing ears but
basically if this doesn't pass it tests
this but if this does pass it doesn't
test it if you're just do two if
statements it would it would run them
both no we don't want that sometimes you
don't want that so how to create
functions so you know create a variable
set it equal to a function add the
parameters and whatever else you want to
do it in the function function is around
by calling its name and giving it input
values you see right here p1 call the
percentage function and put parameters
in it and does some cool
so apparently is that really our just
making sure that the whole section okay
so that we just breezed through our
JavaScript section a lot it was review
it was if-else statements how to set up
variables how to set up functions and if
you're still a little bit you know you
make a little bit mistakes I I suggest
just taking a little notepad like this
and throwing in the examples at the end
of the day as long as you understand it
logically looking at syntax will
shouldn't affect you but you know thank
you for watching it looks like in the
next one events will be using events are
kind of like on click or hover over
stuff and we'll be using that to make
our site more interactive in the future
alright thanks for watching guys I'll
see you in the next
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
