three in HTML structure table gives and
spans so let's get started here so
tables are mega sweet it says to get
warmed up make sure the heading has the
font family Ariel so style equals posh
family burial shriek a place i'll add an
image so let's see let's go get an image
ninjas we're pretty good must like this
guy it's kind of a big image this work
so get your image URL and then we'll put
it the loads nation so say SRC equals
and then of course your end it so and
then add a second image which is
clickable and links just like all right
so we're going to say a href equals and
we'll just do google do not delete
anything relevant and we're actually
going to just reuse the image just to
save time
oh that almost do that for a reason it
should work oh sorry see there we go
okay so make sure codes right I'm save
and submit and the way right two images
one clickable one not so add an opening
closing set table tags your buddy list
HTML document all right so inside body
we're going to put a table and then a
closing table go to the result view
you'll notice that nothing was visible
because we haven't done anything with
the table yet so all right so TR is
table row so we want to add two more
rows below this as per the instructions
all right we still don't see anything
but we're building our table so in the
second row at a table data TD TD sale so
this is the first year out so I guess
this is the second we want to add TD
rush p table data going a single round
table name type to between it all right
so too and see we have one column in
three rows Oh until right another cell
with three whoopsies I so table data 3 /
table data so there's our one column and
three rows one two three not not too
complicated
so we want to add some more table data
to the second table row so there's one
and two and eventually you may want to
just start adding a little bit of helps
me to keep track but like maybe with
comments and whatnot so you can see
right here we're adding another smaller
table data all right and then do the
same for the third tagged with 1935 all
right now we have a basic table pretty
cool tables are really important how you
do a lot with them styling lies and
everything Isis everything with Korean
labs just have put everything we have in
our table so far between us st body and
t body tags alright alright so let's try
I believe we do this outside the table
border here I could be wrong actually
I'm sorry we do it inside table there
tbody long post regarding
so table heads just like paragraphs
they're just like the head and there's
also a head for taillights oh alright so
we have to create the tea head and tea
and element insert table inside the
table heading element has a single row
using trtr so just like anything else
we're just kind of breaking up our table
hearing two different components oh add
to th th the table head all right um
with the famous Phyllis monster and
first here you can see right here that
it has now doing some stuff like making
this bold and centering it and now we
have some table headers not too shabby
so next they have added a let's see
they've added a title room but only
spans one column right now so to make
the column span two columns we need to
call span and we need to set it to th
all right so look just do this by how it
looks so we have Famous Monsters by ear
we need this to go we need to suspend
two columns so call span and we're going
to set it equal to always remember use
the parentheses equal to two columns are
even the wrong one
too so there you go you see how it's now
spanning two of the columns hence the
cost i'm very very intuitive so all
right now we're back make the famous
Pulitzer at Birth your labels emphasize
IE makes metastasize all right so we
want to and might notice how they change
the way things are done but that's all
right so we're looking for famous
monster so here's famous monster so what
we can do here is to p.m. and then we'll
do a soap / eels that did not work maybe
we have to do it and we have to do it
right here yeah I so you want to do it
within the text area not the table area
so
alrighty then famous monster burst and
now let's go to birth year so here's
berthier and we're gonna leave the tile
size as well and then make famous
monsters by Berthier the title red so
let's see here th calls man I Boise you
how to merge these so let's try this
tomorrow style equals color red and now
it's red not too bad all right now we're
doing a little bit of recap we're going
to be using divs and spans next so just
kind of take a look here if there's
anything that you are unfamiliar with
already need to check up on alright so
div div sounds for divide and conquer is
short for division allows you to divide
your page into containers that is
different pieces so be helpful with CSS
I don't really use tubes that much but I
don't design pages too often so we're
going to create our own dip and give it
the background color yellow alright so
in this case we're just as I div style
equals background color and we're going
to set that yellow and then we're going
to say and
so that is what we're doing and it wants
us to give the same width and height
index as we get four so we should have a
yellow block cool go ahead and make your
yellow div link to a favorite site so in
here under a href equals pornhub nah I'm
just getting we'll do a Google come and
of course we have to and that and make
sure so there we going now let's see
here okay apparently we do the HR for
the dip that makes sense and then we
call okay so and then we do a otra it's
all about how we work in here so you try
few dozen and we need to delete this one
damn so now now we're good to go can't
click and click can click alright for
now we'll continues the styling
attributes change colors wrap the word
bred in the editor in spandex alright so
okay and get to span tag style color
equals room
oh so only word between span changes
color ok so i guess span is span allows
us to control smaller parts while div
can divide your web page of individually
so the kind of similar let spanish use a
little bit more for something just
smaller into things I guess so you span
tags to style the word impact with the
family on impact spam is the rest
Texas's don't click explanation alright
so impact so style April spots family
and wants you lose this video so bam we
only change one point of it not too bad
so we're going to go on the next point
you notice how span works and it looks
like you can kind of see a little bit
right here well we'll be learning soon
as some CSS cascading style sheets and
you can see here how certain things are
getting altered a bit so coming up next
we will let's see we're going to be
clickable photo page and so as always
we're going to be sharing our
achievements try and get more people
into an HTML is one of those things
where a lot of people can use it it's
very entry level so long next section
clickable photo patient we working a
little bit with the stylesheet dot CSS
so I will see you guys
