video what we did was we set up the HTML
I'm just kind of did the bare bones of
getting all our buttons set up and a
little bit formatting in this video
we're going to work a little bit more
with the styling aspects of the week
okay I just have an idea of what we
wanted to look like and what we want to
do so I'll show you what I did so
basically what the first thing we'll do
is we'll go ahead and just set a
background image now if you don't know
where to get like high quality images
all my background images that you'll
ever see I get from a site called
unsplash.com I'm not sponsored or
affiliated with them in any way it's
just a common resource and I think a lot
of people use so this is a little too
big because they it's all free high-res
images so you can even use it in your
portfolio and everything like that so
we're gonna go ahead and set the
background size here to a hundred
percent and then on top of that we don't
want it to move around at least I don't
so I'm going to set the background -
attachment to fixed
so you see now the backgrounds not
moving around um definitely a preference
thing for me this is what I would prefer
now the fonts a little hard to see so
we're gonna set the color here to white
lots of much easier to see now next
thing that I would do is I would change
this font it's very boring I'm not the
best so let's take a boring font that I
do like I'll just go ahead and throw it
up in here normally you put this in the
header so this phone is called a month's
montt Seurat I believe is how you say it
I got this just from Google's API fonts
and we're just gonna set the font -
family here to that and because it's a
font that we're importing we need to put
quotes because it's not built into the
browser and now we have a little bit of
a nicer fun in my opinion anyhow so it's
all coming together piece by piece now
this this start button will probably
contact glass so everything's not
looking as nice as we want it to if you
remember everything was kind of centered
so bootstrap here has a nice class and
well this is what we created this bigger
outer div you would probably have this
be your container div as well if we were
gonna set it up to be responsive for the
sake of this video we're not really
gonna do it it's just a simple
application maybe down the road but so
you'd say the Tech Center class I now
everything there goes is now centered
but our buttons aren't inline as we
would want them to be so what can we do
about that well we have these all set up
as h2s and by all I mean these buttons
so these h2s we're gonna go ahead and
put on that display inline so each one
of those divs everything should be
aligned now don't worry about this reset
because this will be hidden eventually
and they start we need to keep it's a
little too much on that like someone
would say maybe but to not
put up never have the most politically
correct thing we say work alright so
we'll add a little bit of margin there
around it and now everything's nice and
formatted session time break time and
this is basically the core bare bones of
our CSS and HTML so in the next video
we'll get started with the session time
and I'll show you how to increment this
up and down and then we'll hide the
reset button as well when it loads so
I'll see you guys next time thanks for
watching
