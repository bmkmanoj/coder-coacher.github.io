we are doing file input and output file
input and output the last section of
Python so let's see how the how this
works
see it believe it I'm um clicks check
out I so it looks like we're crazy list
with a was it I believe this was called
a conditional and we're saying F open
this and I'm not sure with the W is you
know this just lets just something to
see what's going on here so this is what
we end up getting I guess when we submit
it one four nine sixteen ten lines and
numbers so let's get started we're going
to create a variable called my file set
it equal to open so function on output
dot txt so that's some sort of file in
this case pass we want to pass something
our plus as a second argument of
function and let's see what this output
is not defined
oh this needs to be in quotations so
we're looking for a file name
my guess is all right so
it right over my list to get each value
whose own what's going on here use file
dot right
to write each value to output txt so we
need to change this a little do file dot
dot all right
I make sure class TR and I see are these
are strings for passing through I think
this is what we're supposed to do not
positive oh so filed all right Maya oh
oh excuse me
let's see here add your code blow so
we're not messing with that at all so we
want to iterate over my list so for I
and my underscore list
I'll dot right STR I make sure to add a
new line after each of element 2 - sure
each wolf here /n + /n this is how you
do a new line I guess and use my file
close to close file and then alright so
then we want to my times for a file not
close let's see if we did everything
correctly right requires a file object
but received a stream
so filed all right I'll excuse me my is
it my underscore filed all right there
we go quiet girl all right see here so
we're gonna declare a variable called my
file set it equal so two equal to the
file object return by calling open with
both output Tex
all right so we're gonna set it equal to
open and this is gonna have one
parameter output dot txt and then we're
gonna have the second parameter R and I
don't think they've actually explained
to us what the second parameter does yet
next we want to print the result using
read on my file so print my underscore
file doubt read and then we have to
close that or else the file remains open
I guess it's probably bad in terms of
memory use so we we read it then we
close it so next we need to Claire
variable again called my file and store
the result in open this time we want to
open text dot txt and our oh these are
commands these are like DOS commands or
command prompt commands I think so
are read-only mode and then on three
separate lines print out the results so
let's print my underscore file dot read
line and then
so I wants us to print this out three
times I think that's what it's saying
and then my followed up close
so you're gonna refresh the page don't
wear your co2 says alright this is I
need to refresh the page
sorry but I'm gonna need you to refresh
the page don't worry cuz it's a Python
alright so see what we let's read
through here real quick open text nut
text file in our
very open equals and then this is the
mode that's what that stands for my
father I read live on three separate
lines print out the result of colors I
see okay so it looks like we're doing
everything correctly we have our
filename and we have our mode
everything's good we close this and then
it's just a call my file dot read line
no such file or directory so it seems
that it can't find this text dot txt so
let's go to the forum and see if maybe
some other people are having the issue
as well that was five and nine
reading between the lines my reason for
5/9 by
alright so for those who still earn the
problem your change in exhalation work
to a dot yes so let's just try changing
the are on my file to our plus
nope
all right so well input/output looks
like people are having an issue with
this exceed our my father
just write something extra
and that txt that's a no can you see
there's so many shows there's no end of
line and the first line so update the TX
key file - below let's see here my file
my file read file print my file
let's see
so we're having a little bit of issue
here five nine what am I missing
I've added wr+ mode after this every
three empty lines all right so let's try
that
there we go
so just try adding a wr+ I guess the
files empty is having an issue they
should probably update their there the
code I guess I check out our extremely
bad code in the editor like the last
screen save us and I click Submit you'll
notice or read file read entry any
datavac tech skills to pee
this little piggys just text txt at a
write file close on line 9 write our
file dot close on line 9 and the line 13
had a read underscore file that closed
not closing files is very bad that was
the point of that check out the example
in the editor note that we don't
implicit Lee close our file and remember
that we if we don't close the fire out
data we'll get stuck in the buffer click
Save and submit to see so success all
right now you try write any data you'd
like to give with an ass all right so so
with and then we want to open the file
to txt dot every text txt comma and then
we'll do the mode of wr+
as alright I should have paid more
attention like it's lights out all right
this text file alright as a text file
and then I will say text file
was it dot right all right yeah I
thought right and we'll just put success
text is not too fine
it looks leading Randy and he did it
back to Texas let the xt know all right
so
let's go ahead and copy this
see what's going on so it's open text
dot txt and we'll just do W because we
want to just write it over so that's
probably what's going on there and we
didn't capitalize our F here man
all right bluest below your with ASCO do
two things check its files it's not that
close and so we'll say text will say if
so if text dot txt file I say is I see
like is open I remember in the if
expression
that's case closed all right Oh
if dot closed is equal equal to false
apparently it but if you read above it
says that this will so if it's not
closed and so we can call dot closed
text file dot closed not to be coming it
can not to be confused with closed else
the only else aren't cool after your
it's and print out the value of my file
to cost print my underscore file dot
close we don't have in my file
let's just see what's going on here
cool so we finished our Python course
yay
did a little bit of file input and
output I'm sure there's a some good
documentation to find on that if you
need it 13 hours 2.5 million students
beginner technical level I will say
though I did think the Python course was
a little bit harder than maybe the
JavaScript or the HTML CSS the Ruby is
so far even though still beginner level
I think this is by far the hardest
course that we've kind of messed with
yet so if you're still looking to do
some fun stuff with Python I'll be
messing around with pygame which is a
free Python game library and we'll be
making like a entry level game and all
I'll try to see if I can figure out how
to put it into a browser if not you can
download it when I'm done making it and
I'll be doing videos on that as well so
don't forget to check out my other
videos and questions comments concerns
anything that you would like me to
address and any ideas for videos are
always appreciated in regards to code
Academy we will be doing some more the
make a website projects we're gonna
jQuery is probably our next our next
challenge so jQuery I believe is a
little bit harder
it's what three hundred three hours oh
my god we're gonna knock jQuery out like
tomorrow so we'll see you next time the
jquery videos or maybe Ruby on Rails
depending on what we do thanks for
