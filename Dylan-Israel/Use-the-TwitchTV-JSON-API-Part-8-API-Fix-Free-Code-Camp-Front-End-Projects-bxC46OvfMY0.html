watching this video you're having
trouble with your twitch API essentially
what happened was twitch updated their
API and now was requiring the client ID
header so what you'll see in this video
is how to one get your client ID because
it took me about 20 minutes to find that
out and I'll walk you through that
process about where to go what links and
everything and then to an example of how
you would change a get JSON in the
twitch API they may be using in the past
such as for the twitch API free code
camp project which this is kind of
dedicated to into the Ajax call that
you'll need to use it for so let's go
ahead and jump right in
alright guys so by popular demand people
have been asking me how to fix their
urls in the twitch JSON API now this is
gonna be a quick video showcasing how to
fix a URL and I'll show you one example
of what you'll need to do so the first
thing that you need to do is you need to
go this webpage will really help walk
you through it it's a blog on twitch I
came across but you'll need to go to the
paid this page right here twitch.tv
slash settings slash connections and go
down to the bottom here and you're going
to see this register your application
the reason that we're doing this is you
basically need to be able to get a
client ID so that you can get your your
your client ID so you can add it to your
URL what you'll do here is you'll go
ahead and put in your application name
your redirect URI
I just put code pin I go and then the
application category once you choose
that you can go we'll go put a test one
code pen dot IO we'll go ahead and put
other and maybe we'll put YouTube or
something like that
and you'll see it will read sure so of
course you gotta put an app's absolute
it's GT piece like open there we go I
test over 9000 so there we go then
you'll get this client ID you're gonna
need to copy this client ID and then
there's a client secret and everything
else there's a couple ways to change
this we're using jQuery cuz it's pretty
simple and that's what we're used to so
let's go ahead and pull this up right
here what we're gonna do is we're gonna
I already fixed one but uh we'll go
ahead and fix this one so I'll show you
how to fix this one so originally what
we had we're in our code pin here by the
way and let's see here what did I not
uncomment
getting unrelated air come back to that
so you'll see right here originally we
were using get JSON which seemed fine at
first so what we need to do is this get
JSON there's no way to actually apply
the header so which is what we're gonna
need to do we need to apply a client ID
and that client ID basically says that
our count is used is being used to call
this API call so we're gonna go ahead
and cup just comment this out and what
we're gonna do is input and I'll type it
out piece-by-piece an AJAX call get JSON
is basically a shorthand for Ajax
like so and then we're gonna go ahead
and pass in a couple parameters first
thing we're gonna pass in this object
like we normally would and then we're
gonna pass it in a function excuse me
we're gonna pass in some parameters like
so so a little bit different so the type
refers to what type of call we're doing
in this case we're doing a get call my
keyword is I think dying so my keys are
off a little bit so we're doing a get
call and flux just turned on let's go
ahead and turn that off real quick sorry
about that guys so then comma the URL
now if you remember before we had this
API twitch URL like so go ahead and put
that in there so that's our URL then we
need to put in our header now this is
the thing that's slightly different now
what's our header our header in this
case is going to be in quotes client -
ID and remember that password we just
got we're going to throw it in there and
I believe this one should work just fine
like so there's the old client ID and
then finally we're calling this success
now on success it's gonna run a function
that does something with our data
then we just go ahead like so and in
here it's basically where we put our
logic and my example we we check to see
if the stream is online or not
and we can go ahead and console dot log
date of 1 and everything should be
working let's see where we messed up we
have our header they were a type we have
our header jacks
success
energy so somewhere along here I made a
slight mistake
Oh headers I believe that will fix it
it's gonna refresh this page real quick
how's this
so somehow we broke something this is
very interesting oh I see right here we
didn't comment this last part out right
here there we go sorry that's that was
my little air right there so our code
here is correct and you'll see now we're
getting the correct call so you have to
change all your get J songs to these
Ajax calls they're still gonna be get
calls the URL you can go ahead and get
rid of the callback function I believe I
haven't tested this on all of them and
then you need to pass in your client ID
once you do that you'll fix your twitch
API calls so have you guys found this
helpful if I ever do an update to this
I'll showcase how to update the other
ones there's about three or four API
call so you're gonna have change this
get JSON if you fall in my example
you're gonna have change this get JSON
and I believe there's one more and then
finally this get JSON as well but as
