about how important side projects are
and a lot of people have struggle
struggle with trying to figure out what
to do what to build and how to get
started so today I have 29 side projects
ideas that are gonna help you in your
career in one way or another and you're
gonna learn a lot and you're going to
it's going to make you a more attractive
candidate and you're going to become a
better developer in the process and it
may surprise you not all of them include
you actually writing code just sort of
being in the realm of things and one
thing I want to say I would normally say
this at the end of the video these are
29 ideas that came up with if you're
watching this video share and I'd share
your side project in the description
below a lot of people take inspiration
by seeing other people go and build
something from scratch and if it's not
on this list definitely share it and
I'll approve all the links if you guys
have a website or whatever it is just
share it I want people to see your side
projects and be inspired by them as well
but at the very least
here's 29 bad or good ideas with their
ideas and you choose the one that works
best for you since we're talking about
building things and building side
projects I thought this is a good time
to talk about the humble RPG maker
software bundle there'll be a link in
the description it'll help me out if you
decide to buy anything if you use that
link and for a dollar you can get four
four gum games here if you're not
familiar with RPG makers something
actually used to use on the PlayStation
PlayStation 2 basically what it gives
you are a bunch of tools to build your
own sort of old-school RPGs let's see if
we can mute this and jump in to a point
here but it really gives you an idea of
how you can build your own games that
gives you appreciation for building your
own worlds and it's cool it's on Steam
you can share it and it keeps on going
and get more and more tools you know
until you get to the $50 tier but you
can you for $1 $7 $15 you can get all of
them in there it's go away you can help
me out and as always guys if you're if
you're interested in that when you go to
pay you can decide to hey I want to give
it all to charity hey I want to give it
all to Dylan whatever it is it's a cool
way you can help me out so thank you so
much and don't forget to use the link in
the just
Crypton as anyone with 29 ideas would
tell you is it good to have it on piece
paper so idea number one and I'll try to
go through this in a reasonable amount
of time a podcast that's something that
I'm working on and white wives potty is
good one you're gonna be introduced to a
lot of different developers you're gonna
be able to pick their brain and two it
helps you build a brand it shows that
you can commit to something and you
don't need to have a daily podcast you
can even have a weekly or bi-weekly
podcast where you're you maybe have a
YouTube channel where you put it up but
at the very least you have it on Android
or Spotify and go from there you'll be
introduced to a lot of different things
and it's really really great to take
that idea number two a blog code not any
blog I don't want you talking about you
know Pokemon right unless you're
building the Pokemon application you're
going to detail about but have a blog
related to code talk about it and a lot
of people are worried about well I just
started coding a week ago I just started
coding and week oh that's okay it really
is when I started my channel I was i was
a scrub and I'm still a scrub by much
less of a scrub then then I was then and
the reason I say that is you could start
your blog about just your journey you
may not even be ready to write a
technical blog yet and that's okay but
you can start writing about what what
you've struggled and why you're
transitioning and and it doesn't need to
be a daily thing a subscriber of mine in
life livestream the other day so I was
we've read blog every day no you're
gonna burn out you're not gonna have
anything talked about every single day
what I would say is try write one blog a
week one 500 word blog you don't have to
really put a word count on it but make
it a high quality great blog and go from
there so number three a YouTube channel
right my youtube channel has taught me
so much just by between having being
able to commit to something long-term
it's also a great way to build a
personal brand in the coding space and
when I say in a youtube channel on a
video game channel you're gonna gain
things from that but not as not
necessarily as a developer it's kind of
cool if you share it but I would say
start a coding channel it could be
whatever you want you to do a tutorial
this is something that I'm personally
building a course on so if you're if you
want more detail about that I'm hoping
to have it out by the end of October
that's that's the end of the idea for
the course but youtube channel ii
something that you can go to hell
help promote your your career no idea
number four a Facebook group and I've
owned Facebook group Co tech and
caffeine these are something that you
can start have people who are interested
and passionate about coding share things
and you can moderate it and you can
create it and you can put that on your
resume and show that you're interested
and just be an active member of it
Facebook group is something that you can
create start and you could start today
it may not have as many members you may
have to get creative on how to get
people to join to it but it's a great
thing to get to get started I did number
five build a web game build an html5
game there's a lot of games like build a
unique one here's what I'm trying to say
don't build a tic-tac-toe game don't
build hangman build your own game
whatever it is that you're interested in
build a game around that and it has the
ability to grow right this is one of the
projects like the blog like the podcast
like the youtube channel like the
Facebook group that can be a long-term
project they start on day one and it may
not be everything you want it to be but
it's going to evolve as you evolve as a
developer so to come up with a game
build a build a web Brit based game idea
number six volunteer I volunteered
through code.org and other organizations
this is another great side project or
side idea so that you can have on your
resume
you're gonna I've volunteered I've given
speeches I've helped prepare lesson
plans I've answered questions for
teachers and developers for those
lessons plans and I sign up through code
org for hour of code every year this is
another great I know it's not
necessarily the side project but another
idea that you could help to add
something to your resume no idea number
seven start a meetup group my friend
Christine when she was learning off of
free code camp she started a meet-up in
downtown Los Angeles where she started
with two people it got up to like ten
and she maintained the meet up all the
way up until she got a job as she
stopped unfortunately but meetups are
great places to not only meet people to
learn to interview developers find jobs
sometimes but if you start it it's
another great thing that can maintain it
and keep it alive it's a great thing a
great looking side project on your rest
idea number 8 this one's a little bit
more of a coding one build an API built
build something Billy a back-end for
something an example I would want to
give is a but you could build a jokes
API where it tells programming jokes and
maybe you know it whatever it is but
Billy an API is something you can do
quick and efficiently and you can expand
upon and depending on what it is that
you're passionate about in life you can
definitely take that and and run with it
but um you know you could you could do
that in API slash programming language
right oh that's that's kind of I have a
slash there so how can you build a
programming language it'd be very
interested interesting for you to go do
that research but it's not as hard as
you think right so if you don't know
this Arnold Schwarzenegger has a
programming language where it's like
functions and and variables and types
are in like his quotes like get down
it's like a string or something right so
you could do something like that where
that would be a very interesting side
project where you say look I built I'll
just use Pokemon an example I built a
Pokemon programming language you go and
build something like that and I can
build it overnight but it's definitely
gonna be an interesting side project
that's going to set you apart from from
everybody else idea number tonight build
a plugin for one of your favorite tools
that you use right we we live in a day
and age where a lot of a lot of
applications whether it be a web browser
or whether it be a gaming let's take
League of Legends say you love League of
Legends you can build plugins and you
could build skins and you can build
build scripts for that that is something
I'd be interesting to be on your project
you could build that and then give it
away for free or charge a fee a freemium
model whatever it is a lot of these
things you can monetize down the road as
yes if well it's the money that you
would get by being a developer and being
employed and and learning and growing
number ten this is for somebody who is a
little bit more senior but you could
mentor or you could start a mentoring
site decide sort of gig slash advice
sidekick and you just got to market it a
little bit and maybe create a website
for it but mentoring helping people out
tutoring people this is all this is
another
a side gig where you just sort of create
a basic sight you mentor people and that
would be another great side Vegas well
side project idea number 11 hardware get
her ass bury pipe get Arduino build
something right a lot of these hardware
projects they involve code raspberry pi
I think can have her Arduino can have
like eight or nine different languages
and JavaScript is not one of them sue
sharp C++ all these sorts of things Java
build something and and it's okay if you
go and get a kit and you build so but
build something unique to you the
example I get for me is I would like to
get a Raspberry Pi and like get a red
bulb and hook it up to a YouTube API and
every time I get a subscriber it just
flashes for like five seconds nothing
crazy but that would be a unique project
to me and you could put that down on
your side projects ideas and that will
show show an employer that your
interesting person that's eager and
you're trying to build things and you
enjoy this right so look into the
hardware aspect idea number twelve this
is for someone who's a little bit more
money hungry slash wants to start an
interesting thing it's very easy to
start a basic hosting company by your
own server set up your hosting and then
rent out hosting space to your friends
set up a website and you might maybe
throw some ads up on Craigslist this is
something I'd be a very interesting site
project especially if you're more
interested in servers and databases than
anything else
idea number thirteen this is something
I'm also working on right now build a
Chrome extension you know I use things
like honey
JSON for matter the way you call this
the react tools you know so I use a
bunch of Chrome extensions I'm actually
working on building one right now every
Friday I get two hours to code on
anything I want it doesn't have to be
work early it's actually encouraged not
to be work-related and what I went on
building right now is a Chrome extension
that whenever I get a JavaScript console
err why I'm in my debugger it will
actually inject a coding meme one time
to kind of just have fun with it right
because it's frustrating when you get
bugs in your code that's the idea that's
what I'm working on so you could build a
Chrome extension to whatever it is that
you're interested in idea number
fourteen participate in a hackathon
go to hackathon you're gonna build
something it's often going to be with an
API you're not familiar with there's
your project there's your side project
and you can continue it on if you want
or you don't have to right I've talked
about my yourtube project go watch that
video in the where I talk about failing
out of it this it's like part of being
successful is fairly I forget what I
called the video but it talks about that
project that's something that I put on
my resume it's a unique project that I'm
proud of even though it's back when I
barely could code right I did number 15
cell coding product start a clothing
brand story notebook shirt right
you can I you know you don't necessarily
have to have a coding channel to start a
clothing get involved in the coding
culture and one of the cool things that
you can do is you if you are good at
graphic design and good at web design
you start designing your own logos
writing and selling coding products and
coding shirts you can start with one
shirt that would make a very interesting
side project let's see here so build a
software-as-a-service to replace an
old-style company this one's kind of a a
large long term project but I encourage
you to take on those long term projects
that you continue to grow and evolve so
software-as-a-service is an industry
that's growing very rapidly and what it
what it basically is is it means that
we're taking something old and we're
making it new and providing as a service
with software a good example of that is
uber where you used to have to call
taxis and now we have an app that kind
of hey it does it for us or we use that
do it counting by hand now we have
TurboTax you could build something
that's a very large project but you can
find a smaller and better example than
what I gave as to where you could get
started for that number 17 built reloj
board built a Trello board showcasing
how to learn a very specific skill set
over a six month period and share it and
post blogs about it and continue and
throw it on there I think it's a good
read I think I really think that's a
pretty cool thing because not only can
you show that you're that you have a
game plan and how far you are along that
game plan you can show the employers
that we'll look at this
say this guy's learning the right things
this guy is on a path and he has and
he's motivated and if he does what's on
this list he's definitely a great
candidate build a text editor plugin is
number 18 number 18 build a text IRA
plugin if you ever been in a text editor
like I use Visual Studio coding like
damn man I wonder if there's an
extension that exists for that the next
time you think that don't only look for
the extension but when you don't find it
build that yourself and get going
this is something I'd be a very cool
very appreciated plugin it's also
something that your employers could
actually just implement themselves if
they liked it you're gonna get a job
right build a hybrid app if you ever
wanted to build a web application
building a mobile app is great right
that's something that you can put on to
the market so it's gonna push it out
there and the employer the employee can
download it and get started number 20
this is for maybe the little more
experienced developers but build a
course build a course a coding course
build a software course web development
course whatever it is that you think you
can build provide value to and help
educate people build a course and it's
it's something that you can definitely
throw on your resume in your side
projects and would look amazing number
21 write a book and you're saying Oh
Dylan you know that I'm some of these
you know most of these I encourage I
would say about 75% of these you could
start today entry-level some of these
including this write a book is
entry-level and you're saying well I'm
not gonna write a technical book neither
am i most of us never will
I'm writing a book right now I don't
work on it as much as I should but the
book is essentially a hundred stories of
developers and how they got started one
of the very most interesting things I
find is seeing how everyone's path is
different mine has been different than
then you know program with Erics and
traversing media then Chris Hawkes
everyone's path is different and it's
great to to sometimes read up about that
and I'm that's one of my books that I
want to write and it's gonna be a great
portfolio down the road 22 build a web
app this is this may seem crazy but we
really haven't talked about that
- maybe the API but have you ever
actually built your own web application
have you ever built something that's up
there and I'm not talking about like a
calculator or a a you know a Simon game
where you can find tutorials build your
own custom web application and a custom
product custom project build it whatever
it is one things I have I have this
crazy idea for this custom dashboard
that I want to build that'd be an
example of a web app that there are
other dashboards out there but not like
what I want to do so build a web app as
crazy as it sounds number 23 start a
magazine there's gonna be a digital a
magazine but there's a lot of cool news
coming out in software and it may be you
write about it curated a little bit
start a digital magazine or even a print
magazine so if there was a coding
magazine that I could pay five ten
dollars a month for I totally would
that's a little bit more of a outlandish
one but it's an idea number 20 for
starting an open-source project started
a very grand project that's open source
to see if you can jump in or work on one
as well so that one might overlap a
little bit with one or two of the other
ones but hey I'm trying here people this
is 25 get a certification right there so
and it's not really Sai project but
equally important through your resume go
and get a certification in whatever it
is that you're interested you're
interested JavaScript there's a
certification out there that you can go
and get in that you're interested in
Java there's a certification that you
can go from Oracle and get that there
you're nervous in Linux there's a
certification for that go spend your
time and get that certification for your
resume now number 2000 every 26 compete
slash work on and rank high on an
algorithm site you guys see me rank up
on code fights at a certain point that's
going to look very good to put that on
my resume and even if they don't know
what it is I can throw on their code
fights level blah blah blah and they'll
say what is this code fights ninja class
thing as like used oh well I I solved
300 algorithms and this is what it is
it's just a high ranking I thought it
was kind of cool it shows that you're
unique and then you're studying and
another great thing that you can do and
number 27 a web crawler this is
something that may be a little bit
controversial but show that you have a
web crawler that you've built a web
crawler and make it viewable so people
can see the crazy amount of stuff that
you can just rip data off the internet
that's cool little project number 28 an
Instagram coding meme channel or site or
profile whatever you want to call it
build that it's fun you're gonna enjoy
it right it's something that I want to
start eventually I just haven't gotten
around to it cuz I'm always starting
side projects
I love side projects and number
twenty-nine analytics slash FinTech
project analytics and financial tech is
huge industry this is something that you
could get going if you're interested in
crypto currencies if you're interested
in stock trading there's a bunch API so
you could use and get started with it
with these are just a few ideas so quite
a bit I I mean this is what I was able
to come up with and uh just kind of
freelancing twenty-nine ideas maybe like
26 some might have overlapped a little
bit but I hope at the very least it got
your juices flowing as I said in the
beginning of this video please please
please share your ideas share your
projects I want people to see this and I
want you all to start a side project it
will make you the most interesting
candidate it will make you so much of a
better developer and you'll enjoy coding
a lot more once you find a side project
you enjoy and it may not be the first
one you start it may not be the second
one but you eventually will find one
that you fit your groove and you'll
enjoy it and you may have to start a
couple and it may become part of your
life and that if that's the case you're
going to become a much better developer
over your lifetime I encourage you all
to do it and I hope that these 29 ideas
or so or torrent will call 26.5 we've
this 26.5 ideas helped you out I wish
you all the best I really do and so I
make lists like this and videos like
this because I want you guys to succeed
because it
III am I'm doing very well ever since
becoming a developer and I encourage you
all to do your best and continue to grow
and grind and I think side projects are
a huge part of that so thank you so much
