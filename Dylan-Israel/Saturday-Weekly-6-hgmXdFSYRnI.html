here and he brought me this toy too to
play alright so welcome everybody today
is Saturday for those of you are new to
the channel or haven't caught one of the
live streams before this is what I call
my weekly Saturday weekly series I gotta
come up with a better name you get the
idea from it but I'm gonna start doing
topic oriented more so these are every
Saturday I leave the live streams up
yesterday you might have caught a
two-hour live stream that is different
that is for every thousand subscribers
kind of similar so you get a little bit
extra of me there's only so much to go
around
Ricky orange David yang and II am how is
it going arey P we got the we got the
whole news what up dude is this a QA are
you just talking about what you want a
little bit of both so usually I start
talking about a few things and I start
answering questions in the process so
feel free to spam the chat with
questions it also helps me talk about
and also how I encourage the questions
because that's part of the reason I do
these but also allows me to make video
gives me topics for you know I'll answer
the question but sometimes if it's a
good question I'll actually just film a
video about it so that other people will
see it cuz not everyone's gonna watch
the livestream a good example of that
was from our conversation yesterday I
filmed a video about I went and pulled
up some stats on why you shouldn't get a
why you shouldn't get a swear I'm
looking for shouldn't get an unpaid
internship not an opinion although it
obviously everything I have on here has
some opinion in it but I went and pull
up some stats to support my opinion at
the end
day okay can't shoot a question about
wireframing yeah yeah definitely
um I'm surprised it didn't get approved
it may still be pending what am i
working on this weekend YouTube
basically fill a little under the
weather
a little bit tired I'm I'm detoxing from
drinking a bunch of energy drinks and
I'm trying to get back on the straight
and narrow so I've been drinking like
you'll see here and my Super Mario Cup I
have black tea just something to keep me
functional congratulations and II am on
the first job but lately on the weekends
I've just been working on YouTube stuff
I actually really want to change that
I've been thinking about finally
building a a what we call it a store not
necessarily for the YouTube channel but
I have I want to start a coding store
and I talked a little bit about that so
even though financially capital wise I
don't necessarily I basically would be
choosing between starting a business and
buying a home I would like to build that
store in angular 4 just as a side
project before I want that you want the
360 shirt you better get it why it's hot
because I've been thinking about
renaming the the channel just to Dylan
Israel
so we'll see there are no coding Toros
360 shirts I know a lot of people sell
shirts and stuff I just I don't know I
just don't I've never wanted to buy a
youtubers shirt so I never would ever
make something like that I tend to just
kind of stick with what I know
Andre Conejo if you're trying to get
some wire framing done quickly I I could
recommend balsamic that's what I use I
love it and I couldn't recommend it more
it's it's intuitive it's quick it's
great I would start with balsamic and
just start building it out you can get
you can get your wireframes done in
balsamic in no time now I do believe
that it's not a free product there may
be a trial so you can try it out and if
you like it it's like seventy dollars a
year or for an unlimited license it's
pretty it's pretty reasonably priced
that's where I would start when going
with wireframe that's my go-to tool I
really think it's probably the best on
the market
it's quick it's fast it uses icons for
font awesome so it's going to look
somewhat similar they also have two
different modes balsamic like balsamic
vinegar but IQ so be al sa miq balsamic
wireframes I've never touched figma no
the only things that I have wire-framed
in is balsamic I'm also wire-framed in
pencil project and I've also hand drawn
things and I have for free user flows
use Gliffy which is amazing for that
sort of stuff but I can't say I mean I
can't really say anything else I can
just tell you that I really like
balsamic it's always done the job for me
recent /nu vir really liked your comment
how you present any plans to ever
develop with python with any of its
frameworks i knows - basically
oh not in the media future man somebody
just asked me if i had interest in a RvR
the thing that i and the reason i say
not in the media future is because if i
were to ever transition from web
development i would dive into blockchain
and that's something that I would Python
I believe you just one language the use
of possibly this cute cat over here
aren't you trying it you trying to show
me YouTube famous kitty huh sure every
YouTube famous kitty yeah yeah but uh
yeah so that might be when I jump into
Python it's a Python in college I've
done some Python courses just in the
media future nothing that's on the only
horizon
I'm fully plan on sticking with
javascript but if there ever comes a
point in time where I want to transition
to something else which can fit can tap
happen right I've talked to iOS
developers who used to do front-end and
they just wanted to do something new and
blockchain or data science would
probably be where I would go
I did try the slide at my job yes it's
fast it was surprisingly fast I am uh I
am familiar with Gary Vaynerchuk yes
thank you for the contract our video
took the risk and left my first
full-time dev job for a bigger
opportunity with Turner nice well I hope
that works out for you
you know it's contractor hire is a very
common practice in this field a lot of
it is can we actually work with this
person much longer or like can we work
with this person long term and a lot of
times I just don't know until six months
in you well usually they'll know after a
month but the contractor hired parts
usually about six months first full-time
web dev wasn't much of a deaf job it was
more of a web master role did you do
WordPress it's so funny you say that
because I have a I am I have a video
coming out talking comparing saying
should you be a wordpress developer and
I make a very good point about how when
we look up the skillset WordPress
specifically the skill WordPress and you
look up the other skills you'll notice
that half the jobs on there are not are
not um sort of looking for are not
actual developer jobs so I get questions
about WordPress all the time but I
finally wanted to do a video about it so
we have some good videos coming out this
week I really like the the videos come
out we have the WordPress video I just
discussed we have a I'm turning 30 on
almost it's Wednesday and so I have a
video talking about the five things that
that I wish I knew as a younger man or I
could tell my younger self and then I
have the video showcasing why you should
never do an unpaid internship so I I if
you guys I highly encourage you to check
all that out yeah I won't take any PHP
jobs either I did some contract work
recently in PHP and it reminded me how
much I hated PHP even though I was
getting compensated very well it's uh
it's something I don't ever plan
do it again I thank you it's just not
worth it
top three PC games at the moment
although I haven't played PC games in
quite some time
I haven't played games really in quite
some time if I were I would say League
of Legends for my personal favorites
would be League of Legends would be
definitely in this is no particular
order but Liga legends I love I love
civilization although I like
civilization 5 probably the best so
civilization and then you get throw in
interchangeably Warcraft although I've
been played Warcraft in like a decade I
love to Warcraft but if I'd play a more
recent one that I would I would play
would probably be ex home or ex home too
I haven't played breath in the wilds yet
no I don't have a Nintendo switch right
I purposely go out of my way not to play
games guys so I'm not quite there yet uh
thanks is a softcore developer that's a
new term I've heard that but that's cool
as a as someone learning development the
only languages I know our SQL Visual
Basic and recently Python basis a
challenge Oscar if I want to do web
development should I stick with Python
and go Jango um if you're gonna do
Python you definitely probably want to
go Jango if you're gonna do PHP you want
to do layer value if you're gonna do
JavaScript you're going to want to pick
up a probably front-end framework like
angular or react maybe some node since
I've been working at this new company
have you seen them bring in any new
deaths um
I know they're interviewing for roles
but they have not brought any I am the
newest hire to my knowledge no I take it
back they have hired somebody so yes
they have I just remembered right now I
talked with them recently about graphics
cards at a at a at a new hire mixer that
they put on
I got the hand on the Mikey and then I
got it off who do I have winning TJ
versus Cody carb rent I don't really
know I think that's going to be a pretty
close match I would like TJ Dillashaw to
lose I would say that Cody since this is
this is just logic that doesn't really
make sense but even PMMA analyst will
say they'll base their knowledge off
this even though it doesn't mean
anything but since sis Dominick Cruz
beat TJ Dillashaw and Cody gar Brandt
beat
Dominick Cruz convincingly
I will say that if I were gonna throw my
money on it I would definitely go on
Cody Garber I'd be that would be my bet
a sneaker how experienced do I need to
be to be a QA tester not very a lot of
QA is documentation writing tests
creating acceptance criteria it's one of
the roles that sometimes they offer to
devs who aren't really quite ready to be
developers it's definitely an
entry-level position most of the time
but it doesn't have to be and I'm making
generalizations in this but these would
be generalizations I think most people
would make
your buddy
say hi say hi to the youtubes
um I considered taking a QA roll but
luckily I never I never got an interview
a lot of QA rolls I feel like go to
recent college grads and I never got an
interview for any role if I think if I
stayed at at my technology trainer role
I probably would have gone to QA how
long did it take you to get through the
front-end portion of freako camp and
what's of my only learning tool but I
would say that it took me probably about
nine months from start to finish
nine months to a year it's Florida still
in shambles from the hurricane that's
it's funny certain areas certain areas
yes but not not really like some roofs
are missing shingles there's like trees
that I've been cut up that are still on
the side of the road you got an offer
for QA so you're just wondering I would
say don't worry about it too much but
sometimes a lot of times sometimes
people get pigeonholed into QA and they
didn't want him they just want their
foot in the door so just make sure
you're working outside of work if that's
nots not where you want your career to
go Bitcoin mining any more videos on it
maybe a lot of people gave me a lot of
 for sharing the bit Petite one but
we'll see
bitcoins doing great man I almost have
one full Bitcoin I have like point eight
six bitcoins are you doing stink Oh
buddy
daddy got your belly to read your belly
Oh
yeah I also have a theory I'm and
litecoin
how do you manage stress it's a very
interesting question because it comes
and goes right so I the first thing that
I know that for me on how I make sure to
keep my how I make sure to keep my
stress level down is I don't have
commitments and what I mean by that is I
don't have financial obligations I don't
have things that I have to be at other
than work and I eliminate those so I
hate committing to things that require
me to be somewhere when like I'd rather
much I'd rather just do what I want to
do so for me that helps manage my stress
now if there's something that is
stressing me out I go and tackle it I
find that I personally and I think a lot
of people do this just think about
things too much on the back burner I
never actually tackled the problem so
like if you're worried about money a lot
of people would just be worried about
money the rest of their life go and get
more money
think about it figure it out get a
better job
sophomore yeah that's that's so I was
always worried about money and I'm still
worried about money but I don't have the
same worries I'm worried about how I can
have more money to buy a house not about
how I'm gonna have enough money to feed
myself in a problem but I try to
eliminate the things that stress me out
and I say this a lot about people about
my fears and about other people's fears
is oftentimes the anticipation is the
worst part so if you actually just
tackle whatever it is that's stressing
you out or whatever it is that's making
you anxious it's a lot better than not
doing it
and just even if you fail at it you'll
feel much better so that that would be
happy in mine my advice you still broke
after purchasing a house Kevin I know
I've I actually went and looked at
places today I wasn't too impressed with
what we looked at its the hype around
Disney World real we haven't actually
gone and I took April to Universal
Studios I can tell you the price ticket
of one hundred and sixty-five dollars to
go to Universal Studios is quite real
quite real at 165 doesn't count food
that doesn't count parking oh my god I
spent like half a month of rent for like
six hours in and university was crazy
who did I dislike going why did I
dislike going to college um particularly
the curriculum I also disliked that most
of teachers did not care so there are
two teachers I remember very clearly
that I enjoyed and both of them were ex
students but there's a lot of hey we
don't really care if you pass or if you
succeed and I'm not saying to make the
courses easier anything like that I'm
just saying they just don't care a lot
of the professor's were people who were
just there to get a check outside of
their normal job or they were professors
who this was their full-time job and
they really just didn't give a
about you and that was something I
really hated but I also just hated the
theory aspect of it I've always been one
of those people that enjoyed practical
things and you know I'm sure a bunch of
computer science people would disagree
with me that computer science degree
isn't practical and it's just theory
base that's why you have so many
computer science students that graduate
who still can't write lines of code so
that was I mean from for me personally
that was probably the thing that I hated
the most about it
probably the structure I don't know man
I was just really unhappy in school and
I and I don't know if I I kind of think
I kind of just wish I got an easier
degree not necessarily because I don't
think I could finish but because I was
working forty hours a week and I know
people do this by I just couldn't at the
time but the theory aspect was probably
the worst the the 15 math classes in
calculus and the four physics courses
all this sort of stuff that really just
didn't have any business being in it and
very little coding I thought I was gonna
be doing a lot more coding
spent 250 clean your car but I bet you
got 250 dollars worth of meat off that
deer so it kind of cancelled out you
know say my cats would be eating deer
for a month if I ran over a deer I just
throw the carcass on some tin foil and
let him chew on it Oh sometimes you
forget that these guys are vicious
little killers we salute them outside go
outside and they would just come back
with blizzards in their mouth and eat
them instantly like literally walk in
with a lizard half of its body hanging
outside their mouth and then they come
in and they they go and they like hey
let's go let's go let's cuddle after the
after they so after they get done eating
the lizard and by the way they don't
just eat the lizard they play with it
and torture it for their entertainment
and then maybe they eat it after and
then they go and they after they've just
murdered this smaller animal and then I
come back to you like nothing's
nothing's changed and they're like hey
can you pet me I feel like a good cat so
cats are very strange what do you think
of it like that that this this guy right
here has no problem murdering lizards
every day of the week
you're a dirty lizard murderer you're a
darn a lizard murder Oh daddy got you
daddy get you why good job okay you're
gonna knock it off
okay um you know I should write articles
on steam it maybe I mean I wonder why no
one ever talks about Java plus spring
for web development that's because no
one likes Java or spring except major
corporations that use it if you've ever
if you've ever worked in Java and I at
my college course or close in Java I
could tell you that it was awful
but I can't agree with you that there is
a lot of money in Java and the Spring
Framework that goes with it so it just
kind of pens
Kevin you can't make jobs on
how important is having communication
skills it's extremely crucial especially
when you're trying to get your foot in
the door
being able to formulate a sentence and
be able to not come across super awkward
in a field of awkward people will not
only help you rise to the top it will
also allow you to get hired
you're oftentimes working on teams of
five or six maybe a little bit more a
little bit less some company I mean you
need to be able to work with other
people and that innately requires
communication communication is the
number one soft skill of any job is also
the number one soft skill of being a
developer period and it's something that
you need to improve on
dots on PHP I'd rather stick my dick in
a blender the write in PHP no huh I'm
not a fan that might have been a little
too much but I'm not a fan part of it's
just a weird dirty language I did about
nine months of it at my last work and I
really didn't like it I tried to man I
really did
I kind of blame the fact that we're
using that CakePHP framework with it
instead of something like laravel but I
I'm not a fan I try I really did try to
like it I just couldn't
when you're first learning code do you
ever feel like giving up if so what did
you do to get over that hump well this
is kind of a two-part answer when I was
in school I definitely felt like it it's
hard because you're Here I am Here I am
in this spending time and money enrolled
in a CS program that I'm not enjoying
and the only part I enjoy the coding
classes was just maybe one fifth of the
program so I find that I like coding but
I don't like getting a computer science
degree and so there are times where I
thought about giving up and that just
kind of was one in one I never really
thought of giving up the goal of being a
developer obviously I gave up on going
on finishing my degree but I could say
when I made the decision to drop out
start working even if I was just doing
technical documentation I studied every
day for many hours and ton on the
weekend and I never gave up once there
there's a conversation I've quoted a
couple times with April where when I
dropped out and she's oh she came over
and she's like you know what's your game
plan if at what point do you do you give
up on being self-taught and going this
developer way not from a negative
standpoint but from a hey I want to be
practical at what point do you say you
know what I need to go back to school
and to me it wasn't ever a question it's
just like I will grind until I get there
and it took me nine months from when I
stopped going to school to get my first
full stack developer role that was a
little over a year ago maybe here in
three months but when I made the
decision to stop going to school there
is no giving up at that point you are
making the adult decision to change your
course in life and were there days that
I didn't want to code of course there
was those days that I'm tired those days
that I'm stress there's days that
are harder than others right there's
days that you're feeling like loot a
loser I you know and that was I had
those April on those days would tell me
that you know I'm not and those were the
hard ones those were those are the hard
ones when you are feeling just like
you're not where you're want where you
want to be in life you're living
paycheck to paycheck you can't go and
get your your wisdom teeth taken out
that are affected cuz you got any money
you're borrowing twenty dollars from
your mom your mom's bringing you
groceries this is why I was working as a
technology trainer and you're living in
this shithole shack basically of a room
and things are roughing so there there's
always those days but when I when I
wanted to when I made the decision there
was no going back and that was that
simple what was the alternative was the
alternative not to and do technical
writing that death wasn't alternative
for me
no offense eka right I agree with you on
PHP
I have a couple podcasts that are
getting recorded right now I'm actually
gonna film on with Ricky pretty soon I
filmed one with Tyler McGinnis that will
be going out so look forward to that
we'll see what I end up calling it I I
mean I can tell you Kevin that I've
worked in PHP and I don't like it
and I think most people would agree with
the statement that it is but it is fair
to say that maybe I haven't used it
enough and I don't enjoy it so I have to
agree to disagree with you on that one
why didn't you just get an information
system segrand said I'm finishing up my
junior year at the point that I dropped
out am I going to change my degree and
also you're talking to someone who is so
miserable that even though you have all
the family supporting you and and
wanting you on this path I didn't want
to be there and I was so done mentally
about it that it was like finish degree
or dropout there's no other if I changed
my degree I'm having another two years
at it alright so how often do I write
full complete full stack code well my
last role was full stack now in front
end so not too often the last five weeks
but at my last role for the last year I
did some full stack contract work a week
ago
I know I did get so guys I did get the
wisdom teeth out teeth they're all good
man I got the I got the braces we're all
in the clear on that stuff I'm just
telling you I'm just telling you where
my mind was that at that point in time
have ever met anyone's a CSS /s CSS
specialists know they're out there
but I'm not
filezilla any good I don't know
so funny
we're hanging out with the dance Oh
Oh crazy cat
do I offer sorry guys do I offer
one-on-one mentoring says Joshua
Covington I do but it's in our
increments and it is $90 for an hour so
part of the reason I do these live
streams is so that I can answer your
questions because that is a lot of money
for most for most people in the world so
it's not it's not something that
everyone can afford just so little time
so if it is something you're interested
in you can shoot me an email you can go
to coding tutorials 360 calm and see it
on there if you want to talk to somebody
whether they found it helpful or not
David yang in chat has taken taken one
of my mentoring sessions and so he can
either vouch for me or he can say god
man Dylan really just took I think I
think when I did with Davey o 75 that uh
just damn man Dylan robbed me blind to
my $75 yeah so I try to do my best to
help you guys out with the channel but
if I did if I did mentoring for
everybody I would be doing it you would
I'd be doing it eight hours a day for
free and see em the 90 so if you're
interested something like that you can
definitely find out find out the details
on the website and we'll set something
up
remember my name first name code last
name god yeah just look for if you know
cutting Toros 360 comm you'll see a
tutor session there basically just be a
button that you click and that will send
you to basically prepay on PayPal and
then shoot me an e-mail or you can shoot
me an email at Dylan's email 3 1 o at
gmail.com and let me know what it is
that you're talking about because I
don't want you to book or what it I
don't want you booked something and then
I have to refund you because you want me
to give you an in-depth breakdown a
c-plus plus and I don't do C++ so what
happened to your home slash office
nothing man I'm just sitting down just
hanging out with the Tito um yeah I'd so
I'm just with staring at computer
screens for a while last couple days and
just a different different you know get
a different perspective from me so you
get to get it on the phone
for the next day or so trying just it
allows me to pace also so you guys don't
know this but I am a horrible pacer I
pasted that around the house all the
time
Oh dual arm says big inspiration got my
first deaf jobs this year donates $2
super chats $2 I think is the tech mr.
Thank You Man
congratulations on your first step y'all
man that's the big one that's the hard
one I mean they're all good ones but uh
give me Oh
as you can see I'm not fully skilled
with holding the phone yet as I keep on
dropping down but as I was saying
congratulations on landing your first
web dev job man
it always feels I was so excited for you
that I
just drop the phone I'm sure excitement
yeah Mike Mike draw that's right baby um
but uh congratulations and thank you for
the support man that's really cool I
don't ever expect anyone to financially
support but I love it when you do we're
gonna change the pace real quick so I
guess I got some new things I'm doing in
the video so I hope you guys are gonna
like um I'm trying at the end of the
video to throw in like a 5 to 10 second
joke that's related to the video so make
sure you guys are watching till the end
I have it in the WordPress video so far
and I have it in the the UM the unpaid
internship video the the video about the
five thinks I wish I knew is coming out
this week I didn't put it in there cuz I
I already made that video and uploaded
it before I came up with this idea but
look forward to that
Silicon Valley God what did that be cool
man you know what that this is how big
of a Silicon Valley got fan I am and
this was before their recesses and I
have been actually watched by sentiment
email said hey is there any way I could
be an extra on your show I will fly out
and put myself in there just for the fun
of it like that would be so cool to me
um just a little small coding channel
extra walked by in a scene or something
naturally they hit me back but that
would have been so excited what do you
think about code Kadim ii intense pro
front-end dev course for 10 weeks I
would say that I think I'd be very
skeptical of anything that doesn't allow
doesn't have any ratings on it and who
when they were doing this program before
I think it was under a different name at
that point but it was a very it was a
very misleading misleading um title and
the subject was poor I would say that
your prep money's probably better spent
doing Udacity or Udacity that nano
degree or udemy course yes that's what I
believe
I mean you can go I have two videos
actually talking about the program and I
can tell you that why you watch those
I'll tell you why I thought why I
thought they were poor but you can also
read the comments people took them who
will agree with you
ooh most of the time will say you know I
took this and it was awful
yeah I'm not I'm not a super big fan of
that
what they're trying to do recently not
that I don't anything do that I paid for
the react now a degree program for $300
I just think that they could be doing a
much better job than they are know I did
a video recently talking about their
Alexa course and a little bit of a rant
about a little bit about a bit of a rant
about how I think code Academy is
failing that might be something worth
watching if you're considering it but I
think you're $200 is much better spent
on 10 $20 courses on udemy or you or
Udacity
usually on udemy
I mean free tokens great if you're just
trying to get started I think it's great
for JavaScript there's nothing wrong
with it by the way I say this not to
tell you to do one or the other I
encourage you to do them all if you do
them all you'll you'll be in a much
better position down the road how many
actual projects that I have when I start
applying for jobs I want to say there's
five or six one was my youtube channel
one was a angular version of the weather
application one was a jQuery twitch API
project one was my website
one was a hackathon project and then one
was another free code camp project
depending it depending on what time in
place so that was kind of what I had on
there
you know Joshua I mean your network
security guy there's nothing wrong with
going into DevOps there's good money in
that and good job demand and if that's
the skill set you already have it might
be something worth considering engineer
choose trying to call me
well tell ya I I told him I call him
back in 20 minutes he says I'll be in
class what class is he taking that he
did tell me he joined a cult recently
say
uh so I got lucky it's what black guy is
saying here can't get a job I know back
into well I mean it could depend on the
quality of your projects or good depend
on your communication skills and and
everything else
I mean if someone came in and could code
but had a negative attitude I wouldn't
hire him and I'd recommend he'd not get
hired how much time do I spend coding
per day well I spent 40 hours a week
getting paid to do it and I probably do
about ten hours a week on my own not as
much as I used to a lot of my time gets
chewed up by YouTube a lot of my time
gets chewed up by side projects podcasts
emails talking to sponsors
trying to do that type of stuff so I
haven't been a I've been focused more in
YouTube than I have been on actually
coding and something I want to switch up
in the near future
what do you say to people that say that
the tech industry will be saturated in
ten years and that people today
shouldn't get into it um I would say
what are the alternatives you're talking
about if I would also say that you're
probably not looking at the numbers
right so fastest group one one of the
fast growing faster than the average
large amount of jobs very high salary
and that and that well like what do you
want that it's a fast-growing salary
it's growing faster than the average
jobs there's a lot of jobs what's the
alternative
it's just people being beat it's just
people whirring in my opinion there
aren't that many jobs if you look at it
most of the YouTube coders are
freelancers what there are a ton of jobs
it's just hard to get your first job how
did I study 12 hours a day I used to
study 12 hours a day when I wasn't
working as a developer
and I I don't actually think that's true
by the way that most of YouTube coders
are freelancers I think most of them
probably works for corporations and
decided that when they could they would
work for themselves
guys there's plenty of jobs out there um
I actually just had the random mixer so
I've never really worked with recruiters
before but uh I've probably talked with
about 20 since I when I was looking for
work and they all saw recently that I
updated my LinkedIn so I got within a
week about five or ten voice mails
trying to steal me away like you know
hey Dylan this is this is Tasha just
want to let you know it I saw that you
update your LinkedIn so it sounds like
you found something just wanna make sure
you're happy and if there's if there's
anything I could do for you you know I'm
not trying to steal you away Dylan I
just wanna I just want to let you know
what's going on on the market out there
and just so that you're informed for
yourself just like I don't know what you
offer me that uh but that was that I've
had I've had in this last week or two
about five or ten lows
um how do you know when you're ready to
get a developer job the example I always
give is when you can start up when you
open up a text editor and you can start
a project and you just start building if
you can do that you're probably pretty
solid
did Chris Shawn get hacked I don't think
so someone said that I think you just
took down his video the other day but I
checked his channel this last night
where someone said that
how much caffeine do you consume a day I
have an espresso usually and then I'll
have some black tea so not that much
I've been trying to cut back although if
I look extra tired and I'm looking at
myself it looks like I am extra tired
it's because I am cutting back on my
caffeine so it's just taking it's taken
up wear and tear on me for the weekend
also April snores a lot and if I get
super if I can't sleep because the story
I go sleep on the couch and that's
happened three times this week
would you say tech industry is like
every other engineering major you can't
get it enough except civil engineering
walls between America's infrastructure
always needs to improve my heart I would
say that if you look anything if you
look at the growth of all the
engineering if you take all the other
engineering disciplines and add the job
growth it is still like 20% of what is
in software engineering so if you
consider those things great
opportunities then the computer science
software engineering aspect should be
god-tier in terms of that
so if so maja my hair I I recently put
out a video saying should you get a
computer science degree go and watch
that video when you get a second man a
lot of these questions will be answered
and we'll be going over that so I should
all CSS bootstrap jQuery is good enough
for junior developer position my
javascript is still questionable maybe
at some places I would probably
recommend you pick up angular or react
our mini software engineers hired from
overseas a certain percent is I don't
know what many is though like what what
defines many
is it possible to get a day's data
science job without what is that
without a degree like learn at home
self-taught yeah it's probably possible
but it's definitely gonna be harder
because in that in that role you need a
lot of math what typically just comes
with I imagine there's math courses on
on udemy but it's probably gonna be a
little bit harder than maybe front-end
or back-end development
if you just want some projects first off
I would always suggest starting a long
term project but if you just want
something on your resume build a
portfolio site to start and then build
some stuff that you're interested in
build something that uses build a basic
crud application for for something that
you would use I think that would be
probably your best case because it
sounds like you you haven't done a put
or a get or post or delete like these
are the things that you're going to need
to be somewhat familiar with
is it hard for you to get down how state
works in react no not really
uh yeah I mean so Joshua you're talking
about DevOps which is sounds anything
you're talking about deployment
networking it's DevOps servers
sounds good Joshua just let me know
shoot me an email we'll set up a time
when we could talk
same thing with you neo Tarek Phoenix if
you want to dive one-on-one we can book
a mentoring and we I can kind of help
you we look at your resume we can look
at your github we can look at your your
Linkedin cover letter talk about what
projects you can get started on these
are usually a lot of the topics that we
cover when I do mentoring because those
are the things that you can start
changing today you have $1,000 where
would you invest in Bitcoin I would
invest it into Bitcoin maybe a theory
Umrah like coin but most likely Bitcoin
or spread it out between all three now
as fast well I invest money every
paycheck I currently have money invest
in a stock market I've money invested in
peer-to-peer lending I also have money
invested in crypto currencies and I am
of the belief that Bitcoin will go to
25,000 within two years go we're in a
book mentoring it's 90 dollars for an
hour if you didn't hear that earlier but
it's you can shoot me an email make sure
that I can I guess we already talked
about your topic so I think I can help
you but you just go to my website coding
tutorials 360 calm you'd pre PA there
and then shoot me an email and we can
set up a time that's all
did I pull an all-nighter when you were
learning to code all the time I don't
advise it but I did do it all the time I
was sleep-deprived for a very long time
which is why I don't do it anymore I
actually get eight to nine hours every
night although my sleep has been messed
up because I fell off the train and I
started drinking energy drinks and doing
all that sounds like a good mentor and
investing as well I could definitely
talk to you about the basics of
peer-to-peer lending I could talk to you
about the basics of the stock market I
could talk to you about the basics of
crypto currencies I don't claim to be an
investment guy but I am learning I could
talk to you about the importance of not
having a savings account and instead
having money and things like a corns or
betterment as your savings account which
have a five-day withdrawal period but
earn you in some cases up to five times
235 times back the amount of interest
for the essentially the same
functionality so I could talk to you
about that so but it's all it's all
relative right so if you're not if
you're just getting started with
investing I could definitely explain to
you some concepts but it's something
that I'm constantly educating myself on
so
I want to say I'm an investment whiz by
any check stretch of the imagination I
do watch a couple investment channels on
the daily I would encourage you guys if
you want some really good high-quality
content to watch The Business Insider on
YouTube it's an amazing Channel
oh you got it
alright guys uh I'll stay on for about
five more minutes so if there's anybody
is holding out a good question now it's
the time I'm getting a little sleepy and
then I'll end up my final thoughts but
I'll take one or two more questions and
then we're gonna call tonight for
Saturday weekly Saturday night weekly
with the night live streams hopefully
some of you guys who I'm trying to make
a an effort to do these at night which
is why I did one last night it's
definitely not because I'm too busy
because I did it for y'all know um but
um one thing I would say just uh I feel
bad because I know a lot of people are
different time zones so okay so this
will be the last question that I'll do
my final thoughts I just enrolled in a
react now degree do you have any advice
for me to get the most out of it yes I
highly encourage you to get familiar
with es6 and I also encourage you to
work on it every day they have the
extracurricular courses and I would
encourage you to and I have two videos
on the rack nanodegree watch those but I
would also say that just treat it like
job man put in your two hours a day
every day regardless how tired you two
are and start with the extracurricular
and knock that out as fast as you can
and then jump into the the rackmount
agree if I understand a trick a mortgage
joke and I be a developer one on one for
40 hours is like okay yeah with me it'd
be $3,600 yeah okay guys so um the way
that I like to to end my live streams is
I like to the owner the in honor of
Jerry Springer I'd like to give you all
my final thoughts
so
what do we want tongue let's let's
discuss our final thoughts about a few
things right now um recently we're
talking about being afraid of things and
someone in chat said what is my response
to two people who say in 10 years the
fields gonna be oversaturated and it's
going to be we're all just wasting our
time so there's gonna be a million
people and so a lot of times if you can
make yourself afraid in life there's
definitely a way I'm not saying that
there's my issue with a lot of people in
this world is that they want to believe
the worst will always happen even if the
best case even if you're showing that
the best is what's happening so
specifically if you're entering a field
that has high growth it has a very high
barrier of entry in terms of technical
skill and it has a lot of jobs and
you're worried that this thing that's
hard to get into that is growing very
rapidly with no signs of slowing down
that you're going to be out of a job
before you even start is a very
unrealistic fear to have and I say that
because if it was a realistic fear I
would have no problem telling you like
I'm already okay I have experience I'm
in the field I would have no problem
telling you hey watch out y'all like
good but my point I'm trying to make is
not to answer that specific critique but
to say that when you have facts and you
have stats to answer these questions
that are worrying you and even if you
get the right answers or if you see the
facts and they say this is what's
happened and you just want to ignore
them you can you know it's fine there's
a bunch of people that believe the earth
is flat also so you don't have to
exactly ignore you don't always have to
believe the facts you just yell fake
news but you're only going to shoot
yourself in the foot and
process so my point is this is that when
you have a very clear-cut thing and that
is about as clear-cut as any field is in
terms of the three main things job
growth salaries amount of jobs
all three of those are very wet doing
very well and growing so why would you
be worried about that
there's a million there's a million
different things that you could be
worried about that actually makes sense
that's I want to so so what I'm trying
to say is try and focus your energy on
the issues that are real issues and not
just being paranoid about things like
the earth being flat right so anyhow
that's my two cents guys try in just
when you get good news except that it's
good
verify trust but verify but uh don't
worry about things and if you want to be
negative you're always there's always
gonna be a way to be negative and I'm
not saying be woefully optimistic where
it's causing issues but you can always
look and find anything that you don't
want if you look hard enough and you can
always just not believe what you see so
have a nice night guys I appreciate you
showing up see you in the next same tune
in for the videos next week I guess</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
