AI has to be exact Chris Hawkes actually
did and if you're not familiar Chris
honks he is a youtuber that basically
talks about development and programming
related topics in his most current video
it's he he has a a very clickbait titled
called quitting YouTube and it's not
really even clickbait but a title like
that it will always be considered
clickbait but he talks about a lot of
things that I think are really important
about what are you doing on YouTube
in his case he talks he mentions a lot
about how it kind of sets him that his
clique baby videos do better than then
perhaps his is more technical videos
right and he talks about how in the past
he's devoting time and energy to YouTube
and he doesn't know what - what - like
where is this going
where's this going in and you know after
you just trying to become a better
developer and maybe get into like a lead
developer role is this going to affect
his prospects in the future is this
going to and it was very enlightening
video and I related a lot to the video
because we're kind of in the same space
right and I've been a fan of Chris's for
about five months or so and you know I
don't catch every video but I do watch
some and I can definitely relate to some
of the sentiment about thinking hey you
know what am i what am i doing on
YouTube what it where is it going and I
think that the issue with him is here
that perhaps you I always have looked at
YouTube as a back-up plan and as a way
to supplement my to supplement my my
learning and like - it's like that extra
something else you know it's it's just I
and that's why when I went
I talk about these things and I spend
time on YouTube I probably spent on
average about an hour to two hours a day
on YouTube related stuff which isn't
that much right it's basically a
part-time job let's say I spent 20 hours
a week I don't make enough to and he
talks about like well what is he doing
with this because he doesn't make enough
I don't know what his money situation is
but if I just tripled what could you
drop three times the size of me if I
tripled what I make at his size he still
and he has many more you and logistics
what I make and I'm my first year as a
developer he's probably making maybe
thirty to forty percent at best what he
makes as a as a developer and so he
can't do it full-time
and it's he starts talking about what
about you know how do i how do i you
know to divide how did they divide his
time up because here he's spending all
this time learning technical things and
he wants to videos about that and
doesn't want to do to click maybe boring
stuff but that's what gets the views
it's kind of a an interesting thing so
why am i making this video well for one
it really resonated with me and i think
i think what we may see is that chris
takes a short hiatus and finds that
passion because I know for me at times
when I when I when I really went after
YouTube and is about a two or three
month period of my life where I wanted
to do YouTube full-time that that's the
goal and I still would like that and I
think maybe five years down the road or
something like that that could happen
but I don't know if like I always now
look at it as a hobby not necessarily a
career and and I can I can definitely
relate to spending a lot of time on a
technical video which why don't do it
either because you get to an hours upon
hours doing these technical videos then
you get 300 views when in reality if you
just talked about JavaScript's coming to
an end and then you just you know as a
clickbait on and they get thousands of
using comparison right and so it's it's
frustrating it I think you
frustrated and I could I could share in
that frustration now I hope he doesn't
go anywhere because I I do like if you
like crazy I think he's one of the very
few voices of reason in the coding space
and one of one of the one of the reasons
I say that if there's a lot of these
up-and-coming channels that are giving
advice that have no years of experience
or giving advice is just terrible advice
and I have no place giving it which is
why when I give advice on my channel I
try to say stay away from advice
necessarily and say hey this is what I
do maybe it can help you out too so like
my most recent video I talked about how
to know what to learn what to study
what's a study if you're trying to get
into the field and and that's how I do
it
it's literally word for word exactly how
I execute what I learned for or you know
what how why study algorithms so why am
i studying algorithms so I always try to
I never try to maybe go abstract and
sometimes you do obviously but I always
try to stay on track in on the topics
that I care about and that I have
actually done a lot of times a lot of
these channels that are coming up they
just tell you I don't know if it's what
you want to hear or they tell you the
nice stuff and not necessarily the best
stuff and that's one of the reasons I
like Matt's channel or engineer truth
channel so much is and he that's why
sometimes he gets kind of a high dislike
or like to dislike ratio is because I he
kind of cuts out the and he
says hey they thought what the world
should be like this is how it is and let
me let me not sugarcoat it for you and
sometimes people can't handle that right
some people and it sometimes people just
need you to tell them what they want to
hear and what I say is I like that about
Chris like I feel like he's always been
very straight up like this is what it
takes this is what it is and that's
something I've always respected about
him so I hope he doesn't go anywhere and
I don't think you
well but I do think that that over time
as this channel grows that sort of
feeling that hey is this worth my time
may go away and he may have to change
his outlook about what to expect from
YouTube like for me what I expect from
YouTube is a is a portfolio item I
expect to take skills that I'm already
gaining and make easily transferable
content to it and I expect to make a
little bit of money not a lot of bit of
money but a little bit maybe down the
road I'll make some money maybe down the
road I'll I'll get there but in the
short term I feel like YouTube is
especially in such a niche area that
Chris and I am men and other other
channels like us is that it is a very it
is a very long marathon and when you try
to sprint to catch up in that marathon
you end up burning yourself out I've
know I've done it and I think I might be
what's happening with him but I just I
don't know I don't know man it would be
a shame that somebody who is a fellow
self-taught developer as well which is
really really nice to hear and Chris are
only six years apart in age so we're
kind of pretty pretty close in age so I
can kind of relate to to where he's at
and like he's worried about the next
like right now I'm about to turn 30 he's
35 and I can kind of relate to the fact
that he's thinking about his future and
then he's thinking about what am I doing
here because he's he's getting closer to
40 than he has to 30 and I think that
might be playing into as well where I
feel like in in life every decade you're
saying okay where am I going right after
20 at maybe maybe after 20 and so you
get and you get closer to that middle
point going in one direction or the
other you start saying okay what it what
is life going to look like at 25 26 when
I'm 30 how am I going to get there and
that happened for me that could be
something where with him where he's like
can my time be better spent learning new
things rather than learning these things
just for YouTube because I'm not getting
back the max
amount of returns which is maybe a lead
developer position or something like
that but I hope he doesn't go anywhere
that would be really sad so for any of
you guys who maybe haven't subbed to
chris hawks or anything like that i
highly suggest you go and and give them
a sub and you know say Amen dylan and
myself don't want you to go anywhere i
hope you stay around i'll link the video
the quitting YouTube video and I
encourage you to watch it it definitely
everything he says in there I pretty
much agree with I can I can I can relate
and I don't know if it's just because I
have a channel that's probably plays
into it but it's definitely a bit of
trying to go on to the next phase your
life and reflect upon how to move
forward at least that's how I interpret
it I wish him the best of luck I hope
you guys go over there and sub and watch
some of his videos I will see you guys
