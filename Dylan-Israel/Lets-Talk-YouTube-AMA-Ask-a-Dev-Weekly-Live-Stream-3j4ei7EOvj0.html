all right guys so we are live and it is
Black Friday which if you're not
familiar I'm not sure if all I know for
sure Thanksgiving isn't an international
holiday but for those who don't know
Thanksgiving essentially is a day the
celebrates America America and basically
and and discovering of of America not
that America was technically discovered
but that's really where it came from and
the following day is Black Friday so a
happy Black Friday Happy Thanksgiving to
everybody who's there
I normally do my my weekend live streams
on the weekend but since I have a
four-day week and I'm available right
now I hear we are on Friday doing
Saturday's live stream so so what I like
to do is I like to once a week be able
to answer questions and shoot the
and we can we can talk about whatever if
you guys don't have any questions I'll
talk about some of the things that are
in my mind as a developer as a content
creator hello everyone hello
christ-centered dev so it also gives us
a I'd like to switch up the time
sonication because not everyone can can
make it on you know Saturday evenings or
mornings whenever I want do it just
wanted to know does April still code no
right now she's learning project
management she's actually enrolled in
about three or four courses in project
management that are about a week apart
so when she was and the rest of our
company was laid off she was able to get
unemployment and also a grant to pay for
some courses and project management so
that's the direction she's going right
now what she lands a project manager
role I probably will probably try and
teach her a little bit about
architecture and a little bit about
maybe some of the tools that she'll
actually use in the real world such as
confluence and JIRA so that she can be a
good project manager that's that's kind
of my goal because I think I think the
hardest thing for project managers a lot
of times it's not being technical and so
so although that they project managers
roles are really to communicate
requirements to the stakeholders and to
the developers to make priorities but
it's also hard for them to to guide
things sometimes when they don't fully
understand what it is that they're
guiding and that's why as a developer
you could go and get a project manager
role like that if you ever got sick of
developing but that's neither here nor
there but yeah so she hasn't been
studying code
she's been focused on project management
she's been studying that and she has a
test for a certificate II working on and
she got this grant which will give her
give her money for the courses that
she's enrolled was a good wafer to axe
ask for an extension on a project
deadline just tell him tell him sooner
than later that's my thing sooner than
later is the truth right so you don't
want to be the day that they're
expecting something to be delivered go
hey hold up by the way don't got it
let's talk about it you know so usually
in a work environment you'll have
stand-ups every day or every other day
and that's really up to you to say hey
I'm having issues doing this this is
actually a lot more work than I was
expecting we didn't realize that there
was some back-end that needed to be
altered and you know I only do front-end
or there's some front-end I only do back
in we got pull some again whatever it is
I mean I'm sure you have your reasons
it's up to you to clearly communicate
ahead of time during those stand-ups or
during those meetings or whatever it is
so yeah but that's that's really what
you should do project manager for a tech
company that's the idea yes
so one of the things that I've been
working on is I've been saying if you've
been watching for you these last year's
I'm going to deep dive into angular and
deep dive into JavaScript so what I've
been doing is I've been going through
all of the JavaScript documentation I'm
not done yet it's been a very long
process I did this four days straight
for about three hours or two hours at a
time and and I'm actually filming 1 to 2
minute videos about like let's say
string methods how to use it what it
does and that will actually be uploaded
on a separate channel so if you're
interested in that I'll have a video
coming out and I'll link to it
the reason I'm just putting on a
separate channel is just for I don't
necessarily think it's super relevant to
what I'm trying to do on this channel it
is something in software I just think it
might put it putting out 500 videos that
are a minute long two minutes long but I
don't expect to get a lot of views but
I'm also probably gonna put into a
course as well so if you want all in one
package breaking down documentation and
deep diving into JavaScript that's why
I'm filming it and I'll release a little
piece every day of the video so that's
how I plan on doing it so you can get
all the course at once or you can wait
500 days to get all but that's that's
another side project that I'm currently
working on what do you think about
wannabe junior dev starting a blog to
talk about their learning journey I
think it's an excellent way to get
started on a side project I think
eventually you will need to probably do
something technical technical side
projects but I think at the very
beginning it shows that you're that
you're eager that you're interested and
that you're contributing to the
community
however freelance I have way back in the
day when I was doing like WordPress
development and minor HTML and CSS
changes where's the
sources you learned angular honestly
udemy and YouTube and just building
projects man once you build projects
things start clicking in I didn't use
the angular CLI for like creating
components and stuff like that I just
entered it in manually so I could kind
of fully understand how everything
connected and helped me memorize what's
in there it's so I'm not super dependent
I found that very helpful as well like
angular CLI has a lot of great tools in
it I use it to start the project right
cuz I ain't doing that but I'm talking
about like when you want to generate a
new component how it all connects where
it goes that was something you know what
files it should create that was
something that I do manually Thank You
Roberto this is the first day so this is
the first day in god I don't know maybe
maybe nine months so I haven't had three
videos a week go out for those of you
keep track on in Eastern time I usually
have one video Monday one video
Wednesday in one video Friday and I
actually didn't have topic today so I
don't I don't know I might be cutting
back to one or two videos a week I'm
kind of running out of things to talk
about right now
so one thing I will say about the blog
post by the way is that um I had
somebody who asked a similar question I
said well you know I'm gonna do one blog
a day let me just say for you as a
developer you need to be studying more
than anything else now it is great that
you're going to write a blog post may I
suggest that you write one blog post
every week just one a week and go from
there that's that's more so better than
anything else do it random question
you're like Florida
I like Florida I would say so it's all
it's all relative Linford this way how
much did I like California on a scale 1
to 10 about a 3 that's why I spent the
rest of my life Florida for me is about
a 7.5 so a significant increase in
happiness
and there's a few things that fall into
that for me that make that massive jump
right so I'd like it to and a half times
if we were to throw a California might
even been a two so I would say so I'm
very happy in Florida in comparison part
of that was the cost of living the taxes
and the traffic so that is that those
are the the three main things that was
that were important to me now I make a
lot more money now than I did when I was
living in California but I don't think
you would have had that much of an
impact the traffic still would have been
bad the cost of living would still been
high and the taxes would have been high
so I I could just tell you that myself
personally I'm much happier happier in
Florida but it's all relative to what it
is that you're trying to accomplish
what's a good project to build when
trying to learn a new technology it
depends if you're trying to learn
front-end or back-end if you're doing
full stack
you should probably implement some sort
of API or crud with it I have seen the
Java humble book bundle and I think that
it's a great deal for $15 or $1 or $5 so
just kind of depends oh but I think if
there's any Android books on there's
probably I think they were O'Reilly if I
remember correctly so Chris
Micah says to Starcraft sure yeah thank
you and I think it depends on calyx
touches everywhere yeah yeah so
California is pretty much I lived in Los
Angeles I lived in the South Bay I lived
in the Inland Empire it's all expensive
it really doesn't matter where you go
it's all expensive I can tell you that
for the apartment I have here I have a
three-bedroom two-bath apartment here
it's about 1400 square feet it's got all
the amenities that you would imagine we
have a gym we have a pool I have a in
the apartment laundry set up and I also
have a laundry room and all that sort of
stuff and the same sort of setup would
probably be two to two-and-a-half times
the cost in most of California do you
Florida feebly turkey for Thanksgiving
or alligator you know alligator would
have been good but um I actually treated
April and I to some lobster tail have I
made a video on the es6 arrow function
syntax not yet
it definitely will be in my and the
JavaScript deep dive course one second
gents I have to use the little boy's
room
let's see here what I miss is there
another state you want to move that
might help your tech career so I'm very
happy at where I'm at but the next job
that I would take that would steal me
away ever would probably be Amazon
Google Facebook a company wanted like a
company like that that you can't say no
to Amazon reach out to me in the past
unfortunately I named passed a second
technical interview a while back but
there in Seattle Facebook and Google are
are pretty much everywhere but mainly in
San Fran right so that probably be the
only way that I would go back to
California but eventually maybe I plan
on settling down in Portland where my
brother is there and whatnot
of course I wash my hands man I'm a
civilized individual um but honestly I
don't really care where I live as long
as there's low-cut low taxes high
incomes low cost of living and and low
traffic that's really what I think about
go Gophers no I honestly don't know
enough about go or no to compare it I
enjoy node because I can tell you it's
very easy it's just JavaScript if I were
to move back to California ever let's
say let's say I got a job in San
Francisco cuz that's realistically
probably where I would end up I would
have to have a stupidly high salary for
one and two I'd live very close to where
I worked and it probably costs a lot of
money but no but that would be what I
would do my brother got to see us agree
a few years back and took some years off
after graduating to travel and do other
things now he wants to get back into it
how hard would it be for him now well he
has two CS degree you might be able to
land an internship but he's gonna have
to study yeah you know I would tell him
to jump on free code camp jump on code
fight start solving algorithms and his
language of choice and just get back
into the habit because there are gonna
be a lot of things that he's going to
have forgotten some skills and stuff
like that to go to go from there
uh yeah it would probably take me yeah I
don't know at this point in my career if
I was to go to SF specifically I would
probably want a hundred and fifty to two
hundred thousand dollars based off the
cost of living that's there and and
everything else that goes along with it
I could tell you a while back I had a
contract role offered to me after a very
long interview process at Levi's for
120,000 and I turned that down because
it was enough money for where it was
which was in the financial district of
of SF the youngest coder I have ever met
um I could tell you that like a nine
year old message me and wanted to like
stay in touch on who's building websites
and stuff like that but ever met in
person uh like in in the working world I
don't know I also don't know the
question of the answer they what type of
salary should a junior dev be able to
get in Portland it kind of pens what
technologies you're working in but
honestly I would just look up like if we
if we said junior front-end developer
Portland Oregon salary but I would say
kind of the standard I think for a
junior developer is about fifty five
sixty on the low end the average salary
for a junior developer in Portland
Oregon sixty three thousand four hundred
nineteen according to glass store as of
November 2017 so yeah about sixty
thousand would probably be right for a
junior developer
they feel shamed working as a front-end
developer with a CS degree even
nine-year-olds do it now
I don't know man I actually I personally
think front-end is harder than back in
now the reason I say that is because
there's a lot more moving parts with
front-end then there is back-end
developers and front front-end
development means a lot of different
things so like yes 9 year olds are doing
front-end development but what are they
really doing are they doing static HTML
and CSS sites and are they very good
probably not are they doing JavaScript
probably not are they using the latest
JavaScript frameworks and you know
probably probably nothing right
so um are they updating their wig pages
maybe um but back in in my opinion is
not really that difficult it's
essentially storing data and routing
data to and from that is how I see back
in well you have to kind of do a lot of
different things in front-end
do you think that the closing of recent
boot camps for me the market is starting
to change when it comes to demand for
web developers no I think what you're
seeing are a lot of organizations that
tried to get into this business model
and then essentially what happened was
you have a consolidation of good
companies and bad companies and I also
don't think I did a video about why kind
of answering this question said wire
coding boot camps shutting down and my
personal opinion is I don't think it's a
business that that can scale and so when
you see these boot camps that are
getting up to like 1215 locations that
is a very hard thing to scale and
especially over time and also what's
happening is you have colleges now that
are having their own boot camps and
essentially doing that money grab
because they're losing students who
would be CS students they're going to go
into these college code coding boot
camps let me grab some t guys
do you think it's a good idea to go back
to college at age 26 yes if that's what
you want to do it also depends on where
you want to progress in your career and
I say that as somebody who just sent his
transcripts into Western Governors
University at age 30 to go and finish
his degree as well so um that uh I not
because I can't become a senior
developer out I'll be senior developer
in a year to two years and in terms of
on my actual resume it's more so to
become an architect to make more money
to work at a company like Google can
someone with no prereqs finish WGU in a
year or two with the bachelor and
software engineering you'd probably have
to talk to them about that but you can
if it's your full-time gig I know it's
the program is set up so that you can
finish as many courses as fast as you
can and some people have done it in as
little as six months right on there it
says that the the average graduate
graduates six six months to two years
but in order to be able to enroll in
that program there are certain
requirements that you have to adhere to
is your opinion what is your opinion
full stack developer jack of all trades
master of none sort of I mean that's
kind of what people look at full stack
ass but I think it also depends on what
sort of company you're working at Avery
so here's the thing is like so smaller
companies want full stack developers on
average they need you to be able to do a
lot of different things that's okay and
when you get your career started it
helps to be that way so that you can get
going and you can maybe make yourself a
little bit more broadly skilled to be
more broadly higher ball and but I think
I think what happens is as you progress
little more into your career you become
a little bit more of a specialist and a
lot of those full-stack developers go
for gonna be front-end developers or
back-end developers or whatever it is
and go from there
what am i drinking unsweetened black tea
can
website with the only flasher Django I
don't know do you think the wages for CS
are justifiable if so what is the
primary thing that justifies wages
supplying to men the fact of the matter
is is that there's so many develop
there's so many developer jobs with
skill sets and very specific things like
let's say there are enough developers on
average how many developers have the
years of experience and how many
developers are skilled in the things
that someone's looking to for them to be
skilled and the answer is few to none
people who already have jobs that's why
you get steals away so so often that's
why you can leave that's why the average
developer leaves after a year and a half
so the fact of the matter is very few
people can code and they you can't make
the argument that there's an influx of
junior developers but there's a there's
so few senior developers and so few good
developers that there's definitely a
shortage in that aspect yeah and so
Calvin makes a good point that some of
these full stack developers they mainly
do front-end or they mainly do back in
but they do dive in and they do dive
into to one or the other on occasion
when needed yeah I mean so here's the
thing guys it's like I study every
single day and I will for about another
three to four years and then I'll
probably chill out I think but very few
people do I can tell you that the
majority of every co-worker I've ever
had I think I can safely say about 95%
don't so
if you do and you're one of the good
ones and you can and you continue
studying you continue to progress you'll
definitely be a better developer than
most but not everybody does matter of
fact most people don't most people after
they get their first junior job they
might study first two three months then
give up the primary reason for high
wages is pointers pointers does it what
do you mean pointers the primary reason
for it it's because it's a skilled
position in which very few people can
can fill it
yes if you study while you're there you
will succeed more than the average guy
you definitely be going you'll be a
better developer which will make you
more hireable am I going to go to
college while having a full-time job yes
I have there will be starting January
1st or February 1st it depends on if
they're able to process my transcripts
on time
I'm crazy what why am i crazy man
full-time student full-time at home
software engineering it just means that
I have to cut back on studying on other
things that's all
so like YouTube might take a little bit
of a hit side projects might take a bit
of a hit
that's that might be it
it's a bachelors bachelors
so everything about creating my own
death company no I think that closest I
would get to that is maybe just being a
contractor or freelancer guys I wake up
here let me tell you how my schedule
goes so every morning I wake up at about
6:45
sometimes 6:30 lately I've been waking
up at 6:00 and I hop in the shower and
then for an hour plus I sit down here
and I work on YouTube and I study that's
after that I go to work and I work 9:00
and I show up to work usually about
thirty minutes early and I watch angular
tutorials
after that I work for about nine hours I
come home I eat I shower and I sit back
down here three to four hours to work on
YouTube to study to build side projects
and continue going on and on the
weekends I do the same thing on my days
off with probably about four hours a day
I would say on average and then I run
errands and do everything else that I
need to do so what I'm trying to say is
there is time I just have to take away
my study time my project time and go for
that and do just fine oh my udemy course
it's just a single angular project where
you build a portfolio
it doesn't cover all the angular
language but it go it goes from there am
i planning to do some object oriented in
the future god I hope not
I'm doing PHP something was majorly
wrong in the career path guys
I know thank you
oh yeah be ph3 at my last job I hated it
do you ever feel like you know a huge
smelly load of programming stuff a
little about other subjects have you
balance your knowledge um you mean
balance my knowledge in software I mean
I could tell you what I'm knowledgeable
in I'm knowledgeable in JavaScript to
degree right and it's not to say like
I'm a coding dot or anything I'm just
saying if I were to say if I was saying
if you were to say hey Dylan what what
are the things that you think you could
speak intelligently about one would be
software specifically web development
another would be maybe the UFC not even
MMA but specifically the UFC because I
watch that's one of my side projects I
could talk a little bit about RPG gaming
and classic video gaming I could also
talk about anime and I think we're done
so that's about it right those are the
things that I I have knowledge about but
that would be what I what I do do you
feel that a lot of skilled people are
wasted in web development wasted no I
mean I think web developments one of the
biggest fields because it's one of the
most used so I don't I don't think you
could use the term wasted mark Raider
has the right idea so he says so yeah
exactly someone offers me PHP or short
or short rope and a high branch I'm
probably thinking the short rope and I'm
Bridge any suggestions to a PHP
alternative you can do node you can do
c-sharp net it all it all depends
so one of the things I've been hearing
lately is to starting a side project yes
this is the thing I preach every single
day what is a good way to come up with
ideas for a side project choose
something you're passionate about and
then you can stick with long term and
you can you can go from there I think
and if you can't earn a dollar with it
that's that's always I go from there
I mean wasted because society doesn't
advance the man-hours put into web
development I don't think that's true at
all
I think good developers are rewarded if
they're willing to leave their job the
problem is a lot a lot of times people
have this weird loyalty thing built into
themselves and you know I don't
necessarily feel comfortable talking
about this but I'll tell you like it is
is just because I'm an employee and I'm
not trying to leave my job but I will
tell you that statistically speaking you
are likely to get a raise that's much
larger than the raise at your current
work if you go and leave for another
company and a lot of times the hours
that you're putting in that you're
stunning in web development you should
be saying hey if I don't get a $10,000
raise this year that company across the
street will give it to me and go from
there so that that's the truth is that
you might get a five to six percent
raise which it might be high by most
people's standards in some in software
but assuming you don't get promoted that
is but you would definitely get on
average a twenty percent raise some
times if not more depending on where you
are in your career to go to another
company so
what do you think 2018 will offer well
PHP still be in demand er well
JavaScript file off I think both they're
gonna be fine I think if you are
learning PHP that you need to make sure
you learn laravel it's the only PHP
frameworks growing in popularity yeah I
mean there's so many people who stay in
dev roles in junior roles where they
were making X amount of dollars that was
you know they had no idea right they
don't follow the market they don't look
at it every day they don't you know what
would you say is the best path to land a
web developer job in 2017 well Jim if I
remember from our previous conversation
I think your main issue was that you
said you had bad social skills so for
you I would suggest working on that but
I also would say if you're interested in
a front-end development you need to pick
up angular or react you need to have
projects in them and go from there what
operating system drive use I use Windows
yeah in terms of front-end development
which is what I do i do angular i'm just
reached familiar with maybe a little bit
of bootstrap javascript obviously a
little bit jquery and definitely in the
current version of angular or react
react has redux it has native as a few
other things but get familiar with
testing as well get familiar with maybe
some of the version control such as get
what else i know you a PHP buy like to
ask what the best learning resources let
me see if the site is still up I give I
give our boy some some love here so
there's this youtuber called code course
and if you go to code course comm he has
hundreds of videos on PHP for a low
price of how much does he charge in a
month for a low price of six euros a
month or 60 euros a year but he was
probably the go to PHP he's been doing
PHP for about ten years his videos are
excellent I would recommend that him his
stuff code course comm and youtube.com
slash code course se junior dev on his
first job would you be okay to leave
after six months for a better paying job
or should say one minute I think you
should leave at six months but one year
minimum is fine as well what's the best
way to build a social networking website
just get started
and make it better as you go if you're
learning for the first time you should
be learning the current version of
angular which would be angular 2
currently referred to as angular which
they're technically on version 5 if
me about 20 minutes ago an engineer
truth is Matt live streaming right now
see ya out there doing this thing or you
watching a video is jQuery worth
learning you should be familiar with
jQuery but it's not what's gonna land
you a web development job you might get
a web design job jQuery is like one of
those frameworks it's used now by web
designers who never wanted to get better
in web development is it I mean there
are a lot of websites that use jQuery
when in terms of like high end high end
um web dev jobs you're not gonna get too
much jQuery jQuery so like this stuff
used by developers who don't study
anymore that's all that's one way I
would put it am I gonna pick up
blockchain programming yes in six months
uh well my plan was to start learning
blockchain in about six months after I
dove into JavaScript and angular and I
still plan to do that but it also
depends on how busy I am with finish up
the degree so should we build static
pages with these frameworks as portfolio
projects the whole point of angular is
to build dynamic things so you should
build something dynamic uh are not our
nozzle gonzales I don't think web devs
have anything to fear from Wix or
WordPress I think what sites are getting
taken for that sort of stuff is the
really at the end of the day the
mom-and-pop shops that are are that are
building you know static content but in
terms of an actual like global company
that needs to have certain in-house
tools half the development I do is just
building tools for our other departments
and I just don't I just don't see it
ever happening I think I think what's
going to happen is a lot of web
designers are
get go into WordPress and but in terms
of developers not so much
I don't know Linux or AWS I mean if
you're interested in AI programming
there's a role in it's not web
development but it's definitely
something that you could learn what type
of projects do you think developers want
to see when they're hiring competent
people I think they wants a unique
project stuff that aren't clones of
things to be honest stuff they said hey
I created a project based off this topic
because it's a passion of mine and I
updated I built this feature for
something that's unique man that's
really what it is
I'm sure building a clone of Airbnb
looks great on a resume and it is it's
fine but I would highly suggest building
your own custom side project on top of
that as well you're gonna need a front
end
Omar you're gonna need a back-end I mean
really just depends on how you want to
deliver it or what the social network is
I don't know Jim I I would say when it
comes to personal projects man it's just
being unique and building your own thing
and constantly updating it and seeing
the latest stuff and working with the
latest technologies is going to be
what's going to impress those hiring
managers as well it's just a passion for
you as a developer what I think about
UJS I think there's no jobs in it so I
don't I don't really worry about it
as a beginner should I only focus in one
programming language yes
well I mean honestly stop waiting man
just start something decide what you
want to build and go from there
it's a lot of times people people get so
worried about what they're building like
even if you build something innocent and
it fails you'll have learned so much
just by building it than never building
anything at all and maybe the second one
it's the one that's really popping off
and a lot of people just don't build
anything though yeah I would say most
people just may have a little bit more
confidence to myself included the tech
lead told me that one of the reasons I
have junior in my title even though I
think I shouldn't have junior or I could
maybe get go by without it is because in
my interview I have it I wasn't
confident enough so it's something that
I'm trying to work on as a developer
myself I know
I want to build our project just seems
so huge piece by piece man that's how
you start you build out one thing keep
working on it do you think a mobile app
is more impressive than web app it is if
you're trying to be a mobile developer
have you ever burnt out often I'd burn
out I was I've been burned out for like
the last two weeks which probably why I
don't have a video coming out today
part of that was getting sick and
getting overwhelmed I feel much better
now though but I don't burn out too
often no I I have heard of the book you
don't know jest it's a very good book
roaming that's my boy Roman right there
Roman pose oh man always showing up my
boy Roman
do you think it's worth investing some
time in basic mathematics if you can't
do college-level algebra yes that's
essentially where you need to be as at
least in a front-end developer I would
say and most development depending on
this field you're in in the subject
matter if you're doing data analytics or
very complex back in that requires some
algorithms you're going to need to be
better but on average you need to be at
a college algebra level are there any
programming side projects you're working
on now yes I am building a a web
application that's going to house a
bunch of mini developer tools so like if
you ever had to parse a JSON I have a
JSON parser I built although it's not
complete it parses it as text but
doesn't collapse I have to add that
future and there's also a HTML condenser
minna fire I have to do a CSS version so
all these little tiny tools maybe a text
transformer that is what I'll be doing
all right that is what I'm currently
building I'm also building a deep dive
through JavaScript doing about 500
videos on methods and everything else
till I know you've talked about free
code camp do you think any web developer
should go through it or skip it can I
help you get hired I can tell you that
what actually helps you get hired is the
what you've learned and what you build
on your own I could tell you for me I
think it was something I put on my
resume that attracted people to show
that I was always learning always
working on things but more than anything
else it just made me a better developer
Jim don't you have a CS degree I'm sorry
I might be confusing you Jim with
somebody else but I could have sworn
we've had a similar talk do you not have
a ace a CS degree
yep yeah a bachelor's degree in software
development yeah I mean that should be
enough but but um I I think I think
where you maybe lacking is in the
interpersonal communication skills as
well as in projects if you don't have
any projects that are impressive and
impressive is a very loose word if you
not any projects that are unique it's
going to be hard for you but honestly
Jim I would say I would say go and maybe
try and take some courses on speaking
feeling comfortable breaking out of the
shell a little bit
and I say this knowing that it's very
difficult I am an introvert by nature I
know it's a little bit strange because
I'm you know I'm talking my video I have
700 videos on YouTube right but only
recently have I kind of been a much more
charismatic or much more talkative
individual I vote for the majority of my
life I have been closed off to others
and I don't really like talking with
people I like meeting new people I
totally so I told I totally understand
is what I'm trying to say but honestly
it will help you so much as a developer
if you can work on your communication
skills and and go from there so dynamic
page is web pages work with certain
frameworks in the page works as
portfolio projects present for jobs yeah
I mean honestly if you're building if
you're building a web app today it needs
to be dynamic in general that's the
whole point of what these frameworks do
they allow us to build web applications
that can perform a lot of stuff without
changing pages and do so dynamically
based off what the data and the states
are
just clicking functions lol I mean it
could depend if it has authentication
display inserting things
storing stuff in local storage hovering
over stuff
clicking stuff disabling buttons and
forms if the data's not properly filled
out displaying error messages in the
forums if the day is not properly filled
out just really depends I guess what I'm
trying to say by the way guys if you
haven't already a little little little
shout out love to myself please join our
Facebook group code Tech and caffeine if
you want to support me at patreon it's
patreon.com/scishow cooking tutorials
360 or you could support me through
super chat as well you're always trying
to get an education and nowadays to get
education in the United States you have
to take out loans and things like that
luckily I am financially able to not
take out loans but I will be eating top
ramen for about a year so if you don't
want me to if you don't want to see me
die of early heart attack send me your
monies today no but um one thing I would
say is I just want to harp on the fact
of of doing unique projects and if you
go to my website coding toriel's 360
comm you'll see a couple of things that
i built i built all these pages this was
my first angularjs project and
and um one thing that I made that unique
it's a it's just a web page built in
angularjs it's not built in a very great
wave angularjs again its first day ever
built but one thing that I did to make
it unique for me was I connected to
YouTube API took the time to research
the YouTube API and connect various
aspects of it so you can do stuff like
that where it's not super complicated
stuff but is unique that will make
people appreciate it do you think it
would help me to get a programming
mentor I've been trying to find one of
those and have I got a mentor I want to
say I necessarily have a mentor I would
say that I have people who I respect
that I ask questions of who are senior
developers and pick their brains as much
as I can before they get annoyed with me
oftentimes to the point where they get
annoyed with me and then leave them
alone but I've never really had a mentor
the closest thing I had to a mentor is
free code camp so I I don't know man I I
don't I don't know I've suggested to you
about the communication issues but how
often do you actually code are you
coding every day are you building things
every day cuz if you're coding every day
you have a portfolio because you haven't
ran out of things to do you'll never run
add things to do but you've at least
built some stuff is there stuff on your
github do you have a portfolio website
where people can view your portfolio you
know how's your LinkedIn doing how's
your how's your resume look all this
started basic stuff but you should have
projects built that are unique to you if
you're coding every day it just happens
because you're running out of things to
do because you know you can't watch
another angular tutorial cuz you know
angular because you watched five
tutorials on it right so I get it uh I
live in that for like night so luckily
luckily it's only gonna be about seven
thousand dollars a year for Western
Governors University which is
nice I am I am a a know skilled dirty
Protoss player that's all I haven't
played in a while
Howard so here's the thing here's what I
don't understand Jim how do you get a
bachelor's and software development and
still be in the learning stage of going
through tutorials how does that happen
and it could just be that I don't
understand what a bachelor's and
software development actually entails
but to me to get a bachelor's in
software development
there has to be some software
that you coded right or am I crazy I'm
your hero Thank You Morgan
I appreciate that play attending dev
Mountain next year good for you man
got a picture of my mother and well I
got a picture your mother and my wallet
too do I have an academic degree I do
not
uh so do you not do so any soft any
codeine in a in a software development
like I don't understand how can it not
be a computer science for a lady degree
I understand it's not a computer science
degree is to software development degree
oh look look I totally understand Jeff
okay I see where you coming from
you didn't do anything outside of your
degree all right that's what's going on
right now I get it
well why aren't you doing Java and C++
if you did Java and C++ if you did Java
and C++
there's Java there's a ton of Java job
so there's a ton of C++ jobs and they
pay very well
salsa dude Happy Thanksgiving to you too
I have not even heard of weeks w ee x
sang man happy Black Friday to everybody
as always so used to think gym I
remember us having a very similar
conversation on a live stream and it had
to be it had to be like six months ago
it was a while back
you should have progressed since then
yeah to make a button a link you're
gonna want to make a incur tag either
wrap to wrap the button in an anchor tag
or make an anchor tag styled like a
button Johnny be don't be throwing on
click at a guy who's asking how to how
to make something an anchor tag he's not
ready for on click
how many how many advertises I get you
email for coding related deals too many
too many I just delete them all I don't
care uh I I just but I mean like a
course just like fifteen dollars at most
right so I don't know I'm not
luckily financially I'm at a point now
where I don't worry about spending
fifteen dollars and I of course one
course you'd be good for keep you good
for a while right the course that I'm
working through an angular has twenty
six hours of video
this so that fifteen dollars is gonna
keep me going for a while well Tim I'm
Jim rather I'm sorry to hear about your
health issues but I think I don't like
Java either so I get it but I think you
just got put in the time man when I was
in the night so when I dropped out of
college I and I took a job as a
technology trainer at a at this software
company I am I was studying
three to four hours everyday during the
weekdays and like eight to like 14 hours
on Saturday and Sunday and and I don't I
mean I don't know how much work you're
putting in but I found just that sort of
dedication was what made it for me to
get by without a degree I can only
imagine which is one of the reasons I'm
going back to school where I would be
with a software development degree
sort of gotta hit your patriotic
students again hey I hope so man
that'd be the dream I get a solid man I
get about $50 a month which is
appreciate it covers my website it
covers my forgot Dobby is so expensive
man
it's unbelievably expensive
yeah I don't know I may I might start
looking for an alternative reason does
is the a in a Sanford her a a trust
after anchor yes
one of my views on net neutrality I
think a sane I think the internet should
stay essentially even for everybody and
otherwise it's just weird it's exactly
everything that's gonna happen it's
going to happen there's gonna be slow
lanes there's going to be fast lanes and
it's gonna kill create new businesses
starting up who which pretty much every
new business nowadays is going to have a
need for faster internet connection when
it comes to software everything is
connected to the Internet so so I I mean
I think we need to keep it the way it is
but it doesn't look like that's gonna be
a it's a possible lam job in three
months it depends how hard you're
working that what happens the code
slogan code everything I think I
accidentally deleted it on the intro I
never went back to put it in his what
happened
whopper Big Mac bro we all know it's the
whopper baby I had one today - for five
baby extra for cheese oh thanks forfor
cheese
we were out today we were out today
dunes of Black Friday shopping got
hungry
we got the I don't know why I got so
hype on the whopper but definitely the
whopper over the Big Mac so what's up
with the gym what's up is I have an
injury in my hand and I need to go to
the doctor that's what that's what's up
at the gym what's up is your boys never
been fatter at more out of shape in his
life that's what's up
he's becoming a stereotype of a
developer excuses trust me man
although I its I need to go now sound
like gym with this software development
degree I'm making excuse now I'm just
I'm just giving a hard time gym uh no I
should workout you're right oh no no no
I definitely gained a few pounds man we
know the coding babes clap a aren't they
important up now don't do YouTube
anymore it's not where they live doing I
don't know I don't know if I can
employee I can collab with them on their
platform of choice so yeah I know I've
been I've been putting on a little bit
uh we've been stacking gains baby as I
saw London chat told me so I don't put
on weight when you're a beast
you stack gains so we stacking gains all
right this has been fun today get to do
this too often
how do you feel about relocation well
considering I relocated to Florida from
California um I would definitely take a
role so you've had six off job offers
but you'd like to stay in Seattle
Washington you know what man this is a
 that pisses me off here you're over
here yelling about I can't get a job I
can't a job but you've had six job
offers in different states take a job in
a different state go get some years of
experience because that's what's really
important from there go and leave back
to Seattle Washington just go get some
job experience start get better come
back and go home man oh my goodness did
I get relocation when I moved I got
offered $5,000 for a relocation package
I turned it down for a $5,000 higher
salary so I would say relocation is kind
of a standard thing for most cells even
if it's not just a higher salary
so long-term the gate in terms of what I
want to was more money so I got offered
said hey we'll give you the basically
the deal for my relocation was this
$5,000 cash cash in your pocket you get
it you're getting your first paycheck
was it your first paycheck or before
your two weeks before your first pitch I
forget what it was but yeah so they said
look we can give you five thousand cash
and the contingency on that money is you
have to work for us for two years
essentially every month that you work
with us we take off two hundred fifty
dollars so if I leave at one year which
coincidentally was what I did I would
owe the company twenty-five hundred
dollars
now on the other side you could take a
five thousand dollar higher salary and
we don't have any sort of contingency
like that and that was what I decided to
do now the reason that I took that was
one I prefer five thousand dollars every
year for the rest of my life to get a
higher salary and to I understood that
there was a decent chance that I may be
jumping jobs if this job didn't work out
I didn't know that I wanted to work in
the military contracting industry and I
didn't know that I mean know that if I I
know the job market well enough to know
that especially in your in your field in
this field that you can get larger
raises sometimes when leaving so I
didn't know that I would I was planning
on staying wherever I was at for several
years but I didn't want to put myself in
a position where I couldn't and I to me
the in terms of the short term in stock
of in terms of the long term it's a
better choice perhaps homeboy has a girl
who can't relocate that's where I'm at
I'm okay today I left so I don't have
any look leave your man
leave your woman and do what's best for
you right so I this is all true by the
way I don't think I'm bullshitting um I
went to Florida I told April I'm taking
the job in Florida which by the way
California Florida basically as far as
you can get while still being in the
United States of America and I said look
I'm going to Florida I'm going I've been
wanting to get out of California forever
I hope you come with me she said I'm
doing - think about it Dylan I went she
didn't say she was gonna come down after
she can't guarantee me nothing your boy
went down there said look I'm here I'm
gonna get us an apartment come on down
I'll take care yeah I'll pay your bills
when you get down here cuz I know you
don't have a job I know you don't have
too much money saved up come on down I
hope you come she did but if she didn't
this is really different different
dynamic we were talking about right now
but my thing is I don't think that's a
good enough excuse it's not a good
enough it's not a good enough excuse to
say hey I'm so childish that I I am just
I am so in love that I'm going to shoot
myself in the foot in order to satisfy
the heart and the penis or the genitalia
regions I don't believe in that I think
you need to you need to do what's the
best decision for you and it's the best
decision for you when you're just
getting started you know if it's love
baby it'll work out
coast to coast it'll be like some some
some software tech Romeo and Juliet what
I'm saying is look out for yourself and
get your experience get started right so
if you're staying in an area because
you're man or woman won't won't cut it
you need to look at your priorities
different
favorite programming project personal
professional I built I would say my
youtube channel if that counts
yeah here's the thing guys is it's like
would it it wouldn't have sucked if she
didn't come down yeah I was on the phone
talking to her convincing hey come on
down come on damn I was like the price
is all right I like come on down baby
let's try and get it down here but if it
didn't work out it didn't work out right
she has to she has to leave her family
as I did she had to leave her job as I
did right and and go into you know live
where she knows nobody and it's a it's a
it's at all risk but you need to take
rich sometimes just uh yeah coma says
love don't pay the bills until they do
sometimes you know I'm saying but uh you
shouldn't be doing that sir stuff but
what I'm trying to say guys is be
willing to relocate be willing to take a
risk especially in the beginning right I
don't plan to live and die in Florida I
came down to Florida I said ah five 10
years and from there I will continue on
and see you see what's up
so you know I meant I've only been here
for a year I got at least four more in
here before I'm even thinking about
relocating or something like that
so I I got down last year about October
the first week of October my first day
at work for my previous job was October
3rd so I've been here about 13 months
I'm Miss California the only thing I
missed from California is Mexican food
they don't seem I have a lot of it and
they don't have very good much very good
food in Florida in my opinion
but I don't miss California no the Doge
says he's learned a lot now good man
hopefully hopefully you remember a
short-term memories on pulling right am
i using essential oil diffuser I am but
you know what I won't let you guys know
a secret right now you guys aren't gonna
believe me but when I went to New
Orleans I was looking for dev jobs and I
went into a voodoo store right I went
into a voodoo store and and I said I
need something that's gonna help me get
a job
they said we got you so they hooked me
up with the the it's gonna look the job
mojo oil and the job mojo incense right
and not only did I get a job three weeks
later I got job for more money than I
thought I was gonna get paid that's the
secret right here boys yeah I get that
job mojo oil forget all that studying
and stuff and building projects work out
communication having a good portfolio
just hook yourself up with that short
term job mojo oil and go from there
yeah guys if you haven't already to take
the time to sign a do you take the time
to sign the net neutrality petition
please I think it's called the placebo
effect look man I don't believe in it
100% I'm just saying it worked all right
I'm just saying I put some in right now
if I get erased on Monday we'll know it
works right if I got a raise on Monday
it'd be so stunning cuz I feel like I've
even had my three month interview
oh you're killing it uh I was just like
look I'm just pouring this in your water
now cuz that's going to give me a
promotion do I think it would go through
the net neutrality I hope not man I
really am just not trying to think about
it
I just hope not um we have about thirty
actual developers I would say not
counting project managers or bas or
Quality Assurance DevOps thing on my
left cheek
do you work first
it up for midsize company I work for a a
large multi national company if you're
talking about my that that's a
rubberband 29 I would say yes 29 out of
the
these DevOps really killing the
developer nope DevOps is just kind of a
different type of developer they're
there more so they do development
depending on the role but they are more
focused on deploying and things like
that so it's a different type of
developer that's all it's just a
different specialization all right just
like front-end and back-end you have
DevOps which are more focused on
delivering code and making sure should
don't break this is just as important
yeah I mean I so I apply for jobs and I
also go through recruiters when I was
looking and what I found as a junior
developer or someone trying to get their
first role recruiters don't really do
jack what's the best way to practice
working with a P ice to work with AP ice
build projects that use them
I mean really do get calls with api's
that you're comfortable with use you
know post puts deletes just get
comfortable with that
do I feel developers are going to be
outsourced by the rise of machines no
not in any time of our lives I have not
tried the xvideo API now
vr program here's the thing guys I have
a I have a HTC vive and it's fun in
gaming but I don't know I don't know
what else you would use it for other
than maybe movies I don't know that it's
going to I I also he couldn't tell you
if it's a lucrative market or not I'm
sure it's a market for sure but I don't
know enough about tell you but from a
user I don't see it replacing monitors I
don't see it replacing televisions I see
me gain and I don't even see it blowing
up with gaming
what is the opposite of AI about 75% of
the American population
I haven't been looking at jobs so I
couldn't tell you if there's jobs or
whether suddenly I'm sure there are how
many I could tell you her for what type
of company it's just not something that
so when I was applying for jobs like
three to six months back I was looking
at I didn't see too much webassembly
stuff but I was also looking for
front-end web development and I'm not
sure if webassembly falls into that or
not but I haven't seen that yeah what I
think about the sound recognition field
like Alexa and Google home I actually
today bought a Google home and Google
home mini I I really like it man I'm all
about the smart home stuff I don't
really have any smart home stuff yet I
was kind of holding off on buying in and
I it was just a good deal all right
let's let's go treat ourselves I will be
getting some smart lights a smart
thermostat smart locks eventually all
that sort of stuff but I'm a big fan so
that I mean that will be kind of how I
build out my house now right now I just
have an apartment so we'll probably just
you'd like to go from there
how good would you consider yourself at
JavaScript how good at javascript were
you before learning frameworks I
honestly don't know I don't know man
I think I'm okay at JavaScript I don't
think I'm great it's so hard to compare
yourself to other people like I think
I'm a decent junior developer I don't
know if I fall into a senior developer
category it's hard to it's hard to say
that I would say if I was to categorize
to myself is somewhere at a intermediate
developer level how long did your job
search take you to get your current job
about three months I studied for about
three months and it started applying
when I started studying there was I took
some time off from applying in that
three months just because I got so
frustrated dealing with recruiters and
dealing with at these stupid interview
processes and but like the program you
feel do you think that field will be
more lucrative in the future than web
development salsa dude I don't know if
you're talking about VR but I think a
lot of fields will be and here's the
thing guys if you if you learn if you
become a developer front-end developer
you can just study other things build
projects other things that get jobs in
those other technologies you should have
no problem learning it so I wouldn't
worry too much if you like web dev and
you're thinking oh well I want to jump
to a field that makes for money just
study that when you get off work and
then do it leave the job a year later
for that role well part of LA I live in
I live near downtown Los Angeles I've
also lived near I mean I've lived in
depending if you just count la near
downtown LA
OLX and Google homes sound recognition I
mean I think building apps for that is
going to be something that's going to be
pretty just become part of the norm but
uh I mean I just think it's another
skill to have I don't know how I don't
know how well that scales but I'm sure
it's just an app at the end of the day
April will never leave you you make too
much money in most guys you're each age
make twenty two thousand dollars a year
at thirty years old most people make
twenty-two thousand year you need to
start questioning yourself
um April's never carried how much money
I make she has taken me from when I've
been unemployed delivering pizzas too
miserable to be around money it's not
something she's ever concerned herself
with but uh but uh she ain't leaving
because of the baby leg you know but uh
ya know so um she uh she is April and I
have been dating for seven years and so
uh she's leavin cuz uh I actually ever
chained down sheesh she's in it for the
long haul man
so she would feel like she that's like
that's why you can't marry them so they
always have something to look forward to
and something they have to have she'd be
too bitter so you can't marry those yeah
she did say that if we ever broke up
she's taking the cats though so I
definitely can't leave her I love those
damn cats he's being sarcastic Jim
I'm good BSU I are you are you yeah um
yeah it's it's so funny we were talking
about money the other day and if she was
working still
what do top developers makers is that
very too often it depends on on if your
work at what see you're working in but
if we want to do give a general feel I
think a hundred thousand is a very good
feel I would say that I I think a lot of
a lot of senior developers not working
in like a San Francisco or a New York
you would easily probably get 120 K if
not more but it definitely depends
anything new I'm working on right now
deep diving into JavaScript so I'm
working on some videos going through the
documentation and I'm also working on a
bunch of tools that are going to be on a
site that I'm working on
yeah so I had a video and I couldn't put
it out because it was too similar to to
the top five ways not to learn to code
but it was called the top five things
I'm not thankful for and it was supposed
to be like a Thanksgiving video but it
was maybe I'll put it out if what it was
is another not V I love making those not
videos I just have to make sure they
come out appropriate what is your take
on a first job should I be aiming for a
startup midsize or large corporation you
should be aiming to apply to all of them
and hope one of them takes you even if
it's out of state even if it's not in
what you want to learn and you shouldn't
care about advancement you shouldn't
care about growth or additional training
you should be taking the role you should
come home every day and you should be
studying in the things that you want you
should be leaving that job in a year and
leave for a nice race that's what you
should probably be doing
what is a funny way I can tell them well
it's not uncommon for companies to have
people build them in 15-minute
increments you know a lot of times if
you're doing contract work you're you're
getting maybe 90 to 150 dollars an hour
so just defense if you have an existing
thing that you charge at or if you don't
want the role you say hey I can politely
decline if you have something you can
recommend to send their way offer to do
that you should oh you should never
never charge a flat fee unless you're
building something super basic
yeah
you
sausages so sit down how come you know I
have a donating section during the
livestream we like to help out well you
can if you look in the chat there is a
dollar sign it will actually allow you
to donate money and as well as to put a
comment in there to make sure that
everyone can see your questions see your
comment and I of course will answer it
because your boy is the sellout I try to
answer all questions some get through
some don't but you will definitely get
an answer if you send me money but yeah
you can donate through the through the
the dollar sign this is super chat
that's one way for you to donate money
does your employer pay for additional
courses you take to improve your tech
skill set no but the course I bought is
fifteen dollars they're not paying for
my degree either but it will make me
more valuable make it easier for me to
be promoted and you know make me worth
more in theory so perhaps I'll have more
leverage when it comes to talk about
skillset and compensation when you go
first web dev role have you done any
serious damage to a company or failed at
anything really bad uh I know that I
don't think so No
you mentioned that you don't have
academic degree do you think having a
master's screen would put you in a
better position or even a solid CSU of
course it would you're talking about
adding something that adds traditional
value and a lot of companies yeah
they'll hire you to be a junior to have
a senior dev but it's going to be the
harder it is the more that you get into
management the more that you go for a
tech lead to architect it's not
impossible but it's definitely all that
stuff makes it easier do you ever get
friends or family to ask you for help
and web developer so whether they what
do you charge them a lot of times I get
the hey I had this idea and then they'll
send me this idea and I'll be like look
I don't know anything about mobile
development I I can recommend or it's
possible but I don't have the time and
honestly I tortured by people or so or
as a freelance freelancer and very few
people pay that so that usually shuts
the conversation down entirely I've had
friends and I like think about I've had
several over the years and even then I
think I was charging like $50 an hour
now I charge 90 and they wouldn't pay
450 so so yes coding skills are greater
than a degree knowing people is greater
than a degree knowing people having
coding skills and having a having a
degree is the best of everything
no that's what I'm trying to do how can
I become a freelancer go get five years
experience become a senior developer and
then start getting a contract role
what about having degree is not IT
related is better than no degree so
that's the truth of the matter all right
