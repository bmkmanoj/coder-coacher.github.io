backing Codecademy and learn angularjs
one point x we are in routing so what is
routing routing is a pretty important
function of angularjs I apologize for if
things are a little dirty back here it
is because it's going to reset this page
by the way it is because I just moved to
Florida and we are on the floor and
things are still messy I got a desk
coming though so what is rounding
rounding is basically where you you can
create multiple views that are routed
for a single page so like say we wanted
certain things to display we could then
go ahead and have it do that but it's
going to be contingent upon the route
and what triggers the route so you may
that may be some condition so you'll set
in your code now d oh my god is this
happening again so
let's go ahead and refresh this real
quick so watch out for these loaders
loading the entire time there's a lot of
that happening so what do we want to do
first when we're trying to output the
template now the template is really
nothing more than a URL excuse me of you
so the first thing that we really need
to do is this div ng view now we're
going to go ahead and put this down
below the header but it really doesn't
have it doesn't matter where it goes as
long as it goes where you need it to as
long as it's in the body I should say so
this entry view represents a couple
things oh it's basically where our route
is going to be outputted to so let's go
ahead and we'll pull this up this is
what we got right now and then let's go
ahead and jump into the apt j s so
you'll see right here this is our app
and it's taking in the gallery up here
as well as an additional dependency
injection we're basically just saying
look this is a library that we need to
use we need to use the ng route library
of angular so that's what's going on
here now what we're going to try and do
next is output this code so i'm going to
type it out on to try explain as we go
so we're basically something going to
take our appt variable that we have here
we are going to come to you call config
and then we're going to pass in a
function that is going to take in this
specific this isn't something that you
can really rename but you want to take
in the route provider let's go ahead and
do that so semicolon now that parameter
that we're passing in route provider
this is basically just saying whatever
route we do something with and we're
going to define route provider elsewhere
so one that will know what's getting
passed in but for now just thing when
it's this route do this so this first
one is a URL that's right and the the
next thing that you need to include this
way basically the location of the route
we're going to include the controller so
we know what the data actually is and
this is the same thing this is another
URL controller using a home controller
it's not URL and then the template URL
and this is really just a view at the
end of the day it's our HTML file and if
we go ahead and open this up real quick
we're going to take a look at it so
let's go ahead and pull that up so to
see right here it's basically just a
bunch of HTML now it could be in a
variety of ways you may just you can
even just take all this and you wouldn't
be able to type as HTML but you could
type it like text and you could go ahead
and put it up where template is as well
we're going to go ahead and just follow
the fall this so we'll have used /
home.html now what's going on after this
is we have a dot otherwise now dot
otherwise we'll go ahead and drop down
line as well dot otherwise is basically
saying what if we can't find what you're
looking for and in this case we're just
going to say your redirect to this URL
which happens to be the same as this one
so go ahead and go next there's no going
next and not clicking like save is
because for whatever reason this was low
infinitely loading and like a couple
ways I got by it was clicking this link
so that this would be in here while i
was doing this it anyhow so uh if you're
having issues with that go ahead and go
i need help with this exercise and go to
the forums and there's a lot of
solutions and just try two or three of
them and some will work for you so let's
go ahead and jump back in between app
j/s so what we have right now is
basically just one path now we haven't
actually set the path we're just giving
it a general path
so what it's actually want us to do is
go ahead and just call another dot went
on it and you'll see right here when we
do that all we have to do is the same
thing we have to pass in a URL what's
the URL in this case it looks like it's
/ photos / colon ID and then we need to
pass in a controller as well so you
forgot the comma so we're going to pass
in a controller and then that's going to
be called the photo controller and
finally we're going to go ahead and pass
in the template or the view and again
you could have this as like something
like this or you know just you could
type out the HTML and you can put
something like hello world but a
standard convention is to simply put in
the URL path either one works though
most of the time I'll actually take that
bath I don't think that will work i
think i'm thinking of react so don't I
ignore me on that I'm not one hundred
percent sure just do it put the ER help
add that's probably right so I got it
got confused with the react so we're new
photo dot HTML let's go ahead and run
this hopefully doesn't infinitely load
alright cool alright let's see we have
views
photos / photos / call an ID controller
controller controller there we go let's
try that cool now you'll see right here
we have more photos so as of right now
we have multiple routes in different
we're not actually we're not actually
choosing one or the other right now but
that would be something that you could
do right now we're displaying multiple
routes let's let's go ahead and move on
let's go ahead and do this and then
let's go ahead and reset this exercise
so now what we want to do is we actually
want to take the JSON data here we just
want to go ahead and jump into views and
in this one we want to oh wait all right
let's going to run that is already
looked at this we want to go to the
photo HTML and we want to filter views
and upvotes by number so let's go ahead
and jump down to views look that's title
and that would be a detail dot let's see
views and then we're going to a simple /
and then number remember the slash will
denote that we're doing the the the I
believe it's called directive or a
filter it's called something with a d if
i remember correctly the technical name
but it's a filter alright so instead of
views we're going to go ahead and change
the stuff votes let's go ahead and run
this now so this has now changed this
and what will show it before you move on
we just basically just filtering the
views and up votes to be something
standardized now there's multiple
filters in number and you can look those
up in your own time but don't think
there's just one there's about 20
different ones in different ways you can
do this but when you call the generic
one like so there's a generic filter for
the number i don't quite remember what
it is off the top of my head now we're
going to use this for the publisher day
so let's go ahead and use this other
filter and this is just going to be
detailed dot pub date and we're going to
go ahead and use the date filter for
that again there's numerous date filters
as well that will work with this so
let's go ahead and see if we can view
the results see when we click it now
it's all clean and it's auto formatted
but that was pretty much it what you
really need to take away from this we
have these routes and it's basically
different different aspects of its
components almost there being able to
assign multiple views in one in one page
application you also need to remember
that we were able to use the filters so
that we can see different things in
quite various ways but I think this sums
it up probably best routes are a way to
manage apps containing more views so
that's really what routes are therefore
it's also there to enable or disable
certain things so maybe we only wanted
certain views to be displayed like for
instance right now when we click this
it's displays and we're off of it it
doesn't so I hope you guys found this
helpful um definitely definitely
encourage you to get comfortable routes
I'm still trying to I'm going to very
quick at my work I imagine but as always
