camp in basic algorithm scripting the
bonfire section on one called confirm
the ending so let's go ahead and get
started here so what we're basically
trying to do is use a substring method
to get the find out if a word is in our
in our string so or a letter ends with
it rather so if it ends in an N in this
case it would it should return true so
we want to return true for everything
and obviously we'll get some stuff but
it's not working so let's go ahead and
start off by we want to have a place to
start so we want to save our start is
equal to our at the length of our string
- our target dot length so in this case
our target is our n and our string is
the Bastion so in this case we'd have
well we have ba SGI n so we'd have six
so if let's say we need to do is just do
some lift statement all we're doing is
comparing and contrasting so we don't
need a for loop for here
so if our string dot substring so if
you're if you're not familiar with the
substring booze it starts at one point
and then it goes on so we're gonna start
here start here
and then we're going to say if the s the
reason that we start on the we start
with the start variable is because we
are actually checking from just we're
just checking the end of the string so
that's why we have to subtract the
target from that and then we're gonna
say if that and you go to the end of the
string so start at the 6th position so
start here so start here and and then go
to the end which is here are they equal
so that's basically what's going on here
so we're gonna get the length of the
original string
we're gonna say is this equal to the
target and if it is we want to return
true else return false
oh you're thrown else in here just it
will work either way but just so that it
feels nice and then when we run it boom
good to go so let's go ahead and put
some comments in here let's take this
out real quick and what we can do is
there will put a variable R for just
comparing and of string so what we're
doing is we're getting the length of
string and then we're - saying how long
our target is so that we start there so
we don't have to iterate through it and
then our if statement compares compares
and string with the target string that's
pretty much it so some it took me a
little while to get this perfect like
this I was doing for loops and all this
craziness and then I just kind of
thought about it for a second so just
think you could have done it with a for
loop and the rage own and would have
been a lot more complicated we were able
to do it in about 13 lines of code here
twelve lines for you
it's destructor so that is bonfire
confirmed the ending pretty quick pretty
quick one but can be very tricky and in
the next video it looks like we will be
working on on how to repeat a string so
I'll see you guys that and thanks for
watching and don't forget to leave a
comment thumbs up and subscribe thanks
for watching the video don't forget to
Like and subscribe that helps me out a
ton and I appreciate all the comments
that I get and all the questions I get
in the comments and I'm happy to answer
them so keep them coming and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
