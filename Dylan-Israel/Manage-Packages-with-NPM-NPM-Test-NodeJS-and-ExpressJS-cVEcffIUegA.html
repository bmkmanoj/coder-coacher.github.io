in manage packages with NPM we got a
little bit stuck in the previous video
but we're back at it and we are doing
NPM tests so let's go ahead and bring up
our menu
our section menu using how to NPM and
jump down to NPM tests last time we
installed a dependency if you're looking
at the package.json may seem a little
bit odd so let's go ahead and pull that
up you'll see we have this scripts test
err no tuff specified and exit one okay
so what it actually wants us to do is
instead edit our package not JSON to
make your strip section look like this
so let's go ahead and do that so we're
include that was node and test yes so
we're gonna do a little something like
this so node test dot J yes okay and
then we're gonna create a file called
test j/s and then it's gonna have to
basically just run a single line and
we're that's what's getting called every
Pat every every package every NPM
basically has to have a test file and it
can do something as simple as a console
dialog works and to make sure that
everything set up and that's what we're
gonna do right now so is there a section
where they want us to create this I
don't think so so well we'll just go
ahead and create a file using the touch
command your gonna zoom in a little bit
touch and then we're gonna create test
dot j s and now in test is we're gonna
open it up and we just console dot log a
value this and obviously by now everyone
should have basic JavaScript knowledge
we're gonna log out the value here and
then we can let's see here we touch we
created the value or we created the file
we added a value and then then we made
the script section look like that and
now let's go ahead and run out ood to
NPN
verify so we ran our test script you'll
see that it says works right here and so
maybe we should have done something that
may have been a little bit more easily
known to that this was ours works might
be something for something else but
that's basically it so things take away
from this quick video is how to create a
file using touch and then naming it
after so and that every every package
will have a test file or test that goes
along with it and you may need to create
that when you're using NPM but as always
