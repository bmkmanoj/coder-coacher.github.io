Java to code CAD me this is the first
language I ever really learned I did a
little bit of Visual Basic by consider
Java my first official language we're
going to be learning the fundamentals of
Java programming it's just the
introduction we're gonna of course do
this whole course Java is the main
language I I've been taught in so I'm
very excited that they're doing this so
let's go ahead and get started in our
introduction to Java introduction to
Java so what do we need to know first
off that how how does Java work in this
case you see a public class your name
this is kind of the just you always have
to kind of have a class and you always
have to have a main method
so this public static void main string
args is our main method what this means
is this is where we call our initial
ation our nish to initialize our code
whatever it is you always have to have
it although for most things system dot
out dot println is how we print out the
system kind of refers to the system
object that's kind of neatly built in
there so we're gonna go ahead and print
out gilberto so what we should get is
gilberto up top nice so i type any whole
number then parenthesis print oh so
let's go ahead and print out 10 which is
a whole integer so we don't need to by
us just putting an INT in it
automatically reads it as an INT type of
alright so we'll just put true so this
is going to print out the true value so
meaning that we can go ahead and print
out like if we get a boolean we can
print it out from a variable this is how
you print out a character so this is all
kind of simple or a char as they call it
so if you need just a char it's a that's
how you do characters so all right now
we're going to initialize some variables
so you can see right here one of the
things about Java is you have
to declare your variables like for
instance in my number in tis its type so
it's an integer my number we're gonna
set that to 42 bullion is a boolean and
we have to set is fun equal to I guess
just to check this off as we go and my
number is equal to for you two boolean
is fun is equal to true and char movie
rating is equal to a just go ahead and
do like that let's run our code and
again to get all three check marks
that's kind of weird but hey so this is
it's pretty it's pretty intuitive at
least for me so the given code is poorly
formatted it's this one out on line five
is easier each so what's going on right
here as you can see that this is kind of
obnoxious and yeah it will run like
coups
yeah will run like that cuz we're
printing it out but what we really want
to do is just have it all on one line so
you can see right here prints out false
we're just the correct output so there's
also single line comments which are just
two double slashes and we'll put on line
for precise that's you have a nerve
accommodate it out so we want to ignore
this to print out noise so that's how
you do a single line comment just two
slashes meaning that we can type
anything here you know in take it and
also a multi-line comment is a slash
star star slash sorry / track star slash
and then you everything these are
multiple line comments
so select in variable mind number
product equal right so we want it to
equal the product of two numbers so
we'll say so same thing with normal
variables so we'll say 34 plus 14 and
that should give us 48 I'm not quite
sure what I did for those numbers semi
an equal to the product of two numbers
they're you sorry you have to multiply
said product so yeah its multiply divide
anything like that so modulo again if
you're unfamiliar with modulo basically
it just divides a number and it'll get
but you know if you have a remainder or
not if so but like what it is so in
their example 15 modulo 6 15 gets
divided by 6 twice and it has a
remainder of 3 so if you were at a
modulo 8 it would return a 3 so alright
so wants us to return a number that
returns a modulo of 2 so let's try 12
and want to mod it by 5 and that should
return to goes in twice so 10 minus or
12 minus 10 leaves it to
all right so use one the rational
operators to compare any two integers so
all right so we'll say 7 is greater than
5 and so what this is going to do is
print out true or false and because 7 is
greater than 5 we're gonna go ahead and
print it out print out true rather use
equality operator for the two ebullience
so we're gonna say here this is just
like equal equals this check is true
equal equal to true and if it is it's
gonna print true cool so write a single
line comment anywhere you want we are
doing the anticipated Java preview you
know something even though job is my
first language I ever really learned I
kind of hate it
after diving into PHP and JavaScript
Java scripts what I really like I know
is it's like oh man
why aren't we learned JavaScript and
jQuery but they have the reasons all
right so it wants us to set our boolean
is complete there it is
equal to true easy enough or in our code
set the int variable awesome level equal
to 121
that's pretty high awesome level if you
ask me and what else we are also in
variable called epic level to be equal
to awesome level times two so this is a
nice little thing we can do so sometimes
you need to loop your variables for
certain things so we can just set one
equal to x two and so if awesome level
changes so we'll our epic level
and then uncomment the last line so the
console prints out the last so remove
the multi-line comment and when we print
out it should print out the epic level
BAM there it is we've completed
quote-unquote the Java course preview so
pretty cool stuff obviously it was a
very basic course you've ever done any
programming it should be relatively easy
for you
but I absolutely am stoked that they're
continuing continuing to improve their
products you can see all the stuff that
we've kind of done so far so hopefully
the after they put up the my sequel
preview is about two three weeks and
then they launched the my sequel course
so I'm hoping the same thing for Java
I'll see you in the next videos I hope
to have those up as soon as possible
thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
