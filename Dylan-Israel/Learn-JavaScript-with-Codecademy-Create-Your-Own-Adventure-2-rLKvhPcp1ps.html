we're doing code your own adventure 20
as you can see I've already done these
sections unfortunately a few of them
came out in bad quality and so will just
be working our way through here and
resetting the code as we go but this is
a brief look at what it is we'll be
creating kind of a prompt input you know
using variables old-school type of RPG
like old like ms-dos old-school type our
pjs guy cool if you if you would like
those type of games so like for instance
you're walking into the forest minding
your own business and you run into a
troll do fight and pay him or run so in
this case we're going to put fight how
courageous are you strong yes are you
smart I won't put no bow is it one of
those you only need one of the two you
beat the troll nice work alright so
let's go ahead and reset this so it's
asking us to prompt the user for input
and store it in a variable called user
so let's create a pulse a bar and it on
three user and to get a prompt it's as
easy as doing prompting and putting it
in so we're with right like a an
interview think so are you looking for a
job ? save sweat and in this case it
doesn't matter what we put we're just
pretty yes because we haven't put any
like if statements or anything like that
for a prompt so it's going I said are
you looking for a job and then it says
Kylie dot uppercase or lowercase on to
your prompt and so as in you can check
the thing right here we're going to do
dot lower case just goes that to me
makes more sense dot T 0 lower case and
what this is going to do is instead of
having to write multiple answers like
yes with a capital y know
the capital and or vice versa this is
going to just lower case whatever answer
we get and then when we need to do
something with it so it's going to
change so if we put that all in caps let
me actually print that out so let's go
ahead and console.log user and you'll
see exactly what we're going to do it so
save and submit and we're going to do
yes and all caps and see how it lowers
it now that way when we want to do
something with that input it will be
much easier all right so let's go ahead
and get rid of that log all right so
we're going to add a switch statement um
I will touch out several different cases
all right and probably is you a little
reminder here how to use your switch so
switch takes an input in this case will
be our user we test the test what the
value is in our case is going to be yes
no maybe or something like that and then
it's gonna do something so don't forget
to default so switch take our value what
are we switching through our user colon
like culinary no it's on a bracket and
then in here we are going to have case
and this is where the lower case works
we need case yes and then it's going
bracket again yeah this one's bracket
okay and then we want it to we want it
to console dot log something out also
log do you have a college education or
actually do you have because you don't
need a college education for everything
marketable skills
and then don't forget to break it
because we want to break out of the
switch statement case know and we'll say
console.log well have a good day then
and just for the sake argument again
feel free to break we'll put case may be
and this will let's say we don't want to
hire okay we don't hire babies all right
and then I don't think we have to call
it it's just default yeah it's not case
default so then we have default and this
is again don't forget to break for each
one because once it meets this value you
need to loop to break so default and
we'll break here as well actually I
don't think to get the default does need
to break let's see you again yeah the
default doesn't need a break because it
shouldn't reach there and it should go
again if you don't get it so don't break
although I think you can do it either
way to be honest with you I've seen
people do it anyway what the convention
is you'd have to look that up for
yourself we'll just say did you the
question so I'm also pretty sure we
don't need to sound like homeless but
it's just standard convention for me and
I like it lets me knows I did my train
of thought there so let's go i'm saying
mr. my are you looking for a job and yes
I actually so the next section all right
add some if else statements just check
whether one of the tradition do you have
any marketable skills and
so how do we want to do this so let's
all right so what we can do here is we
can change the prompt we can change
these console dot log to a prompt so
we'll say prompt so it our answer equals
prompt skill so we're going to change
your code a little bit and we're going
to say if answer equals equals on might
don't forget to do the dot dot the
lowercase or uppercase what every year
preferences answer is equal to yes also
dot log may be just right this job and
it else Elsa I guess we could do an if
statement here seriously people to know
because they give us something other
than yes you're out now I'm thinking
about it and then we'll console dot log
out for else as well
I will say oh so they wants to use and
and so I felt so much to your case and
check to see whether one condition and
another condition are true well alright
so in this case if are so you code it
the answer is equal to yes and series
it'll be true and then just a false
answer so false and I'm not going to do
an else am I going to get a lot of code
real quick so I wants to you so true or
false and so from here we can do it for
all these but we're just gonna do it for
the wine the same time it should work
just fine so give any marketable skills
yes so we're going to answer is equal to
yes and we'll set a answer is equal to
no here to false and then we'll say we
can do it another if statement and yes
here I'll say if so we use a little bit
of a nested loop answer is equal to true
and and we'll just do it like this
decision
we're just going to make of a variable
for the sake of this prompt our decision
rivard choice will say he's undecided
still set this to false choice just
going to the false we want to
console.log or actually let's do another
prompt are our deal equals prompt and
from here we'll say is there anything
you can do to go ? and then we'll say
well in another if statement so this
one's going to say if deal c 3 equal to
true or our answer is equal equal to
chew console dot log thank you for
taking the job and we need to do one
more statement here to get the set deal
is equal to true and then we'll say if
we're going to call dot T lowercase now
we're going to say if deal is equal
equal to yes
deal is equal to church now just because
Louie we did this because answer is
going to be true in this point we
probably don't need this but it's better
that way so assuming that I make these
symptoms airs this should work only in
the yes case and you can see how it's
slowly getting a little more complicated
and if we obviously were making a real
interview type of thing we would have to
go through it just for the sake of
understanding i do encourage you to go
and just do each statement yourself do
you have any money feels yes same thing
with make you jealous oh we do use an
else statement alright so else also the
log sorry to hear that yes we're looking
for job yesterday and marketable skills
anything you do yes and been good to go
so uh you'd see how it's getting a
little bit condensed here a little bit
sloppy but uh here's my old code looks a
little bit more easier i did like a
little hard pga type of thing but um i'm
just gonna say with some with that code
do you dare open the door destiny eyes
film pretty dramatic so we'll say yes as
the chosen one you must not be
indecisive so apparently i guess wasn't
an option or i didn't enter yes properly
something along those lines but up next
we are going to be working with arrays
objects in JavaScript so just it should
be a little bit of a review if I
remember correctly but all in all thanks
for watching and if you have any
comments
Erin's anything constructive always
leave me comments or suggestions
anything video you of course that you
want me to review that's great i'm
always looking for new stuff we've done
probably about a third of what
Codecademy has to offer maybe maybe
closer to a half about forty percent and
once we get done with that I'm going to
be looking for additional things to be
reviewing and as always
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
