in code Academy we're doing the
introduction to react Jas part 1 I just
had yesterday my excuse me Thursday my
first my first react online course and
now this came out and it's a nice
refresher that's what I thought we'd do
it to get into it reacts very
up-and-coming library so basically what
it's saying here is take a chance
Cerrito
over it but it's basically saying that
react is fast it's modular it's very
scalable and flexible and it's it's
rather fun popular that's basically
that's all that's going on right here
I'm just basically going over why you
should learn react so you'll see an
examples here that's why I reset this so
what we're talking about with JSX is
basically how react how react allows you
to write HTML and JavaScript so you'll
see right here we're incredible called
h1 in Subang and we're just going to
create some HTML Oh world so within a
variable here we're storing what looks
beep in our JavaScript file basic HTML
this is basically what uh
rej SX is so let's go ahead and run this
you'll be doing a lot of this as well
it's actually very intuitive this aspect
of it so uh cool man so I can kind of
merge my my HTML and JavaScript a much
more standard way yeah and that's what
JSX is and that's basically what it
tells you element right here take a
second to read that if you want more no
no more about it but that's basically it
basically the JSX turns it into basic
JavaScript that's basically what's going
on here
all right cool so um it inapt up Jes
we're gonna create a variable can any
text hello world use the example oh it
doesn't look like it wants to store it
let's go ahead and just create a
paragraph and we're just gonna put in
hello world let's see if it wants us to
storing in a variable I think it does
cuz this doesn't do anything Oh
apparently they're okay with us doing it
like that whatever
so it goes over a few examples showing
you how things can go you can store
other elements as well you can store our
key value pairs like this Center Ben and
sew it alongside of it so we're gonna
create a variable here club that's gonna
store an art at HTML 5 article excuse me
I have the hiccups from some some
medication that I own from getting my
wisdom teeth removed yesterday so I
apologize if I kick up throughout the
video so we rinsed our article tag here
and we'll leave it empty cuz it doesn't
tell us to put anything in it oh don't
forget your semicolon as well
this basically says that we can add
attribute names to our HTML like we
would in normal HTML what you can do so
we're in declare variable here called p1
we're gonna set it equal to a paragraph
tag with with the words to win it and
then we're gonna create another variable
here called peace oops let's let's go
ahead and run this line by line
it takes a second to run on the website
so just be patient with it
worker another variable here called p2
and we're just going to store another P
tag and then here bring up a bar let's
go ahead and run that
and now now you're gonna see that it
wants us to add some attributes so the
first attribute it wants us to give us
ID and set this equal to law large and
we're going to set our P to ID equal to
small just basically showing us that
this is a functionality of our JSF X as
well so basically any attribute you want
you can add here
basically what's going on here is it
says everything has to be nested within
other elements so you'll see right here
we have our h1 that is nested with in a
tag you may want to use better
indentation and line breaks and you'll
also have to throw brackets around this
because the whip
the way that the JSX works is oftentimes
you'll need to store everything within
one container and you will showcase that
right now so we're gonna create declare
a new variable called a bar my div and
we're just set this equal to an empty
div
so next we're going to store an h1 but
because we have more than one HTML
element we're going to go ahead and
throw these brackets around it you can
see an example right here as well if you
want to slow up for a second second but
basically it can only process one thing
at a time one owner it goes owner parent
child so you have to have the owner
let's kind of have what's going on here
oops now we need to put the world in
hello world for our third step here
Oh
I don't know what it was about this this
medication I'm on for a long wisdom
teeth but it is giving me the hiccups
blog DSS removes please move blog notes
back as soon as your Saviour funds
alright let's go ahead and reset our
flaws your friends blog the sound he's
asked you to fix it you immediately I
diagnose the issue I think I already did
the location is what the issue here was
is that this wasn't around it
oh no that wasn't the issue
we need create a div so similar to how
we have to put those brackets brackets
around it it can only process one
container and that one my main element
so a lot of times we'll be throwing dibs
around your JSX like this so it's like
processing this block and the div
everything in the div is that that block
is really I have to think about it no I
shouldn't Bennett
did my div
let's go and run that hole over time
there should be everything
hmmm let's go and refresh this page real
quick
all we need to do here is create a div
that go around all of that it should
work just fine
cannot find module blog so somehow our
blog in here got reset uh which was that
air that we got earlier on I'm not quite
sure what happened so let's let's see we
can do this one more time we're going it
okay let's see if that will fix it so
white house Dutch I asked why this
apparently this is our compiled jeaious
that's kind of crazy it's going around
this one more time
I'm not quite sure what happened but it
seems that the blog index page got lost
just go ahead and hit run a few times
see Phil fix itself for us well this is
what you would do you'd basically I
think what happened when I reached reset
this is somehow it messed up the blog
because there's supposed to be like a
blog file in here or a block like
blogged up HTML but our code here is
correct we're wrapping our rht our JSX
into one container that will allow us to
to process everything there we go let's
let's see I think it goes it added it
back so here it is again blog back
Genesis when Oh music let's see if it
does it so what we're basically gonna be
doing now is every time that you want to
actually output so this is just some
mumbo-jumbo that it's gonna be in every
file basically but so it just recognize
that for the time being but what we're
gonna need to do here is our react dong
dot render tape takes in two things it
takes in our JSX which as of right now
we're just gonna part code in some stuff
in h1 element that takes in hello world
normally what you would do here is you'd
probably pass in your application so
you'd have a variable that stores all
the app changes that you want and other
apps within it and then you just put in
that variable name and then this
document dot get element by ID all we're
doing here is chart targeting and
element within our index within our
index dot HTML file that all these
changes are going to go to so oftentimes
you'll only have like one thing here and
so let's go ahead and pull up index.html
yep and you'll see right here main ID
app this is where our react JavaScript
is gonna go
go ahead and run that and hope we don't
get that stupid blogger again yo come on
make sure it's not here unless I typed
it wrong which I don't think I did
oh my god I did so make sure you
capitalized on by the way it react don't
so see it gets outputted right here so
we're out putting our Jessa X that comes
in here outputs right over here so the
first argument in fast react don't is
our JSX expression and then the other is
the location
so select app JM so let's jump over to
app top J s we can go ahead and close
previous gen s and what we want to do
here is call our react do em capitalize
dot render so render here is rendering
our components or gaius X we're gonna
pass in an h1 all this is gonna say is
render me so from here where do we want
to render it we want to render our JSF
is to get element by ID
to the app
yeah so you'll see a render me is now
displayed there instead this is just
basic JavaScript saying it may make it
seem a little weird since we've been
using JSX just gonna ignore it at the
end of the last exercise disappeared on
this for the screen main idh1 under me
so instead of app what we're gonna do
here is we're gonna jump into a HTML get
rid of this main and we're just
basically going to change the span so
it's basically just showing you that we
can target multiple things whether you
name this container and then what we're
going to need to do is jump back into
here and we want to change app to
container because that no longer exists
and we just want to go ahead and target
the container now because that's what we
changed so I run that one more time
so we're outputting are this here comes
our JSX and then this is the location
so similar now we just passed in pure
like JSX
you can also pass in a variable which
we're gonna do right now with multiple
HTML elements so here we're gonna go
ahead and do var my list we're gonna
pass in a list get this multiple
elements we're gonna put those
parentheses we're gonna start with a ul
and then within here we're gonna have
some some allies will just go with some
of my favorite old-school RPG super
mario RPG will then hit it off with that
with the classic shakotan i like she
tony the shakotan series and then one
more for good measure let me breath the
fire we could definitely throw final
fantasy in here as well but don't don't
sweat that too much alright so we stored
our variable my list here so now what we
want to do is we want to say look we
need to render it so we're gonna react
react Dom render and in here we're gonna
pass in our JSX
or in our very our JSX variable here and
then all we're gonna do is pass in where
we want it so we're gonna say document
dot get element by ID and note it
probably doesn't matter matter but you
can also do this by class as well
IDs probably the correct way to do it
you're not gonna want it most likely
target mult
multiple things and so you'll probably
just have an ID that you're going to
target so this is kind of standard
dimension
then we'll render and then we have our
three three list items here unordered
list items I should say and that was
basically the introductory course to our
JSX
so we've learned about JSX elements how
they work about meaning to contain
things there's kind of one element and
then also how to actually output that to
the HTML so up next it looks like we're
gonna be starting the first react
component so check out the next video
