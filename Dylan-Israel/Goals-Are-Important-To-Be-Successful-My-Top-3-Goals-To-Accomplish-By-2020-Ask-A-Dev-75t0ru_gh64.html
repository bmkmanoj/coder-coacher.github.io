something that's as important in code as
it is in life and that's setting goals
right so I have talked about I'm not
where I want to be and it doesn't mean
I'm not in a good place by the way I'm
in a very good place but I want to be
doing better and I I work every day to
get to where I want to go and I have
goals and I have short-term goals I have
sort of what I call my mid-tier goals
which are basically goals that are
anywhere from two to five years it's
kind of one year and lower is short-term
for me yes on my scale and then I have
long-term goals which is basically
everything past five years that for the
most part I have very few long-term
goals it's short term goals that I'm
trying to work towards and sometimes you
set unrealistic expectations on what you
can actually accomplish in a set amount
of time and and you know you have to
give yourself a little bit of a buffer
but I was just thinking because this so
I think about right every day I come
home and I do YouTube I answer emails
and phone calls and comment back to
subscribers I do everything to achieve
these goals and I'm just thinking that
there's this one number that kept on
popping up in my head and I'd been I I
wanted to by 2020 have a hundred
thousand subscribers it's one one of my
goals right so we're in August of 2017
so I I give myself in that by the end of
2020 now if I could have it by the
beginning that'd be great right so
that's goal number one but I have three
goals that all revolve around a hundred
thousand so gold goal and I'm working
towards every single one of these right
so this is about why mine mid-tier goals
now sure I'll talk about my short term
goals next now my mid-tier goals are
100,000 subs $100,000 salary and
$100,000 in the bank and I was just
thinking Illuminati Illuminati has
blessed
because these are all believe it or not
achievable things which is crazy right
the Illuminati has shined a light on us
and said hey do you have that trifecta
going on we you know we know what we're
you know what we're all about and so now
I pray to the gods of the Illuminati
but all jokes aside these are my three
goals and one thing I want to say my
three mid-tier goals right one thing I
want to say is that is it possible that
I won't achieve this of course it is
even if I work everyday to accomplish
these goals it is entirely possible but
I think there within the realm of
possibility I am at about 25,000
subscribers this month I grew by 2,000
if we say that I grow by 2,000 every
month from this month on for the next
three years which would be the end of
2020 I'll hit my goal now if I if my
subs increase a little bit every month
five or ten percent in terms of sub
growth I'll hand it at that two-year
marker a little before that right so
that's a very achievable goal in terms
of salaries I'm not too far away from
knowing the job market and knowing where
my my salary is now and where it will be
in the near future I'm not too far away
from hitting that that six-figure cap
right so that's that's a gold - well you
know net money's not everything but this
these are things that are important to
me financial stability and being able to
have options I really I really think you
know to have options in life you do need
some money but it isn't everything but
that that's my goal in the short term
right in the mid-tier right the next two
to three years that's where I want to
get and in terms of saving money because
that's what it is to me right it's about
having the options of can I do what I
want to do yeah until you're gonna have
money most of the most of the time can I
do have the stress of not being able to
pay rent pay the bills and stuff like
that um if I have money saved up I don't
worry about that so can I get my net
worth - a hundred hundred thousand in
two and a half to three years I
I think I can I guess three three years
and four months three what yours in
three months I I definitely can so I'm
about a little over 10% of the way there
and the bulk of that savings could as
you guys know I came down here with
about $300 left over after my air B&amp;amp;B
and god I've had this cold forever so
I'm sorry about that guys I had I came
down here with little no money just a
carload full of stuff and and sold
everything else and so after I've rented
a room at about $300 for my next
paycheck and then I April came down and
I had to pay her bills for a while
because it took her about five six
months to get a job and luckily in the
last three or four months that she's
been working we've been able to save
quite a bit of money April has her own
savings I have my own and I've been able
to save a healthy amount of money about
about 50% of my income so in the three
or four months I've been able to save
about ten thousand dollars which has
been great to take the stress off of me
right I've always been really worried
about not having money coming from you
know a personal situation where I didn't
have any and so one of my goals is to by
the way this is first time my life I've
ever hit that that that five digit
savings category and it's a very strange
feeling because it's like you don't the
natural instinct is not to be proud of
anything money related because you don't
want to you don't ever want to come off
as somebody who that that's all that you
care about right that's all that you you
want that and that's not really the
truth for me I just want peace of mind
and for me that's that's what gives it
you know I wish it could maybe be
something deeper but that that's just
that's just me so those are my three
mid-tier goals the the Illuminati goal
set right we got the 100k subs Hunter K
salary hunter K net worth or whatever
and that money will probably go towards
you know
and stuff and investments and things
like that so those are my mid tier now
the reason I'm bringing up goals and you
know my short-term goal right now is to
is to continue learning just become a
better developer and how am I going to
do that while I'm doing things like the
nanodegree program that's a four-month
course that's with short term goal there
I am
constantly working on YouTube because I
want to get to 50,000 that's my short
term goal is to double my youtube
channel in as quickly as possible and
I'm trying a few different things for
that so I'm experimenting right now
another short-term goal I have is to
build the if you're if you're a member
of the Facebook group you'll notice that
I threw out a poll the other day say hey
would you rather have me write a book
about sort of 50 developers inspiring
stories or would you rather have me make
a course about how to create a coding
channel what to watch out for the tools
and resources available for you how to
monetize it all these sorts of things so
for those who don't know like what one
big thing about YouTube is that you
actually make very little ad revenue but
it gives you a great platform so that
you can make whatever you make an ad
revenue you can actually easily double
or triple it elsewhere through sponsors
through affiliate links and other other
means other very very notable means
right you're only going to be marketing
things to to people who who are your
audience one and you've earned that
trust with them I know that you're not
gonna just sell them some bootleg
and and to Proxima they're gonna be
interested in right there's a lot of
when someone shows me something that I
would be interested in like oh man how
dare he tried to get a 5% cut so these
are all things that are gonna be talked
about in that course and to my surprise
of the 50 people who answered that and I
thought it was going to be the book this
is why this is why I don't know what I'm
doing right so I thought I was gonna
gonna be writing a book and have all
these great stories and part of this was
bet based on the fact that I kind of
told my developer story and it got such
positive feedback I said you know what's
better than one developer story 50
developer stories and that was going to
be something that I wanted to go and
interview people and
writings always been a sort of a
sideline passion of mine and it's I
really thought it was gonna be this book
and then it was like 45 people said the
course in my four people said the book
so we're definitely building the course
I probably will do the book eventually I
think that's going to be one of those
five year projects where I slowly
ancient out piece by piece while the
course I can continually work on but I
can finish that in a couple months to
get going so those are my short-term
goals my midterm goals a long term
I asked of right now I really don't have
any long long term goals for the most
part I try to take five years in it
ahead of time because based off where my
midterm goals sort of get achieved or
where I'm at will determine what my next
five years is like right so that's how I
look at it so everyone's a little bit
different one thing I want to say about
goals is that goals without without a
plan of action or nothing but words so
every goal that I've talked about right
now I have a plan of how I'm going to do
it how am I going to how am I going to
get 200,000 subscribers I'm going to
continue working on content every single
day I'm going to experiment with content
I'm going to see what works what doesn't
work I'm gonna be doing giveaways I'm
going to be collaborating if I've
reached out I'm going to hire people
help me with my channel and and things
like that so I've planned there how am I
going to raise my salary I'm going to
continue studying I'm going to continue
my self education as well as perhaps my
college education and fitting though the
traditional rap these are all things I'm
going to do how am I gonna save money
I'm gonna make more money and I'm gonna
save more money and I'm going to invest
more money so currently I'm able to
invest 50 percent of my income that will
always no matter how much money I make
I'll probably stay at that until I have
a surplus I guess I don't I don't need
that much money in life I just want a
good computer right and food in the
fridge and I'll be happy right I had
whatever April wants right so that's
basically she needs more than that but
that's neither here nor there so for me
it's peace of mind
but you know how am I going to do these
courses I I'm gonna look and see what
the job market is in the short term to
see what I should learn and how I should
move forward I'm gonna reach out to
developer friends I know and and confirm
that you know hey it's just something
that what's your thoughts I'm going to
be in involved in the in the coding
community as much as possible that's a
long-term goal if you want to talk about
something that's longer than five years
for me it's this it's coding in general
and whatever facet it may be right so
what I what I'm trying to say cuz I
don't want this video be about my goals
and how I'm going to accomplish them I
want them I want you to understand that
Illuminati and and that you need to have
a plan of action when you're going to do
this otherwise it's just words right and
if you if you just say one day or some
day I'm going to do that one day some
day comes very quickly and you're it's
usually before you're ready one thing
that I learned the hard way is that by
the time I want it to be somewhere like
really wanted to be somewhere
I wish I start three or four years
earlier and so now if you think someday
I want to someday I want to be a digital
no matter self employed okay
now you say how long five years what can
I do five years to make that a much
closer reality than it is before what do
I have to do what skills you have to do
what businesses can I start what side
income is gonna get and you really need
to start working at every single day and
I'm not joking guys I go home every day
and if I'm not writing code I'm doing
something on YouTube if I'm not just
allowing you to I'm watching something
on here if I'm not doing that I'm trying
to make some affiliate money I'm trying
to I'm reaching back out to recruiters
I'm doing whatever it is that helps me
move forward to accomplish my goals and
so I don't want you I don't want anybody
to be just think that things are going
to work out that is a really bad fight
good thing yeah let's just say 10% of
people are lucky enough that
they are just planning on things working
out so you're in the best-case world one
in ten right one in ten in which your
goals and your dreams just magically are
here and if that is you you're lucky
okay but the other nine and ten you want
your goals and dreams go and get them
going to work towards them go and
achieve them because nine out of ten
times they're not just gonna show up at
your doorstep so I hope you guys are
working on your goals and that could be
stuff like I want to go from a front-end
developer to a back-end developer or a
full-stack developer I want to get my
internship I want to start learning to
code I want to do all this sort of stuff
okay you want if there's something you
want great now remember that feeling
remember that want and devised a game
plan to go out there and accomplish that
goal so I hope I hope you guys are out
there grind in I hope you guys are
trying to figure out what your goals are
why they're important to you and how
you're going to achieve them so that's
my that's my memo today or my that's my
message it's been a long day I
appreciate you guys so much for helping
me accomplish my goals YouTube has been
an amazing thing and I will continue to
do this until ever tell him I here
anymore I guess that's really the game
plan
I'll see you guys next up bye hey guys
thanks for watching the video special
thanks to our sponsors dev Mountain if
you look for a coding boot camp where
tuition and housing is included
definitely check them out appreciate it
and I'll see you guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
