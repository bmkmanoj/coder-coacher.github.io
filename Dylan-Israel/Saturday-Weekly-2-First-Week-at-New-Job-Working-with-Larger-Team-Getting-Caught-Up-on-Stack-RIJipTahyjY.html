set Saturday weekly which is our weekly
live stream before we get started quick
shout out to myself and to you with this
special Humble Bundle going on right now
we it's a health oriented something that
we should all pay more attention to I'm
a little bit in the same category of not
taking as best care of myself as I want
so you can see things like essential
oils I'm pretty interested in that as
you know with my diffuser mindfulness
stretching body weight training I mean
most you won't have to worry about this
one here it's cognitive behavioral
therapy I don't know about some of this
stuff or some of that they hippie
dippity stuff but vegan cooking more
essential oils so on and so forth
there's a link in the description just
want to do a quick little shout out
there so if you guys are interested in
that check it out alright so welcome to
the channel I guess and good morning so
we're doing this a little bit earlier to
then I normally would just ended up
working out that way I'm a lot has been
happening I am lost my hair due stress
from my job know I got a bad haircut
from a barber so no hair I started a new
job I just finished my first week and
there's a lot of reflecting that we can
do about the new job I gotta say any
names because oddly enough I wouldn't I
went normally say any names I especially
once that Nene's because so now this is
the first job I've ever had where
um even watch so that's kind of strange
right so I'm not used to anybody ever
giving a about my channel and much
less watching it right from my previous
two jobs I had no one you know it was
good for the resume it was good for the
introduction but no one watched and now
I think one or two people do and it's
interesting so so that that's happening
I finished my first week and a lot of a
lot of things welcome David yang I hope
you are doing well I hope I don't be fit
working on the things that we talked
about David booked a mentoring session
with me and we kind of went over a few
things on to help him maybe appeal a
little bit more to the the job search
market right so what you doing on my my
uh my voice got very deep
I might it might just because it's early
I don't know I I don't think I've ever
had a really very deep voice I mean the
testosterone is at an all-time high so I
could understand maybe ah
but so so okay let's talk about let's
talk about I think I think we can gain a
lot of insight into the audios screwed
up a little bit let me see if I move
this a little closer that might be a
little bit better for everybody so so
one of the cool things that iron Milo so
one of the cool things the audio is
screwy huh hmm why
uh-uh
is it really awful like I need to
restart the stream or is it kind awful
and y'all can deal with it buddy it's
too hot okay we're gonna roll with it
we're gonna do it live all right so not
to give any name I don't necessarily
like to say where I work out if you guys
really are wanna creep I'm sure you can
figure it out but so my previous job I
worked at a military contracting company
and they are traditionally a service
company and what their service that they
provided was they help run military
training exercises and they were
building out for the last year and a
half and I was there for about a year
really that for last year they were
building out web applications to help
facilitate that and it was a very small
team about four people on my team and
about three other developers two to
three other developers to pay on if we
had a contractor and not at that time so
I I that be my first real one-year full
professional experience you know grant
I've done internships and I've worked at
other larger software companies that for
me is my client sort of baseline start
of my career like real hard set started
my career in development right grant
I've worked in and software a little bit
for about a year and a half before that
but not really as a developer so I am
used to being able to take a project and
I'm not saying this is good or bad or I
have a preference one way or the other
but I am used to be able to say take a
project from nothing designing the front
end designing the back end doing the
wireframes designing the database adding
features getting rid of features you
know so
so it is a I what is going on with the
sound guys let's let's see what's going
on here let's see oh there's some
there's definitely something going on
here
aye aye we may have to restart the
stream we're in technical difficulties
Lucy here oh my goodness that's not good
alright let's see if that's a little bit
better
oh no that's not better at all
you
how
is that I was just saying Destin alright
so I'm parently not getting audio
through my headphone alright I think we
I think I think we I think we solved it
so thank you for letting me know about
the audio on uh on my end here
it seems that all right and for the
record Kevin I've always sounded like an
OG so uh let me stand up for a second uh
alright so thank you guys for letting me
know that we're having I'm going to have
to fire my audio engineer you're doing a
 job mister audio engineer so ok so
as I was saying I'm used to having
control over every aspect not every
aspect but I'm used to having a lot of
flexibility and so one thing that I've
been asking one of the other developers
that I'm that's on my team is you know
how how how much can I sort of tweak you
know because I don't I don't I don't
mind following like set user stories set
instructions and Lee and just doing that
but I also want I am I'm also I'd like
to go above and beyond if I think
something's a good idea
I'll just do it so that's not
appropriate at at my current work
because we have project managers and we
have business analysts and they want to
make sure that I don't I don't um waste
my time
implementing features that the clients
and the the stakeholders don't even want
so that's one adjustment that does come
out of this and it's a good one for the
most part it's something there's
something wrong with it
either way it's just a different change
of pace right so if I if I have an
opinion about a matter as a developer I
should speak up at our stand
and our our meetings for those of you
who aren't familiar with I'm a little
bit familiar with the agile and
basically the way that everything works
with it so my previous previous job the
two jobs ago when I was doing technical
writing I was I was in an agile
environment so you have these things
called stand-ups and on your basically
the team that you're on every morning
everyone will come up they won't sit
down they will stand up let's see if I
can imagine and you go and you'll talk
about it's usually three things it's
what you worked on um what you're going
to work on in any like problems you have
I might be getting the order wrong but
that's basically it basically what if
what have you been doing what are you
going to be doing do you need any help
and so you'll do that every day and that
will be with like your maybe the entire
development team so there's like three
or four teams right and then you have
your your team meetings where you're on
your sort of subset team our teams are
I've about a team of five and I think
eventually will be six or seven but I'm
on us so we're on a relatively new team
and the team seems to only been around
for like two weeks I think we're going
into the third week now for the team and
I'm going from a point where we had no
business analysts and we had no project
manager - we have all those things and
it's it's it's great everyone's really
nice and friendly and everything but
it's a different change of process which
is which is very interesting because you
you get so accustomed to just like like
you just make your own decisions on
things right and now you you you say hey
can you find out about this is this a
good idea because you know when you're
getting caught up in your own hype right
when you're like you're like hell yeah
this is gonna be a sick-ass feature and
you're just thinking about any you're
excited about it and then like maybe
from a developer standpoint it's
actually amazing from a business
standpoint you just wasted a week of
your time
so it's interesting to start going to
meetings and things like that and
because at my last work in the last year
I probably went to maybe 10 meetings at
most granted they were longer meetings
when that happened about an hour to two
and then we had one or two that went for
all day but in comparison when you're on
a larger team and you have larger teams
and there's more developers and
everything like that you have a lot more
meetings an example of my very first
week I had a lot more because it was my
first week and let's talk about that
let's talk a little bit about what sort
of things happen in your first week as a
developer now in my case we they are a
very social company so there's a big
emphasis put on culture which is amazing
and part of the reason I think everybody
is so happy there and is one of the
reasons that I chose I chose to accept
an offer there and I wanted to accept an
offer there I had that I had a couple
other opportunities elsewhere and this
was the one I wanted from day one and
I'm very happy I was able to work out so
um I knew I knew going in by the way
that uh it not being a traditional
software company that that there was
going to be and then then be more
marketing focused that it was going to
be more social right and so as
developers a lot of time so this is this
is generalize generality but a lot of
times we are a little bit of an
introvert we're a little bit of a you
know not to say that we're like all not
just why not like sitting in a dark
corner and code and not talk to people
but maybe we are not super bubbly and
and and the biggest social right now I
consider myself pretty social then again
I move across country where I don't know
anybody and I don't talk to anybody so
maybe I don't know what the hell I'm
talking about so it's uh I could be
wrong on that but
is definitely a more social company and
the environment showcases it and so one
of the things that happens on like sort
of day one is or during the during this
week we you you go and you sort of
submit a paragraph about yourself so
they can send it out to the staff you
take photos be added to like a company
rolodex and there's there's literally
like a photo room and you bring your own
props right I brought my legal legend
statues for the ladies I know so you
know I brought up but yeah I brought my
legal legend statues and the majority of
the company is women which is definitely
a different thing from from what I'm
used to working with I would say I'm not
completely sure how many employees but
if I had to guess it's about a hundred
and fifty employees and I would probably
say it's like a hundred to 50 but that's
because I feel like there's a lot more
marketing in the space that they're in
is health and beauty and so that it
naturally is going to attract more women
which is not how it works in development
right so so it is a it is the first time
in about two years that I have worked
with that truly truly worked around the
opposite sex not good or bad just an
observation one that one that I was
thinking to myself about recently so
that's one thing is to free lessly we
haven't said did you ever job shout out
a corporation before you or a full-time
developer and you think is a useful
learning experience I think it'd be
great I don't know how you'd go about
job shadowing unless they were looking
for an intern I'm not quite sure how you
get into something like that other than
just doing an internship you work with
18 developers lots of dependencies
sometimes even say hi to me at so that's
not the environment that that I I work
in so one of the things that kind of
worried me about this potential about my
current job was that the the interview
process is very long it goes fast but it
is very long right but
so so you take a thing like like I had
two phone calls I to in-person
interviews I had a a a technical
interview during one those in-person
interviews and then I had to take home
project as well and that was that was
basically the interview process which is
it I guess it's like five steps so it's
not the fastest thing in the world not
to mention the phone calls with the
recruiters they send me and the resumes
and the cover letters and all that stuff
so will they allow an essential oil
diffuser in the office I have seen some
of the senior senior senior members I
guess the people with offices the people
with offices I've seen have essential
oil diffusers part of the reason for
that and why it's probably a little bit
more accepted as one they have an office
so they're not bothering anybody else
right not everyone's going to like
lavender or spearmint whatever it is
they're peppermint rather while the
company itself also sells essential oils
so it's a little bit how could you not
let them have essential oils if you sell
essential oils like it's probably
encouraged right now I don't think I'm
gonna bring one to my desk
I'm already strange enough I don't need
to be over there with the essential oil
diffuser just blasting in and blaring it
and spilling water all over the place
right but yeah so a much more social
company there it's very very interesting
being there and I honestly I've been
loving it the first three days or so
went kind of how I was expecting the
first day I there's a lot of
introductions a lot of of paperwork at a
lot of reviewing handbooks kind of
learning about the processes introducing
myself going to meetings not really
having anything to say and to be honest
I was exhausted the first day I from
going through such a social his social
experience right
your meaning probably I probably meant
25 30 people on the first day and you're
shaking hands and you're getting
accustomed to the new environment and
you're building relationships and it's
um the week went by very fast but that
first day that's expected for me anyhow
I probably thrive in new social
situations
and I'm not saying that I did poorly but
it was something that really drained me
the very first day so much so that I
could only study for about 20-30 minutes
when I got home and then I I went to bed
I ate I studied for about 20-30 minutes
in angular 4 then went to bed now one of
the things I was really surprising on a
technical standpoint was that my
technical take-home test was in
angularjs I was under the impression I
would be working in angularjs now I'm
not I'm working with angular for c-sharp
and a couple other things but that was
the impression I'm under now I'm super
excited to dive straight into angular 4
but it was kind of kind of worrisome
because I had only at this point done
about a to our YouTube course and I'm
continuing to to learn and work on and
everyday and they the the management
style is very very sort of relax get
your work done if you need help ask and
so especially for the first week or two
I've had a lot of leeway first week and
I imagine the next couple Lally way to
get caught up and help out and in any
way that I can so I you know I spent one
day about half the day watching angular
fork tutorials just sort of going
through a lot of stuff and then when I
got home I've been studying up on a few
things angular for being one the main
ones typescript before that jQuery
because we have a jquery project coming
up it's like yeah I've worked with
jQuery but haven't touched jQuery in a
year there's a lot of functions that I
just kind of need to brush up on now not
actually typing anything out these would
be like crash courses I've been watching
through traverse' T media's channel and
stuff like that so day one very draining
day one failure draining just reading a
lot of the handbooks
learning kind of the processes making
sure that we're all on the same page so
very exciting am i do I'm hired as a
front-end engineer but I'm going to
learn the the backend as well
probably get myself some more money
eventually if I get proficient in it in
terms of like a salary cap you know
being able to do c-sharp asp.net it's a
great skill to have also for a more
practical standpoint I don't like having
to wait on other people like right if I
could if they it's it's very clingy and
I understand that we're all supposed to
be like okay well you're gonna be
proficient in this and you're gonna be
proficient in that and like we're all
gonna work together yeah no I get all
that but like if there's something that
I can do I'd rather just go in and do it
and and change it so that's that's
something that I'm gonna be having to
pick up and go from there so yeah so
first day was very draining the second
day I don't really remember too much but
I think on the second day I was really
studying a lot I was watching a lot of
tutorials I was providing very little
value probably until Thursday which is
probably pretty good actually
so I a lot of times you probably can can
kind of float through for about maybe
something like two to four weeks
depending on the job where you're kind
of going through and you're providing a
little value and part of that is because
you are new right you're like new the
system you're coming I'm coming in as a
junior developer and maybe if you were a
senior developer or a team lead you need
to take cancel on and not to say that I
was like backing off I just needed to
feel comfortable working through and
kind of seeing how things worked and so
by Thursday was when I wrote my first
line of code so quick quick turnaround
in my opinion and then Friday Friday's
an interesting day so Friday as I
mentioned that the company culture is
amazing and they're in this beautiful
brand-new building that just got built
and it got building like 2014 I believe
do my research on the company and yeah
they're the only one in it and a
renovate they rent they spend like ten
million dollars renovating it
according to the article anyhow and a
beautiful building so um so they have
this they have a couple things going on
in it to add to the company culture
which even though even though from like
a from an introvert standpoint at times
the first one or two times
it is incredibly awkward for me right so
they have this there's this 3:05 role
which essentially at 3:05 they play
music and then everyone kind of
high-fives
and part of that just a hey listen at
least this life thing a part of it is
kind of take a take a quick two three
five-minute break break this sort of
zeroing in on our work right and and and
take a moment to to sort of you know
slap hands with the people on your floor
and semi introduce yourself right so
that's an everyday thing and I can I can
tell you the first time or two
it does feel incredibly awkward at least
for me right so I'm very uncoordinated I
don't know maybe my ghosts laughs I
accidentally hit them in the face no uh
but uh it's a it's a social thing where
you're becoming becoming becoming
becoming a team right it's it's a team
thing and so that it's a why 305 I don't
know it's just a good point in the day I
guess it's after lunch you're still not
necessarily going home from work so I
guess time wise I don't know the history
behind 305 though so yeah so somebody
has to play music and this is on every
floor and so you have the company the
company I work for is it works it works
global but um
I guess I could say that there's nothing
wrong with me saying where I work at so
you guys just scope it out on LinkedIn
anyhow good morning Jordan so another
thing about a the culture in terms of
Mayan that is very nice and I feel kind
of bad about this about so there is a
mentoring program because they are very
focused on making sure that the
employees are happy and making sure that
everyone is acclimating to the company
well right so they don't want you to
just go and be forgotten about they want
you to be be a part of the team and they
want you you know they're looking for
long-term long-term developers they're
not necessarily looking for people who
are going to to take a job and then job
hop for you know five or 10k raise a
year later they're looking for people
that they can promote and and work up it
within the company and their their
promotion practices from what I've seen
since they promote basically they
promoted like half the developers before
I started as they continue to build out
their their development team so so
there's a mentoring program what I mean
by that it's not like I'm someone
mentoring me on the skills but
essentially you get a mentor who happens
to be the my business analyst that I'm
working with and basically once a week
you're supposed to meet for like 15
minutes and they they talk with you and
they hey you know how you doing the
company you got any questions anything I
can help with and then you know they
have like a 45 day review with you and
like HR and then 90-day review with you
and HR and I so so that's that's one
thing that they do try to make sure that
everything and even even that right that
that you're kind of you know it's just
it's just another thing that's a little
bit more more personal and a little bit
more less introvert right so you got to
connect on another level there's nothing
wrong with that
but
takes me out of my shell a little bit
right especially I starting out earlier
on just leave me alone leave me alone
just a lot of code I don't talk to
anybody I don't know anybody I don't
even do they like me do they not like me
no but you got you guys go I'm trying to
say right you sometimes you just want to
be in your shell and so there's things
like that to make sure that a you are
adjusting to the to the company well and
you know you have someone there who's
there to help you so the reason I
brought that up is I forgot about our
first meeting so it's not a good look
not a good look I was I was so his
Thursday and I was finally writing some
code with one of my team members and
mind you my mentor is actually on the
team also and we sit like six feet away
from each other and you know he's like
the next desk that's diagonal to me and
and he's seen me work on this stuff and
I'm I'm just I've ignored the the
notification or whatnot through through
outlook and then he comes up at 12 15 or
15 though it's 15 minutes they spend
whatever the time was and was like oh
hey you know I was like oh the ins the
instant I saw him come up to me I
instantly ever know you get into
something and you see somebody any like
so I instantly knew that I'd forgotten I
you know I obviously apologized and and
he you know he said oh you know I didn't
want to bring it up to inside he's it's
not his job to bring it up to me right
we have something scheduled I don't need
him to you know I have no expectation
that he's gonna pay men are you gonna
make sure that you make your meeting
with me right so that's on me
granted uh I don't think there's the
biggest deal in the world but that's one
slip-up I did recently and then Fridays
are a whole nother visa and that this is
this is something that really had I had
I known that they did this on Fridays I
would instantly um probably accepted the
offer the first time like the before
without negotiating but I got a little
something extra for negotiating so I
guess I'll worked out but every Friday
they have a demo day which is about an
hour where someone from the development
team shares a project they're working on
whether it's for work or for no passion
or side projects to get better and
there's also a two hour after that
hacker period where you basically can
work on anything you want so for every
Friday you have two hours to work on any
side project you want recommended that's
not work-related right so one thing that
I started and I ended up helping one of
the so a lot of the staff a lot of the
developers are new and one the one of
the guys on my team that I that I've
kind of been attached at the hip right
that then like kind of like jumping on
his projects and like just trying to
trying to get a custom he's kind of the
the gentleman on my team that I've been
working with he's been very helpful and
he isn't accustomed to testing in karma
and jasmine and so so he yeah basically
during that two hours instead of working
I started working on a Chrome extension
I want to build a silly little Chrome
extension where basically when you hit a
a bug in your JavaScript console in the
in uh it will throw a meme up it's sort
of you know it's kind of like a little
fun alright well I'm kind of
frustrated that my code is broken but
hey here's the meme to kind of make me
laugh before I dive into this that's
that's the premise behind it so that's
what I'll be working on in there amongst
other slide fighters but instead of
working on the side project which only
worked about ten minutes long we were
going over testing right so how we do
test-driven development which is
something that basically if you're not
familiar with this is my first real time
doing it
I've written tests in the past post
application creation this is the first
test I've first job I have the EDA
tester and development and what that
basically means is that you write tests
as you are building out your application
that's that's the gist of it and it's to
make sure that you're not breaking
anything in the process and that your
your functions work with your tests
right so if you know that you're going
to write add function you need to make
sure that the two parameters when
and together return a correct number so
that that's that's an example of a very
basic test but he had never been
introduced to not really introduced that
so we had spent that time writing tests
for an application and to be honest I
was finally getting into the groove of
things and I you know I know I know I
haven't provided that much value in the
first week and you're not really
expected to but that doesn't mean that I
don't want to so I ended up working
through it but I think I will always
because I someone who loves side
projects you know I have the YouTube
channel the Facebook group now a podcast
and a couple others right that are on
the back burner the coding course it's
still hard to sit down and do them all
oh but but um this is gonna be a good
thing for me because I really do enjoy
that and some of that stuff may be very
helpful right you could make the
argument that by me writing that
extension and sending it to all the
developers that that may lower their
stress like I'm not not like you may
literally lower their stress levels
where maybe that's the meme that just
makes them kind of crack up at the
situation even though they're frustrated
beyond belief right I have a couple
other ones that I'm glad I've thought up
but I've never ridden a Chrome extension
before so I thought this would be a cool
little side project I think it'd be a
quick one also I don't want do anything
that's going to take months or weeks or
anything like that yeah and then every
Friday also there's about an hour in
which there's presentations from the
entire development world or portion of
our company and other other parts of the
company that are going to be talking
about certain things and then they all
try and go out to lunch on Fridays and
we went to like a steak house which was
kind of nice been a while since I've
shut down and have steak I was very good
yes so it was a very good week probably
not the most productive I did write some
stuff with google analytics and that was
interesting I haven't dived into that
too much and test-driven development
kind of getting accustomed to the
reviewing process so on Friday we spent
time peer reviewing and doing some basic
of one of our our co-workers our team
lead and that's that was great it's
definitely something I'm looking forward
to the three main things I was looking
forward to or three or four things I was
looking forward to at this current role
was one growing as a developer and what
that that was like the overall goal if
you will and that's going to be
accomplished by test-driven development
which we're doing the peer reviews slash
code reviews working in additional
frameworks like angular 4 and yeah so
everything's been great so far so that's
kind of my first week let's answer some
questions here let's see here so why am
i up so early uh well I mean I'm
accustomed to getting up at 6 a.m. every
day I typically don't stream this early
because I am working Monday through
Friday now I get up to 6:45 because I go
in at 8:30 versus versus the 6:30 to
6:45 I used to and that actually allows
me to work for about 45 minutes to an
hour in the morning which is great I
really like it a lot and I can kind of
get a little bit done so I've actually
like videos on the backlog and stuff
like that and I work a little when I get
home but it's also synced April and I
schedule up so we're having dinner
together and we're spending a little bit
more time together in the morning like
before I used to just get up and leave
now we're having coffee together in the
morning and doing things like that so
that's why I'm not like waking up later
than that
can you speak to your studying inside
projects while off work yeah so I
released a video yesterday about why I
JavaScript is amazing and someone one of
the what Kasey one of our our common
common subscribers I guess what what one
of the one is the more active
subscribers like it's a better way of
putting it comment hey we're if your
live streams man are you stunning for
you for your work yes so that is exactly
where the live streams have been my um I
have when I get off work
for the last five days and I will do
some this weekend as well now that I'm
actually writing some code I feel not as
pressured but I always will continue
studying just not as stressed out about
as I was this first week partly because
our next big project it's gonna be in
jQuery and reason for that is we're just
adding features to an existing
application so I'm not too worried about
that like I was more worried about
angular 4 because I I don't have any
production experience than that but so
study so so that's what I've been doing
I've been watching in terms of studying
typically how I like to study is like do
video tutorials if there's an
interactive tutorial going over a basic
framework or library if you code Academy
or free code camp I'll do that first
that's not always practical and they
don't always have that right but if they
do I will do it and it depends what I
I'm trying to learn a framework or
library specifically I will go watch a
tutorial and some people I could
recommend on YouTube it would be a
traversing media Academy and Derrick
bonus all the dirt bonus has been
staying away from like the newer stuff
he is he's kind of I think I think he's
running out of knowledge to share and
that not to say when I say that it's not
a dig on on Derrick I just don't think
every man can know everything and web
development changes so quickly but that
was originally who I would turn to quite
frequently so oh but those would be that
kind of the three I would go to when
looking for video tutorials and vice
versa if you're looking for more
detailed tutorials than what's on there
online I couldn't recommend all three of
them more I have traversée media
courses I have a cat Alliance courses I
forget that gentleman's name I just know
his YouTube channel
but yeah so like I'll be working through
the traversée media course on angular
that I have front to back pretty pretty
soon but that's typically how I go about
studying and then after that why don't
why I'm learning learning through the
YouTube channel through the interactive
tutorials through the udemy tutorials is
I have I saw
I'm thinking about what can I build with
this of my own and then I go and I build
a tool with it like a little web app
that I wanted right so let's say you
were watching a Chrome extension
tutorial and you're like okay cool I
want to build I want to build you know
the in my case the the code meme
debugger right so that's something I
want to build so that would be an
example of what I would go about that
yeah Maximilian thank you Maximilian is
the gentleman's name from Academy out
and then last name s
no disrespect to Maximilian the guy's
killing it I'm a huge fan just have
trouble pronouncing his his name the
name Maximilian is pretty pimp though I
don't know what it is like you're just
out there killing it if your name is
Maximilian like you're not homeless if
you're Maximilian not a crackhead no
crackhead Maximilian something so uh
side-projects uh basically every day and
every morning I work on something a lot
of times it's YouTube I have a you know
today already
I consider this part of my work believe
it or not with me doing live streams on
the YouTube channel it's funny time sort
of talking about things and it's very
beneficial because I can help you guys
out and it helps my channel out and
today I'll probably work I really want
to build this Chrome extension and so I
might might dive into that a little bit
but I probably should study so um I am
one thing that April on a more personal
level April has been very upset with me
because for months I've been preparing
and studying taking interviews doing
phone calls and continuing all my side
projects the way that those interviews
and the studying for those interviews
and the time for those interviews has
come from from us for me spending time
with her and so she's been very upset
with me recently of not spending enough
time with her so last night I took her
to dinner today we are going to go to
farmers market and see a movie sometime
today and then tomorrow we aren't doing
anything and that's going to be kind of
my day to catch up and study and work on
my side projects
I'll have like a three or four-hour gap
during the middle of the day where I can
do that as well but a lot of times where
my time comes from is I just don't do
anything else that that's the truth the
matter is I enjoy doing this so much and
I'm trying to accomplish the goals that
I have that sometimes it does have a
strain on the relationship and then
sometimes I have to sort of wait until
April because I don't realize it because
I'm just sort of in it right I'm just in
it and loving it and then April tells me
like look you need to spend time with me
oh okay yeah that's it you know usually
when it gets to that point you're past
the no no no no no but am i I'm of the
mindset that we'll have plenty of time
we have a lifetime to spend together you
know so what is the most efficient way
to hook up to a day to put database and
display search information PHP and my
sequel or MongoDB so uh I don't know
that specific thing uh but my
understanding is it depends it depends
on how large of a database and how
you're querying it and what you're
trying to query I would say that no SQL
databases traditionally are a little bit
faster but you it really I really
wouldn't be too worried about the most
efficient way you probably will have an
easier learning curve with MongoDB if
that's what you're referring to so how
do you motivate to get up so early
well I like getting paychecks that's
really motivating I mean what do you
what you gonna do you know I could sleep
in but I already set up this habit from
the passion of getting the paycheck and
then I also you know it's I get I go to
bed at a decent time I get eight or nine
hours of sleep every night even though I
think I think I still kind of dark
circles they're not as bad today but um
yeah so uh I I go to bed at 9:00 every
night like a like a goddamn adult uh am
I still doing the now to agree yes and
no so I've been actually using the extra
cream
they're part of the now to agree to get
more familiar with es6 as well as get
I'm trying to break myself trying to
break myself off of the github desktop
tools as well as the tortoise git which
was using in my previous work I want to
sort of work on these skills and those
are the extra curricular while I need to
focus more on these skills from my
current work I will continue to I'll
continue jus than a degree and I think I
have to like December 5th to turn it all
in which is only two more projects at
this point so I'm not too worried about
it but I it is on the back burner for
the time being and my understanding
Ricky was telling me that I can actually
postpone it by after three months and so
I'm going to look into that and how I
can put that on hold for a second why I
get kind of caught up because you know
obviously my work is my main priority
yeah I know I should be drinking this
energy drink um I'm kind of I'm trying
to practice moderation so one thing I've
I've had issues with in my life is the
inability to practice moderation the the
ability to sort of be dependent on the
things that I love and just like you
know when I was playing Lea legends five
years ago I was playing League of
Legends like six to eight hours a day
when I was drinking energy drinks
I was drinking three energy drinks today
and so one thing that I've been working
on is trying to be able to have these
not necessarily vices but have these
things that I used to be dependent upon
and have them in moderation and I've
been doing decently well so far what's
going on man where's the hair how you
doing David well I was just talking with
you about you with one of my co-workers
actually they asked me if I had like any
any co-workers if they asked me if I had
any subscribers that would like would
give you on YouTube they were
basically asking if people on YouTube
were jackasses I said no not really you
got you get someone who's you get some
negativity sometimes though and that's
that's when your name came up not not
too
to pick on you or anything but that's
kinda that's kind of I think that's a
fair statement on my part you may say
that I that's a little bit rough and
that you're just being practical
I disagree though but where's my hair I
should ask my barber right so uh so I
Sunday day before I started my new job I
went into a barber shop just a local one
I said hey I uh I have a job I'm
starting a new job tomorrow and I just
want I just want you to clean it up a
little bit just take a little off top
you know and I'm not too picky just get
it you know make it look nice I got a I
got a I got a job interview and that job
I got a new job I just want to go in
looking looking all right right and this
is what I ended up with so I don't know
if that's my fault
I'm pretty sure it's his fault for that
that's where right so Derek said in his
live streams that he's been sneaking
away from webdev stuff because you want
to focus on building games to teach him
how to build games let's see sharpen
unity okay that makes sense so that like
I have noticed that he's been putting
out games I thought that these were
skills that he already had and he was
just sort of trying to build projects in
those skills
how many hours of coding do I usually do
in a weekend it kind of pens right so
the last the last couple weeks not as
much as I would like just because we
have the hurricane and I've been
preoccupied with with you think the
haircut is his fault I think I look good
no no I
I'm definitely growing my hair back out
but uh there's nothing I could do about
it's definitely not how I wanted to go
into work right it's like you're already
kind of nervous right just from a very
personally like I'm gonna meet new
people I'm gonna be a new environment
you know you want to look good you want
to feel good and all of a sudden you
don't look good
and you'll feel good but on a weekend I
would say assuming that it's it's a
normal weekend probably about eight
hours for a weekend now not as much as I
used to about four and four that's
that's probably about what I do and then
I spent time on YouTube I spend time
taking care of sponsorships emails all
that sort of stuff that goes along with
having a YouTube channel Facebook groups
affiliates all that all that start
setting up stuff for YouTube you know
reaching out to to people to do that so
you have that for your side project as
well you know the occasional blog that
all right then won't release I have like
5 blogs I've written I haven't released
so yeah not as much when I was really
trying to become a developer it was like
28 hours so I was you know a lot of
people might think 8 hours is a lot for
a weekend it's really not for me and it
depends how enthralled I am in in the
project also right so so if I'm like if
there's like many projects that I was
building so like when I was doing the
the micro service projects for free code
camp I was really loving it because I
just started diving into node in MongoDB
among goose and Express and everything
and in a weekend I did like all four or
five and I probably spent 20 hours that
weekend doing that and that was a lot of
fun and then like when I was a couple
months back when I was studying when I
wanted to get better at solving
algorithms and I knew that there's a
chance that I could be taking technical
interviews in the future I decided to
start doing code fights code fights
comms you're not familiar with it is an
algorithm site I love it and I got
really enthralled with that and then I
started doing like 25 hours in a weekend
of algorithms for probably about a month
before I stopped doing that and I would
do like two or three hours a day during
the weekdays and do that and I've I've
just been loving it so it just depends
it goes in waste but I always try and
spend some time Cody because I I I mean
especially right now so my like right
now I'll probably spend about eight
hours this weekend prepping for work and
a lot of that's just going to be getting
more comfortable with angular 4 and I do
want to dive into a side project like
actual coding side project hard coding
so hard not like I'm on a hard code
something but I'm actually going to
write code a lot of times because of the
social media aspect of YouTube a lot of
my other side projects are social media
based but I want to I want to kind of
stay away from that in the future and
and go for it so that's it just kinda
depends on what what I'm where I'm at
mentally and what I want to do and and
what's going on with my career right so
the last couple weekends I haven't coded
that much because I was talking to
recruiters as answering emails doing
skills tests doing practical take-home
tests all this sort of stuff so now I
have a new job and I need to study to
make sure that I'm proficient in
everything and granted I can do that on
the job and I do but also I want to ramp
up as as quickly as possible provide as
much value as possible right
this is a company I want to work at I
enjoy working on it and I want them to
want to keep me so that's where I'm
going so um hey Delma high school right
now I'm learning some languages simple
ones like HTML CSS PHP and jeaious what
do you think I should learn next and
what do you think will be the next
future language so I I kind of did a
video yesterday about this and I think
JavaScript is the language of the future
and the present although you can make
the argument that Python now having
overtaken R is going in the same
direction so I would say JavaScript and
Python or is just both great ones to
learn it kind of depends on what what
your passion is the Z masterful so my my
suggestion to you is if you are into
data science and analytics you might
want to pick up Python because that's
kind of what that's used for
and if you are into web development just
pure web development there's so many
great javascript language javascript
frameworks out there and libraries that
you can learn that you might want to do
something like that you're definitely
gonna want to pick up node for the
backend and some things for it to go
along with that is Express Express will
help you with your routing and it's also
it basically just makes node a little
bit better that's how I think about it
is it's a essentially a framework for
node for you to make your life easy so
so that's one thing that I would kind of
suggest because there although there are
a lot of PHP jobs there also a lot of
lot of node jobs - hey buddy so I would
say I would say maybe pick up node for
the backend start playing around in a
couple of JavaScript frameworks if you
haven't ever played around in any of
those before jQuery is a quick a quick
one to pick up but you're probably gonna
want to move if you're in high school
you have plenty of time but you're
probably going to want to move to a more
popular one such as
angular for react and react has a bunch
of other like sub libraries under it
such as redux react native so it really
just depends how deep you want to go
into web development but you know you
can you can build you mobile apps you
can build desktop apps there's databases
in JavaScript it really is just one of
those languages that it's no longer just
for like client-side building widgets
and stuff like that it's traversing
media put it in a comment what's a good
place to practice JavaScript for
beginners free code camp comm is a
full-stack JavaScript online open source
bootcamp completely free as you would
imagine and I would I would highly
suggest if you're trying to pick up
JavaScript there's free code camp comm I
think it's a dot dot edu now or.org but
free should redirect you stinker
all right so so I would I would say
that's probably your best bet if you're
just getting started and how did I stay
motivated uh well I haven't always been
motivated so free code camped out org
there's also beta dot free code camp
calm it might be free I think it's
probably still calm if you want to test
out their new stuff so how do I stay
motivated interesting question because I
haven't always been motivated right um I
got motivated when I dropped out of
college which may be very surprising to
people and the reason for it is I knew
that if I was gonna make that dramatic
alright buddy I knew that if I was going
to make such a dramatic choice that I
had no choice but
to get motivated and start working hard
and everything so in my case it came
from a frustration of being broke and
from a standpoint of of like just sick
of being broke man I remember there's
some there's you know April and I living
in the living room with the three cats
and and you know some nice sweet
legitimately go to bed hungry because
we'd have any food and you know my mom
would bring us groceries on occasion so
I mean that that's that stuff that's not
that old we're talking maybe about three
four years ago
you know I've I guess it would be about
two years ago when I stopped going to
school but yeah so it's just one of
those things where for me I I knew that
it was I was very unhappy and when you
make such a large decision like that and
even though it has worked out I've
worked very hard for it to work out I
assure you and I've had to do a lot of
things that you know just supplement
that but that was really fit for me is I
I knew that I was unhappy with what was
going on in my life and I made a very
very unpopular decision by everybody and
um
God knows although my father is very
supportive of me and never really gave
me any any any about dropping out
get paid for all of my schooling so I
have no debt but also no degree to show
for that so going down the self-taught
path that was kind of that was kind of
what happened for Moute motivation and
and the reason I would say that I
wouldn't say that I wasn't motivated
before then but uh not like I am now
before I was just so miserable being in
school I really was just trying to like
survive
how could I thrive when I could barely
survive you know I mean so that's kind
of that's kind of where I was at
mentally when I was in school um let's
see how did my first week go awesome and
everyone's great that I work with and I
I I'm leaving this livestream up but I
basically go I spent about 20 30 minutes
going into sort of some of the the
culture stuff and how they're going in
but just a quick rundown
everyone's super friendly a lot of
developers are new there because they're
sounds like they're they've been
building out their team a little bit for
last year
so most of developers have been there
less than a year a lot in the three
month and under mark so everyone's kind
of on the same page and it's all fresh
in their mind what it's like to work as
a new developer at a large company at a
and on a large team how do you know your
javascript is good enough to apply for
jobs this is an interesting question I
was in a unique position in which I was
working at a software company not as a
developer but as a technical writer and
I could see that the candidates they
were interviewing and see them fail
things through like the glass on the
whiteboard cart and see that I was a
better candidate it's so that that that
gave objectively see that I was a better
developer than a few of them and that
was when I started realizing that I
could go and start applying also from
like a non objective standpoint or non
like non specific if you can start
building a project like if I said to you
right now
I want you to build me a website that
connects to the Facebook API for logging
in hand is a meme generator you may not
know off the top of your head how to do
that
but you're going to open up a text
editor you're gonna start doing the
research and you're gonna start working
on it and you you understand at some
point you'll get there if you're that
you're probably ready if you can build
something if you open up the text editor
and there's nothing in it and you don't
panic because a lot of times you open
that text and you're like I don't know
 it's like if you're past that point
you
probably ready to start at least looking
for internships can I speak to the
office layout and computer setup do I
have any interest in building computers
I don't have any interest in building
computers I've I mean I've basically
upgraded every aspect of my computer I
currently have from the power unit to
the graphics card I had so I I had to
update the power unit to support my
graphics my new graphics card was a gtx
980ti
i had to then update my those are two
things i added to it i updated the SSD
on i update so we had a HDD i think this
what it is or h HD I always forget and
then and then I I got a I got a call I
got an SSD cuz they uh it was the boot
time on my computer was getting
ridiculous and that helped a ton so I
installed that trend thing is there's
anything else I installed I think I say
but I you know I've never built anything
from scratch I mean I use so in terms of
operating systems everyone kind of uses
wherever they want right a lot of the
developers use Mac I use Windows and I
really want to get started on Mac unless
I have to
I've always used Windows I like Windows
and I don't see the point of of changing
um DAF se out business casual it's not
really cubicles everyone has a desk but
yeah so I mean that's yeah I got I got
my two computer and my two monitors and
a laptop and filing cabinet all that
sort of all standard stuff that you'd
expect and yeah it's great would you be
willing to go back to your former
employer they offered more incentives
and match your current salary with your
current employer
no they they the the the honest truth is
that they probably would have paid
me whatever I asked not not whatever a
this is a cocky way of saying but they
would they would have matched when I
handed in my resignation letter they
asked if there's anything they can do to
keep me to stay that would have been my
opportunity to say well it's a money
thing maybe we can talk about the money
and I given that how how crucial I was
to the the team I I'm pretty sure that
they could have they would have match a
matter of fact I would say with 99%
surety they probably would have at least
matched what I said so and I remind you
guys it not was not all about the money
like I I got yes I got a little bit of a
race I got some better better better
benefits in terms of pto um so but I had
more luxurious offers I guess in terms
of just direct compensation but I
decided to work this was the company I
wanted to work with and the people I
wanted to work with and so I can make
more money with them long term like
probably could short term with this with
other companies dude do you have do you
notice any advantages about working with
a larger team so this is something I'm
actually gonna film video on next week
or the week prior or we post that
following week so there are different
advantages right we were talking earlier
about how on a smaller team on a very
small team ride till you have four four
members and we were only of one team and
we didn't necessarily follow like to
traditional not I guess not traditional
but the agile way I stand up and all
that sort of stuff and you have one
senior dev who's also the architect
doing the back and a lot of times and so
in that instance I had
I had a lot of leeway I had a lot of
leeway so hey do this project I I'm
designing the way it looks I'm building
out the front end I'm building out the
back end and occasionally the closest
that it ever comes to like getting some
input in that situation is hey this is
what I'm thinking what do you think
about it and then most the time it's
like ah just do this one other thing so
in that case I add I add I was able I
had the ability to to basically build
out the projects however I'd like use
whatever external resources I wanted and
go from there now working on a large
team of granted I've only been there for
a week but I have some experience when I
assume my technology turner's I was one
team member of about eight to ten
depending on when we were on at one
point in time the size of the team and
that basically that basically gave me a
lot of insight so in that case you're
just working a lot more hands on then
then you would be you you're working a
lot more together in my case I the way
that my previous job or is doing
full-stack was you're basically have
your own application you're building it
and no one's touching it because
everyone's building their own
applications and now with there's less
applications and more features that
you're building out it's a lot more
organized there's a lot of you know
there's there's people who are only
doing front-end which people are only
doing back and there's people who are
just in DevOps and there's no there's
not say that some of my stuff doesn't
overlap but you're all kind of working
hand in hand and there's an organized
process of how things are done and you
don't know it's not like the Wild West
I'm gonna just do things how I want
which is nice right so it does take away
some of the flexibilities a little bit
stricter but part of that is becoming a
better developer and being able to work
better with others which is something
that I was looking for is something that
I'm very interested in
like code reviews or another thing so
yeah you have more processes set up I
guess that's what I'm trying to say of
various aspects so it's less you
deciding what's the best way of doing
and having senior developers who have
been in the industry much longer than
you are much more qualified to decide
what a good process is set up processes
that you then follow and get better in
the process because of it I guess what
I'm trying to say so I've been doing
free code camp for weeks I'm starting to
feel burned out any tips to keep up my
motivation I would say star side project
start a side project and find something
that is a little less code oriented what
I mean by that is dive into like meetups
maybe start joining a couple Facebook
groups you know Co tech and caffeine is
a great one I hear so sorry start start
meeting other developers whether it's in
the digital world or in in person and
start going to maybe talks maybe watch
videos without actually typing anything
there's other ways to actually learn to
be a developer that doesn't require you
to write code and I would say try to
integrate that into your workflow or
your learning process as you are slowly
getting burnt out so you will get burnt
out especially if you're like studying
every day as you should but you have to
figure out how to manage that while
still enjoying yourself like like this
this live stream might be a good example
of something right where you know you're
feeling a little burned out and so here
instead of you actually having to be in
that sort of critical problem-solving
brain instead what's going on is you are
just listening interacting we're having
a conversation here and it's more of a
sort of audio experience where let's
let's listen in sort of AMA and see and
see what sort of items that you can
apply to to your workflow and it's a
completely different process than you
actually writing code but you may leave
here in this hour hour and a half
talk and and maybe feel a little
refreshed or at least take one little
thing away and say you know what that
was a good point let me see if I can
start doing that and that's another way
that you can become a better developer
that isn't just you going through
documentation and slamming your your
head against the keyboard how's the
slide you know I forgot to go down on
Friday every Friday I wanted to go down
that ass down the slide but I forgot so
how did I personally learn angular so in
terms of angularjs I did the tutorial
psycho Academy exactly like I suggested
how I learned oh yeah can't hear my
mouth so oh so um I I did the tutorials
on angularjs encode Khadem e1 one
weekend or one afternoon or something
like that it's pretty quick I then
watched Derek bonus for videos on
angular twice I coded it once I watched
it once I then coded it through it right
he was doing code to follow along and
then I built my website coding toriel's
360 comm that taught me the basics and
then I got hired for an angularjs role
I've been going through free code camp
in team treehouse for two weeks now that
feels like a lot of it isn't sticking
got any advice well it depends are you
are you like is that your only resource
are you actually typing code out do you
have a side project are you you know it
my advice and are you studying every day
like a lot of times people think this is
something you can do every other day
it's really not when you're getting
started you really kind of should devote
your life to it for like three months
three to six months every day
um but so I would say it depends where
you're at right or if you are you just
trying to learn JavaScript if so I do
think the interactive tutorials through
free code camp are very helpful because
you're actually typing code while
learning about language as kind of
structured in a pacing so it's not
easier it's easy from easy to hard so I
would encourage you to check that out
maybe just try and try different change
of pace sometimes just watching videos
isn't helpful enough you have to
actually counter it what's your thought
on code combat so I like code combat I
have like a couple of videos up on it
going through the first two levels or so
the force level in the desert area I
don't know that it's something that I'll
actually go back to just because it's
it's one of those things where where it
it's it's no longer a helpful for me I
guess that's what I'm trying to say as a
developer like that's definitely
something when you're just getting
started out or you're younger and you
want to attract kids to learn to code
but um I think it's fun I have no
problem with that I think it's not a bad
way to learn it's a different way to
learn and if you're just getting started
it's probably is probably pretty
exciting why do you make a video on how
to build a website using angularjs as
you did your website well I mean I could
my websites not the best example of
angularjs mind you because I watched
some tutorials and I built something and
I think it's building angular 1.3 and
they're after like 6.5 or something or
one point six point five
could you explain hackathons sure I
happen to have a hackathon t-shirt on
which probably where this question
originated so a hackathon is basically a
programming competition where there's
usually a couple objectives and prizes
and stuff like that this one was a data
science one I had no business going to
and I didn't even stay I was there for
about four hours I took April so she
could experience it and I I was totally
unprepared I couldn't even get on team
but it was it was interesting to go to
see how how detailed data science
actually is and I had a I always had
respect for data science I at that point
then had a much greater look for data
science so um so a hackathon interested
video talking about a hackathon I went
to sort of where I failed at winning at
a hackathon I talked about failures part
of the process I encourage you to check
that out but essentially what happens
and and they're all slightly different
but but basically there is an objective
usually usually there's overall goal we
like we want to help like let's say it's
for MasterCard like I said I've been
seeing a lot of those lately we want to
we want you to take our AP our
MasterCard API and help the food service
industry and that might be the main
objectives and there might be some sub
objectives right and then like the top
three we'll get prizes money items it
depends Angel hack comm orange Ohio is a
great site if you're looking for
hackathon to go to I encourage you to go
to him even if you think you're not
prepared just sit in experience it you
might get lucky someone might be looking
for interns while they're there but you
know so essentially you have an
objective and you have technologies
right so people bring their API so
there's companies there they have their
API is they have their their you know
their their hardware their software
whatever it is they want you to use it
in
resting away and build something out of
it and then you'll get prizes and then
you can put on your portfolio and stuff
like that as well that's really at the
end of days you show up it's usually it
depends but it's usually somewhere
between 24 and 48 hours and sometimes
they're over night and you can sleep
there and sometimes you gotta get up go
and come back and and yeah you just
program and not think that it's great I
I love them
there's not enough by me for me to go
which is why I went to a data science
one even though I know I shouldn't have
and I felt like such a loser oh my
goodness I had no business being there I
was like yeah I'll just query a database
and then I'll just show some stats I had
no idea oh yeah so uh house job great
great great we discussed that quite a
bit earlier in the segment Josh so I I
encourage you to watch the first like 30
minutes of this decoding God's back
that's right uh so I uh I was this close
to buying code God for my my license
plate but it was it's too is too much
I'm not like money-wise there's just too
much to do something like that
I was just like driving to work the
other day I'm just like I saw someone
with like a like a like a custom license
plate and I was thinking like you know
it's also seven letters code God and I
was just like laughing to myself and
it's like just thinking like should it
like like how totally would I feel if I
actually bought that oh man um I still
might dude though I don't know I just I
might not be able to help myself to do
something like that
um we'll see though we'll see oh okay
first list of the resources videos
websites they use to build your website
angularjs uh code Academy YouTube and I
think I took a starter template from get
bootstrap or start bootstrap I forget I
forget the exact one how old
I'm 29 I will be 30 years old sometime
next month
yes next one I'll be 30 next month uh
yeah it's just a common question I get
asked why is it that you guys always ask
me how old am i I'm very curious because
I it is a is it is one of the most
frequent questions I get in my live
stream is how old am I
and why does it look like I have no
eyebrows what happened to my breasts
oh yeah I do get that quite frequently
now my gut instinct is that a lot of
people are trying to compare themselves
to me at where I'm at in my career to
their own age and be like alright well
and maybe make some correlations have a
good one Nora yeah okay so I'm on the
right path you dress here I'm
calculating if I'm too late yeah so
you're trying to figure out Oh at what
age how come they named a country after
you okay waiting there's a coating god
you know say what I'm so what I let's
talk about that for a second so uh cuz a
lotta a lot of people are very worried
about about Oh am I too old to to get
into software am I too old to to do this
and that I mean what's the alternative I
don't think I mind you I I'm a I'm of
the opinion that no you're not
there was what a seventy year old that
released an app that's doing quite well
I read article about a while back and as
long as you're willing to work hardening
at the time
you could definitely pick up codeine you
can definitely get jobs in coding my
coworker my Eric Susan my previous
coworker he was in the military first 12
years of his adult life then he did four
years in a CS degree and he didn't start
working as a developer till he was 35
you say well till I'm older than 35 okay
so you're 40 now you're 50 what's the
alternative right like if you're if you
are if your motivating can work hard and
you're going to learn the stuff yeah is
it gonna be lard it might be but a lot
of times you had benefit the benefits
that don't come along with hiring a
younger individual so take me for
instance I'm on the younger side I will
say 25 year-old will do a little bit
younger than me it's a 25 year old 25
you may not you may still be going out
every weekend and drinking and like try
and do the single life have a little bit
more hectic come and tired to work maybe
you're not as responsible as someone
who's 50 50 years old you're just
getting your break into the industry
they understand that you want this right
they understand that that this is a
person who has their together and
it's got their together and that
you know they held their kids might be
out of the house by then they're not
worried about that right so that they
that you are someone who is motivated
and that grannie it depends but this is
what I would take away from someone
who's just getting into the industry at
50 is that you are somebody who has
taken a step to change the direction of
their life and it's going to be
appreciative of that and it's also not
going to be is going to be mature to the
point where if somebody comes at you in
a hostile manner you're going to be able
to be mature enough say huh hold up hold
up you know let's just calm down for a
second and instead of younger I might
just be like yelling and screaming so I
there's benefits that go with it is
gonna be a little harder maybe maybe
it's defense but like I've worked at my
two jobs ago I see yeah by the way I was
the youngest guy at my last job
everybody else the 35 year old was the
next youngest everybody else was 45 to
like 65 so it just it's just a fence now
I understand that it's intimidating but
what's the alternative let's say you're
50 and you're I'm just gonna choose a
don't get if anybody in here is this job
don't get upset I'm just choosing the
example job a waiter so you're 50 and a
waiter and and you don't have benefits
or you don't have you know you're making
ok money cuz you're getting tips but
it's not what you want to be doing
anymore right I understand that I was a
delivery driver for many years so so
you're a waiter and you're trying to
transition you're 50 you wanna make more
money you want to do all that sort of
stuff that comes along with it what's
the alternative in that case to stay a
waiter to gain a different skill or to
do nothing right and so do nothing
you're just gonna stay away there I
guess so they really have two choices
you have gained a skill stay waiter stay
in that job staying whatever it is that
makes you want to leave you can stay
doing that that's an awful decision
that's all that is a way awful decision
as someone who did that with school
staying in something you hate in a job
you hate I'm under 70% of people hate
their job as a fact every poll again
again will show you that seven I ten
people hate their job which lie it's so
important to find a good workplace which
is one of the things I'm very excited
about why I decided to to work with this
company because I I had that feeling and
it and I'm very confident after the
spending the first week with the people
and the company and the culture that I
made an excellent decision so
your choices are when your Wayne am I
too old is stay in what you're doing
what you're clearly not enjoying or
isn't working out for you in a in a
technic in a in a practical standpoint
whether that be money benefits long-term
goals whatever it may be or you wouldn't
be changing your job direction or career
direction or gain a new skill and if
you're in that first category where it's
not working out for you and you're
trying to gain new skill to go into it
you only have one choice gain a new
skill and dive into it and that doesn't
necessarily have to be coding it could
be and it's not nothing wrong with that
and coding is unique in the aspect that
you can build a portfolio to showcase
your skill set and your experience
without ever having even have an
internship or any resume experience so
when you go in there you can not only
work on these skills for relatively free
to low costs and there's materials out
your ass to learn all this stuff the
hardest part will be deciding which ones
are good ones and going from there but
if you learn it you build a portfolio in
it you can show these employers that
yeah I may be you know sold and I don't
have any experience and my last ten jobs
were working as a waiter or a bartender
or whatever it may be that that you
weren't happy doing but look at what
I've built look at the skills that I
have I'm ready to be here I have the
skills necessary and you'll get your
shot but the option of staying in that
job that you're not happy with for
whatever reason whether it be money
whether it just not be fulfilling gotta
go with option two there are two fingers
too and learn something new and that
could be maybe maybe you want to be an
electrician maybe you want to be uh
maybe you want to work with databases I
don't know it's but the stain and a job
that's not doing it for you is not a
good decision it's just not with life is
short guys I was miserable for too many
years in school and I people ask me all
the time what would I do differently and
I instantly know all the answers I
do I would stop doing all the things
that made me unhappy and that and that
sounds that sounds very simple who'd Oh
what are we doing you know who does
things that make them unhappy 70% of the
population that works okay so don't be
in that 70% be in the 30% that finds a
job and a career and a company or start
your own that you are happy to work out
that you say you know what these are
good people these are good people and
these are companies that I want to be
around and I could see myself being
there for the next five you if you're in
a job right now and you can't really see
yourself being there for three to five
years because the idea of that disgust
you stresses you out or is just very
unattractive you need to start gaining
skills to leave that job so just
something to think about this might be a
stupid question it's okay I asked you
two questions all the time but the way
that you get rid of stupid questions is
you get correct answers and then you
don't need to have stupid questions
anymore so good good on you for throwing
yourself out fix no strife but says this
may be a stupid question
could you semi explain the difference
between front end and back end yeah it's
pretty straightforward so the front end
is your view your UI your your your
template if you will so like when you go
to a web page and you see things that's
the front end that's the HTML the CSS
the JavaScript that's your front end
basically what you see now the back end
is what's going on behind the scenes the
stuff that you don't see happen a lot of
times and that is like you're connecting
to databases and databases so basically
the data the data that's coming and
being displayed on the front end
connecting to that data and and
displaying that data and updating that
data and and deleting that data all that
sort of stuff that deals with the data
that's the back end at the end of the
day and and the front end connects to
the back end and then the back end sends
data back to the front end and the front
end displays it for you to work with and
see that's the main that's the main
difference
sort of the the back end works with
servers and databases at the end of the
day and the friend connects to the
backend back in since data back via via
routes as Johnny B is explained in chat
and so on and so forth do you think
portfolios help in energies yes I do and
I think if you don't have one you're
gonna have a hard time especially very
good to the industry how are you gonna
prove how are you gonna prove to
somebody that you can actually code if
you don't have any code why are they why
are they gonna even set up an interview
right if you have no work experience so
if you have no work experience and
you're just gonna say I have I know
these skip things I know that I know
them no was hired me yet and I have no
work experience but I know them and you
don't have something to actually show
that you know them why would they why
would they set up an interview with you
over someone who does have a portfolio
and no work experience so yes and that's
why I feel in a video maybe last week or
the week prior where I said five things
that you need to do to land a web
development jump one of them was have
portfolio if you're not doing off on
those things you really are you really
causing issues for yourself and I highly
encourage you to um to uh change that up
yes it's uh so for those of you who are
maybe a little bit older older and are
worried and I understand being worried
about things I worry about stuff all the
time
part of the reason I invest in save just
cuz I'm worried right I'm worried I'm
worried I may be broke again right so I
save and invest I make sure make sure
that that will never happen again so I
understand being worried about taking a
big leap because it's scary right you're
going into something brand new
for you something that you've never
dived into and there is going to be a
barrier of entry that does exist but
when you compare it at the alternative
it's not that scary when you say here's
something that has a good opportunity
and I I believe I would be much happier
doing and here is something that I
already know I'm unhappy doing and has
less opportunity and I'm going to either
you're gonna stay with that or you're
gonna take a chance I think knowing that
if you're unhappy at where you're at in
life it makes it much easier to take a
chance like that's really all you have
to think about sites are apps built
while doing tutorials do you think I can
make a portfolio now that I think it's
alright yeah you push it to your github
or something
although the the portfolio items that
are going to be most impressive are
going to be the unique ones the stuff
where the stuff where you've built an
application that no one else built and
that you enjoy and you're going to
continue working on like my biggest
portfolio project is my youtube channel
it's because it's it's not only been
something that's unique it's also
something that I'm continuing to work on
to this very day and I'm it is is
continuing to grow and is continuing to
mature and so you guys have been in the
unique situation that for the last two
and a half years I've been working on
this channel that you can see me
scrubbing it up right just scrub it
there's been a scrub right and you've
seen me get to a little less scrubby and
continue to get better and continue to
evolve and like and go from having no no
experience right to oh I got a technical
writer job and I'm doing this I'm doing
that I'm very excited about it and then
going from there to a my first full
stack role and then recently to now my
front-end role and got to see me
building things and just doing coke
atomy tutorials to building projects to
now actually feel
feeling confident enough I guess I guess
this confidence thing to be able to give
you my opinion on things as I as I'm
growing and maturing in this field and
in this industry which is not something
that I was able that I felt comfortable
doing I've a couple of videos from years
like literally two years ago where I
wanted to talk about something but I
wasn't comfortable enough to put myself
out there and and doing things so all
you got to see was me sort of
monologuing through my code and now now
I'm much more comfortable to share my
opinion and you know my advice to a
degree I try not to give too much advice
I try to more so talk about what has
worked for me and share it with you and
why I think you should do it I don't
necessarily like people who give advice
for stuff that they have they haven't
done before or that they can't back up
with stats and stuff like that how do
you rate no rate the knowledge you've
gained from beginning your previous dev
job to now
well I've gained a couple skills some
very practical skills true for one I got
much better at a model view controller
architecture and working with angularjs
so as I mentioned that very limited
experience too I also have a lot more
hours of coding under my belt I went
from being able to do this just after
work to be able to get paid to do it
during the day five days a week and do
it after work on the weekends so I got
better with angularjs and using some
very specific angularjs plugins my
plugins but um additions such as angular
UI UI router being the biggest one so I
got much better with that framework I
also became a much better JavaScript
developer because I was writing it
covered all the time and I was studying
outside of work and and I wanted to get
much more much more familiar with the
documentation of JavaScript one of the
issues with being a self-taught
developer especially web dev because a
lot of people are CS devs are some
computer science grads and they they
don't get most of the time don't get too
into JavaScript and everything going on
in there and so they might be more
familiar with Java C sharp C
occasionally so one of the issues is you
do have some gaps in your knowledge and
I'm and I think it goes for any field
but I think maybe web dev especially of
self-taught developer so I spent time
going back and and reviewing
documentation so that instead of doing a
for loop I'll do for each loop instead
of you know getting more comfortable
filter and map and all these array
methods and string methods that exist
and just making sure that they are in my
toolkit so that's one thing I went on my
way I also got it uh much better at wire
framing I did do some wire framing at my
previous job whereas doing technical
writing but not as much as I did at my
my my previous previous job at mine as a
technical writer I did more I did
wireframe but not as much and in a
different fashion than what I'm doing
now or what I was doing previously so
the company that I also got uh some
experience working with testing using
karma and jasmine so these are things
that I to be honest didn't even know
existed really
I knew the QA but like I knew they had
QA but I never actually written a test
so I got more familiar with testing and
that was great so I started picking up
karma and jasmine and as I mentioned I
was showing a one of my current
co-workers well I was showing one of my
current co-workers that specific thing
yesterday and that's something that I'm
using at my current job but I got
experience from that at my last job
another thing is I got familiar with
angular material which is kind of a Java
Script and and stuff it's a style sheet
and I'm like component library for jump
for angular and so I got familiar with
that which is Google's component and
they and architect component library
sure have JavaScript will just say
JavaScript to CSS library to do things
like multi selects and searches using
angular material I also got familiar
with PHP and I had taken maybe ap
free course on coke Adam e and done that
here actually went through and I'm
building the back end in PHP and I'm
using that and I'm I'm connecting to I'm
using CakePHP framework as well
zombie I became much more familiar with
PHP and I'm writing front-end and
back-end code and connecting it from
start to finish doing that I've also
would say that I got better with my
sequel though I'd done some my sequel in
college and touched it probably a year
and a half at that point so I got much
better with databases in terms of that
and an architecture so as I mentioned I
I've done some architecture I at at my
at my previous job as a full stack
developer you were kind of because of
the set up you kind of had leeway to
architect your own projects this is not
how it works in large companies there's
an architect and very senior architect
who's making I'm sure buku bucks and
their architecting your projects and
you're kind of following the guidelines
so in this case I kind of get experience
in the fact that on a smaller team you
can architect your own project so you
also I also had that ability
another thing is be more comfortable
working with other developers right up
until that point the majority of my
development 99% of it is me one on
myself one on one I guess there by
myself coding so one on one one of
myself that's weird very today I feel
like I'm doing something nasty so I but
the bulk of my coding is just myself
coding right there's no additional other
than active ons there's not really any
any pair of programming that something
has changed up quite a bit I also got
more comfortable with frame the
libraries like bootstrap 3 and more
comfortable with build tools like Bower
and gulp and grunt and all that sort of
stuff
so a lot of a lot of I also picked up
tortoise skid which is a good tool so a
lot of different tools and practical
skills in this last year learned and
that's just what I picked up on the job
now in the meantime over the year not
only did I continue to study and get
better
and I I picked up in my free time I
started working more with node Xpress
MongoDB Mongoose I also got better
solving algorithm so I their code fights
and and learning more about the
documentation that way so in the one
year that we're talking about that I
worked at my previous job I've picked up
quite a few skills and quite a few quite
a few not only skills but quite a few
experiences that have made me a better
developer so let's see here can I please
explain MVC MVC is an architecture for a
project and what that stands for is
Model View controller so you can think
of your model as your data that's kind
of how your object to start so a lot of
times you're manipulating data right so
let's say we have this data object the
view is where it's displaying that data
that be the front-end and the controller
it's the logic so that's like where your
JavaScript is that's sorting what's
gonna do what so the models kind of your
data the view is where it's going to
show like your your template your HTML
and then the the controller is your
logic what's your take on frameworks
like bootstrap or foundation are those
two something where they are pursuing is
there demand it's one better than the
other Thanks I would say bootstrap
probably more likely use boot chat for
if you're gonna start with bootstrap I
don't know too much about foundation I
can tell you that pretty much every I
see bootstrap on job apps more than I
ever see foundation but yeah I mean
you're gonna use it I use it in my
current work I've used at my previous
work it's worth web applications are
interesting because for the most part
you're just gonna style with bootstrap a
lot of times and then down the road
you're gonna do some custom styling I
feel like depending on the type of
project now if you're in a social media
company or you're you're at a company
that's you know it changes I guess it
depends but in my experience it's been
bootstrap or something
it's nice to sort of pick up coke Adam
ePro intensive for $199 do you think
it's worth rs6 free online resources I
think that you can't trust coke Adam II
I think that their their previous from
their previous things that they've done
a lot of people haven't liked them and
they don't let there's no ratings on
them you take there's basically copying
you Demi's program and offering you a
bootleg version which is fine I have no
problem going to a bootleg version but
wait till they're rated and people see
it because from a word-of-mouth thing
and for what I was reviewed it's not the
exactly the same thing but I reviewed
they're similar like online boot camp
for like five hundred dollars and it was
awful it's just awful and they were
misleading people and they've lost my
trust goes to that and so I would say
wait until there's actual reviews for it
and then consider it now if you want
something in the meantime
check out the you nanodegree program
because I can recommend that and it's an
awesome program and they're killing it
it's really a very good program I can't
recommend that it's a little more pricey
I got mine for three hundred dollars
from his on sale and I think if you've
got if the flat rate ones are five
hundred so you may you may get it but if
you do month a month
I think it's 150 or 200 dollars it
depends on the course but they also if
you do the pro version guarantee you a
job or your money back
so something keep in mind but at least
they're they have a proven track record
I think like all their things are like
4.5 rated or higher and and they're
constantly improving it and I'm very
happy with what I've seen in the react
program thus far cook gave me a free
cooking for JavaScript doing both men
that's the truth juda both AI do video
wireframes I should this would be an
easy video to make and and I know you've
asked this for like I feel like a year
now Jordan and I haven't got around to
it but I'm going to yes yes I am I'm
going to and I'll do it this weekend
that'll be a nice little project for me
I have a I have a couple web apps I want
to build and I can kind of showcase how
I'm going to to do that with wireframes
alright guys we've been going for a
little over an hour I want to thank you
guys for sticking through me well why we
were kind of figuring out why my voice
was going all all all deepest so it's
been a pleasure and a privilege if you
guys are interested in any of those
health books I was talking about whether
it be the mindfulness the essential oils
stretching and Paleo diet chakra healing
is definitely not this one right so
vegan all that stuff there's a link in
the description it's a limited time
offer from our boys at Humble Bundle and
you can help me out in the process and
choose if you want to give all your
money to a charity so you're gonna help
some some good or you want to choose to
give it all to me that's also great
right
so whatever it works out for you but I
like to I like to leave my livestream
with a little bit of a little bit of a
final thought we've we've we've we've
had some fun we've talked about some
things we've dived in a little bit I
hope I hope you've learned something by
the end of this and my final thought
thing that stood out most for me and
we've talked about my previous job and
my first week at work but the thing that
really stood out to me that I think
needs to be we need to touch on just a
little bit more is is feeling like
you're too late to the party right
feeling a little too old for the
industry or something like that
and what I'd like to say is I really
just want to harp on the point that if
you're unhappy at whatever you're doing
in life and you could even be making
more money than they then a software
developer but still be unhappy and you
enjoy coding and you this is something
for you and you're not just doing it for
the money
because those are the people who burn
now the people who just want a job and
don't really actually enjoy the stuff
and are just like it's a good career I
can do I'm smart guy I can do anything
and I don't really enjoy it but I'll
just go
get this idea out of your head that it's
okay not to be happy with your work your
work is going to take up a large portion
of your life until you're independently
wealthy until you are making nothing
that until you're making a residual
income that will pay for all your bills
you need to be very happy with what
you're doing and how how you're doing it
and who you're doing it with and I hope
that if you're if you are unhappy with
your job and coding is something that
you think that you would enjoy long term
I hope you do take the leap and a lot of
people are scared I understand that
right but when you think about the
alternative of being in a field that
you're not happy with or being in an
industry that there's no future I hope
that you you find what it is that you
need to pull that trigger and say you
know what it's scary
I'm doing something I haven't done
before but I'm going for it baby and so
I hope you guys go for it and whatever
it is in your life and I hope you make
sure that you know life is short and
that you're happy don't stay at a job
that you're unhappy yet and figure out a
way to have a happy and healthy life in
the process whether that be you going
becoming a developer or if you're a
developer and you hate it going and
doing something else that makes you
happy so I don't want people just to be
developers I want people to to find a
job they they love and I happen to love
this and I think a lot of other people
will too but it's not for everybody but
