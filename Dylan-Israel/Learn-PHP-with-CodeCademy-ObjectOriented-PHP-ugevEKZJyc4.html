object-oriented programming part 2
object oriented PHP so we are getting
down to the last two bits of it and
might as well finish it up strong let's
see what's going on here so let's clap
time you want to define a class called
person and if you forget how do they
have the example right there because so
it's similar to other other race you
would create a new variable called me
and store a new personnel so cash money
now we're going to say equals new person
the morning segment submit and nothing
displays but we've created a person we
just haven't done anything with it yet
um in this case it looks like we're
creating some persons and doing some if
statements and this should all look
somewhat familiar I'm a person I have a
name I not dance cool so let's keep it
going and we'll probably recreate this
so check out the code that is right we
create two classes shape and square with
square and haired teen from shape
plasticware extends shape okay we didn't
specify the square has a size properly
but should inherit it from shape so
public has size equals troops because
what's happening is this is getting the
parameters from shape it's kind of like
a class within a classroom thanks to an
extent and then click complete the if
statement on line 18 by using the
property is exists property exists
method to check if square has sides
alright so we're going to say if
where and i believe it's arrow and its
property under solar fix this let's sit
here let's look at a hint ok so in the
property exist we need to this is
actually a what happens being a little
bit rusty and it looked at a PHP in
about three days but uh so we need to
put the object in there which in this
case is square and then we need to put a
string as well and we'll put as size C
so property exists works like this
probably exists object is the strain
then we can save and submit if property
exists square comma has size
there we go so to fix the string there
so this example we are going to be
overriding parent methods so we have a
class vehicle and a class function home
that returns honk honk so we want to
create a child class bicycle that
overrides all right so we're going to
say class bicycle extends vehicle and
from there we are going to give it the
public function honk sores a public
phone Shin Hawk and then we are going to
return beep beep ! don't semicolon at
the internet CBP and then we want to
extend or excuse me echo rather you want
to echo create a bicycle alright so we
want to create the bicycle first bicycle
equals me icicle and then from there we
want to echo out
icicle dash oh and this should say beep
beep looks like the code printed stead
of beep beep where did we go wrong let's
look at a hint here so class sub class
extends super class a class bicycle
extends vehicle
let's try that now there we go we had it
inside the vehicle class that was a
mistake so we need to have it outside
otherwise it doesn't work properly so
now you can see a BP all right update
your cone from the last exercise to use
the final key word for the honk function
inside vehicle note how instead of game
beep beep we get in there so what
happens here with final is it makes it
so as a they tell your parents might
have told you you're not doing that and
that's final the final key word in your
code to control it methods can be
modified by the class subclasses for
instance you want to use final to return
that it's basically so you can't
override the final method honk and you
can see we get an error here so which is
what we're supposed to get so we've
created a ninja class in this example
we're going to be using class constants
and scope resolution so we have class
person class ninja that extends person
so set a stealth constant two of the
string maximum so we're going to say
pulse stealth equals maximum in all caps
and then we want to echo it echo yeah
stealth so what's going on let's see her
specials constant models never die if
true let's see here using examples
instructions is the guy you need help so
in this case let's say if I guess ninja
so let go
all right I don't look confused about
what we're supposed to be doing here
note that const don't start with that we
didn't do that so still that's our
stealth we have that equal to maximum
and long we say if this is long will not
echo on
settle it wants to see oh okay well I
think you're supposed to echo out
stealth so it's Paris Texas stealth
function stealth constant so in this
case we're going to be using static
keyword we've created king class to
proclaim go ahead and call the / clean
method of using the static keyword
okay so static keyword lets you use a
class property or method without having
create instance of that class it works
like this so say we want to do a person
we can create the is alive say it's yep
and then call it without having to
create that so I let's see here so we
have proclaim and then we want to call
it so we're going to say echo King we
call the class like that then the I
forget the Terminator but clean right
now sorry yeah
person
kingly proclamation non-static king oh
there we go all right so we had to just
add static to it and now we got a kingly
proclamation so let's do it all
ourselves so we worked our way through
so we're in a critical a spokesperson
your then it should contain only a
single methods called say so functions
say take no arguments and returns and
that goes out there are my thoughts all
right and then create another class
called blogger and make sure to do this
outside of here else bloggers that
inherits from person
you know create a cons cats instead of
equal to 50 and then use the static
keyword and scope resolution operator to
call the blocks inherited same method
without creating instances of class so
we're going to say outside the class
logger say no I think I may have done
that wrong Oh non-static method person
dancer to create make that static all
right
alright let's see what's gone on here so
we create our class cool Oh public
function throughout the public all right
so there's our public function class
subclass extends superclass person class
myclass const cats equals 15 cool yes
where does the city's ascetic you
so see we want to use a static keyword
and the scope resolution operator call
the blogger and harrogate same as it was
that crane says hi supplier say
static public static function say and
then we want to do the same thing with
cats really we want to echo blogger bats
there we go take a little second but
mainly just syntax issues and that was
our second object oriented class in our
object oriented example of PHP not too
bad the final chapter of our PHP before
we go on to other languages it's going
to be a review of arrays and advanced
race so I look forward to doing that
next time guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
