little bit about impostor syndrome a
little bit about my experience with it
how I sort of overcame it or M
overcoming it and also just why it
exists in the software field I feel like
it's not nearly as prevalent in other
fields but it's it's it's pretty heavy
in the software industry and my belief
asked you why before we dive into it
let's give a little brief background on
imposter syndrome what it is impostor
syndrome really refers to at least in
the development world that you're kind
of faking it right you are you are not
really a real developer you have just
got lucky and landed your junior role or
maybe you're even looking for roles and
you're thinking you're never gonna get
hired because you are just not good
enough you're not up to snuff right and
you almost feel like you're
impersonating a real developer because
you're not a real developer and is this
something I think is pretty common in
software specifically but I think it
more so tends to go for those more
technical things right where you can't
learn the job in a week or a weekend or
two weeks right it's not like you're
delivering pizzas or bagging groceries
or faster than nothing wrong with that
but in those cases there's not a lot of
people feeling like they're impostor
cashiers they're imposter pizza delivery
drivers because whether you've ever been
a pizza delivery driver or not give it a
week give it two weeks you'll be
excellent at the job and you can't
really say the same for software
development because of technical skills
and and I'm sure this is equally true
when you have more other other technical
jobs that aren't just software
development and the other day I was out
to lunch with a co-worker and we started
talking a little bit about impostor
syndrome and and he has more years of
experience than I do and he was he was
around five or
six if I remember correctly anyways he
was sharing how his previous job was
first really ever had it was really
miserable and didn't want to be there
anymore and I asked him why he didn't
leave and he just said honestly I just
had like some imposter syndrome where
and he the way that he explained it I
really could relate it was that I
thought I had tricked them into hiring
me as a developer and I was just good
enough to keep tricking them and I
wasn't gonna go and be able to trick
another company and it's just classic
impostor syndrome but the way that he
explained it like that I really could
relate right where you're like I have
tricked this company into paying me
money to do this thing that I may be
decent or bad at not any it's it's it's
very relatable and I know I know for
myself I dealt with impostor syndrome in
the past and and still probably a little
bit in the present but overcoming the
bulk of it I think it's one of those
things that as your career starts it is
a confidence thing it is a realistic
understanding of what your market value
is as a developer and sort of just very
on a very pragmatic level taking an
objective look at yourself at your
career at your skill set and saying this
is what I've done this is what the job
requires I meet all of these things on a
grade of one to ten I'm an eight eighths
passing like and you just have to accept
that's where you're at and be happy with
it and not question every move you make
easier said than done but that that's
really what it is but I know that when I
was looking for my first developer job I
probably looking back on it now could
have waited and got a role or could have
got a role earlier and if I waited and
didn't take my technology trainer role
or if I applied earlier on you know
maybe I'm wrong maybe I don't fully
comprehend where I was at at that point
in time but I do think imposter syndrome
played a point in me waiting as long as
I did and when I got my first
as a developer I was the imposter
syndrome
I've always been motivated to learn
right and I've always been working on
the YouTube channel I'm trying to
continue my myself education the best
way that I know how and I can tell you
when I got my first role I was super
motivated because I was like I gotta get
it together
they don't know I can't believe they
hired me and I gotta make sure I get up
to speed right and he was very stressful
it was definitely was very stressful and
the whole time I was at that job I never
felt like I was behind I felt like I was
doing a decent job for the most part
once I got up and running but I still
had this impostor syndrome going on
where it was kind of and this could also
my specific case stem for the fact that
I don't have a CS degree and and you
know that's that's one of the things
that I I think may would have maybe made
me feel a little more confident in
myself because again this is a
confidence thing this is a a being able
to understand what your value and worst
is and that you have value and worth
right and and if you don't which is hard
you know I'm 30 years old right and I
this is something I still struggle with
right I'm fairly new to the field I'm
starting my second year as a developer
and you know my third year in the
industry so I fully understand and a lot
of people are getting started much later
in the industry than I am so for me
though it's it's always been a
confidence thing and sort of and one of
the things that boosted my confidence
and how I sort of overcame the bulk of
it because there's something I was
worried about all the time right you
know a lot of times people who are super
motivated working really hard they're
working really hard kids are really
worried about something in their life
and you know it's for me it's always
like Oh am I just want to make sure I'm
good enough to be here I want to get
better I want to be the best sort of
thing in and I just want to make sure
that this is for me and people you know
I think just get lucky with that one job
right and so when I actually was looking
for a second job
my second developer job where I work now
I had one thing that really helped with
the imposter syndrome was just seeing
that companies were interested in
interviewing me
I had numerous interviews an online
in-person phone interviews and a lot
more than I was expecting
and then on top of that at the end of
this whole craziness that goes along
with looking for a job I had three
offers on the table to choose from which
really for me kind of helped chip away
at a large portion of that impostor
syndrome because it was like not only
did I get hired once before I now have
three people who are willing to give me
jobs in writing right so not like yeah
we like we really like you doing and
we'll get back to you know actual actual
hard offers that had turned to down but
that was something that really for me
chipped away at a lot of the worry for
me a lot of the am I am I too am I good
enough right or have I just tricked one
company in and eventually you start
playing this number game where how many
companies can you just be tricking are
you just a trickster of all time right
or you can just trick four companies
into hiring you if so good for you
but I I tend to lean towards the fact
considering I work at this every day and
study and all the stuff that I'm
actually becoming a better developer and
that I belong in in this industry and I
am not actually an imposter but I know
another thing that boosted my confidence
when I was looking for work and kind of
chipped away when I was looking for my
first developer job was I would see the
candidates that they would interview for
junior level roles for the front end and
I would see them fail solving basic
algorithms on the whiteboard that I
could solve and see their resumes and
and could just and that I guess what I'm
saying objectively speaking that I was a
better developer given what I had seen
of a couple of these candidates and when
I saw a couple other people who I
thought I was a better developer than be
interviewed that was kind of the another
thing that helped me that's that's
pretty unique to me I would say cuz not
everyone's gonna be able to see other
developers being interviewed in bombing
but that is something that does happen
and it is really uncomfortable as
someone as a developer who has bombed
interviews I can tell you that the
interviewer is uncomfortable the
interviewee is uncomfortable and
everybody if there's anybody else in the
room it is uncomfortable and it is a
awful situation so um about a common one
unfortunately so when it comes to
imposter syndrome guys I want you to
really think about what it is that you
are scared of what it is that that you
are afraid of is it are you afraid that
you can't do your job and if so are you
doing your job if you are you can kind
of very logically and that's really what
it came down to for me was kind of
logically thinking about hey what's my
job my job is to build software am i
building the software yes
am i struggling yes do developers
struggle of course they do
are you junior developer yes does that
mean you usually it's expected that
you're gonna need help sometimes for
senior developers yes let's just start
breaking this stuff down and realize
like hey you are a developer you're not
imposter maybe you're not the best
developer in the world but you are going
to be getting better as you progress
through your career and as you work hard
right there are plenty of bad developers
in the world and you you could very well
be one but if you're working towards
becoming a better developer you're
probably not a lot of the bad developers
they they already have two three years
experience under their belt and they're
done learning and they're just gonna try
and get a job with whatever knowledge
they have and never get any better and
that's it that's their choice to make
but I think from in terms of imposter
syndrome really just evaluate yourself
where you're at and think logically
because it's an illogical thing most of
the time where it's just a confidence
thing where you have self
out in yourself because you're in a new
environment a new world it's very
technical and and it's it's overwhelming
to a degree and but it is familiar
amongst and I think when you talk about
this sort of stuff and we have a
tendency as as developers as men
specifically not that women can have
impostor syndrome but this specific
point as men to not share our weaknesses
right not to share our faults not to
share what scares us as men right where
society has groomed us to be strong
burly men we don't we don't cry
we don't have emotion stone blood or ice
in the veins or whatever whatever stupid
analogy you guys give on saying but a
part of that is having open dialogue
with maybe some other developers about
impostor syndrome and as I did the other
day with with some of my co-workers at
lunch and and a lot of times what you
realize is it's not just you and you
feel that makes that makes it that much
better it's like hey you know this is
kind of common thing and when you don't
feel like you're alone you start being
able to look at it from look at it
objectively
you might be able to overcome it a
little bit easier so I hope that you
guys I know it sucks right it always
sucks it's never good to lack and
self-confidence or and it's it's hard to
to just tell you to be more confident
and I'm not trying to tell you that but
that is what needs to happen but maybe
perhaps look objectively at your
situation as a developer and what it is
that you're trying to accomplish and
what you have accomplished and looking
at how the market maybe respects that I
guess based off of the fact that you
have a job and that you can get a job so
it's it's rough out there it's never
easy to overcome the issues of the mind
as much as the body it's always hard the
hardest thing for you to do is to hold
yourself accountable and to treat
yourself well and so this is one of
those things so I hope you guys if
you're suffering from imposter syndrome
just try try your best to look at
objective
and if you're working hard you'll know
you're working hard and you don't have
anything to worry about so thank you so
