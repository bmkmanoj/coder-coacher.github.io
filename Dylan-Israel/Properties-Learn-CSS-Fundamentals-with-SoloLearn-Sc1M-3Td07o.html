back in CSS let's two properties jump
and ride it second let me open my drink
so introducing the box model I think I'm
gonna learn to shit-ton in here and I
hope you guys do as well let's see a sex
box Mona was pretty important to
understand you can see it in the
debugger as well if you're inspecting an
element let's see if we can show you
what you're gonna do when you're
actually so let's go ahead and select
something and you know what there's a
whole lot going on in here so if you see
right here so you see the box model this
orange is basically the margin then you
have the padding and then you have the
content itself if we easily yeah enough
of that but that's basically the gist of
it you have a top part left part right
part and bottom part
Alex chit I'm guessing it goes let me go
back real quick so it goes top right
bottom left okay there we go
understanding the box model to calculate
the width and the height all right
according the box well every element on
the webpage is a box okay
that makes sense I guess so you'll see
we have the width then we have the
padding on the right which is a box
around it then you have the margin
around the padding and so on and so
forth
so the background color of content also
color covers the padding and margins I
believe it might just be padding yeah
all right I think I messed up there
there we go
it's just the padding the height total
height of an element counts the height
of that plus the padding plus the margin
enter the total width of an element in
pixels it's a width is 150 pixels the
left and right is padding is five each
so it's five on each side of the border
with this two so that's four the right
margins are five so all right so we have
ten ten plus four twenty four I believe
this should be 174 there we go
the border property so you can set
borders around things exactly like they
did here this one's five pixels it's a
solid border there's also like - borders
and dotted borders and then the color of
the border is green as well ascribe the
three properties are size color and
style
so you can also just set one property of
as as well such as border-style:solid
border width is two pixels so you don't
need a centum all with the border thing
you probably normally would though fill
in the blanks set the border style so we
have border style and then our : cool so
as we were talking about different
styles of borders you can see right here
there's a bunch of ones already built in
fill in the blanks said the border style
to elements so border soil solid border
width is 5 pixels and border color is
whatever that comes out to nice so you
also have a height and width you can
imagine is exactly what you think it is
its height how the height and the width
so we want to set the height of the dish
so that our width is gonna be 100 pixels
our height variable it's going to be
soap and we're gonna set that to 50 cool
alright so hiding with measurement so
notice how you can do a hundred percent
as well not just pixels see a hundred
percent goes across the whole width you
get high with the night are usually
expressed in pixels and percents minimum
and maximum size so you can do a minimum
width and a minimum height as well as a
minimum maximum height and minimum width
as well
so min - width and we wants it the min
width - 200px cool he also said the
background color or something doesn't
just have to be the body it can be
almost anything just do that its
background set the background colors
background - color is the name of the
property you can set it as a hex value
you can set as RGB value you can say re
BG RGB a and then light green as well so
fill the blanks background element with
ID my style so IDs are hash tags my
style and then we're gonna go ahead and
set this background - color to the
hexadecimal value make sure to throw
your hashtag in front of that as well or
if you're old-school like me the pound
symbol but I got told stop saying that
maybe it made me date myself so
background-image:url so you can set a
background image URL like this so the
way that works is it's a URL parentheses
then quotations and the URL where it is
the location where it is we all saw a
background image see here padding
background color white so you can do a
bunt you can go buying stuff as well
this paragraph has background image so
you can assign a background image to the
paragraph so the body we have an opening
tag and closing tag and then again we
have to set the URL like so good to go
background - repeat so so maybe
sometimes you have like a tiled
background or an image that you want to
repeat quite a bit you don't usually see
too much of this anymore this is like a
good like 2000 1995 thing that that
would happen where they repeat
backgrounds every once in a while then
you'll do something like that
so you'll repeat Y which will repeat
vertically only and then there's also
repeat X which will repeat horizontally
and then there's just repeat I forget
the value here anyhow
so we want to do background image we set
the URL
we wanna do a background - repeat she's
you know background - so repeat - why
it's alright there we go yeah repeat -
why sending the value to inherit when
you set the background repeat property
inherited I'll take the same specified
value as the property of the parents
element basically it's just gonna
inherit from elsewhere so if we want the
background to repeat we're gonna inherit
that from the parent class which in this
case is the body the values of
background repeat property except I
repeat no repeat repeat why repeat X go
back review and then Harriet there we go
background attachment well let's let's
review this the background attachment
property sets whether a background image
is fixed or Scrolls with the rest of the
page there's an awful name for
background attachment that things like
you're gonna attach a file but well I
know so if it's fixed the image isn't
going to move it's always going to be in
that absolute position
whoops you know the background
attachment values you have inherent or
scroll so if you scroll like so you see
the image goes above and isn't always
there the background tatra probably
allows the inherit fix and scroll
there's that I think by default it's
scroll I could be mistaken though if you
don't set anything the list the list
style type property so list style type
will basically let you set the different
asterisks you see the numbers a b c
zeros are 0 you have the squares and so
on and so forth list I'll type flies the
bullets and numbering is of the list and
then the list image and position so list
style image it's not something I was
aware of that's pretty cool I have to
remember that where you can actually put
these custom lists items in their list
style position specifies the position of
the marker box inside or outside so this
is inside out size the default value
which keyword is used to specify the
image location our image location
address for the list style image
property so let's go back I believe is
image style - position weight which
keyword is used to specify the image
location address for the list style
image property
this top position all right
this doesn't look list I'll image
property it's inside and outside
I don't know I don't understand what
they're asking here so let's read over
this room it's just this dark here the
CSS the result the cell position else
eyes default value oh I think it's
L Li is that what it's asking which
keyword is used to specify the image
location address for the list style
image property
what am I missing here gentlemen so
let's see the style position
all right let's see good a hand here oh
my god ul it's always asking for
you would
oh my god URL okay so I get it now
they're trying to they were asking how
to set the image for the for the the
list style image okay all right
something just didn't click of my brain
there the list style property square
outside none so you can do something
like that basically you can combine
everything that we did before list style
type square list opposition outside with
style image none go ahead and set our
position our square in our image like so
styling the table so you can also style
your tables border collapse and border
spacing so you can add some spacing
around your tables like so border
collapse property specifies with your
table borders collapsed into a single
border or separate as default borders
are separate we change spacing border
class order spacing there we go the
captions side property specifies the
position of the table caption we
specialize table caption top so it looks
like the caption it's basically just the
heading here caption position caption
side there you go so depending where you
want to put it probably bottom like soap
puts it on the bottom the empty sales
property specifies whether or not to
display borders or background on an
empty cells on the table fossil values
are show the borders empty cell are
entered hi the board is an MC cell are
not drawn so if we hide it and there's
nothing there it doesn't draw it out
okay that makes sense by ie Firefox hide
it by default that was ie and Firefox
the table layout property
so the table I out specifies the width
of table columns is calculated positive
values are auto then fixed it's auto by
default so if you do set it fixed and
the values exceed it it's you're gonna
have some awful stuff like this
happening auto is usually the correct
way of going about it
the default is auto styling the links
you can style links if you want to for
instance when you hover over a link it
turns red a hover there's also you know
basically just link visited meaning that
they've already visited that link active
happens once active so you see the hover
right here
what of what type are the link visited
active and hover selectors they are a
event type I believe is what that's
going for I just go back
let's see here
following our pseudo selectors okay I
didn't realize that was what they were
called
so apparently hover and all that it's
called pseudo selectors cool so you can
also text decorate for instance maybe
you don't want links to be underlined
used to be the case all the time I think
now not so much
rooms the borders with the emission
links I believe it's none customizing
the mouse cursor so this is something
that you rarely ever see anymore
okay interesting that you can do it so
you know you can basically set a
different cursor there's probably quite
a few the property is cursor alright so
do that properties cursor so you can see
all right here we have default which is
our default one that we're actually
using right now you also have the auto
crosshair
move so by Auto it looks like it's
because most the time you're just
copying text resize pointer all this
good stuff which one displays a plus
icon that is does it move across there
all right cool that seems like a little
bit of a odd one to name it wise
crosshair default value so basically
default value just shows you that you
have the arrow that we have fill in the
blanks to make the cursor appear as a
pointer on paragraph so it's cursor and
then we're going to sign pointer like so
not too shabby
and let's go into the quiz add the
patting value so that it's 10 pixels on
the top 15 pixels to the bottom so that
goes top right bottom left so that's 15
and then 5 to the right and there's our
15 how do you make a list of not display
bullet points
the style type oh you know I believe
it's none there we go and then fill in
the blanks background - repeat is how we
set the repeat function and then tech
decoration is underlined and then we
want our cursor here to be crosshair and
finally make the cursor appear as a
crosshair on all links on the web page
so all links so that'd be our anchor tag
and we're just a cursor and then we're
gonna set it to crosshair cool not too
shabby guys went over a lot of
properties a few things I didn't know
some terminology things that have kind
of little gaps in in the brain but I
hope you guys had fun I hope you enjoyed
