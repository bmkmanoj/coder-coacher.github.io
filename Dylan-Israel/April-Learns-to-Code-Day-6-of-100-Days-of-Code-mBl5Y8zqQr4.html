turn on the humidifier excuse me such a
lot of diffuser mmm looks like
everything's up and running how do you
need this gentleman can you oh this one
allows it to show up on the screen
that's all there's no other reasons have
it but they not relevant right now cool
so we got the chat up all right so let's
get going here that's okay
people show up uh one thing you're gonna
get yeah I'll let you know right now
baby one thing to get comfortable with
as a youtuber is that no one's watching
everyone every time they come in every
time someone comes
I know now working right okay Bert Oh
are your words all right um
so what have you been working on today
uh notes and are you starting my menu
from scratch on your portfolio project
right yeah my portfolios project so
that's what i've been doing i've been
reading lots of codes and descriptions
and stuff like that on a horizontal menu
so i feel like it's all new I was
actually writing in my blog for writing
in my journal my hundred-day journal
thing for this and I was talking about
how nervous I am about house how I feel
how like behind I am even though I'm
just trying I feel already really behind
so it's scary and overwhelming and I
that I'll pull forward enough where I
feel like I can actually start like
sprinting forward that would be nice
yeah it takes a while to get into rhythm
I mean you're only six days in really -
the three weeks of kind of prep work
well the HTML you asked me to lay out
anything in HTML I'm very confident that
I'd be able to do it without even
looking to references so I'm happy about
that that's what I mostly been working
on and code Academy so in CSS like I
pretty much know how like whatever HTML
code I know how to write I can have I
know CSS to back it up to at least make
it function or look pretty or something
like that
oh good all right so what we're learning
right now I'm like well this is the good
part is that's normal
so the you haven't really done any
coding yet javascript ABBA scripts the
coding part not to say that HTML and CSS
aren't important about JavaScript
sarkodie part it's your first real
language and oh you know what I get I
guess don't don't don't be afraid of it
sorry it's supposed to be hairy
but that's also why people get paid good
money because it is hard um I just don't
want to struggle with it that's I'm skip
it's not that I don't want to struggle
the things I know it's part of learning
but I don't want to struggle with it so
much to the point where I feel like I
can't do it well the good thing is you
got a boyfriend who's the coning God
sometimes then the coding turds
sometimes so it'll help you but all
right let's let's continue on with our
functions example that we've been
working on last time we were talking
about parameters and passing those in
and things like that so we have this
console.log a function remember we said
that we could have that we could pass
these are parameters they also can be
referred to as arguments okay so
parameters arguments all kind of the
same now we're going to create our own
function here called function with arts
and remember when we create a function
use the function keyword and then we
call it function with Arg
only pass in a couple parameters I'm
just going based off the instructions
here it accepts two arguments which is
two parameters we can call this arg1 and
arg2 it outputs the sum to the dev
console so all we want to do remember
console dot log will output that data
remember how we pulled up the inspector
and all that and so we can add these
numbers together so we have R 1 plus R 2
this will allow us to console.log with
two values and we can do this as many
times as we want because we're writing
it as a function
and so we can test this we can test it
by calling function with cards and
passing in a couple numbers
give me two numbers for me so 7 plus 9
is 16 and let's go ahead and bring up
the inspector and when we run our test
we get a couple things we're also going
to get our 16 so you can see that
everything is working we also know we
don't really need to see that for each
one because it's pretty straightforward
at this point now we're going to we're
going to be things are going to get a
little more complicated so we're going
to be talking about scope what scope
refers to is is how things run how the
order in which things go so your code
knows what's supposed to go before what
based off of the scope an example of
that would be if we declare a very it's
kind of like nesting and the farther you
are outside the nest the more important
you are the sooner you get instantiated
and the sooner your event happens so we
have this var keyword remember and if we
declared the scope here we said var name
equals Dylan and we wanted to print that
name in here that down here that would
make sense because it's in the same
scope as this and then but if we went to
down here and we just declared a
variable called of our name is still and
then we call it try to outside of these
bracket scopes without calling the
function inside I'm saying that the
inside this works because it's within
that scope
this is called a function scope and
variables get raised to the function
level which means like this goes to the
top of what's inside here and it can be
used that you're not getting it all
right uh okay so let's start with global
scope global scope means that you can
use the function anywhere you want a
good example that okay
isn't there already like an order in
which everything is processed yes and
this is part of that because it gets
more complex but scope is we've been
working with like one scope so far just
global and so in that case when there's
just the one scope it just goes line by
line by line yeah in just goes top to
bottom now it still goes top to bottom
you just where these exist this variable
it only exists within the fun one
function it doesn't exist outside of it
so if we wanted to write here say
console.log name we would get undefined
even though it's within the fun one
function because we never actually
called it we never returned it anything
like that because it only exists here in
the function scope while if we declared
it outside of it we would actually get
Dylan because this is in the global
scope so how would you call it
well this would be a bad example to do
that but like if we had it in here and
we wanted to get that name variable and
what we do instead is we return name and
then right here we would call to access
that because remember it's just a
function we can call the function and
then I'll output it so what would use a
specific scope for my way uh well one
things get messy and sometimes you only
need them in certain areas too because
we haven't been introduced to some more
advanced concepts yet but scope is scope
is one way that we that programming has
set up for your code to run in the
correct order
sometimes and things have the correct
values and usually it's separated with
brackets and things like that it goes
top to bottom but it goes by brackets
within the top to bottom so if you have
if we have in this case an if statement
which it looks like we're jumping into
right now if statements are it basically
takes whatever's in here and finds out
if it's true if it's true you done
what's in the if statement scope if it's
false you just ignore it
so nothing would happen does that make
sense are you so oh well I understand it
all
I don't know okay I mean yeah how you
hear what you're saying and it's very
English like so and so it's just new
yeah that's fine all right
so we're going to declare a global
variable now this'll maybe we'll follow
the example a little bit and it'll make
a little bit more sense so it's going to
be called my global and it's going to be
equal to a value of 10 so this global
variable because its global meaning we
can use it anywhere it has global scope
is like the top scope it it's available
to be used effort word now since it's
available here we can actually use it in
the functions because we've already
defined it global
good morning godless monkey and Heke
Knoll Eric welcome welcome so that's our
global scope so when we run this oh we
didn't Claire declare groups global but
because it's global these functions have
access to it you see how we're just
passing the variables in here my global
circle at my global my global let's go
ahead and declare the Bhoots global
oh excuse me so we actually do global is
the mistake global where we're sitting
equal to five now you'll see that this
won't actually be able to be added to it
because it's within the scope of the fun
one function and not in the scope of the
fun to function
that makes sense
because it exists here it doesn't exist
here yet okay but why does one call on
it then the second is statement uh as a
to show you that it doesn't work uh to
explain to you that's why it's called
huge global oh yes
you know putting spaces
please know that yeah so the point of
that was to show you that it doesn't
work but apparently they want you to
declare it outside to get it to actually
work does it kind of instruct you just
to do it within there okay
oh I see what they want to show you so
this is awful convention this needs to
be taken out so um you know we create
variables like this and this is in the
global scope and that's why I get so
global value there's another awful thing
that you should never do that we could
create oops global like this instead of
equal to five now you normally would do
this if you're reassigning the value
right there's no var keyword in it so if
this has never been created anywhere
else what's going to happen is it's
going to create it and it's going to
automatically assign a global scope to
it don't ever do this it's bad coding
convention but that's that's what they
wanted to show you and that will work in
here because we're creating this for the
first time here without a var keyword
and it's assigning a global scope to it
why would you want to do that because
you have no way of knowing if it is a
global variable unless as your code gets
more and more complex you'd have no way
of knowing it would just look like
you're reassigning the value okay those
right now we're dealing with fifteen
lines of code the we have about 50,000
lines that go to my current project why
you can't look through all of those 50
lines to see 50,000 lines of code
I've written probably about 15,000 of it
which is a lot and I could tell you
right now that I don't know the majority
of the other 35 all right so it gets up
there and you're working with other
developers they're not going to know
every line of your code as well alright
so local scope functions now we're
talking about global scope and then we
we're also talking about the scope
within here that's called local scope a
book called a smarter way to learn
JavaScript all right well I'll check it
out so declare hmm the clear local
variable inside my VAR inside my local
scope
all right so bar my VARs or move or
and so what's happening here is we can
when we call this function it's going to
print it out right we set it equal to I
don't know ten it's going to print that
number out however if we just call
consoled a lot of my bar he doesn't
exist in the scope it exists in the
local scope here why would you is it
just showing you that that's how it
works
yes
the is going on here
oh this area
silly directions you got to read them
sometimes alright so we've talked about
global scope and local scope and so the
local scope can get more and more nested
and global as always the farthest one
out so you can have more than one let's
go yeah now I'll show you an example if
we do an if statement and pretend
there's something in there and we create
a variable here called temp 1 and then
that exists for every scope that's
nested within its local scope so it's
local scope is between here and if we
had another F nested in it and another
if nested in it we'd be able to use temp
1 anywhere within however we would not
be able to use temp 1 in the global
scope or the temp or the the above it
anywhere outside of it essentially
that's on the same time William what
like you can have a close go and
multiple local scopes together yes
there's the way that look yes yes Oh
trying whew soup is more
I'm scared of the rest of that answer
well it's only that yes how cool so um
what we're trying to do here is it is
possible for both local and global
variables the same name however you
should never do this this is bad
convention whatever so here we have what
an idea let's reset this all right so
locally we could go ahead and create
this variable here called the same thing
as this and so what would happen is we
could set this equal to I don't know
jacket a sweater sweater sweater and so
what what's happening here is these are
both the same variables it's bad
convention but this one only exists in
the local scope here once the global so
technically they're different scopes yes
different variables yes well it depends
it is yes
so we've talked about how to return
return statements before I return a
parameter or an argument we've seen that
let's what is it on here times five so
we're gonna write a function that times
things by five so your function times
five why do you have to write it out and
then put the number what do you mean
this is write it down because it takes
in a o because we're creating a function
and then we're passing in a parameter
that we called them so in this case when
it takes in a parameter of five when we
call the function with that one
parameter needs to return 25 so return
whatever number we pass into it times
five that's what this function does and
so when we call it when you call
function excuse me we call times five
when we pass in a number five what's
happening here is we are taking in our
single parameter five which is the
argument known here or this is the
argument or the parameter whatever will
call it and then it's actually going to
return 25 that's what this is doing here
does that make sense
why do I feel like you know grass read
this way I'm grass it's just all new
this is what I always telling you why I
was like you know because I'm learning a
bunch of like vocabulary words that I
don't have memorized it and I don't know
how they work like I'm having a hard
time yeah internalize it okay fair
enough all right
so we've talked about this before where
a number returns a value right and
oftentimes we may store that into
another variable so you'll see an
example here they have changed num and
what it does is it takes that parameter
adds five to it and then divides it by
three so in this case that would be 15
right 10 plus 5 divided by 3 would then
return 5 so what we're doing is we're
taking this change value that we set to
zero we're now studying the equal to 5
and we're calling the function and that
return value is what it's gay I were
saying that earlier when we first
started streaming I was like I'm writing
a blog of all this and just like
yesterday was just so overwhelming and
then I'm going over the code myself and
it's just so overwhelming and going over
all this it's like I I learn a very
specific way so like I have to fill in
the holes and work with it and
hopefully that work or you know the
worst I'm just too stupid gather that
sounds okay this is this it's it don't
its strength what's going to happen is
we're gonna reprogram how you see things
and you're gonna start thinking a little
bit more similar to me at the end of the
day oh thank god at least I'll
understand you at some point that's what
we're doing right now yeah yeah bring in
the heat oh I got him with an incident
argument the other day yeah April hey
April's starting April and I were in the
car and we're really arguing we're
having a debate and she's like there's
no foundation to your argument thus it
is null and she thought she's hot
 him yeah he was trying to tell me
off about like oh well my watchers don't
think I overwork and I was like well you
know the comparison of how much they
work to how much you work we don't know
what that looks like so your argument is
undefined thus it's null watch it hey
big boy all right so anyhow uh we are
now able to return those values as
storuman variables and there's various
reasons why that could happen maybe we
actually need to pass this value into
another function to get another answer
nothing
hit the wall and it is true that's
instant all right want one example it's
take the calculator again so this is our
add function we'll say it is so we add
the first two numbers and then we divide
when we hit that divide we have to take
whatever number we it we have and put it
into a variable that we're going to pass
into the divide function okay okay so I
mean that would be a basic example all
right um so we have this process arc
number here and we want to do is we want
to take process this function this
variable and we want to get the value
that we're going to pass into it so
we're going to say process is equal to
the return of process argh
and we're gonna we want we want it to be
equal to two so in this case we pass in
seven I'll return to and so what's
happening is this functions running and
it's being set so if you're making a
calculator which you have to let all
variables of the calculation you would
set your code up in a way that it does
that okay so you wouldn't have to lay it
out by hand
you could lay out like a function where
it'll process it that way you would set
up a loop we haven't got two loops yet
but there's something called a for loop
and a while loop and what would happen
is that list that we had it would run
for each item that's in there until
there wasn't anymore
and then based on what it was it would
add divide multiply subtract so on and
so forth but up
you guys can't see it but the big
butterball is in Dylan's lap he's so
happy good telling us like he's he's
like laying up on his back hind suck he
feels like he's supposed to be there and
he's a little cautious at the same time
so he's just super excited to be in his
lap right now
normally he gets kicked out yeah it's
too hot just under my lap lately
alright um and he's trying to conform to
his lap as much as possible so that he
can stay sorry I'll let you stay for a
little bit my life um all right so
in computer science accusing affect a
structure assignment I captain our noise
we had accumulated you know if write a
function Nixon line takes an array a
number of vitamins arguments and the
numbered stay on the rhythm is first
time so theory all are add the number to
the end of the write that removed the
first on I Larry alright so what we want
to do the instructions here are we want
to we're taking we have this function
here
the instructions are we're going to take
in an array and then we're taking a
single number that we're going to add to
the array and then we're going to to the
end of the array and then we are going
to remove the first item of the array so
now we're going to have to use some of
those functions that we use and so so
the push-push adds it to the end good so
how would we add it to the array that
we're passing in we would remember this
is our tests our array
what you didn't finish the question yeah
that's a hell how it hi we're gonna use
push right so this our is our array
right when we're adding it okay when you
say our I'm waiting for you to finish
the word yeah all right so they're a dot
push this is how we would add it oops
this is how we would add it to the array
and what is it that we're adding the
item that we're passing in six yeah
let's say it was six and so we'd push
item so this gets added to the array the
end of the right now how do we remove
the first item from the array analysis
add the knot over to the other way then
remove the first element of the right
it's shift ships you like a thing is
already cute like quill cute and then no
pop removes the end godless monkey we're
trying to remove the beginning I might
it might be unshipped I always hear them
confused I don't often times add things
to the front of race it's unshipped if
you're trying to remove it
are you sure shift should just push it
over
you think it's on shift all right and uh
and what we want to do is return the
element that was removed so how would we
do that you want to return the I answer
them yes what's the point of removing it
that if you're just gonna return it to
see you what is getting removed make
sure it's working properly so I'm trying
to think about why we're doing this is
all and why's this all here example just
accept it all right
so we would what what would we do to get
this value we would set it equal to a
variable because just like a funk this
is just a function getting called on
something and so we could set a variable
or remove equals that and we could
return removed so we push the add the
item to the array we remove the first
item
one second I think you got me a cushy is
here on hon shift and shift alright it's
not your father I should know yeah I was
right it's shift so shift how does that
even make sense that's probably why I
find it ass backward there we go
so the the goal here was to add an item
to the array and you remembered that was
pushed good then we wanted to remove the
first item and we can do that by storing
the value in a and then we wanted to
return the value that we removed so what
we did here was we call the function we
pass in an array with an item that we're
going to add we added it using push the
array function push we remove the first
item using the array function shift and
then we stored it in a valuable variable
to make sure that we were removing the
correct value and we returned it
I'm just gonna trust you that is what
just happened it's it's nothing too new
there we're just kind of putting it
together now do you see so what what
what you're gonna get I understand the
shift part and yeah I think yeah cuz I
well this is the first time I've seen
and work together right yeah so this is
all thank everything that you're going
to be learning a free code camp up until
you get to the algorithm section is
syntax and how things work when you
really start to become a developer what
you're going to have to do is start to
figure out how you can take these tools
and now make it do stuff just get to
that part oh by the way can is there a
way to make flashcards for these things
slashers yeah
why do you need flashcards that's what I
want to learn you make your own
flashcards yeah would you guys want
flashcards for JavaScript because I am
building a store and I've been looking
for a unique item to do such a thing
because well the only one is the only
reason why I like flashcards is cuz when
I was in college when we had to like
learn massive amounts of information
within a certain amount of time to
either write a paper or pass a test and
I'm about to like go through all this
and then say algorithms it's like if I
don't have those internalized by the
time I hit algorithms I'm going to be
going back forth back and forth back
before that's part of it though I I
don't like that though I think it would
be easier and quicker to be able to
actually have those and be able to flip
through them myself because I'll know
where they are I'll know that because I
wrote them or I studied them I've had
them tangibly in my hands I'm gonna make
flashcards I hope you do I
know I'm good nothing s you it I just
haven't I I'm sure they're out there
they've got to be out there all right um
so we'll check out the book you did here
do you write the book down I like to
overdo it today what write that book
down that's all right I can go back
watch it yeah yeah a smarter way to
learn genius yeah alright so what uh
water bullying's you remember sure if I
cure false values now one thing mate not
to be confused as you it's just true or
false you don't use quotes with it
you did I'm just saying that that's what
they as an example here so it's just a
true or false value all right miss og
over here all this I don't know we
don't use clothes well yeah
all right so oh yeah it's just try to
ask you if you knew the author
all right so modify the welcome boolean
functions so that it returns true
instead of false when the run button is
clicked so here all we're doing is we
are saying return true is that true
yesterday's never wrote that has a good
sense of humor hey hi hi but it's good I
see now we're gonna be taking it up a
notch all right
Milo you gotta go buddy here you you're
too hot come on go on git no no come on
mama
well buddy wagon wants your lap amen
daddy's got to work all right ow
oh no buddy come on baby
all right so conditional logic all right
so now we're getting now we're getting
into a kind of a one one more step up
than where we were before if statements
if statements are called conditions or
conditional logic and what that means is
it only runs if whatever you put in here
returns true so if we were to change it
to like is it true it's fast we're
passing on a value so true if true and
true obviously is true right it's going
to return yes it's true and it's not
going to ever hit this so once a
function hits its return value the
functions don't it doesn't do anything
else i thoughtyou function
could just yes you but you have to call
it again what I'm saying is that if this
is true this will run but because it's a
return statement it's never going to get
to here unless it's false it's not going
to do them both what when would it ever
be false if we change this to false
that's why we don't have to do another
if statement because if it's true it's
going to hit this if it's false it's not
going to run that and then it's going to
return here okay all right no um I flip
a quarter if it's heads say hey it's
heads return heads if it's false or in
that case tails if it being tails is a
true statement return tails it's only
going to return one when it's a it's
only if an if statement it's going to
hit one or the other or hit it's going
to you can hit multiple if statements
it's the return that makes it only do it
once you can only hit a return once and
then we'll break the function now like
break the code but it'll exit you out of
the function and it will run on to the
next function yes it got it it got its
value you can only return the one big
papa um you're lucky you're lucky this
is a fun live stream video Milo or daddy
kick you out
all right buddy all right so let's go
ahead and work on our true or false
conditional function right now uh take a
full advantage I thank you
um I actually have a picture my love on
my myspace I couldn't believe it
really that's how long we've had this
guy yeah she's getting there man we're
moving fast and she's working on the
JavaScript stuff as well all right um
all right you just alright
yeah just come back in the lab for you
listen all right so we are going to
create an if statement that returns yes
that was true if the parameter was true
or no that was false so in here what
we're gonna do is say create an if we're
saying if if true run this code if not
don't and we're passing a single value
which is our parameter was that true and
in it we just want to return a string
this is yes that was true and then
outside of it we'll bright it right here
turn
now it was now that was false
all right does it make sense if this is
true this runs the cut the function
stops if it's false it checks to see the
value it's false nothing happens and
then it goes and runs that one a code
and the function is okay do these have
scopes and them - yes so this is the the
local scope is basically where your code
is when it runs and so their scopes
associated with it
their scopes for everything why do you
need the second return statement if it's
at the end of the function you need the
return statement because it's returning
the value now we could console.log the
value but if you we're not necessarily
trying to print the value maybe we're
sending it to a variable which is why
we're returning it otherwise we just
have a value floating around that we're
not doing anything with it so it's just
what they're asking in terms of this
exercise but their scope throughout all
of everything
alright alright so comparison with the
Equality operator so we're going to be
working with a lot of equals right now
so you can use double equals to see if
two things are the same one equals
assigns value and double equals checks
to see if they're equal to each other so
an example would be one double equals
the one is true right one is equal to
one now is one double equals to two know
it's false now all right so this is
getting slightly confusing so there is a
type and there is a value the type would
be something like string boolean number
all those variable types and the value
is what it's equal to
so with double equals all we care about
is the value so if number 1 is equal to
string 1 double equals equals double
equals the string 1 it's true does we
care about the value now if it's triple
equals there's another level up it's
checking for type and is checking for
value so that would return false if it's
triple equals all right and so same
thing with string is equal to so in our
example here we're going to return when
the val is equal to 12 so we want to say
hey if Val and so we can do this in our
if statement to get a true or false
value so it's not just true or false
it's evaluating that and returning a
true or false value associated with that
so if the value is equal equal to 12 so
if that's a true statement return equal
else return not equal
you should use continuously
double equal operator
or anybody
freshest see if it's something in here
yeah I'm gonna be wearing okay cool so
basically what we just talked about so
we were taught that the technical name
is that something particular to
JavaScript you do other language equate
numbers to strings it's the value as I
was saying this is something that's
pretty unique to javascript javascript
has always had a very unique way of
equality and variable setting compared
to most languages so if you're working
with languages like Java for instance
you actually before you even create a
variable you instead of creating like
var some variable is equal to two the
number two you would actually have to
define what type it is in Java so it
would be something like var and
depending on how large the number is you
would have it impact there's five or six
different number types and it depends a
like you couldn't you couldn't even
create an integer without you to have to
create VAR int some some some internet
name is equal to two and if you actually
said VAR int sum int name is equal to
two point one it would actually just
drop the point one off so on the the
types in JavaScript the type and value
system and JavaScript is very loose
compared to most languages that make
sense you lost me at Ian I use the
restroom then we'll talk for the next
ten minutes
yeah so it's not smoke it's uh it's a
humidifier and Dylan uses it a lot after
I got him hooked on it why did I give
you a humidifier that essential oil
diffuser yeah uh so I believe I was sick
at the time I believe I had the flu or I
had a fever or something and it was one
of the things where you're trying to
make me feel better and I actually
really just liked it at that point which
is rare excite I am like the worst gift
giver for Dylan so so hey this is
actually what uh what I should all right
we'll do a little story time so um one
thing uh that question is more what
programming language should I learn you
should learn JavaScript that's always
what you should um April since this is
I'll never forget this uh the vid the
very first gift
April bought for me she was super
excited about it and she was like hyping
me up about it for a long time right and
so she's like oh you're gonna love it
this is that and this is probably like
the first year we've been seeing each
other uh early somewhat early on and so
she's like she's like super excited
about I'm not I'm like getting all hyped
up and she's she's really you're about
it and and so I open it and I put on
like the best game face I was but it was
a set of like knives like a like a $40
set of knives I didn't need it because I
threw out his another one yeah she
didn't like the knife set I had I
thought they were fine and she's like
yeah now we can get rid of the ones that
you have six years later I'm still
hearing about this we should've
411's
they the night she got were too
they rested after yeah they were
terrible um if I remember what kind of
knives those were I think it was like
caveman or something like that stay away
from those but I was like I
already have a knife set why would you
and I know she we used to do a lot of
cooking and I know she knew that we I
had a knife set so what she when she
gave it to me I was she was just
basically telling me my knives are
here are some better knives
slowly all my stuff is gone I haven't
gotten better at gift-giving I got you
some kickass shoes she did give me some
kickass shoes there's another those are
expensive ass shoes but they were worth
it cuz he still wears them till this day
so I'm gonna blanket shirts Mark Harris
says I know JavaScript we're kindly
react yes for real yeah I got shirts
first so um the there's two courses on
code Academy which react.js I suggest
you take them and just start trying to
rebuild some of the free code camp
projects with it that's when when I was
learning uh reactants how I got started
she's gonna start buying me clothes yeah
I know that um so the only type of
clothes I do buy him are shirts like
screen DS cuz everything else I don't
know his taste it's hard it's hard being
this stylish boys let me tell you this
he has more clothes than I do that's not
true
it's true maybe money's like double what
I have and I don't know I get a lot my
sugar you triple my shirts are like
seconds every time we go somewhere
he buys a shirt and maybe pants look
pants where's my underwear than I do I
think we have the same
now but what I know get the out
here I wear one pair of shoes I may have
three by wear one you're crazy all right
so let's get back on guys it's supposed
to be a Cody Chou um what are you what
are you working on the next couple hours
this I'm just gonna go back and I keep
taking notes I'm gonna look into maybe
formatting some flashcards for myself
and I'm gonna try I'm going to just keep
going from where I'm at with the
portfolio I don't know if you guys heard
in the beginning but I'm I'm scratching
my whole portfolio that you guys saw
previously and I'm gonna do a new one
using more time
something that's more logical standards
standard less standard standard so I'm
going to be learning how to do the
standard what's it horizontal menu so
for my portfolio page and so that I'm
not too overwhelmed with my portfolio
page I'm going to break it up into
sections so first I'm gonna do my menu
and then maybe you know my backdrop and
then maybe put in the elements for you
know the placeholders for for those code
icons for the examples whatever the my
story is for it I'm just going to break
it into sections and not try to
overwhelm myself too much with it so
that is my thing and then
probably blog about all this how
insecure I am about it all oh yeah I
mean just it's not a lot I don't feel
like I'm doing a lot physically but
mentally I can feel my brain like
scrambling like I'm dreaming about
coding now so that's been horrifying
because all my breaks by the
process you gotta break some code to fix
some code you guys have any last
questions before you round up our one
hour session for the day oh by the way
if you want to support the channel I'm
trying to raise money for and to upgrade
our content to 4k so you can you can
donate you can join patreon all that
sort of stuff if you want to do that we
I'm trying to get a 4k monitor 4k webcam
all that sort of stuff so that we can
put out better quality and do that yeah
um but if you haven't already make sure
to join our Facebook page code Tech and
caffeine or Facebook group I should say
it's a link is in the description by the
way we are growing I don't know if
everybody here is a member or not but we
we were over 1,300 people right now we
enjoy most about coding so far baby I
would say two things uh I really think
coding is a miraculous discovery in fact
the whole discovery of Internet is just
been amazing for us Millennials
to be growing in it so I think I just i
watch endless YouTube videos about what
is the internet packages and you
know all the things that the internet
uses and how goes from one place to the
next and fibre and cables and where it's
all located in the United States and
across the world like the is just
amazing and the fact that like
you can manipulate it and talk to it and
integrate with it something that you
can't like tangibly have but it's there
like it's physical and we found it and
the shade is just so cool yeah we didn't
really find it as much as invented it
wasn't like someone left it and we're
like all this shit's great well I mean
you had to discover pieces of it and
then when they put it together and they
made the Internet I mean it pre-existed
we didn't just like make it out of thin
air the Internet ya know someone
invented it the military invented it
okay I guess they vented it but I mean
everything that is used to have invented
it was already there yeah okay all right
it's like saying hey the Anna Bob we
invented it but we had to find the atoms
and the bomb parts first and then we put
it together and made a Nana bomb it
wasn't like there is a bunch of raw
supplies laying around to make the
identify and very intelligent to figure
it out and be like ah I got it uh so
what gate could we do I use I used two
different ones I use the github desktop
application and I also use a tortoise
kit I like tortoise get better to be
honest with you if you're looking for
something to use I'd suggest that how
are you enjoying learning us April um
yes I was talking about this earlier
with the godless monkey that it's
overwhelming I I want to enjoy it and I
look forward to the day that I
thoroughly enjoying it with a smile on
my face perhaps when I'm making a check
after Cody
um no I I'm enjoying it because I know
what it's going to look like for me long
term and my future doesn't look bleak so
that's cool
I was supposed to press you I have
ever heard right now it was like
whew yeah I really all I heard is I'm
not enjoying this at all but hey it
may pay the bills one day so whatever
it's gonna look maybe I'll be honest
it's gonna take you a second to get in
the groove cuz yeah that's what I was
trying to say like it's gonna take me a
second to get in the group I'm I'm a
writer first so when you guys ask me
something I very deep and through you
know multiple directions and examples
and I'm all over the place because as a
writer I'm not just trying to be one
person I'm trying to be hundreds of
thousands of characters and that's just
how my brain is in general so that's why
I kind of geared towards writing in the
first place because that's just how I've
always been able to write so writing
like a nonfiction book with multiple
characters and all that's definitely
that's already in there so trying to
think as one person logically towards
one direction is going to be a task for
me so that's what I mean that's why all
these things are all over the place you
know so and that's quite I'm kind of all
over the place but I'm looking forward
to learning and being able to think in
this manner so that I can argue with
Dylan on his level playing field and
beat him you can try all right well I
did on that guys thank you for watching
see you guys tomorrow for day seven I do
a tutorial on get April opener there
might be such a tutorial coming it might
once this is your guys I promise a get
cut tutorial I've been holding off on
coding and kind of working other things
in the meantime but um they even know it
is it's version control version control
is where multiple people can work on the
same stuff and you
commit your files choose like a folder
and then you'll have access to the
change code I want or done and I've
access to what you worked on but alright
guys thank you for watching and see you
next time
John's Facebook group send me money on
patreon I'll see you guys next so long
and prosper how long and prosperous</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
