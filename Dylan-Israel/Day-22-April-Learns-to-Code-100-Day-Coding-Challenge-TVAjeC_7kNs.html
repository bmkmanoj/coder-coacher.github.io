in your mind go on as you think you're
so smooth okay so um what do we talk
about what you did today for coffee for
rich get started
all right well I did was it control flow
control flow and learn JavaScript on
coke Adam II so what we're gonna do
right now David um yeah I know I really
liked how Khan Academy broke down the
if-else statements and the variables and
stuff like that it really it really
added some structure to everything that
you've been teaching me so I think it
really helped kind of set it and sound
like I feel a lot more comfortable with
if else statements and else if
statements so cool so what we're gonna
wait here what we're going to do next is
Before we jump onto the whiteboard is
I'm going to I'm going to explain to you
what the point of a switch statement is
what it does and I'm going to just
finish up converting your code here and
I'll help you with any any places where
you get stuck so sound good now a switch
statement that's going to switch to this
real quick switch this
okay all right uh so obit code let it
rain
thank you thank you thank you alright so
um good news by the way do you want some
too good news today
no bye oh man it's your good news yeah
but I'm sure it means more to you than
it doesn't mean my wonderful love of my
life
mother of my cats is reentering the
workforce ladies and gentlemen they said
they said we're not gonna lose a is they
said it could never happen I said one
day she will be employed once again once
again boys
we are a two-income household tears of
joy and relief mean yeah we're she
starts tomorrow right yeah interview
today at 11:00 and check out panic up
nothing I assure ya got a call at 3:00
told I had to go do a drug test today or
tomorrow today preferably so I did and I
got a job by the end of the day yay
thank you
all right baby really for us yeah but I
am financially it's going to open up a
lot a lot of things for us cuz I'd been
holding off on some endeavors that I was
concerned are going to drain our
resources and potentially make us
homeless if they fail now we have
something to fall back on to I also
don't like being a one income household
in case something changes and when you
take those risks those endeavors they
may not pay off I encourage everyone to
take risks and things like that but
educated risk yeah as you can't rest
like if you're gonna be stupid at least
be smart about it yeah um so pick code
asked me what domain name did you buy I
bought two for my course you should get
a dev job no no no this is a office job
it's got nothing to do with development
yeah now it's it's just a sigh used to
be an executive assistant to a CEO at
the university that I worked at
previously in California and just
because I have five years already in
that field of work it would be far
easier for me to get a job right now
doing something in that field of work
than it would be for me to try and find
a job in something like that so
definitely in the future get a dead job
but right now for relief sake just doing
this yeah continue studying and all that
stuff doing the same grind that I did
all you are doing this well I would
imagine but in out before we jump into
is the two webs
I bought two URLs bit code one was
coders course.com
this is for those you guys who don't
know I'm going to make like a 10 or $20
monthly course where I add stuff to it
every month and I offer feedback and you
get one-on-one sessions and things like
that I haven't figured out exactly how
much I'm pricing it but every every
month I plan on adding the tutorials and
things like that layout so that's one
thing that I've been working on and I
bought coders course comm and I also
bought become a coding god calm I don't
know which one I'm going with I'm
leaning towards become a coding god calm
but I don't know yet
I've done some research about the
platform I'm going to use and whatnot as
well so that's that's one thing that
I'll be giving back doing so for those
of you who there's a few who have been
donating or those of you who have been
patreon subscribers I am a believer of
helping those out who have helped you so
I imagine since it's my course
that people would might get a free month
or two so yeah um let's talk about
switch statements we're talking enough
about
I think mine was attacking the treat bag
oh my god
one second mile is it we booked up we
got cat treats today because for those
of you don't know t-mobile Tuesday $7
off a $7 purchase at Petsmart so we got
$14 a free stuff and Milo is breaking
into the cat treat bags that we got
right now on the couch video yeah give
them something yeah reward the bad
behavior baby that's awesome and not for
us baby um ah come on baby
yeah coders course is a awesome name but
become a coding god has more personality
and is something more that I would like
to do and I can make a theme so I like
themes I don't know what I'm doing hell
I might just do them both and making the
same course just so I could have two
courses do something different each one
up anyhow yeah so um do you remember
anything about switch statements I know
I just got to this well we went over
this when we did the free code cam stuff
as long as I remember the name okay so
here's an example of a switch statement
a switch statement takes in a parameter
and checks done you put this down know
so a switch statement takes in a
parameter like so in this case grocery
item is papaya and then it writes a case
says hey in in this case I remember the
cases - was that part of the switch yeah
okay so switches work with really room I
really distinctly remember a case yes
and the process so essentially what's
happening here is we're setting up
if-elsif and an else except we're doing
it in different formats some might say
cleaner and so we're say hey is grocery
item in this case papaya right is it
tomato No
so it doesn't run the code here is it
lime no so it doesn't run the code here
is it papaya yes that's true so it
prints out papayas and we break on every
case statement to exit out of the switch
I love it I love it and then the default
well if everything else that's kind of
like our else so these are all these two
our else ifs and this is our if
essentially and so default
will print out invalid item that's
pretty cool
uh Joshua let me ask those questions
towards the end man oh I'd be happy to
dive into that yeah me too um but I have
very strong opinions about LinkedIn oh
really I want to hear those and yeah
okay so essentially what's happening
here is we're taking art we're taking
Orsay saying hey check this value if
it's this if it's this if it's this if
it else it's this so how do we convert
what's here to work here right and they
give you a little bit a hint so I'm
going to we're gonna stand up because
I've been sitting all day I want to
well you're the one that's going to be
typing in sandy as well so while you
weren't standing in heels all day over
you
does that work on that
okay my six-pack oh my head is broken
yeah
alright so Oh a hand alright so start
converting this this value here so what
let's go over her our if statement okay
Shh let me read this
you just said what it does yeah I like
to read
oh okay
okay so
you have any questions
I'm when it's asking me to make the moon
phase what is it called
the condition of the switch statement do
I need to keep this variable up here
because up here it has it so do I write
out so I don't I don't conform that into
the switch statement what I'm not
sure what you're asking
well let's let's get wait before you go
anything let's follow the instruction I
can't handle your keyboard around so
let's jump down instruction one that's
what I'm asking you
let's I'm going to read it let's
illustrate this by converting our
werewolf program to a switch statement
for now let's also delete the foggy
night variable so it doesn't fog up this
concept so what are we so why don't we
start by deleting I did no you did yes I
had stop you have to delete other
iterations of foggy night maybe look
there's one right here okay well I will
get to that no deed we're doing it in
order it didn't say that
they're a little Kevin okay now what I'm
asking you
it says moon phase will become the
condition of the switch statement now is
it talking about this or do I need to
make a switch name it and put the
condition when phase yes okay that's why
I was asking you it's not that hard
[Laughter]
sorry guys and I used to this massive
thing of a keyboard should I put that
down here
like a little tiny hands and I've always
had a little tiny keyboards this thing
is huge
okay then each moon face will become
each case the switchboard statement
checks for start by reading a switch
name it with moon phase as a condition I
don't forget to set the scope for your
switch statement okay but yeah so um
this last one would go down here though
right uh well you're gonna what's what
you're doing right now is you need to
write the cases so each one these cases
except essentially saying hey check moon
phase to be full check moon phase to be
mostly full check moon phase to be
mostly new and then else yeah right so
you're gonna start deleting this line by
line okay
now what would be a faster way than
typing this out major control seeing
things I don't know is it it would be
for me but apparently my keyboard is for
a giant so it's I'm messing up just
because it's so big and I'm nervous I'm
typing in front of people kind of
interview I'm a little frazzled okay
really bright goes here why don't you
use bright to exit out of the code yep I
forgot your coding dot baby my bad
goddess
let's get that gender right
do you guys see how like Nancy he gets
when he's not doing nothing just clean
it up are you asking for my help what
you want he's always like this yeah
oh I got it oh I see you're saying yeah
oh
oh this is not that
do you fault
break at all
alright so fix your cup
so
how am i doing man I'm exhausted be
honest with you uh exhausted this is why
no comment
oh let's see
okay let's illustrate my cry my face
would become I could just show this
which team Anthony Trollope sorry by
reading I wish I have Finland so you're
not even writing the correct syntax so
like that's the first thing it's all
needs to be what is wait like what I
can't even do this right now cuz this
they don't even want this right now
that's what how do i how do i know you
just you made you've made several
mistakes okay well let's start let's
start from the top no I'm trying to
comment these out no no you don't need
to comment about what you need to do is
you need to understand that you have
syntax errors oh you know what one giant
okay try reading now
good now where the rest of our subjects
are you scroll down and see what else
they have to say
they let you pass this those bastards
alright so you forgot a break for each
one of the cases what every case I have
a break
Oh snaps which all I forgot about that
good I deal in good i all right so
before we move on explain to me what
your switch statement does okay so it's
taking my variable moonface which is now
a condition okay and it's taking that
condition moon phase against all of my
cases which is full mostly full and
mostly no and now my moon phase is set
correctly to full does that have an
effect on my switch condition the
variable so what you're doing is the
variable you're checking that variable
so it has the condition where it should
affect yeah it's it's going it's
checking that variable and so you set a
case to get that okay okay so yeah so
it's taking that variable and in each
case it's saying okay full full yes okay
so console.log how break out of it now
if it was saying what mostly fold and it
would check break and then hit here and
then be like okay it's mostly full arms
and legs me I wouldn't hit the brake we
check it would skip it would then hit
check this okay that's my man
yeah oh good alright good uh no free
code can't look how many software it's
Kirk Adam II um okay
hey everyone Julia says hi why are you
like that
she's got stoned off of the catnip what
all right so
okay so let's let's jump into functions
let's review functions are quick what
what two functions do and how they work
break on default is a bit silly but
valid good to know it's good convention
to put break in there Kevin how am I
gonna it's optional this good commission
that's what you say it's not confusing
you're both saying the same thing in
different words my words are better all
right so Oh
C having a break in case is also
optional kevin says he's right but it's
usually not considered better to mention
and do you remember how to define a
function
yeah so
ouch someone leaves our shoes
function
and then we give it a
a name
give it an example what are we doing on
right now I'm just having you define a
function we're not going to actually
write it out give it give it to inputs
this will and then call that colleague
don't worry about the code inside of it
remember to do to me parameters Oh
other
okay now how would we use that function
we wanted to call it how would we call
it how do we call functions
you just write the name
I'm here to have something else whatever
how do we assign that how do we assign
the arguments to become the parameters
how do we how do we fasten and say this
is 1 and this is 2 how do we do that
function
close there's no equals we're not
signing value
we're just call me
so you just exactly had
I'm getting it confused with
and then semicolon
all this is st. all this the same is run
the function coin with parameter 1 1 and
parameter 2 2 in this case
amb
okay okay onion here you would put
return well you could if that's what the
point of the function was oh so you can
write other stuff in you yeah you could
just put console dot log and B will
actually send it back yeah
returns just calling them because
sometimes you used to return quite a bit
Hanako says i are their methods and java
very same functions in JavaScript yeah
some of them I mean they're not written
out identical but yes that's true there
are a lot of object a lot of
object-oriented languages or top-tier
languages in general you can do a lot of
the same things for instance there are
strings in Java there are strings in
JavaScript now there are numbers to a
degree in Java and there are numbers in
JavaScript now some of the functions
there's int in Java there's float
there's double and I'm probably leaving
one or two out but those are all numbers
as well and so they um there are
different types of numbers but and long
that's another one but they do have
sympathy that are similar like parseint
part string stuff like that
that you can use Congrats on completing
your random quote generator project that
sounds cool okay so what's the point of
writing a function
ah
to assess
why do we have why do functions exist I
should say functions are a thing because
they store blocks of code we can run as
many times as well damn it damn it
okay okay we're doing okay so functions
are reusable code is it all code
reusable no so say we have no functions
and all it does is one our code well the
thing is is no just now no this is
taking Rio so you can reuse the code one
time all the time but say we want to
call say we want to add a number the way
it doesn't know where to go to re-add it
every single time so here we define the
location and we define a storage
essentially we say hey that app how do
you know at that well add is a function
we run the function okay so in regular
code what you're saying is so like an
if-else statement that code is going to
have to be run through every single time
after every input stop no not
necessarily it's more complex than that
right but hold on a second
not
okay so my other part is for a function
because you can call the function it can
just drop down to the function that it
needs to run this call exactly so you
call a function let's say you click Add
on the screen and we set it up to call
this function coin it's calling it and
then it's running the code of Destin
this code yes so it's a little bit more
efficient yeah I'm a little bit more
efficient say it runs all your code it's
a lot more efficient and it may up
what you're actually trying to do let's
say your subtract logic is above your
add logic it's going to be 1 minus 2
before it does 1 plus 2 right okay um so
so we had some good questions we are on
day 22 Hanna codes asks about our about
the random quote machine the reason that
we use map thought float and math dot
random if I remember correctly is that
the way that I did the random Pope
machine we were generating a random
number between 0 and whatever it was 150
uh well I don't know do you remember how
many quotes I had for what the men
thought random so anyhow you get some
random quote you have an array of random
quotes and what we're doing is we're
generating randomly an index so if you
just do math dot random it generates a
number between 0 and 1 to like 12
decimal places but instead what we want
to do is we want to generate a number
let's say I went up to 10 random quotes
that I got I wanted to choose one at
random you would then generate a number
between 0 and 10 and then choose one at
random that's why you use math floor map
die random in the random quote machine
you want you to generate randomly the
index of the array of quotes yeah so any
questions about functions before we move
on to the function section
not yet yeah
did you want to read this description
about functions yes okay
it the random number doesn't assign a
number it retrieves a number so you
already have an array of ten values in
there and so you're generating the index
number you're going to choose out of
those ten values guy you could teach a
machine how to cook this is great
that's essentially what they say
functions are recipes yeah that makes it
really easy to understand for me anyway
you just build a body and then instruct
it to you know identify ingredients and
then cook
you know I'm not going to VidCon this
year because I can't afford the plane
ticket home
but next year I'm going to VidCon guys I
hope you meet me out there and I'm going
to be the guy walking around with the
essential oil diffuser on this shoulder
you'll tell me I have one on each
shoulder like pads those are the true
that's cool all right are you ready to
take a stab at it okay all right let's
give it a shot so how does this code
work here
how does this go so tell me what's going
on when we look at this so start from
the top
what's happening okay well obviously for
the first line we have a variable with
calculator on equals false
so just what type of variable bullion
boolean
bullion boolean Boyan fine go ahead and
say that sound like Oh what is it
boolean bouillon bouillon not bullion
bouillon oh yeah stop looking at the
chat I'm not looking as a chat I'm gonna
you through the thing okay so and then
we have a function this is our function
press power button is it taking any
parameters no it's not taking in a
parameter okay
so inside our function we have a if
statement and an else statement and our
if statement has our variable calculator
on when it's not set to anything it's
just on and so the consult law which is
going to print out calculator turning
off interesting so then it has
yes what is that let's see if same
insane when it's just the one that value
in there I don't know what is it say so
it's saying if true now
that means it could if it has a value or
it's not equal the value isn't false
that's what that if say so if true which
it's not because it's false yes or so if
it if it didn't exist at all yeah yeah
whatever so that's weird why would the
on be false because if the calculator is
on hmm you want to turn it off so
they're using the same bun for on and
off yes okay okay okay so what's this
one do right here what is this for it's
saying if it's not on if it's not true
it must be false thus or turning the
calculator on and we're then going to
set it to true so putting it putting
this variable in there as equal to false
turns it back on nice it true no its
setting it to false so I know I just
asked you what this does so right now
sorry I mean it to come at like you'll
say what's it saying if this is true
okay run our code right right and so
what we're saying is it's already turned
on so we are now since we press the
button since we closed already turn off
it's false it's off I know but that's
why I would run the else but if it was
true in the case where it is true okay
we're turning it off because it's
already powered on and we want to turn
it off so then we have just we have to
reset our variable to false so that we
it toggles back correctly and so in the
case that it says hey the first case is
false right so this is false meaning
it's off right so does it run this no so
hits the else and says hey we're turning
it on because it was false and now it's
not so we're turning it on and this is
how we turn it on essentially so when we
call it the first time
we are turning out and we called sex
time turning it off we went over the we
went over free code camp I went through
the J s section it didn't really seem to
click so now she's doing it on her own
and this is day 22 now now we're making
progress
yeah alright um sorry for the PDA haha
alright so let's actually get it in temp
I want you to four we we end here I want
to try and finish this page okay what do
you mean subscribe to the to the
objective so imagine you work at a pizza
restaurant and you want to write a
JavaScript program to take orders so you
don't have to write them out by hand you
can write a function to perform this
task start by writing a function name
take order inside of its block or inside
of its scope you want to print out order
pizza
we shouldn't be showing we be sending a
value that's all it is asking I know
so literally named in your function now
why is that you have actually I just let
you go no no no remember we have to
define our scope our block where the
block of code is gonna go how do we
define that good and what do we want it
to do
okay now why is that incorrect you have
syntax are somewhere in there where do
you have an error no that's right that's
right
romera functions we always happen it's
not saying that I have a syntax error
well you don't have a syntax error you
have an instruction here meaning that
you didn't type something properly so I
guess it would be a logic error so what
is different there you go
good job
every time I see the little things bent
over here I'm like that's all that's how
it is when you run your code at work a
larger level you like God please work
[Laughter]
guess you're not gasping for air you're
praying I've been watching Dragon Ball
super as Wallace attack on Titan and my
hero academia all three great animes up
I encourage you to watch all them how
did you get the lady to learn to code
what's your secret long dick style no
she just wanted to better her skill set
and I offered I told her hey if I'm
going to teach you how to code we'll
spend an hour a day for a hundred days I
and you'll need to code on your own
that's not going to be enough but I'll
spend one hour for a hundred day
straight because the hardest thing guys
is coding every day ah but that was that
was what I said she's she has seen the
success that I've had with recruiters
and things like that reaching out to me
and that was enough to kind of get her
go all right so
do you want to do you think you can
finish this next one out
this is using parameters I think you can
do it eight minutes you soon be getting
the hand of it
okay so here are the parameters that
you're talking about as variables can we
can set we can call if I'm shown for
example so for here we have the function
with the name and its parameter input
number right that's the parameter that's
the parameter okay and then for the
console.log it's going to put input
number times 13 which is interesting and
multiply x 13 9 okay nice so you
understand that let's look at the
instructions let's include a primer and
I take order function to make the orders
we log to the console more descriptive
inside parentheses of the take order
function atom parameter name topping
this is kind of like Pizza Hut yeah
stuff you guys funny as I was going
through all of this um oh I was starting
to understand how people made those like
random generators for I know your
personality type or we can guess your
age you know like is fine
alright so where do we actually put the
parameter when we in the setup right you
put the value you're okay okay yeah yeah
yeah I don't know what I was thinking
sorry thank you for reminding me
I was I was seeing it honestly doesn't
look great and I couldn't so wait okay
that's right
so now now let's sing a clue the topping
parameter inside the take order function
okay modify the console.log to
incorporate to interpolate the topping
parameter to print a string like this
what they want what that's saying is we
want you to have when we print out using
the parameter to say pizza topped with
bacon
so take order is going to take and what
our topping parameter so how do you how
do we pass in the parameter bacon to
take order
bague in here yeah
but I have to change the console box I
have the console on here yeah how do we
make it dynamic so that it says
regardless if it's bacon or pepperoni or
whatever it says pizza topped with
topping offering value so how do we do
that I would change our stream to look
like that um all right so order
Pizza with
um
no no no you need to use your parameter
how do we use the parameter that's your
function parameter is part of the
function so you don't need to call okay
so okay and Dom I forget does this get
quotes on yeah no okay
that's it right that's how every little
plus that Plus doesn't do anything oh
that's more thing and then how do we
pass in a how do we pass in an argument
and why is that incorrect obviously
that's not how you passing a break
are you have you pass in the string you
need to pass in a string you were
passing in a variable come bacon all
right and you have a very small syntax
mistake let's see if you can find it
nice to actually have a very small logic
mistake in terms of formatting
no give you a hand it's in your
console.log
are you talking about this no no you can
use either yeah
what do you run your code and see what
comes out
so is that the same thing was it for now
oh
yeah
all right click next and we'll continue
on on that section tomorrow
did I break it
alright guys so some of you asked some
questions
earlier I don't remember what it was
about it it had something to do with
LinkedIn um
as always you've been here on our this
is day 22 of our bull retype it if it's
important know old give us your thoughts
on LinkedIn so um as always I appreciate
you guys being here we're day 22 April
starts work tomorrow and she'll be here
after her first day of work and we will
be continuing on the coding grind some
of you may have felt that it was a
little unfair she was learning coding
and not working and maybe her grind
wasn't as hard but everyone's got a
different grinds oh yeah this is a high
rather at first uh but I think you'll
see now that she's working she's going
to continue on and we've kind of built
the habit or we're in the process of
building having a hundred days you'll
definitely have a habit I think I think
that what you're seeing in the last two
days is a lot of growth gathering doing
a much better job on the functions and
those sorts of things it's definitely
going to be a process to get her where
we need to get her but Oh takes as long
as it takes I guess my goal was for her
to kind of start algorithms by day 30
but I think that might have been a
little bit unrealistic so I'm pushing
that back to day 50
day fifty I think I can get there 5050
right if it and that's the 28 days away
if she can start solving the basic
algorithms on her own at day 15 I would
be fairly happy um fairly just failing
Joshua jerk-ass should high school
students start setting up their LinkedIn
for caught the college admission process
this is this is my thoughts about this
LinkedIn does nothing but help you and
so so that so why wouldn't you like
would it will it affect every single
college admissions process no could it
yes and because of that you should take
the time the 2-3 hours it takes to set
up your your application to look as
professional as possible to showcase
your skills in any way possible to
showcase your certificates to showcase
your clubs to showcase your projects you
should have your LinkedIn because you
know who probably doesn't have a
LinkedIn all the other people you're
competing against and this will make you
different and if it does make the
difference or it helps a little bit it
was worth your time and that's the thing
is it doesn't hurt you it only helps you
it and it is either neutral or helps you
in the situation so you should do it so
when you're applying to colleges first
go to their application process and do
all the basics that they require of you
then set yourself apart by going up and
beyond so that you stand out from the
crowd so don't forget your basics basics
or is important because if you can't
read and follow instructions guess what
all your outstanding achievements are
gonna look like okay this guy just kind
of does what he wants and it's up to
them to you know make that call but you
don't want to give them a reason to even
doubt the fact that they don't want you
or
to make sure that they do that's not a
bad idea Kevin to be for her to maybe at
the end of the hundred days try to go
into being a sort of a scrum manager or
project manager sort of thing it might
it might be an easier role tool and as
someone trying to get their foot in the
door and it's Grand Master
so in software there are there's
something called agile and what that is
is it's it is essentially the principles
by which you code software and so in
that there are several things like scrum
scrum is essentially kind of like a
project manager usually it goes hand in
hand but you do things like every
morning for 10-15 minutes your team gets
together and you'll say what are you
working on who needs help
blah blah blah and so typically you have
those morning reviews and then you'll
have longer every usually the average
scrum is the average yeah
the average conferring the terms but the
average cycle is two weeks and so at the
end of that you do you do like a code
route you'll do code review at the end
of the day typically the scrum master
will help assist with that but you'll do
you'll do a scrum of the cycle review at
the end of the the the two weeks as well
do that and you help basically
facilitate make sure the tickets are
going to certain people and who needs
help gets the help who doesn't need help
and it's basically your job to make sure
that the team is running efficiently and
the team is running efficiently and to
the best of their ability and that
tickets are getting done and things like
that and so the scrum master is kind of
and sometimes you'll get requirements
and thing and things of that nature but
scrum master essentially does that and
so it's a crucial part of large software
teams on a smaller team like mine we
don't really have one but when you have
ten developers five developers you know
20 developers you might start seeing
scrum masters and things like that it's
very it's very similar to project
management and it's something that you
can make good money in in as well near
as good as a developer you could make
the same amount of money I am right now
doing it and um yeah that's what I was
thinking Gus shouldn't that be a job for
the first time knows the most no this is
actually a people-person job this is for
someone who is very detail-oriented and
can see the weaknesses and the strengths
of the team I can do that and see how to
improve them I'm really good at that
kind of what I did for my last job and
so it helps that you have a software
background but the last uh company I was
at had a scrum master was very good you
have to have a strong personality at
times and she was very good very
confident and handled everything very
well in that factor and and uh she she
did a great job she didn't really know
software at all um but you basically
make sure you like sake so there'll be a
picture that your team meets it's
deadlines and requirements stuff like
that
so it'll be like a ticketing system that
shows and you'll you it will help that
you know software um
yes more it is more of a management sort
of position in the people management
position but it's definitely something
that you could maybe become a that you
might be able I could role for you maybe
at a hundred days from now and you can
get like certifications scrum master
scrum master and you can get
certifications and things like this but
have I seen the show Silicon Valley I
have but not this season if it's out
even yet so I haven't seen that the
newest season but yeah so scrum master
is also very important
and be a monster sort of you don't need
to be a monster
you just need to be able to have need be
able to push back that's all no you need
to be able to stand your I have a
different way of dealing with people
than Dylan does so we're always going to
have a difference of opinion when it
comes to managing people okay
are you doing we got IT are you gonna
lighten these things are oh I want to
see your teeth that close
Lydia ah they've been looking at my gap
two teeth for like two years they're
ready to see some straight ones hey
Jordan good day sir all right uh so that
was our our live stream what I what we
accomplished is pretty good we'll
continue on with it tomorrow your goal
will be when you get home from work to
finish the function section see god this
may be late yeah it is I love dinner
made um what mac and cheese but you oh
you're bad if it's mac and cheese or not
but I'll have something made and you
don't want me cook no cook please I
might rather be so there's four on I'm
carefully if I can burn the out of
it boy I'll eat it just as happily as
ever jig Nielson asks this will be the
final crash before we get out here Dylan
did you learn coding all on free code
camp how long from accounting for I
learned web development through code
kata me and free code camp I I got a job
I have a uh so J Neilson all these
questions I've answered in videos in
more detail so when I knew you're ready
good job that's in the ask a dev videos
but one thing is that I have I learned
web development all online on my own
resources but I had I was a computer
science student and I had been studying
Java in in college so that was that was
when I that is how I initially learned
to code although I I wasn't very good to
be honest with you I got much better
once I started learning on my own
through code Kadim e free code camp and
videos and things like that
I started just coding daily well that's
how I got that's how I got much better
um but in terms of winter no you're
ready that's when you can start building
projects on your own
I go into much more detail in the asker
dev videos yeah get this stuff done ya
ain't gonna be bullshitting me man about
a project taking six days when I know
it's twenty lines of code all
right
I'll be I'll be striking fools
down I'll be like bro do you I was like
bro you're gonna lie the coding god like
that you know lie I know all your code
uh uh um it broke got a I got a UH it's
all right it's either Office Coordinator
or office manager I remember that's off
of something any I guess I appreciate
you being here this has been a journey I
will tell you that and we're only 22
percent of the way there
we have 78 percent of the journey left
to go 100 days tiny eight birth Anna so
um I'm excited to see where it goes
because I think we've done okay for 22
days I think maybe I had unrealistic
expectations but I think for what for
where we are today where were you at in
22 days
I was stressed out yeah yeah that's just
out in college hating life so yeah the
 is this guy talking about um so it
was interesting um that's for sure sign
can I spend the night tonight and for
two weeks straight amen if you got the
money you can run a bedroom yeah um so
yeah guys I appreciate you being here uh
you want you wanted you want the final
thoughts uh final thoughts will come
another time uh I think I might do a
series called final thoughts or your boy
is being very passionate and popping off
pop it off is this the right terminology
for it I have a video of for me topping
off on college degrees the other day it
was 22 minutes of me screaming and anger
and frustration about the the what the
Pops begin yeah I don't know I I didn't
feel comfortable really semen cuz I was
like I don't know maybe I want to look
too hard uh she just started serious
popping off I would call it final
thoughts yeah I'm so I always call yeah
Jerry Springer although now that that
blonde bimbo uh Republican woman who
just got fired
Tommy Lauren does final thoughts I don't
wanna be sick oh she did she did oh she
took that from you she did actually we
we both took it from Jerry Springer yeah
yeah that's neither here nor there um
but I think you guys for watching if you
aren't already make sure to join our
Facebook group code Tech and caffeine
get all those great resources people are
sharing on a daily basis you get to see
dope pictures like this you to see the
coding god in his natural habitat I'll
show you I'll show you some of the fun
you guys I got in real close and was
able to get a shot for you
I should see what the if you want type
of animal looks like the shame I'll show
you let's see here
this is what the coding got in its
natural habitat over here so um anyhow I
uh I was like I think I thought I
literally have a mouthful of
macaroni a jig that I know but uh more
than just funny photos and stuff like
that
you get resources you know udemy courses
stuff like that um you know stay up to
date you know fit is a healthy meal
Rockpile it it's a nice organic buddy
yeah guys I appreciate you watching if
you haven't already link is in the
description join the the facebook group
code tag and caffeine if you want to
support me I have a lot of ideas for
channel for my channel I would love to
be able to go to VidCon and things like
that and if you want to support me and
you want to make sure that we're putting
out the best content possible you can at
patreon.com slash coding tutorials 360 I
appreciate you all being here we'll see
you tomorrow I'm about to pop off right
now uh you wanna you wanna lead us lead
us out there okay uh everyone code long
and prosper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
