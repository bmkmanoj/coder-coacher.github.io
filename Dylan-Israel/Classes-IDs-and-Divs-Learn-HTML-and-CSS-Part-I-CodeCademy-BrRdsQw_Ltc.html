gentlemen we are back in code calving me
doing learn HTML and CSS part 1 in the
organizing HTML CSS classes IDs and divs
it's better than jump in here so what is
a class a class is basically something
you're going to assign to an element to
take certain parameters certain
properties and display that CSS IDs are
the same thing as classes except you
don't reuse them IDs are specific and
and you only will use it in one location
and then divs are kind of blocks of code
blocks of HTML or stuff that organizes
your code and into a div I guess let's
go ahead and jump right in so we get an
example of an ID so you said ID is equal
to Botswana I guess we're gonna add a
div nested inside the first div so we
have our div here you'll see that
everything is nested within it our h1 h2
is essence in it we're gonna go ahead
and give an ID we're just gonna equal to
header - text we're not gonna apparently
then wants to worry too much about
understanding divs quite yet so I'm
going to kind of skip that part it's
gonna run this so now we've given it an
ID of header - text move on in our
previous sections we did learn about how
to set up stuff for elements now you'll
see this dot that means the class now if
you're targeting a header typically you
don't want to have a class and a header
be named the same thing but in your CSS
the way that we
are able to tell it tell the CSS it's a
that it's an ID is we put a hashtag in
front of the name so we're going to slap
hashtag header - text like so and that's
how it knows that this is an ID now when
dealing with classes similar to IDs but
you can use them multiple times so in
here we're going to change this ID and
set an ID we're going to use class and
we're going to set it equal to partner
it's going to run that
excuse me look now the difference
between a in the CSS the class and the
header are excusing the class and the ID
is we actually for this we go ahead and
do a dot for the class in the name so we
use a hash tag for an ID and a dot for
class so this was supposed to be partner
excuse me
why
Oh whoops there you had a class here
they already had some CSS I said scroll
down to here and then just put our dot
partner so it's gonna anything where the
partner class is a sign it's going to go
ahead and inherit these properties the
padding and the text align the margin
and the border - bottom don't worry we
haven't covered those properties yet
probably do that in a future section
so you can also do a couple things here
now what's what is basically showing you
here so breaking is the class this will
actually anywhere where the class has
breaking its gonna assign everything
here now if you wanted to only apply
certain things in breaking for
paragraphs that have this class you
would do P dot breaking now this is
class specific because as we as we
basically said before IDs are used only
one spot similar to how we were able to
put a comma between our selectors for
elements such as the h1 and the
paragraph tag we can do the same thing
with classes as well so we're gonna
scroll down here to take a look at dot
prompt and dot partner prop table
partner they both share the same text
align setting so we're gonna go ahead
and delete this property from from both
and now we're gonna go ahead and create
a dot partner comma a dot drop and we're
gonna set text align for them both here
it's just an example you probably
wouldn't do it like this for just a
single thing like this but it's good to
know that you have the ability of
setting certain parameters for both of
them like that
HTML or CSS can get kind of crazy once
you get into it the the basics of it are
simple enough the advanced aspects of
CSS get crazy
so you'll notice here that you can
actually sign multiple classes all you
have to do is put a space in between the
classes and on Herot multiple classes so
it's inheriting our book class and it's
also an area named the domestic class in
the example so this is a some really
good advice they have here when you're
when you're doing multiple elements that
are similar you want to kind of keep
them together if you're targeting
partner you're gonna want to keep
partner comma prop nearer than both and
if you're targeting partner in a partner
image you're gonna do the same thing you
want to keep everything as organized as
possible in your code so let's go back
down to the index today's shell will
have it we have a image in here let's
see here
here we are
what we want to do is go ahead and put a
div around this image around this block
of code excuse me so around the image
and h2 and the paragraph
so a div is basically a container so
we're throwing a container around it
so see here
so we're gonna go down to this div and
we're gonna sign a class here so we're
gonna do class and we're gonna sign the
prop class to it so it's two acts like
it has so it inherits that styling from
the prop class but instead of having all
these share the having all these
multiple divs we're gonna go ahead and
actually do a div around all three of
these to do something different so here
we're gonna create another div we're
gonna give it a class equal to value -
prompts and we're gonna go ahead and
close this after the last day of like so
let's go ahead and run it and now it's
going to run more the value dot prop
class around it so now we're gonna grow
back up and we want to put a div around
that so create a div we're going to
assign a class equal to main and because
we want to encase all of them we're
gonna go ahead and go down to here oh
excuse me
I don't think that's what's worked I
wanted to do the H tournament so this
goes on to basically say how important
is our and they are you're gonna be
using divs quite a bit to organize your
code all the time so just be be ready to
be pretty familiar with it all right so
we we learned a lot about classes and
ID's what you really need to take away
from this is that IDs are specific you
only can have one idea signed things and
classes are not you can have multiple
classes assigned to multiple things and
a little bit about the naming convention
and not even the naming convention the
way that you tell CSS that it's a class
is with the dot till CSS with an ID is a
hash tag we also learned about divs
being containers to kind of organize
your code and then do things with it as
well so you're gonna be using that quite
a bit maybe a little bit of a weird
concept when you're not too familiar
with it but you'll get the hang of it
the more you use it but as always guys
