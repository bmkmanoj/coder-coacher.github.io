take an opportunity to wish everybody a
happy thanksgiving i know the holidays
isn't perfect for everybody sometimes
people have good holidays at bad
holidays i really just want to wish
everybody happy holiday and share a
tradition that goes on in the israel
household on my dad's side of the family
so some of you probably have similar
traditions but if you are alone this
thanksgiving and you have no one to tell
who you're thankful to you can tell me
in the comments if that if that helps
whether it's a good holidays are good at
are bad happy holidays on the same so
basically what my dad does every every
Thanksgiving in honesty it's pretty
awkward for me we're not really like a
very emotional guy like putting my heart
on my sleeve sort of guy kind of
monotone at times and the reason I'm
like that just kind of like going about
my business simply been everything else
alone so um what we're gonna do right
now or what I'm gonna do and you're
welcome to do so in the comments if you
that if you'd like but I'm just tell you
two or three things that I'm thankful
for that's what we do every every
Thanksgiving and I thought this would be
a kind of a cool opportunity to do that
so first thing I'm thankful for is my
channel um the reason for it is it's
really helped me achieve some of my
goals when i first started my channel it
helped me get better at video editing
which helped me get my first job working
at ed I where I was a technology trainer
EDI is software company so it helped me
get some experience even though I wasn't
coding I was really really glad about
that the other thing that makes me
thankful about my channel is it
eventually helped me get my developer
job where I am coding and I really put
that all towards my channel now the
other things i'm thankful for are you
know to be to to have people around
specifically my girlfriend who is very
supportive and friends and family who
are supportive they may not fully
understand who I am what I do and like
me as a person but April has always been
very supportive and it's glad to have
I'm glad to have her around again it's
been a while since we've actually lived
together about 10 months and so now that
she's here and we're we're working on
each other and you know we start our
life in Florida I'm thankful to have her
back in my life on a daily basis I'm
also thankful for my cats some people do
very well in like with people I'm kind
of I I prefer to have two or three close
friends and that's about it i'm not a
very big people person and that that may
help hurt me in the professional world
is very good to be very like social and
things like that i don't really drink or
i'm not very social and so my cats are
got a lot of my interaction throughout
the day so as if you haven't noticed by
like the cat window that i have always
have a cat in here that I'm like talking
to Humpty toe hey buddy happy
thanksgiving we're going to give him
some some like fresh fish for all three
cats a little bit of fresh fish or
chicken breast raw chicken breasts for
the thanksgiving for their their little
kitty feast april and i aren't big on
our big on turkey so we actually treated
ourselves to some Lobster definitely do
whatever it makes you happy if your ham
guy turkey guy chicken guy don't
necessarily feel feel inclined to go
with the traditional I'm very big
believer of breaking tradition and kind
of accepting people who do follow it
while at the same time understanding
that you can live your life however you
want to live it and that this is my way
of living it I want to get some Lobster
i'm done with turkey I could I could go
the rest of my life without eating
turkey be honest the best part about
Thanksgiving is the food and all the
food is better than turkey like all the
sides whether it be stuffing with
the yams whether it be cranberry sauce I
really like me some cranberry sauce
whatever maybe I think that all of them
out beat the turgid circles just kind of
there is filler putting off on a tangent
happy thanksgiving i hope you guys are
having a good one and if you're not i
hope it gets better for you but happy
holidays all the same and if you're not
American you don't celebrate
Thanksgiving have a wonderful day all
the same and keep on keep on the grind
guys just keep coding every day and keep
working and eventually you'll get there

are trying to be keep working hard man
it pays off and I hope to hear some
success stories in the future so thanks
