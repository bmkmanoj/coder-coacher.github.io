in solo learn do doing the get and set
after we values a jQuery attributes and
content so when working with jQuery
sometimes you want to just get values
some attributes from the HTML in this
example here we're getting all the
anchor tags or a anchor tags attribute
here in studying getting that you're
getting the href which is gonna store in
a value and then we're gonna output solo
learner alert solo learn with that value
so things that are attributes would be a
class or source div and image our tags
or elements so right here you can also
set things so you before we're just
getting because we are just saying get
this now we can actually set this by
passing in a second parameter so that's
pretty cool if we want to change the
image of the file we are going to use
our jQuery selector dollar sign
basically and then we're gonna say for
this image go ahead and change it to one
dot jpg nice pretty straightforward if
you just want to get it you don't pass
in that second parameter if you want to
set it you pass it in the attribute plus
the parameter now if you want to remove
a class or remove an attribute you can
do that as well using the remove attr so
let's see here fill in the blanks remove
the boarder element of ID with text ID
text remove attribute and then we want
to remove border get in set content so
sometimes you want to go ahead and get
the contents at the content that would
be our inner HTML in this case dot HTML
is to jquery word for it sometimes you
just want to get the text so here you'll
see we have the text of our paragraph
it'll output jQuery is fun you can see
this right here
jQuery is
dah dah now when you get just the text
you're only going to be getting the text
of it so that that's the difference
between inner HTML and text if you get
inner HTML see how we have this for fun
bolded we're actually going to get that
HTML as well instead of just the text
which depending on what you want to do
is is slightly different so if we got
just a text here what we get back is the
letter P goes over it a little bit of
the same thing that we've been talking
about so fill in the blanks to change
the content of the markups content of
the paragraphs with the ID demo so first
thing we need to do is start target our
selector demo here which is hashtag demo
and then we want to change the content
so we're going to append the HTML here
which is actually going to output the
HTML as well now if we output it as text
dot txt this would be actually print out
the B's and we don't want that we want
it to be read as HTML so Val allows so
the Val mix it allows you to get and set
the values of form fields
so this basically will get the value of
name so you see our value here we want
to get your name we can go ahead and do
that with dot Val to get started let's
going to put this in order you need to
do your ready function or your basically
our document dot ready and then we want
to put that at the bottom and then we
will define our variable var t is equal
to the value of user and then we're
gonna go ahead and output that out as
well
so summary the following jQuery so you
have duck text on Val Val attribute dot
remove attribute all these are pretty
common you use it use these quite well
they're really the only confusing thing
might be Tex dot HTML just remember that
HTML includes the markup language so if
you want to get the input field you're
in use Val adding content you can also
add content so so far we've already
talked about we've been
preexisting content now if you want to
add content there's a couple of these
things you can use so a ped will add
something on to the end preppin will add
it to the beginning of selected elements
and then after inserts content after the
selector selected elements and then
before inserts content before the
selected elements so if you want to put
it in the beginning so prepend will do
that if you want to append something at
the end so what is the result
following the coding HTML so we have a
paragraph with one and we want to append
two so that's what's going to happen is
it's going to throw it in front of that
and so that's the - it's gonna be 21
then we want to prepend one it's gonna
be two one one depend really am I
mistaken
so we append a - oh excuse me
it's going to be so you append on the
end any prepend
on the top excuse me I got I got
confused for a second so it's gonna be
one one two there we go sorry guys get a
little loopy for a second you have after
before so before demo we want to go
ahead and insert this and after this ID
demo we want to go ahead and put that as
well so can you use HTML markup I
actually don't know so let's go back and
review this yes you can use HTML markup
you can also add new elements so you see
you can just go ahead and throw stuff in
there if you want so we're creating new
tech and then we can assign the text
value to it so this will create a new
div for instance as an example they give
you so you don't always have to have
content in there so we want to create a
new span let me do it like so and then
we want to append that span the ID and
append so we want to go ahead and append
that like so cool and module two quiz
now fill in the blanks to set the alt
attribute of the image with ID image and
alert the value of its attribute so we
have our image that we're targeting our
what's our selector and we want to
change the attribute alt to demo and
then we want to alert the value of its
SRC attribute so alert alert our hashtag
image and the attribute source there we
go the text method returns to text
content of the element including the HL
markup that is false does not return the
HTML markup and only returns the text
fill and to get the value of the form
filled with the ID name and set the text
of paragraph with ID equals the text of
our name dot Finley get the value of the
foreign field with the ID name so we
want to get the value that's not Val
don't forget your parentheses and then
we want to set it as the text as a
paragraph with ID text so first thing I
want to do is go ahead and target the
text and we're going to pass that in
finally what is the output of the code
in HTML so I have a paragraph with a net
a/b and there's a span and a P so if we
say the P and then spandex a what we
should have is we want to replace the
text of the paragraph then the span
within I believe we should have a a
there we go
and finally fill in the blanks to create
a new element with the text hi and
insert it before the element with ID div
so we're gonna credit variable called a
we're use our jQuery selector to go
ahead and select this div or create the
div we're gonna use excuse me to create
the div and we're gonna output hi and
then the demo we want to insert it
before so I believe those before and
then a BAM there we go
a lot of stuff going on in there really
what you need to take away is how to get
values how to set values that text will
get the text HTML will get the text and
the markup and then you can also change
attributes and things like that as well
that was basically what this example of
jQuery on you can see how easy that is
some of those things we were doing would
have maybe taken three times as many
characters to actually get that value so
it's really helpful in that way with
jQuery I like it a lot I think it's a
great entry level framework to use and
something that pretty much every web
development job will expect you to have
some some practice with but as always
