code we interviewed Chris Sean who has a
vlogging developer Channel
it's how I would describe it I I became
a fan of his about two weeks ago reached
out to and he shares a lot of cool stuff
I kind of really related to him and we
talked about how his channel got started
how he became a developer in three
months how his life has changed since
he's been a developer and just a whole
bunch of really I found it very
motivating and berry I found him to be a
very humble honest guy and I really
enjoyed talking to him I think you guys
will enjoy the interview as as well
thank you for watching code everything
what's up man hey thank you for taking
the time man yeah it's okay I I get to
leave work early there you know and uh
so are you you're working as a developer
right yes sir I'm a friend and developer
nice same here I do do a little bit of
back end but uh what what it what stack
are you guys working with um we're
working with my sequel but we're
actually think we're no it's not
actually it's already but happen we're
moving from my sequel to Moorea DB
because my sequel isn't really good for
expanding you know just our service so
my sequel can't handle what we do so
we're moving on somewhere DB now um so
yeah it slapstick nice so I uh I
recently so I get spammed with like you
know I'm sure you do too having sort of
a coding related channel credit we can
have different content but in the same
category uh-huh I guess I your channels
been popping up quite a bit for me and
so oh yeah yeah I get I get you on like
my home page all the time man so good
good job on that I hope and I've watched
a couple of videos in there they're very
inspiring why did why did you start
start a channel just after like what
motivated you we're doing we're doing it
right now man don't sweat it we're going
get away from my computer
yeah well actually had this I saw I
wanted to learn code and as I was
learning code I've got my main source of
learning other than teamtreehouse.com
was Cora calm it's a pretty big you know
well-known what website among with
developers and so I'll Google you know
what's the most popular language HTML
CSS sure they go back and for and then
and you know while I was learning I got
hired in three months and I decided to
share my story on Korra calm and
surprisingly within the span of three
weeks my answer on Korra got through 1.7
million views woo as if right now has
about 1.9 million views right now and so
that blew up and I realized while my
story can encourage a lot of people and
I decided to share the exact same story
on Korra on YouTube and that video what
happens that video actually um I guess
it's not viral but in the span of three
months about almost 40,000 years right
now
yeah nice right so so I I I love the
sort of vlog inspirational like I don't
watch too many of them but I like the
message I saw you gonna came came out
about haters who talked about that oh my
head said on when I say haters meaning
I'm pretty much a lot of the people who
watch my channel are people who do not
have a job or people who do not have
experience and you know so for someone
like myself I have someone that didn't
graduate from college I'm someone who
has wit had no experience in coding and
so not a lot of people would get a job
in three months like I did it's not
normal I'm really lucky to get a job in
three months and so one way I realized
that people could get the foot in the
door since a lot of people aren't
getting hired yet what is to internal
accompany and what happened is a lot of
people started hating on because when I
told people to apply for internships I
told them to do it for three and so what
happened is that people started fighting
I can telling me Chris you crazy what
are you talking about what why would I
what are you trying to say trying to say
miss lane and a lot of people didn't
like that I said then so what happened
is that a couple days later video three
people got hurt as paint interns but
they offered to work for the company for
free show they're willing to hustle dig
into a company and show their value and
so that's good advice no I typically to
give the opposite advice like I think if
you can get a job if there you should
work for it
but I do like the message of showcasing
that you're hungry and that that's
really because that's what gets you
hired as a junior developer is a
willingness to learn and a willingness
to be hungry and go after the role yeah
exactly exactly I'm actually looking for
an intern right now too so now how do
you have you how does your work evaluate
what intern is a right fit I think one
of the best things about the company is
that we don't care about a degree my
senior developer he doesn't have a
degree he he literally built our entire
system and he's self-taught now I guess
one party could say that his dad works
at Amazon his dad is like one of the
best programmers out there in regards to
servers because he worked Ramazan and so
he was his dad helped them learn to
since from a young age but one cut what
the kind of people were looking for
those who are hungry who are passionate
who already was interested in coding who
aren't trying to get into coding now
because I said there's an internship
available at my company so anyone who's
willing to do whatever it takes because
I'll tell you this when I got hired at
my company my technical director who
wasn't even a program it was better than
me and he told me straight up he's only
a couple days ago he said yeah crazy
sucks
we didn't really need you but you know
what because you're hungry and because
you got along with us we kept you and
now we believe you that you're
passionate because now I could do what I
do today yeah and and I know so there's
this misconception to people who kind of
negative
- dislike you have to have a computer
science degree to work in the field
isn't that and I don't have a cup CS
degree look so if you don't have CS
degree and here we are both working
developers and before this before this
phone call I just got a call from
recruiter like 10 minutes ago and it's
like they still they don't care that I
have a CS degree now granted you should
work hard and you know and and you're
gonna have to train yourself and promote
yourself but it's not the end-all be-all
exactly I mean it's it's not I mean
having a Duke career and not doesn't
honestly having a degree helps but even
if you don't you just have to work
harder but that's what I love about not
having me read because I get to prove to
the world no matter what standard you
set I'll still push through that barrier
you know oh yeah we don't have a degree
we have to work harder but that's what
makes making it
you've taste even that much better yeah
and I mean that that's that's just true
for life right like if you're gonna let
the things people tell you you can't do
sit and let it not let you not do it is
that for you give up you're not gonna
make it very far especially as a
developer because you're always gonna
struggle you're always gonna be learning
and you're always gonna be debugging and
you're gonna need to learn in web film
you need to learn technologies all the
time so that all is not the green thing
and not no one by the way no one dropped
out of school if that that's not the
message the message is is that it's not
the only option
exactly don't drop out of school I'll
tell you this if you had a young age and
you can go to school and you have the
ability the funds to go there go because
I'll be getting a job that much better
and you could get it how you've been a
higher paying jobs as well so if you're
in a position to do it I would suggest
to go mainly because getting computer
science degree or software development
degree bring such a great return of
investment that you'll pay off your loan
easily compared to other degrees out
there now what is your stance on boot
camps this is a question I like to ask I
work there for basically every one of
different skill sets and things like
that because it seems to kind of be a
almost an industry standard now because
there's such high demand yeah comes the
boot camps I mean they're popping up
everywhere not just that they're
extremely expensive on now I what I do
think is that boot camps can be
beneficial if you have the time to do it
but the
going through camp does not mean you'll
get a job right after you graduate
because I have people emailing me
multiple people emailing me where it's
been five months since they graduate
from a boot camp and they still didn't
get a job so I think boot camps can be
warfare they're actually quite a few who
can search on to sponsor me right now
and I told them I will not even mention
the names my videos unless it let me go
through it myself and see what they do
see if I'll help everyone and so I mean
it can be beneficial but honestly you
don't need a boot camp today I really
don't think you do I mean where to go
yeah and and at the same time like I I i
like boot camps i haven't been through
one but I mean you have resources like
free code camp which if you do that and
you treat it like a boot camp is
basically a boot camp and like I
happened to be sponsored by dev Mountain
they they gave me a little bit of money
every month and I can't do a shout-out
to them but I've also I've also known
people who have have gone through the
program one of my one of my buddies is
has a YouTube channel engineer truth and
you know so he he went through the dev
Mountain boot camp and you know he can
speak to the quality of the program and
so I'm okay promoting them and it's like
if it do what works for you but be aware
that when you do go to boot camps or you
do go to college you are going to still
need to be self taught because you're
gonna learn stuff every day exactly yes
now what is a is so how long have you
been a developer for um I've been a
developer for about nine months so I
just actually just get back into the
boot camp fire really quick okay now I
think boot camps are very beneficial if
you have the funds and the time to do it
if you can actually uh if you can
actually sell those my boss behind me if
you can actually had it's time to put in
6 months learn code consistently
non-stop and you're in the position to
do it then do it um it will help you get
a job faster than teaching yourself
again um look I'm very lucky I don't
know how I got a gentleman three months
I was very lucky you know so if you have
the funds and you can't do it go for it
but don't distrust in the boot camp you
have to do your research other because
there are some you know who counts out
that her really is a free money you do
not want to help you who are fake so I
do think that mountain is a good way to
go
I mean I've heard of that mountain I
checked out the stuff and yeah and like
not only do I have someone who's gone
through the program and but I've also
met the owner of dead mountain and he
seems to be very passionate and wants
honest feedback about the program and
like having me meet someone at the top
is there really is a trickle-down effect
to the rest of the organization so I
agree I agree
um yeah I mean the owner is important
too and gotta be cool I'd like to speak
to them sometime you never know but yeah
I've been coming for nine months
professionally
yeah right it's always that
professionally like how long someone's
been paying me to do this like
before that three months which is which
is nice and that's that's really
impressive too cuz I don't have a cs3
but I was to see a student and then I I
basically decided to start working and
it took me about nine months to get my
junior level role that I'm in at now Wow
so and I I mean I I consider myself
self-taught just because in in you don't
really learn web development and in a CS
program you learn Java and things like
that so I taught myself completely with
the fundamentals already had JavaScript
and jQuery and angular and things like
that off of free resources people are
like what books you I didn't read a
single book guys I'll tell you the truth
I still haven't opened a book right
today yeah I know I don't think you need
books um nowadays but I mean if you're a
book person go for it what so what is
what is what was your best resource when
you were trying to get started ah my
best resource people think I'm sponsored
by them I don't know why it's team
treehouse um I've tried you know
codecademy Kota Kenya I don't like
because there are no videos there to
help you learn that's just it's
text-based um I've tried udacity.com you
- he's pretty good
there's actually sponsored by Google
goober AT&amp;amp;T they invest in udacity.com
but for me just the quality of content
the community and being able to learn
quickly team treehouse was the way for
me to go it's funny that you say there's
no videos on code Academy because I've
I've actually emailed them say look huh
y'all need to hire me
and I'm gonna make videos for your
content already because that's what
you're lacking and I never got a
response and I tweeted at him and stuff
like that but it's because I think they
really could expand all they need to do
is every topic have a three-minute video
just like in team treehouse yeah I I can
honestly say that I know for a fact that
if they don't I'm sure that that's in it
works already but if they don't expense
having video tutorials in their website
they will go down
I mean shame treehouse is skyrocketing I
think I'm bringing them about 500 people
a month now you know Udacity is going up
there too so if they don't put a video
content out there I mean why is YouTube
so popular because it's video content
and so the quote Academy doesn't do that
I can honestly say they won't last so
much longer well what do you have good
content I think what they're there and I
this is a theory but I think they have a
bad they don't have really a social
media plan or they don't respect it also
cuz some of you guys might know this but
coke Adam II allegedly has millions of
emails and you know 30 million 60 ml
whatever their stupid number is yeah
allegedly right um yeah but they're you
don't know their YouTube channel I think
I'm about to pass it up myself like it's
like it's like 15,000 meanwhile you have
a site free code camp which has like
85,000 because they're making video
content and they're respecting social
media and III think invention it's crazy
like how can you have millions of
signups and like 16,000 subscribers on
YouTube exactly yeah it's kind of crazy
uh uh hopefully I'll catch up to you
soon
my goal is they get there within a
couple months hey you're growing man
because I how many subs are you growing
right now months cuz I ever thought I
looked at you like a week ago and you
grew like five or six hundred actually I
haven't really kept counting but it
looks like about a thousand subscribers
every three weeks right now there you go
you're growing it basically the same
rate as me I'm growing by about 1500 a
month something like that so III and we
always want to grow faster right like
it's it's never enough
tella making a full-time salary from
YouTube is not fast enough like
yeah it's nice I mean I like doing what
I do mean is because I'm I love just
speaking of people I like helping people
in general on the fact that I've seen so
many lives change within itself you know
I'm very humbled by that not many people
can say to do that there are a lot of
programmers out there that very
pigheaded who don't really want to help
people who say who think they're too
good to help anyone out there so the
fact that I get to do something like
this and even communicate with people I
have a discord channel right now I
started a couple days ago and it looks
like about five or six people are adding
to joining that channel every single day
community is growing and just making
friends from all around the world it's
it's the best feeling in the world
it's it's it's way better than just
clean yeah yeah it is it is kind of cool
to have kind of like a little community
of like people you recognize in your
chat or they you know they're sharing
stuff with you like a check this out and
it's just like oh man this is cool that
there's our people who are passionate
about saying you know coding the same
things I am and they seem to be enjoying
it because I think that's the hardest
part is kind of enjoying it while you're
struggling through it I agree that is
what hardest part so I mean I think
that's when you look back into why
you've been doing in the first place
because it is gonna get hard even right
now it's hard for me alone that just to
find time to code now because of YouTube
is where I don't even learn code as much
as I used to so now just for me to learn
PHP today I have to wake up at 5:30 a.m.
every day to either go to the gym we
learn code and I'll come to work three
hours early and study PHP from 6:00 or
7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and then code for
an additional seven hours at work and
then create YouTube videos after work
and then but it's it's that grind it's
that mentality that got you to where
you're at right and it's like cuz I I
have a similar schedule where I go to
work I come home and then I start coding
or I start doing YouTube it's the same
thing every day but you have to kind of
have that mentality to really be able to
teach yourself in three months or to get
a job after three months and continue to
learn because in three months you're not
gonna have all the skills and in two
years you're gonna have all the skills
but to have that mentality is really
what's gonna propel you I think that's
it I mean willing to sacrifice you know
willing to do whatever it takes
I know there are people who only like
for example including YouTube for me I
just want to help as many people as I
can and what better way to do it than
just don't come in my life every day I
don't have to worry about what content
to come out I literally just think and
speak whatever is on my mind on that day
now put together on YouTube put some
music on there you know yeah in this
hustle and the same thing with learning
code you know if you want to get there
like coding phase said it's a numbers
game
whatever man hours you put in is mounted
now as you put out but also depends up
the quality hours you put in - are you
really focusing are you just are you
really trying to learn right now are you
watching TV while coding it's it's
really just amount about what you put in
and that's what you get out of it and I
can speak for that from experience alone
when I start when I finally got hired
I'll put more time into coding than even
before I got hired I would not call them
you know is that they odd code five
hours they have to work until but now I
don't do it as much because I know it
pretty well now at least in the front
end aspect I think as a friend and
developer the back end is like the great
frontier like like am I ready to
actually go down that path quite yet I
want to I really want I key I'm begging
my technical director every day Kalin
can I can I start working on PHP can I
start building things I want to get
better I don't want to stay where I am I
want to be better than everyone else at
my company but that can't happen until
they let me work on back-end stuff so
the goal is for these next two weeks I'm
gonna sleep in like four hours a day and
I'm loading code PHP three hours a day
and so the goal of my technical
directors that have me actually work a
real-live project over the next two
weeks because of my company whatever
they're doing is that I've been working
with big companies I've worked with
Kevin Durant I've worked with you know
big nonprofit organizations that I can't
say and so it's cool to be able to do
that but I want to be able to create not
just a phone and a spec yeah I mean and
that that's also the next like evolution
of your career right cuz front-end is
just like 30% of the job so full stack
is like 60 and then you have only
back-end it's like 10 like but yeah
developer typically like this for you
know people who may be trying to get
into as a as a get a junior role is
typically you'll start as a as a
front-end developer but if your full
stack you'll go from there but typically
you want to start before
have to learn the front end most of the
time for the back end to make sense yeah
I agree
um also um right now what's big right
now a tech industry are full sack
developers a lot of times me even for my
company we don't just want something
Muslim shrinking or some home goes back
in the in turn we just took in recently
knows back in but he's willing he's able
to look friend in development quickly
that's why we took them in and so I
think that's really big right now is
that you don't just take off one side
that you don't become lazy just staying
in front in a bad game but you really
make it a goal to know everything
doesn't have to specifically mean you
have to know all the languages out there
but Noah's deck whether its mean stack
whatever its lamp stack whatever its
pancake stack you know whatever it is
just go all out of it yeah and and so
that's that's like a good thing to say
because I encourage people to actually
study things they don't use at work cuz
you're already gonna spend 40 hours a
week studying that so whatever you're
not coding in at work study that in the
off hours and hopefully it works out
with you as well yeah exactly
exactly I have a question that I've seen
your videos what is that smog that comes
out to the smog how dare you sir
now it's essential it's an essential oil
diffuser my girlfriend got me started on
it a while back and I absolutely loved
it man I encourage everybody to get one
it's basically just mist it's it's
smelly mist that I like really that's
funny man and I said like a aromatherapy
sort of stuff I mean you'd be surprised
how many people comment about that like
it's it's like a really intriguing thing
I guess that's pretty funny so it's any
any uh I know you say you're studying
PHP alright are you the type to do a lot
of side projects or is like you youtube
your side projects right it's
interesting because of youtube and
because um you know just I know a lot of
people in general a lot of people have
been actually been asking me to create
you know websites for them on the side
freelance projects but you know with my
job you know and I get paid pretty well
I don't need to do those projects for
example to people who shouts to me
asking me if they know if I can make a
website for them but yeah I just don't
have time for that right now
my
side-project my side console is you to
believe that by putting so much effort
in youtube and helping so many people
and making that my genuine goal that and
the good investment in return and result
of that that I will get paid back for
that in the future so that's why YouTube
is my side hustle right now but I do
make a bunch of websites a reasonable
day yeah I mean I okay I always have a
dream of starting a big side project but
they're so it's so hard to and with so
little time and you get people that
reach out and they want tutoring or they
want mentorship or they want you to
build something and like I you know I
offered a charger rate to do like
one-hour sessions but to take on full
projects oh man my guys it's tough it's
tough because because it's usually a
part-time job if you really take it
seriously yeah anything for one video
depending on how much effort I want to
put and I want to make sure all my
videos have good quality content it
takes about 3 hours a day one hour to
export it also don't know not including
vlogging so it takes up a lot of time I
think I put in about 20-25 hours a week
on YouTube alone and that's not even
cluding commenting on everyone's come to
my videos aren't responding to snapchat
Instagram Twitter email stick forever
they respond to because they had the
most detailed emails in the world it's
like an essay and so so yeah it's a
full-time job honestly man I I respect
the hustle and the grind and I I and so
it's so great to talk to someone doing
the same thing because it's like I feel
like Matt it's like it's great because
people are caring about your content
they're respecting you as a developer
but at the same time it's like man
I got two jobs basically I ain't got
time to take on this third yeah exactly
I know I know exactly what you mean but
you know what I'm actually considering
it because I'm building a show I'm
relationship with my subscribers or so
many people are asking me to make
websites now or I might just ask us
describe it help me out and you could
say quickly percent of it oh yeah health
and experience and I I've done something
similar where someone did it someone
couldn't afford paying what I would
charge hourly and so I had people I knew
who I would
take 25% and they would chart they
charge the lesser rate and ship its
event it's it's basically you get enough
that you start your own business like
yeah that's bull
I haven't said again you'd see my the
channel but my goal is a store my
company on the side eventually as my
channel grows and I'll use you to help
me do that so that I'm excited I mean
there's a lot going on I'm even under
works have you been starting my own
clothing line
to call devs life oh I like this so I
already have a copyrighted I have I'm
just looking for quality fabric and so
yeah I just I think there's I think
there's a big market for like like tech
clothing because I think there's not too
much out there no one doesn't know one
good you know gonna be the best I
understand confident I'm gonna be the
best and I can't wait to get into that
hey hey no no yes it's alright to to be
passionate and be like look man I'm
gonna kill it
it's alright when that happens let me
know I'd love to check it out cuz I
that's one thing that I like if you look
behind me I have three like coating
posters that from a company that does
something similar so I love that stuff
man I really did that's cool that's cool
man yeah let me ask you like how long
have you been doing a channel how long
has it been around uh so about a year in
eight months I would say officially a
year and eight months so it's been it's
been a bit of a grind Mike Michael was a
little bit different than yours so
Michael had always been to start coding
or to learn to basically reinforce my
learning and then create a video
portfolio that would help me get a
junior developer role and they
accomplished that and I found that at
the end of it
I'll making a little bit of money
growing alright and I kind of was more
passionate about it than I realized
so it's it's been it's been a long year
in nine months but it's been a very
pleasant year in nine months like it I
could have probably decided to give up
on it six months ago I'm been satisfied
but I was just too passionate about kind
of going to the next level the next
friend
here yeah exactly that's cool man that's
great how has it been of your company
has been it's a little stressful you
know uh you know I've had only two
stressful weeks I'm in one of them right
now that's uh yeah all right so I'm
actually working typically I work the
standard 40 hours a week but this week
I'm working probably close to 80 because
if this is we're launching basically
like our beta if you will so it's it's
it's game day I'm actually in 20 minutes
like on call essentially and so we're in
it to win it right now uh but yeah so
for the most part I got nothing but
great things to say about my my work I
love it they're paying me well it's the
best job I ever had they bought me
monsters that goes a long way for me do
it that's huge yeah make it a goal and
everybody I put up there House of your
monster and one I monster a muffin it
seems like it seems like you're working
in a nice workplace as well but looking
at the surroundings yeah I mean this is
my office this is code developers corner
in my channel um yeah I mean this is the
testing area here's my office as my
laptop my monster this will be my office
soon I hope
oh yeah nice man so how what were you
doing before he became a developer oh
man um before I became a developer I was
an executive assistant that's all right
that's all I knew I I'll see my the one
my weakest strengths or my weakest point
well weakest skill my life is like
spelling and typing and also that's a
rough weakness for an executive
assistant yeah I know exactly so I
googled every single day how to spell
something actually even to this day on
my company the clients get upset hey why
is there spelling and all these things
but yeah I was an executive assistant I
used to I used to be I almost became a
serve ready restaurant I
had the cheaper jobs I was in handy for
three months you know um so pretty much
I just did whatever it took to survive
okay I feel you man I was a student I
was a lyft driver I was a pizza delivery
driver I was a construction guy like you
got a week when you don't have any money
yeah go find some like so I completely
get I respect the grind man uh now you
don't have to get into numbers if it
makes you feel uncomfortable but what's
the page Oh from executive assistant to
developer quite quite a bit
yep um to be exact
Oh $15,000 increase in salary there you
go you know and I'm about to get another
raise and you know it's it's nice I I'm
not negative a bank account anymore I
don't have any more fees
I'm not eating living off cup of noodles
anymore you know that's a nice it's nice
I mean it's gonna get up there I'm in
California fortunately mm-hmm and I
paint a ring there you guys saving that
money and it's it's a surreal time to be
a developer because you know being
sewing demand but also going from being
like flat-ass broke clay I don't know
how broke you were but I was broke as
 and just being able to actually
afford things like actual food not some
company dolls right and then being able
to invest money it's a good feeling and
it kind of doesn't feel real yeah
exactly it's the best honestly I
remember I cried today I got hired I put
on Twitter Thank You tree house will
help me get a job in three months and
because I'm just thinking about it
man it's kind of crazy because even on
my family everyone my family's like
struggling and having hardships but now
I'm paying for their pillows I'm not
saving much because I'm helping my
family now
but the fact that I'm able to support
them the fact that my mom's no longer
hungry the fact that I can even get
married soon to my girlfriend it's it's
sort it's unreal it seems like it's not
supernatural but it seems like something
you never thought would ever happen
because I made mistakes on my way I
didn't go to college I didn't get a
degree I could help me get a job
lazying all I want to do is play video
games and so the fact that I get to get
out of that you know it's the best
feeling in the world and I know there
are a lot of people right now who are
watching there are a lot of people right
now who you know are struggling and so
just know that really code is the way to
go it's the future then I see it right
now and we need more developers my
company is growing too fast it's the
point that we sort of can't handle all
the clients would have any more stuff
and it's the best feeling in the world I
mean it it's nice Wayne like sometimes
we forget why we're grinding but when
you finally it finally pays off it is it
really is the best feeling in the world
that's why I like people are people some
people are like - right why are you so
happy it's like because I can afford
food man like I remember those days it
wasn't that long ago that I'm glad to
hear things are going so well for you
it's like even my family not people knew
that know this but I wasn't special and
I was most people who go to yellow bus
people are on the bus not been talked
down that's how they were called and I
was on that bus because I was born for a
deficiency I had a very slow brain or I
couldn't even speak straight sometimes I
stood in my videos and I try to cut it
off because I still have that problem
and I was one of the people that my
family thought would struggle the rest
of my life because I was really slow
next two months rather than one so I was
born three months premature so not even
with my family they were so amazing the
fact that I was able to succeed the way
I do you know I'm my brothers who got a
master's degree and I make more than him
now I'm doing you know YouTube is sort
of it doesn't matter where you came from
what you know if you were a worm in the
world if you came from dirt if you put
in the hard work if you have that
passion you'll succeed but don't listen
people out of it because everyone told
me Chris I'll try to go on coding you're
not smart enough
my whole family told me that the and
they stopped me making YouTube videos
walking under my cellphone like what you
do almost 3,000 subscribers so don't
ever listen know what people tell you
just go for it you know imagine how good
I'll feel to finally achieve what you
Dreamforce I really hope that all 3,000
subscribers of mine get there too and
that's what I really want more than
anything
yeah I'm excited I get you know if every
day Chris I got hired Kristin got hired
Chris got Sue and if he's what do i do
what do I do
so it's the best feeling in the world it
really is and it's you another question
yeah man eight and it's that's why
that's why like wente when things work
when it does pay off you want other
people to have that you're like I want
you to succeed
it's not like you're gonna take work
away from me or money away from me
I want us all to be like I want us all
to be at this place where we're doing
well and like code has done that for
both of us and I love that man yeah I
mean you know I you know even my company
may not be the best company in the world
but I'm very thankful for them because
they gave me they gave me a chance I
wouldn't have hired myself I know how
that it was I wouldn't have hired me but
they did and so man it's it's you know
beep I'm thankful but I can't wait
everyone watching right now I know
you'll get there too don't give up if
you have any questions hit up coding 360
yeah I mean find that motivation find
what motivates you guys find and
sometimes you have to maybe hit the
bottom where you're like for me it's I
always tell the story about how like
it's you know my mom brought me
groceries and like as I couldn't afford
food and my you know and that way it's
just like something that was
unacceptable for me and I that was me
I've decided to get serious for life I
stopped playing video games kind of same
right it seems to be a growing trend
where you spend it too much time for
games because you're trying to escape
for how up life is so you playing
its kind of eats itself but you have to
get serious and sometimes just say look
devote a hundred percent to the grind
and I'm gonna get there I don't know
when but I'm gonna just grind it out and
get there and it's gonna feel great when
I get there
and you have to maintain and stay
motivated man exactly man
I mean that's it you just if you know
you have to remember why you're doing it
true if you're doing a foot of money
just for the money it's hard I mean
everyone does it for the money but just
check it out and see if you enjoy it and
just imagine where you can't be
a couple years from now if not a couple
months so I mean you never know and my
life change in three months I went from
not even being able to afford good
medicine in health insurance so now
being able to buy the best medicine but
paying for the best insurance in a
matter of months because I was willing
to sacrifice I was willing to do
whatever it took even if that meant
sleeping less to get where I am today so
I mean that's how it goes nice now uh so
