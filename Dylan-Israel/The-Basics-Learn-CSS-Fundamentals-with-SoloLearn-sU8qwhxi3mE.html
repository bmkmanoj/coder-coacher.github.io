in solo learn doing six CSS fundamentals
I'm kind of excited about this courses a
lot of time CSS kind of just goes on the
back burner even though it's so crucial
I mean look at how many people have done
the HTML course and then how many people
have done the the CSS course you can
kind of tell from right there that they
should in theory be equal but it's about
1/4 as many let's go ahead and jump
right in
I'm actually pretty bad with CSS myself
so I'm excited to be doing this I feel
like I'm gonna learn a lot mainly on
every section of this viana so I need to
better I can't be a web developer be bad
at CSS it's going to take a shortcut so
the style conventions of selector
property and what we're just jumping in
there you go oh okay my bad we needed to
do the basics or in the basics what is
CSS CSS refers to cascading style sheets
use with HTML the style things control
the look and the feel of web documents
is how you add it all four-minute man
and can I should be removed from the
HTML document starts every CSS file so
in theory you want to not use the inline
styling or thirst aisle tax web pages
and web applications get way too
complicated to be doing things like that
so that's that's why you're gonna have
your own page it allows for the
separation of style and content very
clearly put and very well very well put
as well inline CSS what we were just
talking about where you can put an
inline CSS to the tag typically you're
probably gonna want to sign a class or
an item inline you don't really use that
so in line is just style to do that to
put inline styling you also use the
style tax si have here but again
typically your styling is going to
it's own prop a problem you're gonna put
those tags in the head when you're we're
defining things as well so you see right
here we're linking our file before we
had our style tag so we want to link the
raela stylesheet the href is test CSS
and then we want to close our head as
well for the proper structure cool CSS
rules and selectors so you have your
selector in this case it's a h1 then you
have the property and then you have the
value pretty straightforward this call
is basically equal signs if you won't
think it as variable so the selector
selects which element to style
there's types of selectors so you see a
red color red font size it depends on
what you're doing
so rearrange so things all right so you
have your selector then you have your
property and the value and then you have
your closing tag as well and then you
can use IDs and classes IDs are denoted
by a hash tag classes are denoted by the
dot so we want to have an element ID
with our background gives a fill in the
blanks gives a background color
element with ID intro so yellow so like
I said intro is hash tag dot is class
and you would not believe how often I
forgot that when I just started out if I
say that a lot is because I've said it a
lot for about a year or two before I
finally stuck in to me I had to stop
looking at what was an idea what was a
class let's see so you can kind of level
your stuff right so you can use the ID
and if the ID intro here that's what's
going on with this right here
yeah the ID intro if there's a first
class nested within our div or within
our intro and it's an M right here go
ahead and
violet like so as you can see it does
right here so you can nest your kind of
logic as well so I fill the blanks for
several belonging to element ID with
test so we have an ID that's test
so everything within tests it's a
paragraph tag we want to go ahead and
style cope so comments comments are
basically multi-line only so that's kind
of how that works so you have me a
little asterisk or a slash asterisk
asterisk slash cool cold you zoom in a
little bit it's cascading stylesheets
it's not like something dropped upon my
head
cascading stylesheets three main sources
of style information that form a cascade
are the author of the page browsers
default styles and by the user okay the
three different sources are responsible
for the Styles you see on the webpage
use your custom on selections if any
stylesheet created by the author of the
page it develops tiles to the browser
yourself there we go and inheritance so
inheritance let's read the technical
definition just so I can make sure I
understand inheritance refers to the way
properties flow throughout the page the
child element will usually take on the
characteristics of the parent element
okay so in our example here what's
basically happening is our body is we're
defining our body and basically
everything's within the body and it's
inheriting those values so the paragraph
tag is gonna inherit inherit the color
green and the font-family:arial because
the body has that set up now if we set
something in paragraph we would override
that all right what color does the
paragraph tag have so we have bought so
you'll see right here so body but my
dears red thus the div is going to air
the stuff within the div is gonna be
ready cool module 1 quiz from the three
types which one is the most useful in
terms of web's website optimization
I'm just going to external because I
think us right now there might be
something that's different where maybe
actually loads better on in line but I
don't think so with style and creating
an internal CSS so what is the style
when creating an internal CSS what is
the style when creating an internal
cascading stylesheets property I don't
understand I see this problem here is I
don't really actually fully understand
whoa what's going on here let's jump
back into here for a second
what is the style when creating an
internal cascading style are you said
properly tagged oh there we go all right
sorry sorry guys I don't really
understand what they're asking there if
somebody wants to explain that in the
comments below
that'd be helpful for those who watch
this to kind of learn style definition
role because it's a selector property
and value cool and last but not least
Phil and blinked fly color white BAM not
too shabby we've got the basics done of
our cascading style sheets we got six
more to go I'm excited for this stuff
down here because I really think I'm
gonna learn a lot working with text is
up next but as always guys don't forget
