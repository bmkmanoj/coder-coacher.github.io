talking about where to start in terms of
the front end or the back end when
getting started with web development
this is always seemed as a particular
obvious answer to me but I get it time
and time again which fly we're going to
talk about it because I don't like just
saying why you should do one thing with
that explaining why and uh TLDR front
end okay if you don't care about the
reasoning you can uh you know stop
watching the video but that's the tail d
higher version but why so why should you
learn the front end over the back end
even though even though the portions of
jobs out there are only 10% front end
25% back in and 65% full stack so the
goal should always be to be full stack
developer but why do I say start with
front end when you're just getting
started well it's pretty straightforward
at least in my eyes and other people
like Quincy Larsson have said that
which is why free code campus structured
this way why you should start with the
front end when you're trying to grasp
concepts that are abstract and kind of
logical and then really if you're not
used to thinking the way a programmer is
used to thinking you need every
advantage you can get at the end of the
day and one of the positive things about
about working with the front-end is it
gives you a unique perspective on how to
actually wrap your mind around things
because you can visualize it and you can
see it it's also one of the reasons that
I'm a big believer on those things like
algorithms which you may not visualize
as much or at all sometimes other than
the output but you can actually that's
why I suggest drawing it out and using
arrows and kind of seen how things are
looping and doing things and it's the
same concept with the front end try and
visualize it and the front end allows
you to that now in the back end its
you're still going to be using a lot of
code and you're going to be learning a
lot of
great concepts and typically it's it's
more advanced concepts which is another
reason why I would stay away from the
back end but the back end really at the
end of the day gets data sends data out
in you know does a few things with it so
your ear you're going to get very you're
going to get typically just a data
object or just a variable back and it
may be very hard or and not maybe it is
very hard for someone who's just
starting out to learn all these new
concepts and maybe not get the handicap
that they should get in terms of the
front end you'll actually see when
you're when you're developing in the
front end you have to connect with two
things HTML CSS and your JavaScript
right on the back end you you might have
to connect with the database so you have
another advanced topic you're going to
be another another item and databases
are much harder than HTML and CSS and
when learning you know no SQL or SQL
databases you may not know where to even
get started with the backend
technologies while in the front end it
it's you'll typically get the same
answer HTML CSS and JavaScript that's
the front end and then it gets more
advanced from there but what what you
can benefit from is knowing that there's
kind of a clear hierarchy of paths some
people like to start with JavaScript
before HTML and CSS and that's that's
okay um in my experience and for what
I've been told by subscribers and people
and people who've got started that way
typically what happens is they they
learn or they begin learning JavaScript
and then they say what what do I do with
this like what now what now what that's
why I say start with the HTML and CSS
because once you learn kind of the
syntax of JavaScript you'll move on to
Dom manipulation which you'll need to
know HTML and CSS and Dom manipulation
says for duck document object model and
what that basically means is that you
are going to do things to the browser
where like you click here on the browser
you click this button and now it does
something you hover over this image and
now does something that's sort of Dom
manipulation and it's
in bliss form and you'll learn a lot
more can I just not know but you learn a
lot more you'll learn different subjects
obviously front end and backing but when
something fails in the HTML and the CSS
you can you can tie it back to your
JavaScript very easily it's much harder
to debug in the back end and there's
tools for your front and back but it's
much harder to debug in the back end
generally speaking that is the front end
so if you're just getting started I
really encourage you to start with start
with the front end and then move down to
the back end once you feel comfortable
or once you feel like you've built up a
sufficient front-end portfolio and if
you haven't started that way and you
think the back end is a better way I'd
love to know your reasoning I don't I
don't claim to know everything by any
stretch of the imagination but I do
think that you'd be doing yourself a
huge disservice if you started in the
backend especially as your first
programming language a way in in
JavaScript you have the luxury you've
actually seen when your shits up
and I think that's a great thing too a
great thing that you should take two
advantage of but as always guys thank
you for watching leave me your questions
