classes introduction to classes this for
me is kind of where object-oriented
programming really starts so I'm a
little bit excited to start it
especially after that awful bitwise
operator section so if this is your
first time kind of working with objects
this is kind of how they work you create
a class and you know always Greco's but
in this case we create a class we can
give it some class functions meaning
that like functions that we would
normally call like that we've written
before these are class specific and they
have print each class has parameters and
for instance in this case we're we have
a fruit class so everything that may
have a fruit so the name the color the
flavor if it's poisonous or not and we
in this case we created a lemon object
of the fruit class with those parameters
and then we can do the description and
the is edible so it may be a little
little new if you're unfamiliar with it
but if if you've done any sort of
object-oriented programming before it a
lot of times it's just a matter of
learning the new syntax so we're gonna
create a class here called animal in the
editor and here we declare it an object
now in the body of your class use the
past keyword
okay so right now apparently we can use
the pass key word here just say just
ignore the fact that there's nothing
here yet which is kind of cool actually
so we're gonna remove the past statement
and we're gonna define it in it this may
be a sound a little weird but this is
basically initializing the parameters
we're going to put into it
hence the init pass it the argument
itself so self is kind of like saying
that this parameter is equal to this
parameter type of thing and then we're
just going to do pass here sing do not
worry about this quite yet
there we go
make sure you do double underscores
monster please sponsor me there we go so
past in its second parameter alright so
now we're gonna pass in a name parameter
so every animal we have is gonna have a
name in theory so we can take out the
past for the time being so the self dot
name equals name is to basically saying
that set this name equal to name when we
call it so it's just something you have
to do for when you'd work with classes
in general so outside the animal class
create a variable called zebra so now
we're actually it looks like gonna be
using this so we're gonna say zebra
equals animal and his name the only
parameter we have right now is Jeffrey
so now we have a zebra that's an ant
animal named Jeffrey je FF are you want
oh and then print it out so now we want
to print out print zebra dot name and
then there's our Jeffrey
all right so check out the examples in
the editor see how the init boots up
each object that's a good way of putting
it actually does its kind of boot up
each object to expect a name and an age
then use a self dot name and itself that
age assignment add a third attribute is
hungry so this we're gonna add it
attribute here is I'm just very hungry
and self dot is underscore hungry equals
is and you're hungry so we're gonna have
that two there and I think that's all we
need to do so this returns whether it's
true or false just a check out the code
and after note that each individual
animal it gets don't name an age since
they're all initialized individually but
they all have access to the member
variable is alive since they're all
members the animal class okay so what
we're basically doing here is giving
this another parameter for animal it's
inheriting it and it's by default set to
alive so even though we don't put it in
here it's our it inherits it alright so
we're going to add a method called
description so the same thing as we
would except this within the class
parameter so def description
you should print out the name and the
age of the animal it's called online
credence all right so so print
let's try name come in age I don't think
we have to do self here and then create
an instance an animal so we're gonna
create now we're creating an instance
hippo equals animal and we're gonna say
purple wasn't Barney kind of a hippo
dinosaurs looking thing so I'll say
Barney and his age is Barney's probably
like 30 and then we're gonna call hippo
dot description we're going to call the
function on it make sure it works
this Fisher takes no arguments one given
okay it looks like we have to call self
on this also so I thought maybe it
inherited I think a JavaScript it
inherits the self after you do the in it
without messing around with it
oh all right so they want this on
separate lines easy enough just print it
again and we should be good so Barney
and 30 so after line three add a second
member variable called health so after
line three we're gonna say health
so we're saying the member variable and
we're gonna set it equal to good then
create two animals sloth and all
shlocker than whatever names you like
all right so let's create a new one
sloth is equal to animal no see don't
say this loss is five so Young's it's a
young sloth I think by standards we'll
just call them sloth and we'll create
Ocelot some Metal Gear Solid maybe and
make sure this is captain is animal
we'll just call him Solid Snake and it
will make him about probably about forty
and then finally I have three separate
lines print out all right print hippo
dot health print sloth dot else print
Ocelot dot
BAM good good good pretty good alright
so now we're switching gears and it's
not all animals and fruits where you're
now working with a shopping cart so
create an instance the shopping cart
called my cart initialize it with any
values you like then use add item it's
it to add an item to your cart so here
we that's our class we're gonna say my
underscore cart equals shopping cart
and we're saying my underscore cart dot
ad underscore item and what do we want
to if you're forget what the there's a
product and there's a price for that
item so we are going to add let's do uh
riot RP for League of Legends and we'll
say it's 1999 takes exactly two
arguments one is given oh we're actually
not adding an item we are shopping cart
here we need to say customer name and
we'll do some shameless plugging
youtube.com slash Pizza poker guy 87 I
hand then here we need to call my answer
cart again dot and underscore item and
it takes in a product and we'll change
that to Python videos and the price for
that is free so zero and that should be
it so Python videos have been added to
the cart and the reason it does that is
because when we hit add item there's
already a function built-in that tell
you what's going on here so check out
the code in the editor they've defined
the class customer as well as a
returning customer note that you don't
display display defined rather the
display cart method in the body of
returning customer but it will have
access to the method via inheritance all
right so we we were talking about
inheritance before so this isn't this is
a subclass of the customer object this
is the parent class so what's going on
here what they're trying to say is that
the this display cart method even though
we don't define it here we inherit it
from our superclass so we could also
redefine it in here and it would take
precedence over it
but in this case there's no reason to
all right online is one to four we've
created class name shape all right
create your own class triangle so loss
triangle and inside the triangle class
write an init method okay so they want
to stay and hair it from shape and
inside here we need a death in it and we
need self side one side two inside three
so just I mean they're using some pretty
blanket examples but if we're just think
about it logically for a second about
what type of parameters you would need
for a triangle and a triangle always
have three sides and we're working with
shapes so a lot of these things may be a
little if if you're new to
object-oriented programming just take a
second pause the video and try to think
about it logically you know what it you
may need so alright let's say now so
criticize yourself outside one equal
side side oneself side two equals sign
too soft on side three equals sign three
and I think that's it
all right so create a new class called
part-time employee that inherits from
employee so class part-time employee and
inherits from employee just like the
triangle did give your derive class a
calculate wage method sadef calculate
underscore wage that overrides employees
just so what were you talking about a
second go takes itself in hours all
right so self dot hours equals hours
because part-time employees like
calculate wage over ice calculate wage
it still needs to be set to self dot
hours equals hours yep you should return
part-time employees so return hours
times and part-time employees make 12
all right so first aside your part-time
employee method we're gonna add a new
method call it's def a full-time wage
which kind of defeats the purpose of a
part-time employee with document self
comma hours the method sure turned the
salt of a super call to calculate wage
so unless you want to return super
saying go from the super class dot
calculate I'm just for a wage and then I
calculate wage we need hours hours and
self-taught hours we have to initialize
it hours then after your class all right
so after we did that derived call myself
what's arrived
now we'll come back to that but it looks
like it might have actually derived just
probably a keyword doesn't look like it
so we can actually take this out because
we're calling it I think we can take
this out because we're actually calling
it from here and it's already they've
already established that when we're
doing this I so create an instance of
part-time employee called mill Milton
and this is a part-time employee and
when we create a part-time employee they
always have a name in this case we'll
just name them Milton finally print out
the result of calling print Milton dot
full-time part-time underscore wage
and then full-time wage for a number of
hours is 10 so let's see if we did
everything right
derived is not defined
on line 19 global name derives is not
too fine alright so class oh it's not
derives that's a class so employee super
object has to know and super object has
no attribute not calculating HS it does
all right so let's here done method such
arguments all right so what do they want
us to put in here do we need to call
parameter because I thought we called it
right here
so line 16 full-time wage so def will to
myself hours returns super from the
employee class for this self kind of
same age
special arguments oh do any passing out
I think we might need a passed an hour
sir self-taught hours
okay so let's look and we know what
we're know where the air is we're just
not quite sure what it is and that was
14 of 18 which was it looks like a job
for
turns super
ooh so we need to return we get the
super from this whatever is the
superclass of this class and then we
pass in ours by not self dot ours okay
so just a little bit of misunderstanding
on our part it's the super we're getting
the super for our part-time employee
we're not actually naming the super
we're getting the super from here and
then we're taking the hours we don't
need to self dot hours because we're
actually getting we're calling it this
function whenever you go two hundred
dollars making that cash money alright
so let's do this again we're defining a
class triangle and this is an object
it's not shaped this time because this
is the first class we have and we have
def underscore underscore in it
let's render stronger than we have self
angle 1 angle two and go through
this self dot angle one it goes any one
self dot angle to a posing angle to self
dot angle three equals an angle three
and that's all they want us to do so far
cool
now create a variable called number of
sides and set equal to three sorry
alright inside the shrine class so not a
new function so we're gonna just create
a blanket variable here number outside
so I'm gonna study equal to three
because this is always gonna be true in
a triangle so create now we're gonna
create a method called def you should
probably put up one thing about Python
is it's always you always have to have
the indent right indentation right so
it's a little harder to follow sometimes
so I I like spacing out my code a little
bit it's uh it's a good practice also a
lot of like Eclipse and stuff like that
will have like a control shift something
that will do it for you but not in this
ie and we're not writing you know
typically we don't write more than 50
lines of code on here at most secreta
method name checked angles sum of the
three angles should return true itself
to us alright so def started beginning
definitely for checking angles and in
here we need a self and we need angle 1
angle to angle 3 the reason we need that
is we're going to be adding them
together and then we're ice AIDS
so if
self-taught actually we don't need the
brackets so not one so that angle 1 plus
self angle to the self dot angle 3 is
equal to 1 exactly equal to 180 return
true else return false same assume it
make sure to pass the self as argument
to check the angels methane
self-taught angle to something sometime
make sure to pass self as an argument to
check underscore angles so-so
okay so apparently we don't need to pass
this parameter in because we already
have it in our init method so we can
just call it because it's class specific
because we're not gonna if we if we were
to do it this way it would mean that we
could override the angles I and I think
that's why they don't want us to do that
they just want to be like oh well these
are the angles the triangle has we're
not trying to change them and we're not
trying to calculate the angles for a new
triangle we're trying to calculate the
angles for the existing triangle which
makes sense the way I did it you could
have done it but that would have meant
that you would be putting in the
parameters every time instead of just
calling it on it it's so creative very a
variable name line triangle it's at
Eagle News that's right so my under
support right now we're gonna create an
instance of this object is equal to
triangle and it's we're gonna have the
size 90 30 60 and then we're gonna print
my I'm just our triangle dot number
sides so the reason that num number on
the sort of sides the reason we're just
calling that variable say what it can
you print out this variable for us
triangle that check and now we're gonna
call the check angles so this is going
to print out this sum of the angles it
should be 180 or actually it returns
true if it's 180 all right create a
class name all right so now we're gonna
create a class that inherits so this is
called a collateral and this is inherits
from triangle
it's a equilateral create a member
variable named angle create a member
variable named angle so angle is equal
to 60 create and in it
oh not death so def I'm just right in it
I understand underscore and then it has
self with only the parameter self okay
and self dangled one set that equal to
self dot angle so self dot angle 1 is
equal to
angle this self angle to April walked in
I just had to finish up what I was doing
so let's train remember what were you
doing here so we were setting this equal
to the angle cuz an equal at a lateral
triangle is a triangle with all three of
the same sides self Tanglin equals angle
make sure that you use this up qualifier
I did ground herself and self-taught
angle one he goes angle self dot angle
to something equal to self dot angle so
it says we're doing something wrong here
let's go ahead and look at the foreign
cuz it we're probably off let's see
yourself time ain't no one oh maybe we
need angle I think that's what we need
oh no should take one argument no we
already have our angle
all right so let's just look at the form
real quick because it's probably
something very small I don't understand
what I should do differently
self-taught angle 1 equals oh okay so we
forgot that to include the self right
here so we're basically saying this is
equal to this and that should be it cool
so that was our first introduction to
classes and Python so what are we doing
next with classes it looks like we're
gonna be making a car and doing the
object around classes in regards to car
so as always comments donation
suggestions word press ideas coding

and I will see you guys in the next
