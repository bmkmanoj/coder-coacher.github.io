academy if you're looking for
project-based tutorials just that
definitely the place to go go ahead and
give them a shot they have a free two
week trial there you can try it out for
two weeks and cancel if you don't want
to enjoy it we're going to be continuing
on with working with an API we're on
displaying the data so last time we kind
of went over what was an API and what we
could do with it this time we're
actually going to be talking about about
the how to get data out of the API it
looks like so let's go ahead and jump
right in so we're going to be displaying
the data in the table element but to
start we're going to remove the div
right here let's see here there's a div
ID / temporary so we're going to go
ahead and remove this and we're going to
jump into our JavaScript and we're going
to go ahead and remove this
json.stringify I'm going to zoom in a
little bit summer coat
just go ahead and move on here
so we're going to add this table here it
looks like they want to add art if
you're not familiar with like that how
tables run down you have the table tag
which basically denotes that this is
where the table is going to be then you
have the table head which is kind of
like where you would put the the top
columns like maybe i'll say name address
city or something like that all right in
this case then you have a table row
which instantiates a row in a table and
then we have these table headers which
are basically same things as table data
except therefore the table head that's
all we're doing here and we're throwing
an ID on here to connect it to an ID
with that's called API table so let's go
ahead and jump into our HTML and where
do they want us to put this add the
following after the first pagination
area diff so I believe this is this is
the first one
you should go right thing so we have a
table here and you see our table heads
we have an actually done anything with
them but they have arse the the name of
of them in there right now now we're
going to go ahead and display some data
in there so you can see some example
right here now let's go ahead and add
the table body table body will typically
be where all your table data goes this
is basically where all our info is going
to go so you have the table head which
are like the column names you have the
table body which were your day to go so
then you have the table footer sometimes
where maybe you want to add up things or
do something like that so go ahead and
jump into here so outside our table head
but within our table we're go ahead and
put in our table body you see we have
some test data we can see how
everything's looking right now so we
want to do here is we want to actually
take use this callback function now they
do they're doing a little bit of an
interesting thing here I feel like they
might be making this more complicated
and needed since we're using jQuery but
let me try and explain what's going on
here we're using the append to which
essentially appends is a jquery function
that's going to append the data that
we're getting from our our response our
response is a json now you'll see right
now when we go ahead and let's just copy
this whole thing well we're what we're
doing here we're saying look our
variable TR is equal to and then we're
pending a bunch of data repenting object
ID this is coming from the JSON object
name also coming from the JSON object
address JSON object created and we're
just iterating through our array our
JSON object that by the sounds of it has
an array in there and then we're just
going to be outputting and appending all
of that so let's go ahead and jump down
and this is probably going right back
here in this callback function
let's see here update your data callback
function so what we need when we shall
grab but we don't need here there is
that I believe you know what let's just
go ahead and take it all like so that
probably the easiest to skip making any
errors and you'll see right now we're
getting all this data that's populating
from our JSON we we have these two
hard-coded in here so that's going to be
it um obviously it's messing up our IDs
and all that sort of stuff but you can
see we're getting our dates or addresses
the whole thing by appending this to the
data a lot of stuff was going on here
they didn't they didn't do too great of
a job explaining the JSON so let me see
if I can explain what's going on here
we're running a for each on a function
that's in our running for each on the
object array so the JSON start earning
an array of data and objects within a
rated day in it and what we're doing is
we're taking the for each and we're
iterating through every single item in
that array and for every item we are
then going to append this data for each
one so this is let's say index 1 so
we're taking index one that ID index one
name index one address index will not
create it and we're storing it in this
variable at that point we're then going
to append it to the table that we have
here and we're going to then move on to
doing it for index to as well and then
right here we're simply calling this get
data function that's going to output it
so I hope this help to explain and kind
of showcase how you can use um AP is
really when you need to output data like
this for you know repetitive purposes
like tables which is really why you use
them but as always guys don't forget to
