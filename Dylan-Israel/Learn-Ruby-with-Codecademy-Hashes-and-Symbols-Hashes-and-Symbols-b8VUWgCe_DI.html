of Ruby let's go back guy I started this
earlier but we'll go back real quick and
okay so just a quick little quick text
here about remind us how to do hashes
but uh just kind of the way I remember
it is it's kind of like an array but a
little bit different symbols and they
have keys also so in this case we're
just gonna set and wants to create an
empty hash so there we go
okay the next thing I wants us to do is
iterate over the Matz hash I'm printing
a values console using foot's
so it gives us a pretty close example of
what we can expect here so dot each
wanted to go through each and we have
the key and then we have the value and
you can name these anything you want but
uh let's see if that works so there we
go so you can see right here that it
prints out the name our age on each one
all right so let's see here
nil a formal introduction so
okay now this is basically saying that
in regards to boolean operators there's
true and false but there's also nil and
nail means isn't the same as false
it just means nothing at all so all
right so city creatures
so this wants to test it and the key
here however and we'll say something
random
so nil does that make this saving your
own default
all right so it wants us to create end
and meal and give it a another value so
this is basically the default value by
the sounds of it and I wants us to see I
like this all right cool all right it
looks like it wants us to just kind of
examine what's going on here
what's a symbol
all right so let's see this is checking
the symbol see it's the same object is
listed twice not really quite sure
what's going on there be honest symbols
start with a colon and then there's a
variable name a circle in has to be a
letter or underscore alright so once
this to create a my first symbol
alright it's saying that they expect to
use underscore in the naming convention
also so : name so say that words okay so
the symbol is name all right what are
symbols you use for they're immutable
meaning they can't be changed whilst
they're created okay I guess I could be
helpful only one copy of any similar
exists at a given time as symbols as
keys are faster than strings is key so
this is uh if you know you're not gonna
have to change anything
just better way to go about it speed
wise all right so in this case we'll
just do the same convention that they
were doing so they're still hashes
technically at least that's how I would
think
I should work just fine probably don't
need that last comma let's see here
well we do name the last comment did I
not have a three here
there we go okay so try out the three
all right
converting between symbols and strings
we use the dot 200 for us and dog to
system good a new variable symbols
all right let's store an empty array in
it okay easy enough used iishe iterate
over the string array so symbols so do I
believe ya do and then the values
we're going to say RS c4s and stringing
Sue's dot team so much
let's see how they good here
okay so let's just type out what they
have here I stopped shooting first and
then you stop push the add the new
symbols symbols little stop push and and
I'm not sure this is gonna work oh
you're shot
Oh
did you create a variable called symbols
go back to the instructions and see here
so we store it an empty array push s
okay so we pushed it we're adding the S
here show us the values just in case
that's messing up all right create an
empty array symbol set each to a values
oh whoops
first
all right for s and strains you thought
I start too soon - very s - a symbol use
push to add that oh you know what let's
do it like that I think I created a hash
code we're still having an issue so
let's let's just look at the example so
if they have our array we create an
array we check our original array if it
has some value for s and strings s not
too soon and the symbol dot push and
then okay so I think we're doing okay
here so let's take a second to see what
suggestions in behalf so let's see what
they did here
strings that each to us and we'll stop
push s tisson okay so in this case did I
say create a for loop for each s in
strings oh no it's okay
so that for loop might be was counting
us there
there we go no loose again it looks like
hTML is a symbol so a great strength
great there critter array create the
string and then we set s is equal to s
not too soon okay so I was thinking this
changed it but there we go okay so this
just calls it on it without read without
changing the value of s so a little bit
sloppy there will have to work a little
bit harder with the symbols what's a new
concept all right many paths the same
summit update your code from the last
exercise you in turn instead of
so this will let us used in turn on
let's see if I think in my vision you
see it's just doing it like that
because this is a string and then we're
calling the dot in turn right the
marriage of hashes and symbols all board
the hash rocket so once I create it have
a skirt hash of movies then wants us to
add two symbols all right it's inside
your hash I do queue the key should be
the names of movies okay never mind
so this will be so good movie home alone
and then put this in brackets or
actually you don't do it although we'll
change this because this looks like it's
a keyword to puts a good movie right now
Avengers there's two and we'll change
this one to super
the value should be a quick description
better expected all right so that works
cool there we go
and it fix the equal look pretty scary
with all those errors but there are
hashes and symbols and finally the hash
rocket has landed and it's shane in ruby
1.9 they've changed the way that the
syntax works so
basically I don't think this will work
now all right so there that he resigned
should work okay basically they changed
the syntax and ruby 1.9 which is
probably the most current version so
this is how you're going to be able to
use hashes dare to compare so let's see
this is going to get a string a lot
going on here so let's just say uh
submit iso spring time is equal to dot
zip time who knows what's going on here
let's take a look at another time
got any more selective that we can use
dot select slit see okay so it's kind of
almost like it if statement Barrett yeah
all right creating a variable Club good
movies and set it equal to the result of
equals select and then we have our key
our value and then let's look back at
the syntax real quick
slash sign
those are two Crowder's it's looking
where value is only greater than three
so I believe that should work and there
you go so we get a primer
The Matrix Truman Show Skyfall linking I
don't know a primer is but uh apparently
I need to check it out the other ones
big fan oh so that's our program works
pretty well right okay so this just
wants to subscribe it's so this just
wants us to print only the value and
then we'll say P and I will say it puts
key there you cool so that is hashes and
symbols of course we'll share this and
let's see what our next section is going
to be so we'll be building oh looks like
we're finally getting some real code in
skin a little bit bigger more than one
screen we're gonna be building this'll
looks like something good movies so that
was the next section of Ruby and this
will be the next one see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
