scientists and jobs that fall in that
category we're talking about how much
money they make with the barrier of
entry is how many jobs there are and
what the growth is for that category of
job we're gonna be talking about a
couple blogs from Forbes and IBM as well
as the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and
goal for that as well as my personal
opinion about the matter before we get
started I want to just throw out that
the Humble Bundle there will be a link
in the description below has a data
science book bundle but presented by
O'Reilly so for $1 if you're if you're
interested you don't know where to get
started
there's some great O'Reilly books here
that go over our Python graphs data
science to the command line and the
eight dollars you get you know six more
books and then $15 even more so so for
$15 you can get 15 books on data science
so if you're interested in that there's
a link in the description and you can
help me out by clicking on that and if
you want to part of it will go to
charity as well
and if you want to give it all to me or
you want to give it also charity you can
do it like so so little shout-out to
that now let's dive into it so the first
thing I want to talk about is my
personal experience with data scientists
and I've worked with a few at previous
software developer jobs so what can you
expect this is pretty accurate the
Bureau of Labor Statistics in my opinion
is very respectable I don't think if it
gets more much more respected than that
as much as people like to say so what
can you expect for the average median
pay or the middle point of a data
science salary so a hundred and
basically twelve thousand dollars per
year for a day of science in the in in
the United States now that doesn't
necessarily mean entry-level if I had to
guess you're probably going to start
somewhere around 70 entry-level there
and jump every couple of years as you
become a better and better individual
now what education wise I think this is
pretty accurate so unlike unlike full
stack development web development I feel
like there's a larger barrier of entry
with Dan Davis scientists not always
though not always
this is absolute right guys we're just
kind of talking in generalities and my
personal experience play based off of
these you kind of need a degree most of
time now there are data science boot
camps opening up and doing very well as
well so in this degree degrees that
would go well with data scientists from
people I've met
obviously math degrees CS degrees
software degrees accounting degrees the
stats degrees business degrees those are
the types of degrees that I've met where
people have been working in data science
and doing very well as well and I know
when I talked to a individual Hughes
telling me he's gets three four calls a
day which is even more than I get on
average when he's not even looking for
jobs so from 2014 to 2024 you can expect
that there's gonna be 11% growth which i
think is probably pretty reasonable it's
faster than the average I think this is
probably on the low end to be honest and
I think data scientists is falling into
a larger category so perhaps computer
information of research scientists is a
little bit misleading but I think data
scientists is exactly what we're it's
same category but I think it actually
opens up to more jobs and it's taking
into consideration so and by the way
this medium pace as of May 2016 it's
pretty current now let's talk a little
bit about what type of languages you
would work in as the data scientist
before we go over what IBM which i think
is probably one of the more respectable
sources that you can get into because
they these are the people who really
track this stuff and work with data
scientists they think that it's going to
grow by 28 percent by 2020 so they think
it's going the the amount of jobs that
was the US Bureau of Labor Statistics
they're estimating based off their stats
eleven percent by 2020 for IBM's
thinking twenty-eight percent in the
next three years this article is from
May in terms of of stats you know pretty
much the same 117 thousand median pay
where a lot of people work so if you're
interested in like hey what sort of job
category
you gonna work in 59% are in financial
tech IT professional services I'd be
like law services tech companies stuff
like that now 700 thousand openings by
2020 that's a lot of jobs for a very
high-paying job now and you got a couple
nice cross here I'm gonna include all
the links to this cuz we're gonna kind
of kind of blaze through it as we go on
so let's see here so you can see here's
some of the highest-paying analytical
jobs machine learning Apache hive big
data all that sort of falls into the
data science series now I this is a lot
to take in but I wanted to kind of talk
about more so and uh I encourage you
guys all I'll check it out but there's a
whole article here by the same
individual talking about why it's a
great job to pursue any it is right
we've we've done we've done things about
about how data Sciences and database
technicians and managers they're all on
the top jobs and in demand and I think
it just keeps on showing up right it's
all in this software it's all in this
development world and data scientists is
a really big deal and the reason they
get paid so well is because it's very
math oriented being a software developer
there is some math but not like the math
that there is a data scientist I've
talked about it once before I went to a
data science hackathon thinking I could
hang up hang out like I'll pick up I was
the dumbest person in the room and no
one would even put me on a team because
they were all there with their
co-workers and it was clear that I
basically had no idea how to get I was
like oh I can query a database and do
these no you're talking about advanced
algorithms that are going to predictive
analysis based off multiple situations
and languages I'm not familiar with
right like Python and our it's very
advanced which makes the like one of the
things I've always said that makes the
the money and the amount of the
difficulty to get the harder and more
technical a job is the higher the salary
is
so as long as it's in demand right and
as we've talked your labor bliss the
Bureau of Labor Statistics 11% IBM says
twenty percent twenty eight percent by
2020 I tend to agree because every when
I look at the job market I see tons of
things in demand and I I just wanted to
kind of do a video to talk about it as
an option now it's not something that
I'm completely familiar with but it is
something that that I think is pretty
cool now what what types of things might
you do as a data scientist so not to go
too much into detail but at my previous
job I used to get I used to gather
requirements for my mic works other
companies and one task that they asked
was they wanted to and they were charter
school system they wanted to be able to
scan the hundreds of thousands of tests
that they take online with their
students and see if there's any
anomalies in the test right these tests
are created and they're edited but
mistakes are made and so one thing that
he did was he used a tool called tableau
which allows you to create very dynamic
charts that will actually that actually
scanned this hundreds of thousands of
not only the the tests that were in the
system but every single tests ever taken
the question in the answered and then
we're able to find outliers to show okay
you know what this this specific answer
specific question we need to reevaluate
this and go from there and see what
tests people are on average are too hard
too easy are just wrong and so that's a
that's kind of what you might be doing
with this eyes now the reason that's
important why they also make so much
money as we just talked about fifty nine
percent could be in the finance and
insurance industry and that's it that's
one of those things where you make them
money by finding those stats and those
analysis I know I know some of the data
scientists at my old work saved the
companies hundreds of thousands of
dollars by doing some very good analysis
of a financial aspect of the company and
I'm not gonna go into detail about but
literally know
joke upwards of a million dollars
specifically due to statistical analysis
and this is the reason you can make a
hundred and twenty thousand dollars in
the if you're just the average right if
you're doing better than the average
you're gonna you can do well and you can
make a lot of money as well now if
you're if you like math and you like
sort of stats and I tend to like that I
kind of drop off once we get to advanced
calculus and I'd have to study up a
little bit but I like it very much so
but in terms of data scientist data
engineers data developers there's a lot
of growth really there's three things
you should be looking for for a role
when you're trying to break into an
industry you're deciding what you want
to go to college for you're assigning
what you want to go what you want to
become and maybe not even go to college
right granted in this specific instance
it kind the average employee has a
degree in this a degree that relates to
this but take myself for instance we all
can work our own own path so what are
the three things that this kind of
checks off for me when I'm looking at
the job market if I was going to be you
know 18 or so or 25 or even older than I
am right one what is the growth of the
job we've already discussed that on the
low end eleven percent on the high end
28% in much quicker fashion what is the
salary of that job that's two and and
how many so what south okay I'm gonna
health choked up here salary growth in
the amount of jobs and they're quite
amount of quite a bit of jobs here and I
encourage you to do your own research
but I think I think you're going to be
very happy if you go in the data science
realm especially because of that barrier
of entry right because of the fact that
that it is hard to hire competent people
a lot of people think oh well there's
tons of people going there's a tons of
tons of people who there's a lot of
people who you could tell I am a very
technical individual I'm so unqualified
to be a data scientist okay so there is
a large barrier of entry to jump into
this but if you are if you're an
intelligent person you can build it you
can build a portfolio in this just as
much you can go and get your degree
you can pursue a internship and entry
level this is a great field to go to I
highly encourage you guys to check that
out and again if you're interested in
picking up some books while you're on
your journey you can use my link down
below to get those books and our Python
and a bunch of other stuff as always
guys I appreciate you checking out this
video and watching in and supporting me
through stuff like this join the
Facebook group where I'm going to be
giving away a entire one or two of these
the nice people a Humble Bundle sent me
this and go ahead and join the discord
channel as well I'll see you guys next
time bye hey guys thanks for watching
the video if you happen to be looking
for a boot camp I couldn't recommend dev
Mountain any higher they also include
housing with their tuition so you can
get up and go and get started right away
thanks again for watching and I'll see
you guys in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
