story about the first time I ever had a
first and only time I had a website shut
down now you've heard me in the past day
I got interested in web development
about two three four years ago whatever
it was but I actually built a website
when I was about 14 and wear whatever
age you are in the ninth grade and it
was called for a lot and I'm kind of
embarrassed even to say what the name of
it was kind of narcissistic but it's
called Dylan's palace I don't know it's
been so long that I don't know what I
was thinking all I remember is I wanted
my name in it right and so that was so
the point of Dylan's pallets they really
have one at that point I was very
interested in journalism and I was on
the school newspaper and my father was a
writer and we used to do some writing
things and a lot of it was me writing
articles that I thought were funny so at
this one and some of it was like art I
had a friend my friend named who if you
refresh you're a fan of engineer truth
channel he's interviewed him a couple
times about being a engineer this one's
more popular videos but yeah namm used
to draw like dragons and things like
that and so I would like scan them and I
put them up on the site and this was all
through like some sort of web template
builder you know I wasn't good enough to
type out the HTML when I could do very
little things at that time but so yeah I
had a lot of articles and icons and I
worked on it every day for like three
months back in like the ninth grade or
going into 9th grade and uh I just one
article I wrote that was supposed to be
funny and it was called something like
10 reasons why my school sucks Leo so
that was what it was and it was it was a
it was an article that like kind of
chain through and it wasn't just like a
list of 10 but it the one that
apparently they found really offensive
was I trying to be funny
and I wrote something along the lines of
and I wish I still had all this stuff so
I could actually share it but it's been
so long it was something along the lines
of seagulls shit on the the single shit
on the lunch tables like bombs dropped
in Pearl Harbor and like I thought I was
being funny anyhow so that was like kind
of to give you an idea of the tone of
the article right so what happened was
was a I someone I don't know who but
someone sent it to the superintendent
and superintendent didn't like it at all
and so I was in Oz 14 little intimidated
at the time and I got called into the
principal's office and my mom got called
in as well all this sort of stupid
bullshit right shitting on my creativity
right so if you don't if you want
another reason why don't like organize
the education for the most part there's
another good one so I'm thinking I'm
being creative I'm having fun whatever
actually I'm problem i think that Nina
I'm making that argument that I am I was
being creative I was having fun and if
anything I was being comfortable with
technology and learning new skills and
learning learning new things and you
have the superintendent who is at the
pinnacle of the education system for the
most part and the principal sitting
there telling you how this is
inappropriate they can't allow it and I
need to take it down and I'm 14 say no
right so I'm saying no I'm not taking it
down so how did how did it come down is
the gist of it well what happened was
they called my mom and after
interrogating me for like 20 minutes and
my mom comes in and my mom's kind of
freaking out about it and she's like
they said they're going to suspend you
if you don't take it down well it's your
stuff you're gonna take it down I was
like nine you taking a downer I'm gonna
sit under this number 14 I taking it
down you know fuck that I didn't say
fuck that but uh that was the mentality
I was like I take it down I do anything
wrong so you'll shit on the tables it's
true no no this is false right Oh
everything is so it's true right and so
what happened was my mom who I used her
credit card
an account at that time I had a credit I
use her debit card or credit card to
actually pay for the web hosting called
the web hosting company and told them
that I stole her credit card to purchase
the web hosting and that is how my very
first website got shut down I just
thought it was kind of a funny story and
I had forgotten about it until recently
but back when I was 14 I started getting
interested in building websites and you
know just pursuing interest and not even
really thinking about it as a career and
it didn't I'd actually touch building
websites ever again until God maybe 25
something like that and that was like 10
11 years later and it was just a
something I thought about and just
looking back on it now and saying you
know my father's overreaction and and
and kind of their overreaction like what
do you care what a ninth grader has to
say about your school being a piece of
shit right like why is that why is that
an issue I thought it's kind of funny I
