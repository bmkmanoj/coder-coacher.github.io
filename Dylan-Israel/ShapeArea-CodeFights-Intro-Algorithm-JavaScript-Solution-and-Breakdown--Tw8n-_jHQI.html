shape area of the intro so let's talk
about what it is we're trying to do and
then I actually have the white board
today I think this is a great example of
one that I personally whiteboard it out
I was really conceptually having issues
trying to figure it out when I first
looked at it so what we're getting in is
a a integer n in this case two and for
each position you are then adding on
several cubes to each corner so one you
get one above it you get one there too
you get so you get the core piece which
is one and then you get a piece attached
to the top to the left to the right to
the bottom and then continues on right
so in this case we have this part then
we attach attach attach attach attach
attach and then it keeps on continuing
and our goal here is to get the area or
these cubes that are filled up that's
the goal and you get four examples here
to really sell sell home the point of
this now I'm going to bring up the the
webcam I'm going to turn that down and
so let me draw this is how I figured out
and sometimes people say hey how can I
solve algorithms that are really
struggling this is a great one to
showcase how with with just a couple
colors we can fix this so the first
thing I do is I start drawing out I want
to see the difference I want to
visualize the difference of of each one
of these squares so we'll have the this
will be and we'll put a one right so
there's our one that's that n is equal
to one so what changes between n is
equal to 1 to n is equal to 2 well we
get a couple ones we get a couple side
chicks
I mean side pieces and then my
girlfriends they hate me for that joke
it's all you see there now we see that
we're and the reason I'm doing in
different colors and numbers is because
I want to actually be able to visualize
visually see the difference now before
we begin
we can start mate I typically if there's
a pattern like this and there is so sort
of pattern I like to do three sets
because two can be a flip but three
usually is it right like two can be a
use case so we could draw some
conclusions right now if we wanted to
from a pattern or say okay well for each
iteration it's four times the previous
one right so this is one plot this is
four we could maybe jump to some of that
but we just still don't have enough
evidence so what we need to do is and
it's equal to three on top of here
the way that we do that just draw it on
draw it on
okay cool so now we have a fully sort of
drawn out the light is shining on this
of course so now we have a fully started
right out so let's try and draw some
conclusions for what we're looking at
when n is equal to one the area is 1
when n is equal to 2 the area is 5 and
when n is equal to 3 we have 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8
all right 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 so 8 this will n
is equal to 13 so we have a difference
of 4 here we have a difference of 8 here
so I based off of that we can kind of
start jumping to conclusions that we're
going to have a 4 in and 8 in here that
is Huli there's somehow a multiple of 4
and now we just have to figure out in
our code how we could write that but
that became very apparent once I drew
that out so I think it's a good example
of how maybe you can use a white board
to solve an algorithm if you're you know
you're struggling with it and this one
was one for me so that's something for
some reason I don't know if I was tired
that day or what but I didn't fully get
it now there's a couple different ways
we can do this now that we've discussed
sort of the prepping the way that I saw
I saw this stuff is like so we have a
bar and we set the area to initial of 1
now the reason for it for this is is
because I expect to when that is equal
to 1 it has a has a unique use case and
for that if a couple didn't we can do an
if statement or we just augment the for
loop that we're going to create which is
what I did I decide to do so at the end
here we want to return the area that's
that's the goal we want to eventually
return the area so with with that all we
have to do from here is we've already
seen that for each iteration so between
and
is the equal to one to n is equal to it
increases by four and from n to two and
three increases by four on top of that
so increases by eight so it's a multiple
of four added on to the current n that
we are on now
we have four loop again we're starting
it at one here not zero we say hey while
at while while one is less than the
number passed in go ahead and increase
the four loop excuse me I'm going to put
this as one and this is I so here's our
for loop and what we want to do here is
say area plus equals because we want to
add to it four times
I because when we are on when we were on
too bad for when we had it when we were
on excuse me one less rather so when we
were on three out of eight and so
continues on right and then we add that
to the area and then finally we returned
and all our tests are passed now there's
probably a couple different ways that
you could write this you know there's
probably a cleaner way than for loop but
it's pretty basic to get going but more
than anything else I think that the the
it's a good example of how you can use a
white board to solve some of these
problems but as always guys thank you so
