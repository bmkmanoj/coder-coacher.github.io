my challenge in interest yeah Matt you
know they are a little history about
engineer truth my man I go back now we
man like literally known each other for
20 years
mind you I'm 29 so that's a long time in
general how do I turn nightbot
on uh sorry guys night buck is not
joining the chat and that's how we're
going to that's how we're gonna be doing
the giveaways it's gonna be an easy
giveaway so everyone can see how we win
here so just I had this issue last time
and it really sucked
so uh yeah back in our college days Matt
and I know uh that's some YouTube
fanfiction for you right there man I
know how you guys get down
Oh Shh come on I so I might take a
second for it to as as far as I
understand what's going on the issue I'm
having here is it takes a second for not
nightbot to recognize how who rather
what do I write with I command so that's
I'm just testing to see if nightbot is
in here so I might take a second why
we're waiting for nightbot friends for
20 hours I'm Barry look too far I will
be 30 in two months your boy is filled
in all old as all right no why
we're waiting here guys let me show you
the course that we're gonna be giving
away to five of you and don't worry as I
mentioned there's a link down below and
there's also a link to traverse the
media's channel if you're not a if
you're not a subscriber of his what are
you doing with your life
and so secondly I highly encourage you
to check it out but also if you don't
weigh me you don't feel like buying the
course we're going to be giving away one
on the Facebook group as well
code tech and caffeine and we're also
going to be giving away but for all of
next week's videos the Monday Wednesday
and Friday we're gonna be giving away a
course there as well for those videos so
make sure you watch that and as always
if you're new to the channel we give
away courses every Monday Wednesday and
Friday video there's no Friday video
this week us and because I posted two on
Wednesday so sorry about that
you got you got you got a little bit of
the of it early alright so so here this
is what we're gonna be using for the
giveaway once nightbot gets off a task
but the course that we're going to be
giving away is this one right here
bootstrap for from scratch with five
projects the one that I really like and
I can't wait to do so is this portfolio
grid one I wish I hope he shows it off
let me see if he shows it off in here
yeah
let me show you this portfolio grid
bootstrap for project sit here here it
is this is the one I really like right
here so you get fighty built out five
projects and goes over bootstrap four
but I really like this project
specifically right here so this is a
resume project and one of the reasons I
really like it is a lot of people I tell
you guys all the time it's really
important to have a nice clean
impressive portfolio and that one's very
interactive he doesn't really showcase
it on there but if you go to his channel
you can see it and everything is
beautiful on it speaking of beautiful
it'd be good if nightbot got off its ass
and started being beautiful so
what's my favorite text editor I've been
using Visual Studio for a while and I
really like it yeah definitely go ahead
he really stood like a six minute video
talking about the course on his channel
and the last minute of it is
so I guess I'm reading the tutorial here
on what to look at to get nightbot to do
his goddamn job so don't worry if we
can't figure it out what I will do is I
will figure out another way
don't sweat it you have to be hot to
have a picture in your resume like that
what if I'm ugly as in Omaha I mean
I'm sure every one is beautiful in their
own way
what's your ugly on the inside I hate
her everyone knows haters are ugly on
the inside I say that I bring up the
hater thing cuz uh for those of you
don't know I listen to motivation videos
on a pretty frequent basis and and one
of the things that they said today I
wrote it down right here because it
really made sense to me I wanted to
repeat it during the livestream is that
haters don't really hate you they hate
themselves because you're a reflection
of what they wish to be and in in short
that is essentially they hate us because
they ain't us right so if you have
someone who's hanging on you in your
life chances are chances are that you
are doing the right thing right and it's
unfortunate that that's the case in life
but often times it is right so and
that's why someone recently on the
channel said something along the lines
of of
of you know how can so III did a very
personal video about how I became a
developer for the last three years and
talked about my journey and so uncommon
and it's got a great like dislike ratio
and to be honest if we were to look at
my stats it's something like I have like
a three point three percent dislike
video for my entire challenge is pretty
good I think and and but someone said
there is one or two people who dislike
that video and like hundred forty that
up liked it and someone commented who
could dislike this video and I commented
back to them because I really think this
is this is true is don't focus on the
people who dislike to focus on the
hundred and forty people who liked it
right and that's really what you have to
do in life because they're they're
always going to be people who aren't
going to like you who aren't going to
want you want anything to do with you
for whatever reason doesn't matter if
it's good reasons or bad reasons so when
it's easier said than done right because
negative negativity is it stands out
much more than positivity because we
kind of take it for granted right
nightbot
Cody face hates me oh yeah and Brandon's
completely correct that that if someone
someone is giving you good advice that's
a different there's a difference between
hating hating on somebody and giving
advice but a lot of times most of the
time it's not constructive criticism or
just constructive truth so yeah all
right we're gonna try and get nightbot
to join the channel once more I'm sorry
guys I think this is so YouTube made a
change in their API recently and it's
caused some issues with nightbot
so you like this channel and I found
because I enjoy your truth Thank You Man
I like Chihuahuas as well so hope that
that helps you um so I don't have
anything negative to say about any other
channels but I'm sorry to hear that for
some reason I've rubbed somebody the
wrong way so see here Deb Mountain
intrigued me to do to free intrigued me
with the free housing till engineer
truth so some people in bootcamp didn't
know what a div was this tells me that
they don't they take anyone making
certification useless thoughts
well this true I am sponsored by Deb
mountain and I have always suggested
that if you are you are looking at a
bootcamp you should always study study
study study study study before before
before going into the boot camp now if
you want to make the poor decision of of
going into boot camp say hey I'm a smart
guy can learn from here there that's
your choice but you can't you can't go
into that situation and necessarily
blame the boot camp um now should did I
kick did I kick Kony face out I did
indeed he showed up in the group I
accepted him he showed up in the group
and within 30 seconds of being there he
wrote a 3-page sentence attacking
somebody on one of the columns because
someone said that so someone had said
something negative about him I if I
remember correctly it was said he lied
on his resume and I don't know if that's
true or not so but somebody said that
and somebody like Cody face no and and
Coney face joined the thing and then lit
pound of text I was just like I don't
want this negativity in here and so I
did ban him I don't have a problem with
them though
you just you can't act like that but my
understanding is stonyface has a a
history of outbursts and ranting and
complaining so that that's my
understanding I only know this because
someone someone who he get attacks quite
frequently tells me that about it and
stuff like that so give me a second here
let me see if I can find a different
giveaway mechanism yeah YouTube may not
be the bot we need but he's definitely
the one we deserve right now all right
I let's see
let's see if this do it actually I'm
just testing something out real quick
guys hmm
I've been I've been having issues I
haven't I haven't had any experience
with lamb to school um I'm going to try
relogin into Knight bond and see if that
helps I'm sorry guys I know you're eager
to get some courses and I'm eager to
give them to you the reason I am able to
do this is all because I think thanks to
traversing media being the homie alright

Hangouts that they have built in here

really enjoyed the react man degree
program I'm about to finish up the first

would show you guys it but um you
started to get a little less motivated
only because in NZ is that New Zealand
seems like a waste of time there's
nothing to waste the time great thing
about web development is you're
developing something for the entire
world so even if you even if you are
salting about the job prospects you
cannot build your own apps
Bildad revenue we live in a great age in
which you can make significant amount of
American dollars that maybe in another
country is a ridiculous amount of money
if you're able to do such things so oh

forward to that and then of course we
are you can also buy it with a discount
code that is in the description just by
clicking the link you'll it'll take you
to the course where you can go and get
it as well good luck slums at York at
your WordPress shop what kind of
projects do we need in react to be
hireable well I would imagine a
full-stack would probably be the best
but if you don't have any back-end
experience a unique project one of the
biggest things that employers hate to
see hate hate hate hate hate to see is
the same project the weather app though
whatever build something custom build
something that you want to build launch
it and have a good portfolio site
Oh can you game on a Mac you really
can't game on a Mac for my understand it
much harder it's much harder to upgrade
any advice for a beginning web dev that
wants to do remote work can't move
anywhere due to already having a house
well it's gonna be hard most remote
positions I pluck pancakes are for
senior developers or people have
experience very rarely well how you
fully remote with no actual experience
my the only real suggestion I can tell
you is try to get a local job and get
whatever experience you can even if it's
even if it's low pain and from there
from there from there go and start
applying for mo jobs that's but and have
strong portfolio it's about all you can
do if you can't relocate but you're
gonna have to get some years experience
99% of the time so what to learn after
you're learning the Jas basics on Khan
Academy angular2 nodejs or react well I
would say if you're trying to jump from
coke atom e JavaScript basics into any
of those you're setting yourself up for
failure my advice would be to go on the
beta of free code camp beta free code
camp comm and start working through
their entire front-end application they
have algorithms they also have
JavaScript es6 start getting comfortable
with that and until you can solve those
algorithms don't pick up a framework
then I post last weekend giveaway winner
name I don't remember if I did I pinned
it I'm a week but I'm usually a week a
week and a half behind so by the Sunday
I will pick the winners for Monday and
the to Wednesday videos to go on there
what is your favorite video game I don't
really have one but if I had to choose
the game I've probably played the most
of his League of Legends so if I had
choose I'd be it although I don't play
games anymore really
if I have an idea for a website idea can
I pay you to develop it if you want to
pay my freelance rate which is about $80
an hour so it just depends on on what it
is do I run the free code camp chalant
no i actually submitted a video back in
the day for free code camp and they
denied me
what were you meaning the cave baby I
was caning fools I was just like what
what +6 all right guys I think you've
waited long enough is that the average
rate for freelance and all depends to
put that in perspective guys that's
about backend language for beginners I
think probably the easiest one to pick
up his note in MongoDB before taking
your job in Florida do you turn down any
offers of employment because they offer
too little composition I did indeed at
that time I was making a 22 dollars an
hour and I was getting offered positions
for 25 but I thought I could get much
higher and I did and they weren't the
perfect role they were mainly more web
designs and development Pokemon beats
Digimon every time all right
so keyword keyword what about the
keyword to be um let's go about journey
i spelling Durning wrong your boy it's

supporting me I know a lot of you have
been commenting with your own journey
stories on the video and I encourage you
guys to to check out that via not just
so that you views and stuff like that
but actually go and read the comments of
other people who are probably in similar
situations to you and myself and you
hear them going through their daily
grind in their and their their hustle

average Joe one last time right average
Joe doesn't get
you can't win twice guys F two six six
Fred Quinton win Jamal kosher last year
old Michael Mila did michael win last
time also if you can't win again it's
okay to jump on jQuery after JavaScript
basics there's not really a set path
it's not a bad idea but I really do
think you should just kind of play
around with basic JavaScript and learn
the Dom and learn algorithms and go from
there how else in the course is you'll
get a e I'm going they the reason I'm
getting your email is to go and send you
the course you will get a course through
email it'll be that simple five minutes
later you will be done probably three
clicks later less than that all right
guys one more minute before we choose a
winner here am I too buff to get a web
dev job well my massive biceps
intimidate potential employers they my
massive biceps did not so I don't
imagine yours will either okay

word is journey don't stop believin that
these first two people are gonna get a
whole heaping full of salt

fill alone we want him to have someone
to share his salt with you know maybe
one person has the garlic the other

second salty person is going to be
drawing cuber you are not a winner you

liking the videos and I've been
supporting the channel watching the
videos
the views are up the watch time is up
the shares are up the subscribers are up
and so it's it's been helping out
tremendously for about six months now I
have been growing by about 2% a month
sometimes just 0% and it's hard
sometimes right you won't stay motivated
you won't stay focus it's just like
learning web dev you want to you want to
be you want to be farther than you are
in life and the same thing goes for
YouTube and and it's hard when you see
six months of no growth right and and I
appreciate you guys for for sharing the
videos and for the people who are new to
the channel and I'm sure it's a
combination of things but I I appreciate
you guys doing that and helping me out
because you know it's it sucks when
you're not growing right and it feels

and so uh it was promo campaign ads on
Facebook YouTube promo campaign no I

also just there are there are humps and
dives with YouTube I have a new graphic
designer working on my thumbnails and
stuff like that so I I don't know I
don't really know what it is but uh the

that's about it I've read some papers
but if you're looking for like the the
only book I can really recommend that's
on algorithms that people have

half years or so I've been doing YouTube

do let's I want to make sure you're a
nerd Ichiro get in here and say thank

who doesn't want to enter his spirit has
been broken the spirit has been broken
huh you know what might be happening I
think some of you guys yeah just say
actually spell hey guys one more it
seems to that we're having an issue with
this loading it I got I'm not refresh it
for and we're gonna have to say thank
you one more time because I want
everybody be able to enter fairly and it
wasn't marking a few of you so I do
apologize for that the key word is thank
you so please say thank you again I
apologize for you already do this how
much JavaScript is enough to move on to
frameworks or libraries or server nodejs
I desperately need your guidance well it
depends man I I'm really believe you're
up bill if you have a project you want
to build go ahead and build it right go
ahead and try something new build it
fresh build it like and you come to the
point where you need a node back-end you
need a framework build that but if
you're just trying to learn I really do
think you need to find a pattern of
something to build build something in
vanilla JavaScript if you don't have a
full project of the Nilla javascript
don't move on to jQuery but if you do go
ahead and mobs are enabled don't worry
man you're right there
if you do
thank you sir key word guys so just make
sure you say thank you in chat not TYT
wise not gonna answer you but if you if
you do go ahead and move on to jQuery if
you feel like you have a good handle on
that go on from there what about rails
rails is hard man this is my this has
always been my thing about Ruby on Rails
so I'll show you the exact chart asks
you wide don't recommend people are
trying to become developers learn rails
now can you of course you can but let's
look at let's look at the node verse
rails comparison there's a chart here
that basically sums it up perfectly
sty boot camps don't really teacher us a
lot of them teach a lot of them will
teach node over Ruby on Rails in which I
was correct so if you see here the
yellow at some point in 2012
there was a lot of rails jobs now if you
see here rails has been going
consistently downhill and what is up
here javascript javascript javascript
javascript javascript those are based
off job postings right so that that's
really my that's really my stance on
that no that doesn't mean that it's for
everybody but what's the most beautiful
website you've ever seen you know I
don't really know so thank you so
keyword guys at 6:25 we're going to be
rolling for the final giveaway of the
hour if you guys want to ask me some

Wednesday video one in the Friday video
and you'll be just picked at random from
a common picker I I want to thank you
guys for giving me the opportunity to to
do YouTube it is it has been a pleasure
doing this and I've learned a lot about
myself I've learned a lot about being a
developer being able to to to do this
even if it's not full-time even if it's
not as a career by the way again you
could you could enter when this video go
when this video ends comment on the
video and with the keyword salt for
those of you are watching this because

and a comment down below make sure you
like the video in our subscribe if
you're not you're just gonna be a
commoner with salt and knockin you're
gonna really be salty why I'm here if
you guys want to ask me any questions
part of the reason I do this is so that
we can have some fun right we can give
away some courses we can promote the
promote the channel we can promote the
Facebook group all that sort of stuff
but one of the reasons I do my my live
streams with every thousand subscribers
is to say thank you to the people who
are here who are people in the channel
because I never had a mentor I never had
anybody that I could really bounce
questions off I never had anybody when
when I was when I was trying to figure
out what direction to go you know people
are asking Ruby on Rails
javascript now I you know I didn't think
to search about that ain't know where to
look I didn't know how to phrase the
question so maybe I can help and that's
why I do those those every thousand
persons live streams so why I'm here if
there's any any anybody out there that
has anything I will answer your
questions best of my building or out
tell you I don't know but I do
appreciate all of you for being here I
mean a fortunate position that every
week I can give away I can give away a
course every Monday Wednesday video I'm
in the fortunate position that I
somebody I look up to somebody that I
looked up to traversing media
fine it sends me ten courses to give
away and you know I have to think that
maybe you think somewhat highly of me
and just being able to email back and
forth with him and you know I watch his
content the fact that he watches my
content is puts a smile on my face
because it's kind of it's kind of crazy
right where you are
you look up to people and sometimes they
like your stuff too right
and so that that's you know I never I
never I never started a channel in in
order to get free courses or do anything
like that or or make money I thought
maybe I could make some money but it was
really to build a portfolio and it's
become so much mores become a part of my
life I've been doing this for two and a
half years channels growing slowly
ninety nine percent of people
technically ninety seven percent of
people if you look at the life to this
leadership ninety seven percent of
people are very supportive I actually
think it's probably close to 99% cuz I
can definitely say that two percent of
me is definitely up on some of
those videos so I'll take the blame for
that it is it has been a pleasure and it
was continued to be a pleasure I have
been enjoying YouTube more than
I look forward to the day when I can
work for myself in terms of being able
to develop tutorials full-time being
able to to learn full-time being able to
to give you guys as much salt as you can
handle it is it has really been a
pleasure so if there's anything I can do
you know I throw the discord channel out
there throw the Facebook channel out
there we have the YouTube videos I try
to help everybody out the best I can I
know not everybody can can pay for a
one-on-one session and I don't expect
everybody to I I just can't give
everybody a one-on-one session about
whatever they know that it's going on
their life I can do my best answer
questions when when we're here and now
so thank you for that it's it's really
cool and thank you to the people who you
know it's kind of crazy thing or someone
donated $30 worth of money this one
h1z1 yeah your boy went to a PTA your
boy went to a YouTube event a while back
who's h1z1 was in Los Angeles and I got
um I got a bunch of free stuff it's
quite good and if you guys aren't
familiar if you're in Los Angeles or
another area that has a YouTube space I
highly encourage you to check that out
as well
um so podcasts are coming out we are
working on a podcast myself and Nicolas
Spinoza we're reaching out to a few
guests that I a few youtubers that we
are fans of and then we'd like to
interview and get on there so there is a
podcast coming out and if you guys
noticed I asked for I asked for this is
this is this is really funny so we asked
I I posted and we got a lot of good
stuff I first I said hey guys on the
Facebook group Co tech and caffeine is
the name of a Facebook group I said hey
guys we're thinking about creating a
podcast any good names you guys threw
out some great names and then at the end
of it we just decided to go with code
Tech and caffeine so uh
that's what we did that's the name of
the podcast I think it's kind of
shooting at the end of day so if you
don't know anything about Nikki he and I
interviewed Nick on my channel maybe a
year ago and we've kind of stayed in
touch a little bit and this guy it was
kind of a troll but we stayed we stayed
in touch and he's a hacker after grad he
graduated went worked in baked America
in New York now he's at a startup and
we've been looking to kind of partner on
something for a bit kind of shoot the
 we talk about various frameworks
and languages and stuff like that so I
think it's going to be about two hours
every week starting about a week or two
we're trying to we're trying to get our
guest on there right now
get we want to hit want to hit with a
lot of good guess interesting people
probably do an hour of Nick and I
shooting the in an hour with a
guest it will be released on iTunes it
will be released on on Google Play Music
and a secondary YouTube channel with
videos on my channel promoting that
channel Oh am i drinking green tea no
this is uh this is some Publix deli
unsweetened black tea really the finest
store brand love for Morocco shout out
to our Morocco subscribers out there
what course to take after Colts web dev
bootcamp well it depends on what
direction you want to go if you haven't
built your own custom project mr. Boston
I would suggest that more than anything
else
I really do a lot of guys jump from like
code caddie me to free code camp and
never ever build something of their own
build something of your own
in my case is my youtube channel build
something long-term that you think you
could make a financial gain on down the
road which you can pretty much anything
with with ad revenue yeah this is
unsweetened black tea not green tea
although
you have unsweetened we do have
unsweetened that's it sorry this this
girls dog just like it out my
window surfing
I say you're picking up the dog poop
that's like I have dogs I can't have I
can't be picking up warm warm
crap man I could get I can't be doing it
excited for that I felt so sorry no I
don't really care to be honest with you
the only NFL game I watch is the Super
Bowl I haven't watched sports other than
eSports I don't really watch eSports
anymore but not including eSports I
don't I haven't watched sports in about
five or six years I literally I I go to
meet up so I go to hackathons we're
going to hackathon in Tampa excuse me in
st. Pete in about two weeks so if
anybody is down in st. Peters and is
looking to go to a hackathon I'll be
going to the one in st. Pete it's asked
me with hospitality yeah $3,000 on the
line I'm about to go and scoop up some
investment money baby Trevor I don't
know that I'll win obviously cats oh
crap what's the difference cats crap in
a in a into sand they bury it it dries
off and then April picks it up that's
that's that's the difference what kind
of perfect path of courses are young guy
can take in order to get experience from
scratch and become a Devon the smallest
amount of time possible it already
sounds like you're trying to cheat the
system man um you really if you try to
put too much pressure on yourself you'll
burn out and there is no there is no
shortcut path if you want a straight
JavaScript path I would really recommend
that you go and just do the free coke
amateur curriculum if you're talking
about web dev be a full-stack mean
developer I think is the quickest path
and go through them and do resources
from various places watch youtube videos
build projects go on coke
I mean you can do a coke atom eCourse in
a day if you know what you're doing and
go from there but I think you're looking
at it the wrong way obviously we all
want to get to where we're trying to go
but if you set unrealistic expectations
you may have a negative result right you
may I mean it's one of those things
where you need that you need to to pace
yourself I encourage you guys to code
every day and if you do that you'll get
to where you want to go some days you'll
go long or some day so code shorter just
code every day and be part of me tough
be part of this stuff right I have any
questions if we have we answered and
gone from there and how many things that
we talked about software-related
go to meetups do hackathons go to
Facebook groups go discord channels join
a bunch of coding youtubers channels so
that you can follow the trends right
these are all things that are important
you guys need to find the fun in coding
and that's not gonna mean every day that
you are you are there writing thousands
of lines of code some days it means that
you you watch the tutorial and you
didn't even write a line of code and
that's okay but you have to find the fun
in coding eyes or it's really it's
really going to be to your detriment was
the slow path to become a developer
probably the slope see that this is this
a lot right I don't think you got what I
said
is don't rush yourself it's not a slow
path everyone's path learning software
is different everyone's path now what
you need to do is you need to look at
the resources out there to find what
you're trying to do and and go from
there if you're number one thing to do
is get a job as fast as possible the
first thing you should do is you need
for about a week in the area you want to
look at look at all the job apps being
posted every day and see what skills are
on there and go from there now
now you also need to you also need to
assume you to build projects that are
your own a lot of people want to just do
the same tutorials that are online and
that's okay but the thing that it's
gonna make you stand out is to build
stuff that is of your own and have
passion for this this is the type of
stuff that that companies want to see
especially as as a young developer or
someone who's a junior developer getting
started other than free code camp which
online accreditation are also good free
code camp it doesn't have an
accreditation just for the record how
much coding should someone have done in
order to get the front of front door of
a decent coding job in law defensemen
everyone everyone goes at a different
pace I mean if you can't I think there's
not like a set amount but if you don't
have three projects built or you don't
have something like if you don't have
anything built you're gonna have a hard
time getting your foot in the door if
you don't have a CS degree if I were to
sit you down say look I need you to
build
how'd it go about building things on my
own well start with something you're
passionate about and I this way I
encourage everyone asserted a long-term
project I'm not talking about building a
calculator or something short-term once
you build something long-term that you
can continue continue building on right
continue working with and and you can
even do that built coat rolling software
people think that's funny right um I
would encourage you that when you say
something what was that line you always
say with your passion code what what I
know you just said it but I don't ever
 remember it choose I choose
something you're passionate about and
build a project around it but give an
example that because I don't even know
okay I am passionate about YouTube right
I do this every day every day
I have a video demo now something that
you're not familiar with say someone
here is an avid League of Legends player
chances are you're gonna have to give
that up to be a good developer but
say you are built something that takes
the illegal engines API and build a a
web application with that something
unique something like that maybe builds
a card game something that shows
analytics all this sort of stuff you can
do so this is
so in my case right so I'm learning
react right now
ash I'm letting react and what I would
do if I was if I was new to new to this
I would go and build a youtube comment
picker which I'm going to do at the end
of this course in in a language I post
it up that is what I would do now what
are you passionate about ash are you
passionate about anything
are you called duty player alright do
you play back baseball do you do um you
know what what is it that your back are
you not passionate about anything it's
or nothing that in your life is
continued and carried you through what
don't swing black tea way on for me
fighting boxing MMA alright so you can
go ahead and build an analytics based
off the UFC and the data on the fighters
and go from there you'd build that in
numerous different frameworks you can
build it with different analytics you'll
learn a lot with using with frameworks
so you could use chart js4 the graphs
google charts use d3 you can build
something custom that maybe everybody
wants to go see hey how do these
fighters match up and then you could
pick a fighter from the UFC in the same
division say okay well this person
traditionally throws 205 punches a fight
the first one throws 150 they're ranked
here you do something like that that'd
be something that's easy
so it's it's valid it it's hard to just
stop trying to think of apps of building
stuff that people have already not that
people have already built cause a lot of
stuff that weren't even mentioning right
now people already built but build
something custom right don't build
something that there's going to be a
tutorial on for you to watch don't build
something that is and it's not it's okay
to do those projects on free code camp I
highly encourage it because that's
better than nothing and it teaches you
the skills you need to go build those
projects that are going to impress
employers can I send you the project if
I ever finish it for you to give me your
feedback please so you're already coming
out of the wrong add to that you should
say you got to change your mind your
mindset this isn't like the secret or
anything but really if there's something
I want to do I don't say one day I don't
say well if it's also like a
perfectionist mentality look you know it
doesn't have to be done or get it
working and send it like it doesn't have
to load I just read an article about
developers wanting perfectionism from
their projects and never actually
finishing or pursuing what they want
because they keep stopping halfway
because the project isn't what they want
it to be but the the hardest thing for
most people who for most people in life
is something about what could go wrong
and just get started and a lot of times
you'll realize things aren't as bad as
you think if you finish a project and
send it to me I will review it yes but
you know what if that's something that
you need to be motivated do the project
your are you gonna have issues now so
I'm trying to say chant you got to
change your mentality it's human talent
you have to get in a mindset and
to get into that mindset you need that
environment so maybe he needs to find an
environment that will help him get into
that mindset because it's hard changing
your mind are we talking about him are
we talking about someone else
first of all the perspective so I can
hide what language or framework should I
learn now and why if you talk about web
development the best thing I would say
is learn react for ducks react native
all kind of falls into one it's some of
the the fastest-growing and most
in-demand and high salary paying jobs in
web development have I decide I mean yes
codec and caffeine for the podcast but
ash this is my appointment is you will
do a lot of things wrong but every
developer does and you will learn from
that experience
stop trying to avoid the trap so much
and just get started and you'll learn
what not to do in the process and you'll
you'll retain it what is stopping
developers / freelance web dev getting a
client that wants a website done but
what's stopping the dev stealing the
idea most here's the thing guys so you
can say the greatest idea on the planet
and most people most people are too lazy
to implement it most people I mean you
know how many people have told me that
they're gonna start a coding Channel and
never do like most people it's not that
the advice and the secrets aren't out
there like what should we do well we
should study every day we should code
every day we should eat healthy we
should exercise we should treat people
the way we want to be treated and we
already know what we need to do to be
successful in life we just have to do
them and it was the same with that a lot
of people there saw from the working
so it's merge stacker mean stack merge
stack or mean stack is great I'm going
down the merge stacker out right now but
I also already have experience as an
angular developer and I'm learning
angular four at the same time so proud
musicals fans I can't sit out over there
people walk by and anywhere where I
could get excellent react tutorials
there are two interactive tutorials on
code can we I suggest you do those and
then from there you go on udemy and you
check out Steven Grider you saw the
number one react guy how about took cs50
no and probably just be reviewed for me
at the end of the day you're casting to
YouTube actually in a lot of my upcoming
thumbnails there ain't no because I was
this is a you guys want to know what a
day in the life of the youtuber is
yesterday yesterday it was like I was
back here I was like making faces I did
I did I just had to take like a bunch of
thumbnail pictures and stuff like
holding cats and I so there there hit a
lot of my thumbnails going forward
because I I should take them all at once
right stranger it's it's a strange life
I live sometimes guys over here like I
don't know I'm doing all this I'm trying
to figure it out - guys could you
recommend some courses interactive
monster-sized free code camp book okay
there aren't too many men that's the
problem
make one there you go make a Kony site
if you're looking for algorithms alright
you want something challenging
go to code fights and start doing the
algorithms and in the language of choice
you
feel challenged yes you might feel very
challenged I promise you
the most challenging thing you can do
though is build something of your own
because there's not a blueprint for that
right so it's that's the thing guys is
that's why that's why employers like
that is that better do them in a
challenging in a language you don't know
no need for that they're plenty
challenging what's the most challenging
project project you've ever made
probably the one I'm working on at work
any good place to find all related jazz
tutorials no man this is the thing is oh
actually I think the beta free code camp
has more stuff going into the Dom if you
go to Veda dot free code Capcom there's
more stuff on there but the I haven't
come across any good tutorials on the
Dom I really haven't I think part of
that is that everybody uses frameworks
so that's part of it you know is
everyone's doing everyone's using react
or angular and so a lot of that Dom
stuff is actually happening but if you
learn react you will learn a lot about
the Dom which is what I'm doing right
now because they it's all JavaScript at
the other day they've really
incorporated that sort of theme into it
alright guys we've been gone for a while
don't forget to use the salt keyword
join the Facebook group I'm gonna throw
the link up in chat right now code tech
and caffeine and we'll be doing a
giveaway there salt will be the keyword
for the giveaway for people who are
unable to make it here whilst we're
giving away a course Monday Wednesday
and Friday of next week again thank you
so much for tuning in and thank you to
traverse the media and
can you tell us Turk how you became a
deaf now that'd be great if there was a
video like on Monday I did called how I
become a developer and so I encourage
you to check that out man but um so
thank you guys I'm for the winners
there's also some great comments on
there for you guys to check out as well
so check that out I appreciate you all
thank you so much for watching make sure
