bar here and we are now for those of you
who are new to the channel or welcome
but um typically what I do is every
thousand subscribers I like to do a a
AMA that I leave on on the channel
usually my live streams I end up
removing or deleting or anything like
that but today's live stream we're going
to be celebrating the 1000 new
subscribers that have come and joined
the herd so if you're one of the new
thousand that of joint thank you very
much one of the things that I've really
had our time finding was answers to
questions mentors that could help guide
me when I had in it when I had a
question oh so that's kind of how the
idea came about which was this and I do
do a lot of live streams when I can when
I'm studying and practicing but I like I
want to leave this up so that other
people can come back and watch it and I
apologize if it sounds like I'm talking
slower than normal but I am making a
conscious effort to remove the Elms and
the ahhs and those filler words in my
speech patterns if that makes sense
I do hope I'd be making a Hey I do hope
I'll be making a 100k thank you video
soon we'll see man it's been a grind to
get to 20k it doesn't sound like that
many but here we are almost two years
later it's been a mission it's been a a
great opportunity to be able to have a
youtube channel or I think not
necessarily a great opportunity but I'm
glad that I took the the challenge of
having a channel and has rewarded me
tenfold with the amount of effort that
I've gone Toastmaster who's Toastmaster
well so I got my share in the Facebook
group which if you guys are not part of
the Facebook group code tech and
caffeine I highly suggest you go and
join
did I take the day off no um my boss's
boss said we could leave early because
it was Memorial Day weekend it's very
nice of him to do that so I got home
it's about it's about 10:00 till 3:00
here I got home around I got off at 1:30
to shower did one or two things and here
we are and I just noticed I was actually
planning on doing a special 20k video
but with how difficult it's been to get
the things that I need for that will
probably get pushed back to 25k slowly
but surely it will come out maybe 21
cave special video I had a special video
I wanted to put together for everybody
did I hear about sto it's an open source
project between Google IBM and lyft I
did not but I will definitely look it up
and if it's something that I think would
be relevant I would love to talk about
it once I educate myself a little bit
about it I have a little notepad here
I'm currently on sort of a hiatus on
making videos until we move into the
office excuse me into the new apartment
when I set up the new office and I set
up my new toys and things like that
um but a collaboration between Google
IBM and lyft mm sounds nice those are
all companies that I would support I
happen to use lift over uber for various
reasons not that I haven't used or I
actually drove for lyft when money was
really tight before I was a developer
while I was still in school a little bit
after to make a few bucks and I happen
to like lift lifts as an organization is
much better now at the end of the day
uber is more popular I probably will end
up abandoning lift I think at some point
in time lyft will either be bought out
by uber or something else
I don't really know I don't think
there's really space for the two markets
cup chocolate on my arm here like some
sort of child
so as I just mentioned these these uh
thousand subscriber AMAs q and A's
that's for the thousand of you who are
new thank you it is one thousand more
towards the hundred K dream and towards
the dream of perhaps maybe one day doing
YouTube full-time which is kind of cool
right
I said home again which is a cool
possibility down the road one that I'm
actively working towards we've talked
about how I'm building a course I have a
business idea or two I will be following
up with shortly after that course
hopefully the the time and energy I put
in the course will generate income to
help fund the project that I want to do
oh yeah so what do you what what is
everybody else working on that we we can
do you think you'll ever run out of
things to produce content on I do not
the reason for that James is I've
changed my strategy a bit now up until
recently recently being the last three -
thank you Paul up until recently the
content I have been putting out excuse
me I have to grab my throat spray I'm
still sick guys what's that
where is my throat right I think
it's in the car
I'm back so the question was do you
think you ever run out of content and
I'll say why I don't so for the last two
years I've been improving on my web
development skills so much so that I got
a job working a software company in a in
a less than soft technical role not as a
developer but working there none the
same for the last nine months or so
eight to nine months I've been working
as a developer full-time now was that
mean well up until up until this most
recent nine months I've been doing
things on coke atom II I've been doing
things on free code camp where I was
working through basic tutorials and
helping people whose skill level was
below my own as I continue to improve my
skill level since then as I've run out
of content pretty much on free code camp
an academy I've done pretty much
everything on those two websites and the
reason for that is those two websites
are the largest when it comes to - they
are the largest when it comes to the
coding and like interactive coding sites
there are some others Oh looks might
like my upload decides to take a
right now sorry about that guys
I closed a few things to help out but
the reason why I don't think I'll ever
run out of content is because I'm
actually changing the traditional
direction that my my course is gone now
that I'm working as a developer I'm much
better developer than I was a year ago
and this will allow me to learn quicker
complete content quicker as well as
opens up a lot of different avenues of
content to create the most recent
example are my are my reseller my
purposes my advise oriented based off of
my experiences sort of videos which I've
been calling ask a dev but I probably
dropped the I'm in the future I'll be
dropping the that title and just be
posting them as videos I don't think an
episodic format is the best way of going
about it and the reason why that new
content is coming about right now and
was in the past is I have gained quite a
bit of experience as a developer and I'm
continuing to grow and I'll be able to
continue elaborate and that's one of the
things I want to separate my channel
from other channels is there's a lot of
fluff out there it would probably be the
nicest way of putting it where certain
channels will just tell you what you
want to hear I never had done it I
typically stay away from advice that I
haven't already taken or I haven't
already experienced or something a lot
of that lies where it's no longer advice
it's more of let me tell you a story
about what I did in a very relatable
situation and hopefully it will help you
out down the road so that in itself
opens me up to pretty much an infinite
amount of content now is it will it be
successful content I don't know some of
the videos do better than others also
now that my channel has grown to a
certain size
it has allowed me to interview people
developers we're looking for
self-promotion or our oh cool you have
10,000 subs let me go ahead and do
something fun you know 20,000 subs as I
continue to grow making those
connections will will be easier and
maybe at like 50,000 I could if I if I'm
lucky enough to get there uh I can go
and maybe go to tech conferences and
report on there that would definitely be
a dream of mine
one one one thing I could see myself
doing is some sort of techie Vangelis it
all where I'm interviewing developers or
showcasing technologies and a very sort
of very similar to my behind the code
thing interviews Thank You Rex monster
for the congratulations and the plethora
of emotes to go with them but but in
terms of running a Content I don't think
so cuz free code camp is going to
continue putting out content coke Adam
II is going to one day continue putting
out content and the idea is that and
there's also other sites growing so
currently I'm working on some algorithm
sites which I plan on releasing content
for I'm also doing my own advice sort of
videos I've talked about and I'm also at
the skill set wise where now if I wanted
to make an actual in-depth tutorial I
think I'd be able to when it comes to
being well enough prepared I've stayed
away from doing you know learn
JavaScript in one hour sort of videos or
in one video or learn angularjs in one
instant you know one video I've stayed
away from that so I've never wanted to
really put out a piece of content that
that would mislead people in one
direction and I think at times maybe
that's hurting my growth but
I've said it before it's kind of
YouTube's kind of like a business in
which what you want is repeat business
and not a one-time thing so if you've
come across something that's really poor
quality once or twice of mine you're not
going to watch any more videos and
you're probably not going to subscribe
but if you if you run across those same
two or three videos where hey I've ran
across this guy's free code camp stuff
I'm going to go ahead and drop a
subscribe here and maybe I'll catch some
of his future stuff as it continues to
come out I think you're more likely to
watch future videos it's very easy to
not like somebody who gives a poor
tutorial but it's um you know because
it's all it's not all about subscriber
growth it's about views and watch time
that's what's most important so I need
you to watch all the videos as I was
going to say not one clicked 81 right um
excuse me
man you know my whole works sick I don't
know if your guys's work is sick that's
also why I've recently started working
on a course it's not only it I think
it's kind I think I'm at the point now
where I can create a course I can
provide value for various various entry
level sort of individuals and I'll get
more and more complex and larger as my
own my own skill set continues to grow
and continues to to go from a junior to
intermediate to senior super senior Rome
right and I may I make it there slower
or faster than others I'm leaning
towards eventually faster the idea being
that I actually do come home and code
every day I do go to meetups and I do
mean every day one to two hours and
because of that I have a twenty thirty
percent quicker assuming all things are
equal which they aren't always but I'm
at twenty thirty percent more extra
study time more exercise
how's that for filler words uh so super
ma'amed what do you think of PHP I need
to learn it from my education starting
this off Auto well I use PHP at my work
and I use a framework called CakePHP and
I think I'll tell you pretty much the
same thing everybody tells me about PHP
or everybody would say about PHP would
be a better way of putting it
PHP is a bitch to learn that is the
truth of the matter is PHP is not the
the easiest thing to learn and that's
one of the reasons that the mean stack
has become so popular and speak being
taught in boot camp because you learn
one stack front to back database whole
whole shebang it's all in JavaScript and
various JavaScript frameworks PHP is is
still widely used everyone's always
talking about the death of PHP but the
the problem with that is may be newer
developers don't use PHP as much and I'm
not saying they shouldn't I personally
dislike it because I think you can do a
lot of the same stuff with shorter
development time using something like
MongoDB and noting Express but PHP
typically is used with older
applications as well as a lot of newer
applications only because if you're
having senior developers who have been
using PHP for 20 years
create these new applications they're
typically being built in you know PHP
and my sequel it's a good skill to have
it will open a lot of doors for you
regardless because there are a lot of
younger junior developers like myself or
either very poor at PHP or don't know
PHP at all moving forward this is one of
the skills I I do very little to HP at
work I do I do mess with it and the
issue that I'm having as a developer is
because
don't have enough of a background in PHP
the the issue that I've been having is I
get where the framework starts and where
the PHP begins a little bit confused so
what I need to do is I need to go and
study PHP alone do my own projects so
that I can recognize those differences
but PHP is a great skill to have on your
on your resume personally if I was doing
a personal project of sorts I would just
be working in the pure mean stack but
that's a newer stack less code to
maintain and the senior developers are
still you know 10 20 years older so
they're going to be using a little bit
older technologies when they architect
these newer projects typically not
always but typically if you're trying to
learn PHP there's lots of great
resources out there such as PHP academy'
or code course on YouTube he does PHP
only do you have a personal favorite
coding style what do you mean
recs monster elaborate if you would
coding style I got code with one hand or
not quite sure
favorite coding style
do you have a personal favorite coding
style like your working environment when
you code I think you're talking about a
development process more than anything
else if I understand the question
correctly oh do I particular setting I
need I typically just want access to a
senior developer when I have questions
and I want to be left the alone um
I want to be left alone the reason for
that is I throw my headphones on exactly
if you guys have ever seen me do any
coding
I should have music on the background
I'll have some headphones on and I'll
just be hacking away that that is my
environment that is how I roll not
everyone's the same some people can't
handle the music and sometimes if it's a
complicated issue I do have to take the
the headphones off and focus for a
second by kind of just like the zone in
not be bothered and if I have questions
I will ask them restful thesis you feel
like PHP will eventually be deprecated
in favor of other languages api's or
frameworks if so do you think mom going
to be expressive no Jess will be a good
replacement
I think MongoDB expressin no Jess would
be will be a good replacement I think
considering that the bulk of the bulk of
boot camps are teaching that stack will
continue to go in that direction very
few places are there to learn PHP can
you code a neat algorithm in Python
please would be awesome what do you mean
by neat Afra Mike welcome welcome and I
am very excited for the damodar on
season 7 I have watched the trailer as
well as the various teasers I don't
watch a lot of TV guys I don't have a
lot of time I probably watch maybe one
show every three days of some sort on
Netflix I do watch anime though so that
that kind of counts and I have three
half an hour seasons I am watching
right now my hero academia attack on
titan season - my hero academia season
two as well and then Dragon Ball super
are the three that I watch every week
which is cool cuz stays Friday and two
of them come out on Saturday I want on a
Sunday so I'm very excited - unless they
do some up although I don't think
I don't think in Japan I don't think in
Japan they have Memorial Day
I think that's American holiday so they
won't do anything usually it usually if
it's a holiday weekend they will stop
with that
Dragon Ball super has good moments and
bad moons
oh that is the truth yeah
Oh coding God is that something new or
is it like the pizza poker guy 87 coding
guys just something fun of and I've been
rolling with it's also going to be part
of a couple skits I eventually will come
out with we have a lot of new content
coming out for the channel we have a lot
of new content coming out for the
channel that I'm excited to make one is
the algorithms that I'll be solving
which will also be part of my course the
others is I am developing a arc about
essentially a Awkward developer who I'll
be playing I'll be persona his name is
Christopher which is my middle name as
well but who it's a right now I'm
working out a five character arc and
based off of how well or how poorly it's
received all I will continue on if
you're fan of boogey I've said this
couple times it's going to be emulate
his Francis character but as a developer
I'm very excited about it I only done
I'm a little scared about it as well
the reason being I've done I didn't one
I did one skit where I titled the video
and said this wasn't with the character
but it was it was sort of a skit I
titled the video how to solve all your
bugs in 60 seconds and it's my most
disliked video of the year ah but uh
that was um that was it um
see neuro evolution of augmenting
technologies is that a anime I haven't
seen that one how do I like the sports
festival arc so far
Rus I am okay with it the show itself is
so good that I don't think they could do
anything wrong at this point now season
1 had a lot more hype I'll say this but
we've seen the entire season 1 I don't
remember our episodes I think it was
around 20 but there was a lot building
up into season one of my hero academia
and I had a great payoff and there is a
much more drama I think I think with the
current season we're kind of building up
to some sort of drama I don't know yet
though it feels a little bit more milder
and mellow but some bad season bye bye
anyway do you not I say yesterday I need
break I did and I am taking a break from
tutoring April and I I do make
commitments though current commitment I
made was every 20,000 subscribers I will
go and do these q A's and answer
questions and I never said I was going
to stop completely
I just we're putting on hold me tutoring
April so that she can catch up and I can
continue doing the things I need to do
and then once we relocate in about a
week we will probably a week after that
get started between the skits and my
course and everything it's a little bit
too much for me to do that right now
nick van den Berghe nick van den berg
says i've had an internship ships today
for education of that for your bachelor
massage which miss which is mainly
online learning online security how
important do you think think these
things well will be i think online
security is great there's nothing wrong
with that and online learning is what
every developer has to do at the end of
it at the end of the day so they're all
gonna be good how important it will
these things be for the developer
community
well online learning as in terms of you
teaching yourself stackoverflow did the
survey we're 90 plus percent of
developers so they were self-taught and
they teach themselves through online
resources so it'll be a good thing for
you to have and security is always great
as well I don't know too much about
online security something I would like
to get him at better 220-thousand is
very good number for an IT niche yeah I
would like to get more than that
especially I feel this is the thing
about software channels and I could be
incorrect I feel that they are going to
continue to grow as software sort of
dominates the jobs that are out there
and if you watch engineer Truths most
recent video about what engineering
degrees to get you had you had like alt
mechanical electrical like biochemical
and a couple other engineers that were
gaining like a thousand jobs a year and
then he had a you had software engineer
which is 150000 III expect it to
continue to grow and hopefully I will
get to that hundred K and be able to do
this full-time or at least do a
part-time I kinda already do a part-time
but do it part-time and get paid like
it's part-time a lot of work goes into
all this craziness who is your favorite
character and Dragon Ball super let's
see
it depends vanko's Dragon Ball super is
in it
this goes back to our earliest statement
about Dragon Ball super having good
moments and bad moments in the anime I
feel like certain characters are way
cooler and way more entertaining than
they are now one great example of this
would be beerus i think beerus was
really cool when in the beginning of the
arc when he was playing around with goku
trying to get him it to become a Super
Saiyan God that was probably the coolest
stuff for me was was just like bitch
slapping slapping Goku around was super
serious now they've kind of made him it
more into a cartoony character but if I
had to choose one character throughout
the arc I would say it's always been
through jitta man Vegeta needs his time
fire spark neural evolving of augmenting
topologies it's kind of neural networks
but with your scratch I think that's a
little bit beyond my my skill set in
Python I don't know that I could help
you started from the bottom now we here
that's right uh for those of you who
don't know everybody starts at zero
subscribers that's one of the funny
things Matt and I joke about is Matt in
the past let's light a couple troll
comments get to him about his parents
buying his condo and basically putting
them through school and doing all this
crazy and the one thing that we've
always joked about is I bet they got you
your YouTube channel too right because
you can't start anywhere but zero on
your YouTube Jim I would like to have
that silver play button I should just
like when I when I move I should just
like Photoshop one on the green screen
in the background saying coming soon
something like that
I'd be kind cool Boop although at the
rate that I'm growing which is by about
1300 to 1500 subscribers it I think it
would take me five more years which
would be depressing but I'm doing a
couple of things to help grow that I
think I think these kids have the chance
of a lot of people watching them I guess
some good stuff
Gino Fernandez jr. says do you think the
fast pace of change in the software
industry is burning out people and
causing them to quit before a reasonable
retirement date I think what you'll see
a lot of times is is that there comes a
point where as a developer you have to
decide if you want to go into management
or in a different field now we're in a
different part of the software industry
a couple examples I could give you is I
could probably very easily transition
into a project manager role or a tech
evangelist this role the and the reason
for that is I have programming
experience once as a developer or for
one as a developer and two I have you
know video editing I'm very comfortable
talking so and VII and I believe my
communication skills are probably a
normal or above normal when it comes to
developers
I can talk the language and I can walk
the walk and I'm passionate about it so
if that ever came a time where I did
feel I did feel I was getting burnt out
I think that would be the direction I
would go into and I think that's what
happens to a lot of developers is
perhaps it becomes too much of a job
which is fair right like I said I come
home every day I code for two three
hours on the weekend more I could
understand how somebody may not want to
do that anymore it's a job where it
takes constant learning at work and not
at work and instead of having a more
technical skill perhaps you'd have an
easier time so learning new technical
skills working with people who are
working with those technical team can
still make just as much money so when
when the time comes if for me if that
happens I think that would be what I
would do and I can understand how people
could burn out
I really can't cuz I've burnt myself out
doing too much in a weekend after being
hired as a developer because I never I
never worked out of that I only done 60
hours on my own stuff right and then I
did 45 there and it did you know 15 20
on the weekends here and then before I
knew it when I went in on Monday I got
burnt out so it's definitely possible
why would you want to do YouTube if you
have a stable programming job why I
don't I don't plan on quitting my job or
anything it would only be if YouTube is
fairly stable as well you can make quite
a bit of money on YouTube it's a
different lifestyle
there aren't you do give up things when
you work for a company one is you work
on their schedule right you go into the
office so you have to commute you have a
limited amount of sick days limit amount
of PTO days you have a limited amount of
benefits if you work for yourself that's
what I quit YouTube - if you work for
yourself you can focus entirely on
something that has allowed you to work
remotely travel with your job if you
wanted it's just as stable if you mark
if you invest your money properly and if
you diversify your your assets
Sukumar missus I have some genius
friends I've been coding since they were
7 I have built game engines with
millions of lines of code jeez and C++
how do you compete with someone like
that starting at 20 I didn't start
coding tell us about 2425 you just start
man hit just like YouTube where you
start with zero subscribers you also
start with zero knowledge like everybody
else maybe they got a head start on you
software is not going anywhere just
start don't worry about things like that
just power forward I should make an
algorithm for my youtube growth what's
my hourly rate I charge $75 an hour as a
freelancer and my current job it's I'm
salaried but I believe if they broke it
down it'd be somewhere around 34
favorite language I love JavaScript
because it's always changing because new
libraries are improving upon the ones
that are there and taking previous
concepts creating a new one and doing
bigger better and badder things why do
people major in engineering if it's not
software computes oft where such
computer engineering mainly because they
don't know any better I would say
because the world in the last 20 years
has dramatically changed and the people
who are advising you or people who like
your parents and people who don't quite
understand the world as it is now they
don't they don't see these things they
don't fully understand it and they want
to tell you what worked for them 20
years ago and there's nothing wrong with
the engineering degree but it's not as
in demand as a software engineering
there's just that's just a fact due to
the number of jobs there and there's a
lot of people who maybe it's not for
them as well I don't I don't tell anyone
to be a developer just for the job you
really have to enjoy it and once it
becomes a job like once it really
becomes a full-time sort of I just do
this for a paycheck that's when you need
to make those choices where I need to go
into project management or I need to go
into a less technical role and start
enjoying your job cos the worst thing
you do is not enjoy your job well I
think a lot of it is just their give
they're getting bad advice from from
people that's what I think it is
what do you think is IT education
necessary to become a developer I want
to be a front-end developer and have a
degree in economics I realize this is
not for me well one thing I could advise
you on doing with the degree in
economics is data analytics a lot of a
lot of data analysis are for guys who
have mathematics degrees financial
degrees economics degrees so that may be
a right you want to look down and going
into a data analytics role now in terms
of front front-end developer I don't
have a degree I'm a full stack developer
I make OK money and opportunities are
opening up left and right to continue my
career path now I've worked very hard to
get here
and I've wasted a lot of time and money
in school before I dropped out but I
think you'll just do fine
if you continue working every day and
that that's really it you need to work
every day even once you get there it's
only step one next you guys figure out
what step two is so I don't I don't know
if you guys believe me when I tell you I
do work every day that could be me doing
algorithms that could be me working on
the projects that you guys see on the
channel that could be me working on my
course that could be me doing this AMA
that could be me going to a meet-up
hackathon it all it all just depends
guys but the thing is you need to work
every day especially if you're trying to
jump into a technical career field
because if you can display those skills
I have a friend right now who has an
English degree what's in English I
forget it wasn't English but it was some
sort of liberal arts degree she has been
working for about a year and a half
doing HTML and CSS and a web design shop
before then she worked for towards
getting a job for about six months
and now has a six-figure salary working
in Silicon Valley
it is is one of those things I swear
can you teach yourself for two years a
lot of people can't a lot of people
can't hold themselves to that standard
of I need to teach myself two years a
year six months whatever it takes it
could take four years point is is can
you every day come home from work spend
two to four hours on the weekend spend
six to twelve teaching yourself this
stuff building projects in this building
a portfolio site coming to things like
this and getting your questions answered
can you do that can you hold yourself to
that economics degree no economics
degree it's it's kind up to you do you
have that mentality to carry on to
continue your learning process now
somebody holding your hand if you can
you can do it
do I use Python I have it in a long time
I plan on reworking with Python I just
need to figure out what I want to build
with it first you enjoy yourself there
Nick
excuse me guys oh my gosh Harry
hey buddy come on you come hang out with
me
you're gonna come hang out with your dad
they turn this off for you you don't
like it all right buddy oh we go
you know Ledo want to say hi say hi this
is Tito he also goes by rengar or HTML
or CSS this is pretty cat of the house
you're welcome for the free code camp
explanation and I am one of the things
I'll actually do as part of my course is
I think it's been over a year to a year
and a half to two years it's been a
while since I have done the algorithms
on free code camp I'm going to redo them
and see if I can solve them in a better
fashion without watching my old videos
and I'm gonna make it part of the course
there's there's already going to be an
algorithm section I have 25 or 30
algorithms already I continue to I plan
to continue to expand that so that
hopefully it will help you guys out
there because I think algorithms are one
of the best ways that you can sort of
expand your brain to think like a
developer but it's always kind of hard
to get there
we don't sticker
what do you think your biggest challenge
is that growing at a faster rate your
subs that faster rate I think it could
be perhaps my content for one I don't
put a lot of time into editing I just
don't have the time to do it I've kind
of attached a mass marketing approach to
YouTube I'd rather put out a lot of
videos then then a one sort of highly
edited video now hey I mean I need more
cats that's it three is not enough
I think there's I think there is a a bit
of a niche as well now I can't fully
claim this because you have guys like I
think you have guys like traversÃ©e
media who are growing by 10,000 subs a
month you have guys like like Derrick
bonus who are going by that amount
you have gentlemen like forgetting his
name right now the coding rainbow guy
who's been exploding these are all guys
that are that are doing great doing
awesome so I can't fully say that it's
because I'm in a niche because they they
are doing something right they're doing
something correct you guys like simple
programmer as well who's part of the
inspiration of doing my more advice
oriented software videos John has since
gone on to do those sorts of videos
about a ton of topics he's run out of
software topics to talk about at the end
of the day because he puts out about
three or four videos a day
but it's something that I am reflecting
upon greatly cuz I do have a passion for
YouTube and I want it to continue to
grow to something where I can support
myself off of it which is one reason I'm
making the the course as well oh but it
it's something that I've been thinking
about Stefan Stefan Stefan MJ says did
you think about quitting when you when
you taught yourself how to code no not
once my girlfriend at the time so I've
taught I've talked about this before
about how poor April and I were why I
was in school and and we took her sister
in and all this sort of stuff
now we ended up breaking up or shortly
after I made this decision by a job at
education dynamics where I was a
technology trainer and that was when I
dropped out of school I told myself that
I was going to teach myself how to be a
web developer and continue getting
better at at code and do all these sorts
of things and once I got a job that paid
me $20 or more an hour I figured I could
survive off of that I would then if I
invoice any developer job I would go in
and I and I mind you I had plenty of
people told me I was asking for too much
money and that I wasn't good enough and
you know I I could go on and on it I've
done a video or a video about one of
them about knowing your worth as a
developer and things like that so but um
anyhow I digress
there was a one conversation before
April and I broke up for about a three
to four month period where I accepted
the job this is like before the date
Dame Forest will start work at my new
job at a software company being a
technology trainer and and she sat down
with me and she said how long until you
go back to school I said well I will
consider it once I get developers option
she said I understand that but what if
that doesn't happen
oh you mean well what if what if you
don't get a job isn't in X amount of
days what if you don't get a job in a
year well I'll get a in a year and one
month
I'll get any or two months here in three
months I'm going to work everyday until
I get that job I've already I've
already executed my game plan up to this
point what a lot of people don't know
that I had a full game plan to get to
where I am and this is something I
encourage people to to in their own life
regardless of where you want to go
develop your own game plan and be
flexible in it I'm not but don't give up
on it there's difference between being
flexible and well this happened and I
didn't go directly to here now it's all
felt no maybe you did here and then you
went to here but I told her at that
moment I'll talk about my game plan in a
second but I told her in that
conversation is there is no it's not
going to happen
it will happen because I am working
towards it and I will get there
eventually
I don't know when in my in my heart to
heart I wanted to do it within one year
I did in nine months I accept it I I
push myself every day part of the reason
day one when I uploaded videos let's
talk about the game plan but that was
not once it everything about giving up
and not once did I stopped working
towards it I take a week off or a month
off maybe once I took a day off
because I was sick like that was it I I
worked myself to the bone sometimes
where you've heard April a couple times
tell me that he works too much that
could be right but I'd rather work too
much than not enough
now that doesn't mean I'm the best
developer ever because I'm not doesn't
mean I'm a developer and I will be
always be a developer in continue moving
forward to be a better developer now
let's talk about my plan and why you
should have a plan as well sorry guys
I'm a little I'm a little caught up here
not I'm not like getting emotional I'm
just sick and I got a cough up some
phlegm
Oh
so a lot of people don't know that I
started my channel as a way of getting
better at software and as a way of
helping me get a developer job that was
out my channel starting I put in my very
first Ruby tutorial and my thought
process was I want to be a better
developer I didn't even really think
about what direction to go into but I
started doing my tutorials I said okay
this is the game plan step one you need
to study every day how can I do that I
don't really know all the studying I've
done has been in school with projects
and things like that but I didn't have a
clear understanding of where to move
forward and what to do so I started with
code CAD imme I continued to do as much
code cavity as I could until I was
starting to realize I'm running out of
content at that point I got an
internship
it was start doing it on the YouTube
channel if you're lucky you'll make some
money from YouTube but at the end of the
day it killed two birds with one stone
for me maybe three it was one I have a I
have a video portfolio item so I have a
portfolio item as close of a portfolio
item as I can can get and it makes me a
unique candidate and objective number
two maybe I get better at coding or I'll
get better at coding from it because I'm
coding more I'm coding new things I'm
coding in various languages I'm trying
to build that that programming mindset
that regardless of the language I can
break down a problem in pseudocode in my
brain and continue on objective optional
objective 3 maybe I make some money down
the road but if you start YouTube don't
expect to make money in the short term
at least from there I got an internship
this is all part of the plan I got
internship I'm still in school at this
point my internship didn't meet my
requirement of 20 dollars an hour in a
software related role now I got an
internship it was about 3 months if I
hired me as a freelancer for $20 an hour
but it wasn't consistent enough and only
it only lasted about three or six months
after back in school this whole time
I'm getting that I'm getting the
experience I'm building up my resume to
make the jump when the time is right and
continuing on so at this point you know
we're like nine months later I accept
the role that meets my threshold I'm
working at a software company it has
like 2030 developers and that is when I
make the decision to to drop out of
school there's a lot of reasons why I
did it I have talked about that numerous
times but the next step was exactly it's
just like starting YouTube channel get
an internship freelance as much as you
can't get a job drop out of school work
full-time at this job that is in the
field that your water came with from
there go into a full-stack developer
role or a front-end developer role and
here we are two years later plan
executed to a tee and now you're like
well your plants done what's next there
is always more to the plan and I hope we
I hope when you're making your plan
every time you get closer to one step
you should already be thinking when that
step is within your graph you should
already have two or three steps but
above that you say well alright Dylan
what are your steps well I'm starting a
course that I plan on selling that I'm
working towards I'm also working on
YouTube more I just invested about two
thousand dollars into my YouTube channel
in my office
for all of this from there I plan on
doing the course and I have a coding
related business I'm going to be
starting as well
I've also have a lot of new things
coming to to the YouTube channel to help
promote it in terms of content in terms
of giveaways all these sorts of things
and when I accomplish the goal on
YouTube what's next we'll find out we're
nowhere near there but that is enough to
keep me busy for a year anyhow the point
of that was have a plan plan
the plan that you don't plan on quitting
and I never thought about quitting and I
knew I would get to where I wanted to go
as long as I put a hundred and ten
percent at it and you can do you just
have to do it a lot of people ask
questions and they worry and I'm not
saying don't worry and take all the risk
in the world I am saying make educated
risk do you do you honestly think if you
taught yourself how to code for two
years and you had a game plan where
you're like I'm gonna work my way up I'm
gonna freelance I'm gonna do that that
the internship I got by the way filled
out a ton of ass posted my resume was
$12 an hour and it was a two hour drive
each way and I got that internship over
someone with a CS degree because the CS
degree guy said no I don't want to come
at 6 a.m. he lived around the corner
also by the way he lived in the same
city I don't want to come in for the
interview tomorrow because I'd rather
I'd rather do it later because I want my
sleep sleep the guy set it up at noon to
accustom for that guy that's what about
tasting in the in my future employer
employers mouth as it should but I on
the other hand two hours away showed up
at 6:00 a.m. as requested which meant I
left at 3:30 a.m. and I showed up a
little bit tired after me where I came
from I said it's about you know Bob he's
like says here you're you're in Long
Beach is that correct I said yes so
that's a long drive so yes but I wanted
this job so here I am and he gave me the
job that instant he says it looks like I
have to call this other guy who didn't
want to come in later
who's more qualified but didn't want it
as much I hope this is going to be
starting something great that's it as it
is thank you
and then I continued to work for him for
about three months internship hired on
for about six months or so
but the my point being is that I had a
plan I work towards it every day for two
years sorry less than that I work
towards it for about a year and a half
to get to where I could get eight months
ago when I got hired here and it sucked
there are some days I didn't want to do
it but I did it if I didn't want to did
I Drive that far often it's been a while
since I've done that internship but I
believe this four days a week
I believe those four days a week it
might have started at three and then it
up some some weeks four five I know I
worked Monday through Friday on some of
those but yeah
so pretty much full-time there for that
internship yeah it was it's about a
journey man that's why I say it should
be it's going to be especially for those
of you who are looking to get a better
life want to be happier you enjoy
programming maybe yes as in earlier like
the subscriber said I don't enjoy
economics how do I do this can I do this
yeah ma'am hello to our friends in the
Philippines I hope you are doing alright
and with the martial law going on with
some of the islands over there
oh yeah guys so when you have a plan
think about it and it's okay to set
realistic standards for yourself I gave
myself one year from when I dropped out
start that job to go into a developer
position now because of the role I was
in I didn't fully enjoy it after about
six months and I was when I had a
heart-to-heart with my with my boss and
I explained like hey I want to be a
front-end developer I talked to him I
said I don't enjoy doing this this isn't
what I want to do what can what can we
do and nothing really happened with it
he did he did do something it wasn't
much it wasn't enough I should say and
unfortunately I not unfortunately but I
felt it was needed because I never want
to be in a situation where I don't like
my job that's the thing it's a second I
start not liking my job I'm out because
as as an individual I should always love
my job I'm not going to be one of the
70% that I'm not saying asked me to
God's gift to this earth but I should
not hate my job in the in the fashion
that most people do it means I need to
be well compensated it means I need to
be stimulated it means I need to have
good people around me and I have all
that I'm very happy about that now in my
old work I had all that except I wasn't
stimulated the tasks I were doing was
not what I wanted to be doing I like the
people I work with I like I really even
though my old boss was a didn't have the
best people skills I enjoyed his company
for the most part even though you made
me a little nervous but unfortunately it
wasn't the role that I wanted
anyhow man somebody asked another
question start a discord server where
your members can chat and talk and pair
program I happen to have one of those
does wonder if I might have a bright
future I think web development has the
brightest future be honest with you
especially with now that non-native
development and mobile apps is happening
so it's taking away mobile application
jobs as well let me see I think I got
something in here how do I invite people
is there a way
I do have a discord code tag and
caffeine chatroom is there a way to to
add people or to create a list sorry I'm
I'm new to discord but this is something
I wanted to do if you guys want to join
the
if you want to join the discord channel
that I'll be promoting in future videos
you want to do it now that's the link
for you to join SoCo tech and caffeine
discord channel I have it up nobody's in
it but me but I will be promoting it in
future videos there's something I was
going to launch when I moved forward
with with the new videos and stuff like
that but there's the link for those of
you asked what did they have me doing on
my internship a little bit of HTML a
little bit of CSS and WordPress
primarily but that was what I was doing
at my internship just posted on my
Facebook page I will but also will throw
it up through a link or something like
that so that people can have access to
it I'll throw it up on here I'll throw
it up right now for you guys
they did some SEO stuff as well what do
I think about online boot camps I think
that you should not do an online boot
camp most of the time I think in-person
boot camps are the best I think one of
the reasons I'm happy to promote that
mountain is because because they will
the great things about it was they have
you live with your other your other
students and things like that that are
part of the program proteus welcome
welcome
fluffy Jacque lit welcome
- bro zoo 1 so if you guys are members
of the code Tech and caffeine group I
just posted the discord channel in there
right now if you're not
good day jordan from canada if you're
not that's the link for it as well I
believe we have officially have three
members pretty sign us up
now I appreciate a game everybody for
being here are there any cyber security
I don't know enough about the cyber
security but I would imagine that just
like most software fields it's a good
one to get into like everything's pretty
much good in software but I couldn't
100% tell you did that did you work on
creating websites I worked on creating
WordPress sites and customizing them I
will definitely include the links to the
description the problem with with this
is restream is deleting my my links or
my my About section you will need to buy
the catback for for 99.99 Rigel if you
would like one of my cats if you donate
now I will put him in that box over
there and ship him first-class now I'm
just kidding uh
uh yeah too cute a Q&amp;amp;A talking about
anything software man you think I can
help out with
although what Mouser I use I use a $10
mouse as Wireless although I've been
thinking about upgrading in the near
future
all right guys it seems like we're
running out of questions
have I ever heard of a game called
runescape I have I haven't played at
that I'll leave you with this I hope you
guys are creating a plan to get to where
you want to go and not assuming that
it's just going to happen and I hope
that everyday you worked one step closer
to be closer to that plan where there
has to be a full stack developer or
anything else but work towards it daily
again thank you to the thousand new
subscribers we have who have decided to
subscribe I was pretty cool I hope that
that you decide to stay and watch the
videos and to the other 19,000 of you
who have been supporting for however
long you missile supporting thank you if
you want to join the Facebook group I'll
put a link in the description I've also
thrown up in chat but if you want to
support me on patreon that's dope also
patreon.com slash coding tutorials 360 I
hope you guys are working towards making
your dreams come true and if you're not
in your ideal situation whether that be
work relationship or anything else I
hope that you're working to get out of
it there's so many people 70 percent
we've said this a million times that
there's so many people who aren't doing
what they love to do and we've all been
there and it sucks and it's hard to get
to where you want to go you may not get
there when you want to but you will
eventually so create your plan guys and
work towards getting there I'll see you
guys next time for the 21 thousand
subscribers special will do another one
of these I appreciate you thank you for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
