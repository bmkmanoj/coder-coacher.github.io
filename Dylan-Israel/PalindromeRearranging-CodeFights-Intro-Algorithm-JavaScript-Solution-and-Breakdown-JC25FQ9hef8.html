in Koda fights doing palindrome
rearranging and exploring the water of
intro but before we get that most
important of all look how cute my
 cat is look at that that is the
cute cat all right now that we've done
that let's get back to business I'm a
little bit fun there but delegate the
point I love my cat so hello my cat oh
yeah so what are we doing here we are
trying to find out if given a string if
there is a way that we could rearrange
it in which we figure out that it could
be a palindrome a palindrome is a word
that is spelt the same forward as it is
backwards now I originally tried doing
this with a couple four loops so what I
found was that I had a runtime error and
I don't remember exactly I solved it but
I was running out of time so what I
ended up doing was I ended up creating
an array that kept track of the letters
as keys and the account of how many how
many keys are the count of those keys
like a we have two A's in this one and
two B's and then we did a little bit
logic so let's go ahead and get started
the first thing that we're going to do
as I mentioned is we are going to go
ahead and create our character array
this is going to be what we're going to
use to set the the keys of our object
when stuff is equal to an input string
dot split all right so here we have our
character right very nice the next thing
that we need to do as I mentioned that
we are going to have an object I just go
ahead and call this letter object you
can probably come up with a better name
this is what I named it and this is
going to be where we're going to append
our keys so what we have to do now is
append those cues so we have to iterate
through our
our array here and we're going to first
say hey does this property exist in our
object if it doesn't go ahead and add it
and set it a value to one if it does
what we actually want to do is just
increment by one so if our letter object
dot has own property meaning find out it
was property to this I actually put
equal equal it's the false but we could
just do not equals
put a knot on here the not operator so
if it's false someone else here so if
it's all we want to go ahead and take
our letter objects and using bracket
notation we want to set it equal value
so that first one and this one would be
a because it doesn't exist in our object
so we're going to add a to our letter
objects and we're going to go ahead and
set it equal to one and just so that we
can see it before we proceed let's go in
a return letter object save it and run
our tests so you'll see right now we get
a B C and but all the values are one
easy enough to fix that so just do an
else here and we will now just target
that object that exists excuse me that
key that exists so in case of that a and
we'll just throw a plus + on it to
increment it run our code now and we
should have something similar we're just
going to keep track of all the should be
safe things up now they're not all going
to be once or thirty A's 1b and 1c very
nice now what do we do from here well
it's just a matter of saying and
understanding that palindromes typically
can only have or not typically can't
only have up to one odd count and where
is it for is the the other ones have to
be even on both sides right so that's
all we have to keep track we have to
keep track of an odd count say hey how
many how many of these keys are all if
it's more than one it can't be a
boundary so we'll create this count I
just call it odd count we initialize it
equal to zero and now we're going to do
a four key in object loop so I just say
for Val and letter object essentially a
fort for each loop for
a object right we're going to say if
letter object and then the vowel in
there for the value rather not the key
for the Val if that value so if 30
modulo 2 is not equal to 0 we want to go
ahead and increase odd count plus plus
and then here it's a returning a letter
count what we can do is we can just do a
simple ternary operator here that says
if odd count or statement is all count
greater than 1 you go ahead and return
false or else is true right usually it's
probably better go true than false but
this is how I did it let's go and run it
and I believe as long as I don't have
any syntax errors we should be good and
there we go so the logic here is just
based off of hey let's break up our
string into an array let's then keep
track of how many of those letters
exists in that array in an object and
then let's find out if there's more if
there if those values if there's
multiple odd ones and if there is it's
not going to work except when it's one
now that I think about it so this pass
though it's strange because if you had
multiple one letter ones this wouldn't
work like this abcdefg would that work
no it wouldn't because that's me both
the same way alright never mind my logic
is sound I am a genius I'm officially a
coding god
anyhow guys thank you for indulging me
