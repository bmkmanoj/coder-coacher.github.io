about to add the functionality of our
quote generator so all we're trying to
do is implement it so that it adds a new
quote with the sent with a correct
author every time that we click this so
I'm sure there's a ton of ways that you
can do this you get really advanced to
set it up with a database I don't have
access to a database I probably do I
could do it through my son website but
we're not trying to go all what would
they say how would they say that in a
mean try hard we're not going try hard
mode so again just a reminder if you
haven't already you're gonna need to
import jQuery and you can just do a
quick add jQuery so if if you're not
familiar with jQuery you're gonna
struggle with this and job so the way
that I would say to get ready is if you
for some reason skip to this point and
didn't take the jQuery course go back
and take free code camp jQuery and if
you if that wasn't enough go ahead and
hop on code Academy jQuery course you
can knock it out by the end of the day
it's like four hours and get a real
quick refresher so weird this is pretty
light but you're gonna at this point
what I my goal is just to remember this
syntax document dot ready function and
then in here we have if you can remember
that you're like 90% there as far as I'm
concerned that's this is a the basic
thing you need to know for they're just
so so what's going on we're saying for
this document run the function which
basically it's like a start so I used to
kind of start your jQuery so in my case
I created a function called get quote
and in here this is where I did the bulk
of my code oops
so when I basically want it my goal for
this function is to click on something
and then randomly choose one thing out
of an array and then just to copy that
index value so we're going to be doing a
little bit of math so we need to choose
a number at random and so we're gonna be
need to be familiar with the math
library so we want to create a random
number because we're gonna create let's
create the array first I'll be easiest
so we'll Kate create an array of quotes
and we'll just add we'll add two quotes
in here we'll say hello we'll just say
hello world so that's one quote we'll do
three hello hello see no no no and hello
guy okay so we have three quotes and
then in my example and I the way I did
this I added three authors so the reason
for this is I wanted to style it
different there's after doing it I
realized there's probably a much better
way to doing it but you do what you do
and we're just trying to have something
on paper and it works that's what
matters it works maybe we thought the
best way but it works and I'm happy
enough with that so the way I did it I
just edited a - and I will put author
one and then comma this will be out
there too
and they're gonna these aren't just
supposed to be at random there you see
author one will be for hello world
author two will be hello see and I'll 33
will be hello sky this was like bananas
alright so those are all our quotes you
could do a lot of ways a lot of harder
ways such as a database that iterates
through and chooses something random
based on their ID number you notice guys
we're gonna very basic let's just
understand the concept so we have our we
ever quotes and we have our authors
actually she just be off there it's
singular
next what do we want to do we want to
generate a random number based on how
many based off the length of the array
so we want to generate either a 0 a 1 or
a 2 ok that's not that bad but we also
want to not just put create oh if do
this create a 0 1 or 2 so we're gonna
use the math library it's the easiest
way to do it we'll just name it random
number and so we want to go and we'll
create math math dot random times are
any either array will work as long as
they're both right so we'll just do
quotes dot length and in our case this
is going to create a a integer or excuse
me a a floating-point as a decimal point
we can't have that so what I did I just
did math dot floor and if you're not
familiar with math dot floor it's
another great reason to check out
documentation but essentially what it
does is it say it generates 43.5 it
drops to 43 if it generates 43.9 9 it
drops to 43 or if it's a negative number
it will actually drop to the next
negative so let's say it's a negative 45
point one it'll drop to negative 46 so
it just drops down to the lowest whole
integer that's basically how it works so
and then methought random generates a
random thing and Bobo quits on length so
here this is basically just a random
number so what do we one do we just want
to take that random number and say we'll
say VAR I named it random quote is equal
to our koats array at this random num
integer and then we just want to pair it
with our R and author it's not really a
random author or in a quote but well you
know this works so our quotes and this
one will just say is
author and don't know
go so we have our quotes array and I ran
away this is gonna pick the
corresponding one because it's the same
random number okay so let's get back in
let's take a quick look at our HTML now
if you if you remember the HTML we have
a quote and an author class so what
we're gonna need to do is to target them
with JA with jQuery and what I mean by
that you'll see right now so we still
want to do it in our our um we're still
working in our get quote function excuse
me I have a brain fire thing we're going
to target these so the way we do that is
exclamation point don't forget we're
gonna say target this class right here
so target this class quote and then we
want to insert this text and what is the
text it's our random quote all right and
also we want to do the same exact thing
except now it's a random author so
target our authors fan class right here
don't forget the dot you're in need the
dot so I know we don't use it here right
this is one of the most pain the ass
things that I don't like by HTML CSS is
the dot is on pounds for the IDS I think
they do they really made it a little
more unnecessary I guess is the word but
that's another conversation entirely
maybe I'll go on a rant one day on let's
talk code but uh alright so we're just
going to target the author and in our
case this is actually random author cool
so we're saying look men do this stuff
so but we haven't implemented the on
click yet so in our now outside our
function this is everything inside the
get quote function we created tooks
two arrays we created a random number we
generated a random quote in a random did
we got a random quote with their
corresponding author and now we're
adding this at these things so the way I
did this is I just targeted the button
but now we do it outside the get
function so we are going to target it
like this just we only have one button
so it's just dot BTN and we want to say
look when you on click on click we need
you to run the function and what is the
function what's the function
don't forget your semicolon you just
want to run the get quote function the
one we just wrote right now so target
the button this is our button the new
quote button and then on click function
run the get quote function so it's going
to save that and assuming I didn't break
anything I think we should be pretty
good here so save it and pray to the the
deivis this works okay so it's hello
world the world we click new quote hello
sky author 3 was that correct hello sky
author 3 cool hello C author 2 and that
was it that was basically this is the
entire random quote generator you can
style it up however you want but that is
generally the the extent of it a little
bit HTML a little bit of CSS and a
little bit of JavaScript to get your
fingers wet this is probably the most
you'll need to know and this is more
just practice than anything else so you
need to know that you need to be able to
target things in your HTML element via
JavaScript and then able to apply
functions that when you do something
except in this example on click you
could then run the get quote function
and there's again there's various ways
to run this but I hope you guys found
this
