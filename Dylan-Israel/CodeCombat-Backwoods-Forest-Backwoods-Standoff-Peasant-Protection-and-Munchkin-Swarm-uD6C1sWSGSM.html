in code combat doing backwoods standoff
we'll be doing if statements arguments
while loops and basic syntax we got our
girl here she's ready to roll
all right just say you say too scary the
Munchkins away when Cleve is ready to
use it okay so basically we don't want
to move and then we want to say we want
to create Rimmer Cleve we want to say
look if it's ready Cleve else we want to
say something so I'm gonna do if hero
dot is ready and then we'll put Cleve in
there how do we cleave again that was
hero dot Cleve enemy all right Cleve
enemy I wonder if we can just your hair
it out Cleve does it have to have a
parameter
let's see if that will work okay cool uh
cuz it's an AoE spell that we don't
actually have to pass in a parameter if
you're aware okay just cleaving where
we're at and not worrying about it where
does it end it if there's a guy around
well just I'm okay with that
so else what do you wanna do you want to
say say something say back up homie
three exclamation marks alright let's go
and submit that see what's going on
thank you
so Cleve back up on me
there goes I was like that for a second
anything is working all right it looks
like that work cool so we got a new item
would winning glasses
I think we're do you have wooden glasses
we're not doing billing grounds right
now because it's a multiplayer one will
come back to that peasant protection
while loops variables arguments basic
syntax we don't have these this is too
fine your semi finest item I propel the
ogres humans must survive okay so far
distance I saying looks setup variable
to the distance to the enemy if the
enemy gets too close to you attacking
otherwise move to stay close to the
peasant alright so this is kind of like
our landmark here
so if distance is less than 10 hero dot
attack enemy and then we'll see if we'll
see if we'll do it correctly so if
there's an enemy yeah I got attack enemy
so if it's within 10 here to check else
we want to stay 40 40 else
he really like move XY 4040 essentially
moved back to where you're at so looks
like everything's going according to
plan
just like everything worked out pretty
smoothly boys all right next up
munchkins worn basic syntax argument
strings variables while loops their
statements so we're slowly building on
our skillset here break open the chest
stay alive so the greens to be this
little yourself just has to cleave
lesson watched Walter loop attack chest
so let's see what is this here check the
distance to the nearest enemy so we can
go ahead and save our distance equals
distance or let's see distance to target
all right so let's do this our enemy
and then we want to say look we want the
distance to that enemy and we'll also do
this if if there is an enemy otherwise
we don't it is if enemy find the
distance to that enemy all right if it
comes close to the town cleave it so we
can actually I want to kind of keep our
comments in line with what we're trying
to do
so we'll say if distance to distance is
less than 10
all right so this is actually a already
doing so cool so what we're going to do
here say look if the distance is less
than 10 and if just this is less than 10
and is ready cleave
Cleve here like leave enemy cool else
here I'll just say attack not enemy we
want to attack into the chest so real
quick find the distance in the New
York's enemy if I find the nearest enemy
if there is an enemy find the distance
to that enemy and then if the distance
is less than 10 and the hero ability
cleave is ready go ahead and cleave that
enemy else attack the chest so they're
keeping their distance right now so you
see how I cleaved right there when they
try the bum-rush me
so they're keeping the distance not too
bad it's a good strategy by them but
it's not gonna work I'm cool I got next
up we're getting our basic flags down
will actually be dropping flags and
moving our character around in a much
more live-action sort of way so I'm
about to kick up a notch so as always
