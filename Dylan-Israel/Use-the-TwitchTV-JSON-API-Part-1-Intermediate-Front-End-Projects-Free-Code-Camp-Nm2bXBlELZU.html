back in the twitch JSON API free code
camp so what are we trying to do we are
going to use the twitch API to one
display our first user story here that
the twitch channel is online or offline
too we want to be able to see it we want
to see who they're following their
channel status if their live and we want
to output what they're streaming and
then three if they currently streaming
see additional details I just kind of
covered that and then we want to
placeholder notification if a streamer
has closed their twitch account now they
give you an array to use who regularly
stream I'm gonna do it a little bit more
complex where we're gonna actually get
their followers using the API because I
don't I don't I don't like this bad
practice hard code something like this
so let's go ahead and get started
all so uh this is what its gonna look
like I definitely encourage you to to go
ahead and style it yourself but I always
do basic styling and kind of leave it up
to you to decide what works best well
this is the general functionality that
you're going to have at the end of it so
to get started it's going to zoom in a
little bit it's going to close this
we're going to name start off by naming
it will say twitch YouTube - reason it's
- is I messed up earlier we're gonna go
ahead and import bootstrap save
ourselves some styling time and we're
also going to import jQuery here put and
save that so for me the first part this
first video is going to be about other
than the setup is going to be about
simply kind of setting up our class so
our our HTML so we have our div class
and we're going to make this a container
the container in bootstrap brings
everything in so it doesn't go all the
way to the edges now if you want it to
go all the way the edges you would use
container - fluid so we're going to go
ahead and get that in there we're also
going to have an h1 here and excuse me
I'm gonna create another div that's
going to store our it's going to store
our sort I'm looking for it's going to
store like our headings and our free
code camp status so we're gonna give an
idea of header and we'll use this later
but we're just setting it up right now
oh we also want it to be centered so
we'll go ahead and add that class that's
already built into bootstrap to Center
this div let's go ahead and close the
div and we're also going to want to put
in an h1 so people know what we're
working on so we have right here use the
twitch TV JSON API and then below that
we ring a little shoutout to free code
camp in case anybody comes across it on
code Penn dot IO and let's see so we
have our we have our little div here
we're going to need to create another
we're gonna create a h3 that's going to
contain the status of free code camp so
that's going to be empty we're going to
use a Java Script to get that so in the
meantime let's go ahead and name it
we're gonna name this FCC status we'll
come back to that later
is that so we have FCC status now what
else do we need the next thing that I
did was I wanted to have the basically
three rows of stuff coming out so you
want the logo the display name and the
status regardless if they're online or
not and this is for our followers so
let's go ahead and get that started we
can create a how to undo this to get it
evenly spread we'll create three divs
and we'll give it class equal to well
first we need to create a row and then
we're going to create a div here and
we'll just go ahead and call give it the
class of kala - MD - for basically break
it up three times I'll break it up by a
third that's basically what we're doing
here so a third a third a third and then
within here we just want to have our
logo we want to have our display name
and we also want to have our status are
they streaming no if they are what are
they streaming and because we want those
to be a little bit a little bit nice
we'll just go ahead and throw an h1
around this whole thing here we see one
two three and we'll close it like so and
then our container and the last thing we
want to do is create a div called
follower info now follow info we're
going to prepend - later for each one of
the followers when our JavaScript runs
with our document loads it's going to
run our get JSON from there it's going
to just prepend out the info that we
need so let's go ahead and create that
div give it ID equal to follower
and so slashed it alright let's save
this now let's just look up but what we
have here so it doesn't look identical
to what we have but obviously we haven't
done much styling but it's looking
pretty similar so at this point right
now what we'll do is we'll go ahead and
hop in to the JavaScript aspect of this
and at the end we'll probably style it
up a little bit and go from there so in
the next video we'll get our document
ready and we'll go ahead and get the
free code camp status hey guys thanks
for watching the video my good friend
Matt at engineered truth has a
three-part interview with Quincy Larson
the founder of free code camp go ahead
and check that out and so you'll get a
lot of really cool stuff thanks for
watching and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
