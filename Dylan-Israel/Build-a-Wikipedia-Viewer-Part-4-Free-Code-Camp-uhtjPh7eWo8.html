code stuff out of the way what we need
to do now is just do a little bit of CSS
using bootstrap classes and clean it up
a little bit not too much I'm not gonna
go into too much detail with it
but enough to get you started so first
thing we want to do is assign a font so
I use lobster not for any particular
reason other than that I just think it
looks nice
so we're gonna import the font lobster
in our CSS file we're just gonna target
everything with this I want everything
to have it so we're just to say font -
family and we're gonna go ahead and put
a lobster so if that you know there you
go
so lobster it will default to something
in the in the browsers this one doesn't
come up but I usually want to put like
Times New Roman or something yeah you
know backup phone a couple usually so
first thing we do is set the font and we
want to make sure that it's working and
on our our stuff here in is cool so we
set the font in the body next thing I
did was I set a background image the
reason for this is the blight is a
little too plain choose whatever image
you like I just grabbed a random a
random image off for Wikipedia I thought
it might be relevant let's go ahead and
put in the URL here
and so we're gonna set the image to do
this okay that looks better I guess but
we actually want this to not repeat for
once so what we can do is take
background - repeat let's say no -
repeat so we don't want it to repeat
I'll make sure you spell it correctly
spell it correctly so we don't want it
to repeat background:no-repeat so cool
it's only there in the 1 so what we want
to do we want and then set it so that
it's fixed
oops fixed and centered so let's go
ahead and center it first so we're gonna
do background - position actually we
won't do that we will do background -
attachment fixed because what we're
gonna do is we're gonna then create a
div that's gonna send a row all this in
the container so uh
yeah we'll do a div and we'll create a
class equal to text center a bootstrap
class and so this is gonna anchor tag
here because we don't want our search
results to display that way so now it's
centered we have this image but it kind
of blends in too much and this is kind
of off-center so what can we do to fix
that we can then set background -
position to center if that's what you
want
I just do to have it but now that I'm
looking at it it actually probably looks
a little bit better to the left
so let's actually take that out as you
can see it cool we have so this is our
background you notice that it's always
in the same position set this up this is
a little too close and this doesn't have
enough we want to give it a little bit
of a a little bit of a pop so what we
can do here is just because it's our
only image we can target the back at my
original code and what I actually did
here was I created a class called
heading and that's what we're gonna do
for our image here so we're gonna create
I did around this image class create a
div the class equal to headings so
that's why we weren't able to go so
we're targeting the heavy in here and we
want to set the background color to
black border radius of 25 okay so let's
see its curve there we then want to
change the display to an line - block
it's gonna bring it in like so and
that's it
everything else is really oh I guess we
could move this button away a little bit
I just targeted the button because I
mean like how it was right up on it like
that so I did button and then I did
margin 1% to bring it out in all
directions I like it a little off-center
like that alright guys so we have our
heading we have our subheading we have
our clickable image that opens up we
have a search here a background so let's
go ahead and put search hello world
submit it and then we have our output so
the last thing that you you can do on
your own is clean this up maybe display
it as blocks all the way across and take
away the styling here but that is the
bulk of our code this helps you out with
the Wikipedia API I
