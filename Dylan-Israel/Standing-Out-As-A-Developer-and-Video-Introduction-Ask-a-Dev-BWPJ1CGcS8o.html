things you can do in your career as a
developer in any career really is stand
out when there's ten people there
interviewing for a role you want to be
the most memorable one even more so than
the most qualified at times and so today
we're gonna be talking a couple reasons
as to why that is and how you can be
unique and how you can't stand out and
also in the past I've talked about doing
a video introduction of yourself so that
when you submit it with the resume or
whatever it may be that they kind of get
a feel for you I'm gonna do a mock
version of that of what I would do if I
needed a video introduction which I've
done in the past and that has worked
very well might I take a moment to thank
our sponsor Deb mountain coding boot
camp go to Deb mountain comm if you're
interested in making yourself stand out
with one of the greatest coding boot
camps out there where tuition and
housing is included so you can sit down
start and build out all the projects Deb
mountain on a serious note has a cool
way of if they teach you and one of the
unique things about it is you built
three unique projects while you're there
I may encourage you if you do decide to
go down that route to take full
advantage of that don't forget to check
them out at dev Mountain comm so let's
go ahead and talk real quick about the
the
being unique and standing out and some
of you may say well Dylan you said that
the most qualified person may not get
the job over the most unique person and
it doesn't mean like one is more
important than the other being qualified
and unique it's like we're gonna hire
the most unique person who's super
under-qualified but if you're both
hovering around the same area you want
to be the guy that they remember and the
guy that they think is kind of
interesting and the reason for that is a
couple things it it communicates a
couple different aspects one it lets
them know that you're passionate about
the field a lot of times being unique I
don't mean being unique like hey that
guy was kind of scary I'll never forget
him I mean being unique like hey this is
um this is I have these projects or I
have a you
suchan on my case or I have a a you know
I wrote a book or you know stuff that's
related to your field that makes you
unique if at the end of the day all you
have is a resume maybe a degree and your
that and some job experience you're
going to be like everybody else there's
not going to be anything that's going to
be very memorable about you but if you
all of a sudden you have side projects
all of a sudden if you have courses
you've built you have social media
accounts that you've built out you have
you have relevant things for maybe you
host a meet-up every week you're
volunteering through code or whatever it
is those are the things that they that
are like they kind of raise your value a
little bit and also they make it so that
you they remember you and one of the
things that I've done in the past and
been very successful with is a video
introduction and what I mean by that is
essentially I have recorded a video
which I in it I'm not dressed in a h1z1
shirt but I'm dressed as if I was going
to a job interview in a clean
environment this is a green environment
but it's relatively clean and I record a
video introducing myself talking a
little bit about my experience on my my
resume right but they should have that
and the link to this video I include in
my cover letters and I include on my
resume itself as well as in my LinkedIn
when I'm looking for work and it's
centrally an introduction to me I want
you to meet me I want to tell you why
I'm unique and that in itself you're
already standing out above other people
because now they get to see a little bit
instead of just being text in words
they're getting to experience you and
that's that's something that's gonna
make you stand out and they're gonna
remember it and this has worked not only
with employers but with recruiters
recruiters a recruiters job is to sell
you choose somebody else that's
essentially their job at the end of the
day they say this guy Dylan you know
he's he's he's different than the other
developers he's yes all this sort you
you're giving them as much you know
ingredients to bake the best pie if you
will or the best cake and try and give
that to somebody say I like that slice
of cake let's go ahead and order
all right and that's the recruiters love
it and the companies I've worked with
have loved it as well and in it I
typically will just explain some of the
things that a little bit about my resume
but they should have it but I will go
over some of the stuff that makes me a
little bit more unique projects I'm
working on things I'm studying that I'm
not quite ready to put on the resume
because I feel like I might be
misleading a bit topics that I'm going
to meet ups I've gone to just to sort of
paint a picture of me and so all these
things make you stand out and you can
start doing this video introduction
today and what we're gonna do in the
next minute or so here is I'm gonna film
a mock video introduction and how if I
wanted to sell myself how I would do it
and base off where I am at at this
current moment in my career okay a
couple things before we go and do this
sort of mock introduction is some of
this is gonna be common sense but I'm
gonna say it anyhow because some people
don't have it so first off you want to
be in a clean environment again if you
have a bunch of noise going on because
your baby's crying
or someone's blaring the TV not the best
time to do it this is essentially a
professional video in the terms of you
are making this you're making a video
resume at the end of the day and it
needs to be presented in a professional
way that doesn't mean you have to edit
it I I'm not gonna do any editing with
it with mine when I do these but it does
mean that you need to have a clean
environment there's not you know monster
cans behind you on the floor there's not
you know a cigarette ashtray behind you
or whatever it is and there's not anyone
screaming or yelling in the background
and so this way if you have to go to
like an office
colocation space just set up a webcam
and film it in there I highly encourage
you to take thirty forty dollars it is
and do that if the if it's so
unrealistic that you and your home
environment can have a calm clean
environment the other thing is dress
dresses if you would for a interview and
you don't know how to dress for an
interview it's business professional I
business casual is kind of how I would
explain it so what would define business
casual it'd be a nice collared shirt
usually long-sleeve if you wanted to
wear a tie I wouldn't blame you I do in
mind and then you have slacks and for
the most part they're probably not going
to see your feet so I think the last
time I feel this film this they only saw
my upper body I didn't even have pants
on so they don't know that y'all y'all
y'all learned a little something today
so just you know dress dress nice dress
as if you were showing up for the
interview and another thing to consider
is plan out what you're going to say
right the worst thing that you can do is
sort of fumble your way through this
it's okay a little bit because everyone
understands that you're probably not a
video God or anything like that but know
what you want to say know what what you
want to make them understand as to how
you stand out above the rest how you are
unique and so to do that just sort of in
your head you know in your head rehearse
and then when you're actually filming it
you may not get it on the first or
second try but go ahead and you know
film a couple of them and choose the one
that you think represents what you're
trying to get across to them so with
that being said let's go ahead and get
started with my video introduction hi my
name is Jenna cereal I just want to
thank you for watching this video real
quick and just introduce myself a little
bit what I'm about a little bit of my
experience as well as how I'm trying to
progress as a developer which i think is
just as important as to where I am today
as I will be tomorrow so just a little
bit about my history my work experience
I got into the space when I was doing my
first internship at a web dev company
that focus a little bit on WordPress
HTML CSS JavaScript and from there I
started taking some freelance clients
through them eventually landed at a
student information systems company
called education dynamics and what they
there's essentially a blackboard or
Moodle and there as in a technology
trainer role which was a mix between a
technical writer and a project manager I
I would do things like create user
stories right
acceptance criteria do mock-ups as well
as crate release notes and training
materials for the field of about a
thousand teachers now from there I ended
up moving to Florida I'm originally from
Los Angeles California
and I has about 2800 miles I was quite
quite the trip but I accepted a
full-stack role at a military training
company contracting company and they
specialized in running training events
for the DoD and things like that and
what I was doing was I was doing green
field development they essentially
started a start-up in the software space
they had an existing business and so
there's about three or four of us on a
small team building out the epic
platform which is a series of training
tools and and analytics tools to help be
able to provide feedback on how the
training processes went as well as can
improve upon I was there about a year
before I accepted a role at my current
work which is it works global which is a
multi-level marketing company and from
there I've been doing front-end
development in angular 2 plus obviously
HTML CSS JavaScript my previous role I
was doing angularjs and PHP in my sequel
here I'm doing angular 2 and we do
test-driven development so we're using
karma and Jasmine for our testing suite
and I'm currently transitioning to a
full stack role there they've asked me
to if I was interested in learning
c-sharp and net and SQL which is the the
backend and I'm always interested in
learning everything so I of course said
yes and I'm progressing a little bit
about what I'm doing outside of work is
I'm currently doing my software
engineering degree online which I should
be done within by the end of the year at
the current rate that I'm going I do a
lot of studying outside of work I've
done a free code camps front-end
certificate which is a 500 hour online
boot camp to focus on HTML CSS jQuery as
well as their back-end certificate which
is node express and MongoDB it's just
something to learn and something to
progress I'm always trying to do that
that's one of my main goals I have a
YouTube channel as well that's
something a little bit unique about me
is as I was learning I kind of
documented my journey and now as of
today I have about 10 million minutes
watched on the channel and it's been a
quite a passion project of mine is
something I continue to do in the future
I do tutorials on there anything in
angularjs jQuery react angular 2 and
node Express going to be whatever it is
I'm studying at the current time and
whatever projects on me it may be a
project tutorial it may be a topic Orion
tutorial talking about skills to learn
for front-end development in 2018 for
instance it's a it's sort of an
infotainment channel as well as a
tutorial channel all compiled into one I
also am writing a book which will
probably be out by the end of this year
sort of collecting my thoughts I have
about 700 videos on there on the channel
which is quite a bit and collecting my
thoughts from those topics into a single
source single source to maybe elaborate
in a in a text way with a little bit
more detail than you can in a video
free-forming video I go to meetups about
once a month the the most recent one I
went was thrown by Sun Coast jazz which
is an awesome organization that has been
putting on meetups in the Tampa Bay area
for quite some time and it's about
aetherium contracts and then nodejs and
reactive components which is the
etherium contracting was very
interesting to kind of see something
that you hear so much about another
thing about me is I volunteer on
occasion through code.org which is a
great organization that's mission and
goal is to spread essentially the stem
to younger demographics and get people
involved at a younger age in involved in
engineering the vols of all sorts and
the most recent time I did it was for
the Florida great American teachin is
about two weeks after I moved down here
I moved down to Florida and I went and
talked to a bunch of young children in
an elementary school for about three
hours about seven classes or so and
answered their questions as well as kind
of talked about what I actually do and
all they really want to know about me
was did I code minecraft how to build
mods in Minecraft and how
much money I made but it was it was a
great experience and hopefully I
provided some value I also do you Demi
courses I've built courses on there and
angular I have several in development
right now about three which will be
released about one a month moving
forward and I do courses on there and
whatever it is I'm learning I currently
am working my way through a 28 hour
angular 2 course even though I've been
working in angular for several months it
is there's always bits and pieces of
things you didn't know existed and it's
always good to expand your knowledge and
try to focus on that so that's a little
bit about me I I'm just a little on a
more personal level I have been in
Florida about a year and a half I'm
loving it
my I've three cats and looking to get a
dog some big animal person and I'm
really just sort of a dork that likes to
code all the time so that's a little bit
about me I appreciate you watching this
video and of course if you have any
questions for me there will be my info
on the resume as well as in the
description of this video my email and
contact information and I'm happy to
answer that it and so thank you again
bye so I think that was a pretty decent
video introduction there are some things
that I would change about it one I
typically try to get it around five
minutes I think we went about six on
that another thing is I probably would
dove into free code camp friends
certificate I would said something along
the lines of you know it's a 500 source
online boot camp 500 hours of estimated
coursework it covers these technologies
I built these 10 projects with these 30
algorithms I'm I talked a little bit
about my code fights how I practice
algorithms there it did about 100 just
to something to get better just
something to show that I'm always
learning those would be the things that
I would improve upon in this video now
everyone's going to be different one
thing that I would probably try and talk
about and this may be one of my
shortcomings is I would have focus a
little bit on team collaboration working
with other people it's something that I
lack a little bit in my side projects I
like to work alone on my side projects
because I like to go at my own pace with
them and
and and make the decisions about them
but if you have something like that I
would elaborate on that but as always
