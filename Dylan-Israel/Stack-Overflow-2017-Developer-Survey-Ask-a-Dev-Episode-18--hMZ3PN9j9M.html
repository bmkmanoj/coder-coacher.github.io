the stackoverflow 2017 developer survey
they they surveyed 64,000 developers and
we have a bunch of cool statistics about
they've been doing it since 2011 this is
their newest one and I want to do
special thanks to Thomas McGuire who
shared this in our Facebook group code
tech and caffeine and if you're not a if
you're not part of the group you should
you should definitely join the link for
it is in the description below as well
as the link for this article will be but
let's go ahead and just jump over some
of the things I thought was pretty
pretty cool I'm gonna do a quick rundown
of some of it so they've been doing this
since 2011 64 thousand developers took
their survey lamia
so one thing that is not too surprising
is that 11 percent of all programmers
said they got coding jobs within the
first year of learning to code so if
you're thinking it's impossible it's not
and then the other no like 37 percent
said between one to four years so within
four years you have basically 48% of all
programmers got jobs or or we're able to
get a job somewhere between that period
of time now 75% developers are
interested in looking for new roles
which is which is funny because it's
such a high demand field that I could
see how that could be true and 53% set
of remote options for a top-priority
this kind of surprised me I thought this
was like oh yeah remote would be great
blah blah blah I'm you get idea of where
all the developers are I wonder if this
is a d3 map I don't know
so well this is another thing I found
surprising to a degree
72% are web developers what type of
developer they fall into so uh when I
say that there's a high demand for web
developers you can see it not only in
the market but other places as well you
can idea what's going on here
and I've talked about this
for how of web developers what
categories who they fall into full stack
web developers make up 64 percent and
then there's back in 25 percent in the
front end is 12 for some this is all I'm
saying once you get confident with a
front-end framework you really need to
move on to back-end technology to really
propel yourself into a role to get to
where you want to get to and you'll see
right here years since learning to code
I don't find this as impressive because
if you count me I'm up to probably about
right here for years but if you count
the professional years I think this is
where it gets much more interesting
because you see how valuable you really
are so of all the working developers
that and of the 64,000 that answered
this 7.57 point four percent haven't
even been working a year twelve point
nine percent so if you've been working
two years you're 20% of the population
roughly let's say five years this is why
I say what's your five years you're kind
of a senior developer what is that
thirty thirty two percent forty percent
about half the population of developers
have five years or less professional
experience so once you kind of get that
entry-level experience you really do
become very valuable and it the the kind
of professional coding experience backs
that up as well twenty or more years
experience seventy-seven point five so
those are the oh geez right there about
eight percent are oh geez another cool
thing was no surprise here eighty-eight
percent of us are male and when it comes
to ethnicity about seventy five percent
are white and no big surprise that about
the next closest one is Asian just kind
of the generic sort of although I do
think this is privately looked at the
previous years but I would guess that if
we would jump back to 2011 that this
both these numbers of male and Caucasian
have have actually decreased I would be
very surprised as I was in the case
because there's definitely a big push
for that disability status most most
people are disabled I don't think this
unable to type that's really impressive
to that 1% and anyone who can kind of
fight through it you know life's a
little bit rougher for them so got
they get through there here's another
thing there's a big there's a big
thought that you have to have a degree
to be a developer not really the case
only about this is about 50% of the
pocket wena bachelor's and master's I
fall into this some some college no
bachelor's degree and then you know high
school as well
so I fall into this about I guess this
is probably about 30% and this is about
50% so it's only possible guys I know
not everyone has the option that wants
to take out loans and things like that
you get more of a breakdown here and
then it goes into more details about
breaking down the Democrat demographic
of how many what's the this 'ti to the
you know a okay it's roughly the same
right how many people are webdev so that
are white and Caucasian and things like
that
I'm not too concerned about that now uh
that goes into more details here it goes
into more education I always find that
there's a good section on here about
boot camps let me scroll down to it
right here oh it also goes into what
were the most popular degrees as well
you'll see by no surprise that basically
the the top one was computer science or
software engineering Computer
Engineering computer programming web
development basically I would consider
these four kind of the engineering
related computer science related degrees
so what's that make up 70 it's about 75
percent or so so about 73 percent 74
percent so about three-fourths of people
with undergrad degrees they definitely
choose to go into a networking like a
hardware or software direction so if
that is something that you are doing the
general direction computer science or
software engineering a lot of people ask
all the time is there a big difference
not really you're gonna have to learn so
much outside of school that you're gonna
actually consider yourself self-taught
by the end of it and if you have one of
the other it's not going to matter
they're both great well you get an
answer here about people who had their
education how important did they think
it was for me
II important and very important that's
about 40% about 40% of people who got a
formal education thought that it was
great
dirty and this this part I actually
somewhat important I think this is just
people I think this kind of falls down
and they're not very important and
important at all it's just as someone
who's gone and up to his their junior
year I can tell you I really didn't
learn too much other than how to think
like a programmer which was kind of
important but everything I really
learned and became a developer I taught
on my own in JavaScript so maybe I'm a
little biased now other types education
90% are self-taught or 90% consider
themselves taught I wonder if they were
able to stay had to be able to select
okay I see I see
so you'll see right here is that 90%
love to say they're self-taught right
online courses on job training on job
training I wonder that just means you're
learning at work is who doesn't learn at
work coding competitions hackathons boot
camps so I bet this number has
skyrocketed I bet this was like 3% in
2011 if it's only 9% now I like this
section quite a bit online how developed
what what ways developers teach
themselves official documentation now
they might still got some og guys of
these 64 thousand because the the
official documentation I've been reading
looks like I'm not a big fan most
of the time but I could see how you
could say that Stack Overflow QA by
point one tenth of a percent is that not
oh this is so this is so true right here
I'm surprised official feel like
official documentation is just something
nice to say I don't think that's
actually true Stack Overflow Doc's as
well look at that Friends Network this
is something I do quite quite often as
well as well as tutoring and mentoring
which is lower on the list I think the
only reason it's lower on the list is
because it costs money that's really the
gist of it if someone could mentor your
tutor here I think that's probably the
best way you can go um surprise um
there's no videos or anything textbook
I didn't realize people still read
textbooks boot camp success this is kind
of cool you can see an ID
people who were successful where they
were when they started already had a job
started program 46% I didn't know that
that is that is abnormally high I guess
you just want to kind of future-proof
yourself I could see that God job is to
developer before completing 10% of
people get jobs before completing the
boot camps that's kind of interesting
twelve percent upon graduating six
percent less than a month nine percent
within three months I feel like these
people right here the four to a year or
anywhere from four down I feel like it's
probably the individual more than the
boot camp so if you're in that in that
situation you maybe haven't been able to
market yourself quite well or you
haven't been actually looking as much as
you should I do think that there's a job
for everybody especially if you've gone
to your boot camp and you have a
impressive portfolio but they're always
going to be those people who follow to
the bottom and I feel like this is them
right here like like what is so between
four months and all the way down we'll
say four months down so I'm I'm gonna
say that you should get a job within
three months of graduating on average
for was a seven ten eighteen percent 18
percent of the people did not get a job
from boot camp before three months that
seems pretty good eighteen percent more
or less program is a hobby
uh this is interesting cuz i don't
contribute to open source projects only
six percent of us you i don't feel too
bad no means only only six percent but I
guess like program as a hobby if you
count my channel but I consider it more
of a second job what kind of learning to
developers recommend online courses are
great conferences meetups boot camps I
don't recommend open source although
it's not a bad idea I just don't
typically think people have the time I
think it's kind of hard this is a great
thing right here get a job as a QA
tester if you really want an easy way of
getting your foot in the door part of
the one of the best ways is through QA
that's really one that entry
rolls so I'm glad to see that's on here
no they just like 32.6% for said a man
these are stupid I'm gonna say videos
fall into online courses because that's
usually what most of it is no love for
no love for YouTube though programming
language this this one was the another
great thing to back up a lot of what
I've been saying and what I've been
reading is JavaScript look how many
people use JavaScript a lot of what but
to be shown right 74% of the people who
are web developers but you can see it's
very important typescript see this falls
into JavaScript as far as I'm concerned
they should just throw that all in one
tag scripts just more advanced
JavaScript at the end of the day Haskell
who we're going back frameworks
libraries other technologies angularjs
wow I'm surprised to see that it is two
point
was it two point two five times the size
I react this shows you how important
note is I've been stressing this for a
while as well I just started learning
node if you want to get your foot in the
door angular Henry or react and node
slash Express right those are the things
that you're really gonna be meeting in
terms of frameworks and libraries for
web development and you see right here
between just how much is being used by
these 64,000 developers I've never heard
of this I've never heard of Hadoop
summer and I've heard a firebase of
court Cordova
I'll haven't used them yet databases my
sequel I use my sequel at my work most
of these are gonna be pretty similar and
let most relational databases are gonna
be similar you're gonna have to learn a
little bit of the ins and the outs I
don't think it's too important unless
you're becoming a a data administrator
but you can also see MongoDB this is no
SQL I haven't used this one before this
so there's relational databases and
there's no SQL databases which kind of
store things as documents in like JSON
objects right and I just started
learning that recently and ma those are
really coming up right now so it's
pretty pretty exciting
you see what platforms 41% of people use
windows 32% Linux Mac all the way down
languages over time so it's been
increasing for 2013 50 its JavaScript's
been going up a lot of these what has
been going down Ruby's been going down
javis been going down so you sharks been
going down C PHP so of all these Python
and JavaScript and node are kind of the
ones that you need to be working on in
my in my opinion based off the stats I
and I really do believe seeing what
people are using really shows you what's
being used in the workplace most love
such dreaded and wanted languages
alright so loved is rust huh typescript
is loved maybe I really need to dive in
this javascript is loved all right
what's dreaded Visual Basic I don't know
I haven't I haven't worked with Visual
Basic
what's wanted Python is of the Most
Wanted and JavaScript all right let's
see top paying technologies technologies
and occupations web developer JavaScript
I think all these are gonna be pretty
similar range up through a little bit
top paying technologies this is one of
the ones that people ask all the time
about like what is and we're gonna we'll
do worldwide just so you can see where
is JavaScript Java scripts $50,000
worldwide so as a JavaScript developer
because most of you are web developers
are trying to be from if you're watching
my channel most of the time all right
you're worth about 50 grand worldwide
sounds pretty good
now Ruby is about 60 Scala now let's go
look at us JavaScript about 90 grand
worldwide he's what you ever in the US
so this is a you know taking senior and
mid and junior I make less than that by
him in my first year coding and I'm not
too far off from that I'm about I
already promised shouldn't say but this
this number I should say is achievable
in two to
years I would say so it's not
unrealistic in any manner correlated
technology's inner oh I like this let's
see here where is my JavaScript so you
can kind of see who uses what with what
phpstorm with PHP of course WordPress my
sequel sequel so javascript connects to
angular which connects node react
MongoDB could drove typescript and you
can see how it could see how Java
scripts very influential like this whole
sort of stat almost like stacks nice a
company type about 70% of developers are
fully employed I'm gonna I'm gonna leave
the rest of this for you but a very
interesting article again if you like
articles like this and you like to stay
on top of these things that helps you
stay motivated I know it keeps me
motivated to kind and I find all
interesting right because yes I am a
programmer and no I don't care about
your app ideas no but I I really like
this stuff pretty interesting article
it's cool to see that what languages are
headed on the way up if it's being more
used and which ones are headed down and
kind of really show you the marketplace
