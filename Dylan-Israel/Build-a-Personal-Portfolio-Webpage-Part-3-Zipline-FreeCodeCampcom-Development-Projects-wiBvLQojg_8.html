second what I was doing wrong I was able
to fix my code so if you remember
correctly this was right up here and
same with this we're trying a couple
different margins and padding's to try
and get it but it kept on doing the
empty space so what we had to do is
actually take our div class page one
text Center and put it around our nav
pills and everything within it and then
at that under nav tools we just gave it
a margin of about 10% so if we do a zero
for something you'll see it comes back
up so margin - bottom we want to push
everything down by about 10% so and
there we go so that's all set to go so
where do we go next so let's save that
and you can see you're just looking
pretty neat nifty nice nice looking a
little little page so let's go back to
our code pin IO and you see that it's
just another background some similar
lengths and then we have an image and
then we have a heading and a you know
some text here so let's go ahead and
create another div so we'll create a div
right here then we'll call this div
class equal to page 2 and let's find
page 1 here we'll just put it right
below it and we'll say dot page 2 and in
here we want to have a background :
URL which one did we land 1/2 so let's
go ahead and close a few of these out
real quick this was the one that we use
right here so maybe we'll do this one or
this one I like this one so if we go
here oops
alright very download that's where we
get the URL that we need so this one's a
vertical one
I still think it will look pretty cool
so we're going to put that in the URL
for it and that will give us our page
two we are then also going to don't
forget the semicolon we're also going to
say backgrounds
- size and you know granted that we're
going to be reusing probably a lot of
this stuff we might have want to created
a class a parent class - page 1 and page
2 but we're not we're not worried about
that right now so we're going to have
that cover it and then we're just going
to set the height to again 800 pixels so
now when we go down we should have a
little something-something going on down
below here cool so nice little
transition and then we have our our
second page so what do we want to do
here so we can start using in here so I
don't forget to close the div either I
so close the div and what do I do now
well why don't we create some more div
so we're going to have a we're going to
have one row for this and we're going to
use the grid system let's use in here
we're inside div class is equal to row
and then we're just going to say slash
and we're going to say / div and then
we're going to give each one of these
div class we're going to set the column
so we're going to set column - we'll do
medium - six and then we'll have close
that div and a row page - alright and
close the div and then we'll do one more
of that and the first thing that we're
going to do is just copy look back at
our page here and infinite what's nice
so for me we'll just let's throw a H we
throw a h1 it up in here and we'll say
let me look out at my h full one is full
on fatty 5.0 m that might be a little
bit much so let's just do H 2 and see
what it looks like / H 2 and this will
be Dylan C is real
alright let's save that and let's take a
look at down below what's going on here
so you see all right cool there's
there's my thing maybe we want it to be
a little let's let's see what it looks
like with H 1
sorry that's much much better actually
so let's add the how did we Center it
Tech Center Tech Center now I believe
this should Center it in our column so
you see how it centers it in our column
and not in the whole page that's because
this column you - six perfect so what
else do we want to do one add a
paragraph so /p and for the time being
we can just copy over whatever this guy
has on his page and eventually work our
way back to it cool so let's save this
and we're gonna look down at our stuff
see how it's looking so look a little
small so let's for P tags I don't think
we've used the P tag this is one page so
everything is going to kind of be
similar on here so it's probably safe to
do it so let's set a P tag that says
font size is 3.0 M now let's see how
that looks
so whatever the normal size is it's
going to be three times the size so that
that's too big let's go down to two and
that's not too bad ah let's try two
point five two point two actually and
then we're going to give a little bit of
padding so we're going to say padding -
top 5% and there we go so that's going
to move that down a little bit we're
gonna have a nice little little font
here and what we may end up doing is
giving a little bit of a background to
this just to be a little bit see-through
because this might be a little bit
easier to read on that but we'll see
what it looks like so maybe we'll want
to put a horizontal row let's see what
that looks like
see if it's any good a lot of times if I
remember correctly the HR slash isn't
all that great
so let's see here
so just HR yeah so we're not we're not
going to be using that and I'll feel
like styling a line so at this point we
have our first page we have our next one
and then we need an image so let's go
ahead and save this go get an image guys
I win I got my image so in this case we
are using an image from my sight so
image' SRC equals so wherever your image
is stored on the internet go and do that
in this case I have one I have a website
and so you can see right here it's
taking up exactly half the page it's
much too big we need to zoom in on that
a little bit so my favorite pictures I
think I've ever had taken on me
if you can't notice that is actually a
cat licking my beard why I'm playing
League of Legends the woman from Target
when we had these develop thought it was
like a ridiculous amount of orange chest
hair when she kind of glanced over and
she's telling me this point Walmart we
picked up Walmart some things that will
only happen at Walmart so I think we're
only going to put in one image here for
this so we can just mess with that
although it's probably bad Convention
just just mess with it I am G am G so
will why don't we give it why don't we
get it uh we'll give it a class down in
me and then we'll say class equals me go
alright so what do we want to do we
won't bring the size down to strike 50%
I don't remember size is a correct
parameter but let's find out so alright
so there's no such thing as size so what
do we put for the height what am i doing
oh my god so height is 50% cool
hmm all right let's try
400px there we go
all right much better so we didn't want
it to be that big so we set at 400 px
apparently the image is bigger than I
thought it was 400 px or that or it's
probably better do a percentage so let's
do like 10% I won't work for height that
we could do it that way so 20 will do
400px and then now we want to Center it
if you remember there was a text
centered I believe that will work for
images also so let's find out no it
doesn't
all right easy enough to fix
I say now let's see if it works margin -
right Auto margin-left:auto okay so in
theory that should have centered this it
did not hmm
