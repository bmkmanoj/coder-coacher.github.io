um yeah uh April's showering for us she
just got home for work we're gonna jump
into day 24 think making you sick by the
way all the more reason I should be
eating this key lime pie that we have um
yeah I think I'm getting sick
I'm looking at myself I'm looking a
little sickly I feel a little sickly I'm
in fit fit looks sick feels sick it's
sick so the I'm ready for the weekend to
be here uh and hopefully feel a little
bit better so last by PI don't work fall
no more pie
so I had to get that out of here yeah
man don't be saying that apple cider
vinegar man April's all about that
all I'm not ready I'm not ready for the
apple cider vinegar oh man
so how many people have been sticking
with us from day zero maybe not
necessarily follow along um how often do
I use reddit never how often do I use
github I don't necessarily use github I
use git every day at work um so I don't
that answers your question but um like
the algorithms you guys see me working
on will be uploading those to github
I'm also be doing several versions of
them on my course so one way that I'm
going to be marketing my course is I'm
going through my channel obviously and
so I'm going to be doing basically on my
channel I'll be doing all the algorithms
that you see me do the first 60 at least
and I'm going to solve more algorithms
on the course but I don't really want to
be one of those channels that doesn't
give away free stuff so up what the way
that I've decided to do it is I'm gonna
because a lot of how girls algorithms
you can solve differently so I'll solve
I'll show my example on YouTube also
I've as part of the course but then I'll
solve a show a second example with more
detail as well um but that's why I'm
doing these hours also I want to be a
better developer and I think it's a I
think it'd be a nice way to get some of
my audience as well I I think I've got a
large chunk if not the bulk of it up to
the people looking for free code camp
tutorials that up just trying to think
of a few other ways to to go about it
well what am I do this weekend we don't
move for another like two weeks we have
all our back up
could someone explain this to me this is
something that I've experienced last few
days why our YouTube users so much more
controlled than Twitter users what is
the white thing from your right-hand
side that you're using what is the white
thing ran inside and why are you seeing
this is our this is rather my essential
oil diffuser um essentially what it is
is you you put things like this is uh
this one's eucalyptus it's essential oil
and it blows it out smells nice and you
know depending on who you believe
there's there's healing properties like
your peppermints not healing but you can
like peppermint will stimulate you um
you can lift just will relax you it's
just Roma therapy stuff that's all of
this I just happen to really like it and
it makes me my thing is um if it makes
me muchas it's just one way that I
distress and I constantly have it on
when I'm at my desk which is something
I'm debating if I'm going to do when I
launch the course or not some people
find it distracting um you know what our
YouTube channels that you know of do
coding coding live streams um well the
coding rainbow does there's a few other
advice coding channels if you want um
if you want to call them that there's a
lot of these junior developers who are
just friend developers at the end of the
day we're like building websites that
are giving advice and it's kind of
strange to me um and they're clearly
unqualified to do so at times like a lot
of times when I when I answer your
guys's questions most of the time I'm
trying to explain what worked for me um
I'm not like the most qualified
developer this is my first salaried role
before that I was working a software
company in a different and more of an
ops role and then you know freelance
interning but like there's people who
have to three months resume experience
it at all giving advice on the the state
of software and it's confusing to me
like so I've been doing a lot of
research about boot camps to talk about
I wanted to elaborate because I've
interviewed probably ten people have
gone to boot camps engineer truth went
to boot camp and I've met out I've met
the CEO of dev Mountain and so I would
say I'm fairly at for somebody who has
not gone through at boot camp and has
kind of been very interested in it for a
long time I considered going to one I've
gone to several introductions sort of
things I've gone to iron yard the iron
yard grad in Tampa I so I was doing even
more research I was following some
people um that talked about their bad
boot camp experience and today there's
this one guy released a video who who
hasn't been employed for a year he
graduated from tech talent south that I
don't mean to pick on this guy but it's
just I I hate when this happens you have
someone who went to a boot camp
hasn't gotten jobs a year later I don't
necessarily blame the boot camp I've
kind of put on both of them but he's
giving you advice about how to prepare
food for boot camp and it's just strange
to me
that you clearly didn't prepare uh if
you did prepare you would have done very
well in the boot camp and you would have
had a very good portfolio and you would
have got a job but if it's been a year
since you've graduated the boot camp
that's on the boot camp it's on to you
and you have no business telling anybody
how to prepare for the boot camp or or
if you just started coding two three
months ago you have no business telling
people how to learn to code that's just
it that's the truth of the matter is
it's very it's just strange man it's
strange that there's all these people
who all of a sudden an acquaintance to I
equate it I call this a tie Lopez effect
Tai Lopez uh at least you had some
marketing skills but essentially what ty
Lopez made made popular is faking it til
you make it and then making it cuz you
faked it that's what that's how that's
out I love it let me say that again is
your name April no it's it's Dylan my
girlfriend's April we're gonna code in
about 15 minutes or so but ty Lopez May
showed people how to make money by
teaching people um how teaching people
how to make money to make money and he
didn't have the money so he faked it
till he made it so it is strange
um Kevin that's not surprising I'll tell
you guys a little bit short a little
story about boot camps I am about uh see
uh I see I got a gentleman whom I've met
on but once or twice but um when I first
started free code camp I went to this
Meetup I've taught I've talked about
this story before where a guy there had
his master's in CS was a working
developer it was like a entry-level newb
free code camp meet up and I had a my
like oh yeah Dylan is a YouTube channel
I think I probably like three four five
thousand subscribers something like that
not ton but you know he's talked in it
and within 30 seconds he looked me up on
LinkedIn and so I guess I said to be
almost two years ago and he and he said
I didn't know pizza delivery drivers
could have coding channels or something
like that that was like some sort of
backhanded comment and anyhow I mean I
just let it go um fast-forward
we're connected on LinkedIn
coincidentally and because he added me
that day and so now he's been releasing
all these uh all these sort of all these
sort of blogs about bootcamp grads in a
negative light and I don't know if he's
bitter because he went and got a got a
CS degree and there's people who are
going down an alternate route not
necessarily better up an alternate route
so it doesn't necessarily surprised me
that a lot of CS majors don't support
boot camps but this that that's why it
doesn't surprise me I guess I should say
um I mean definitely there's going to be
gaps in your knowledge but then you
continue learning every day I could I
mean you guys see me man I'm struggling
with algorithms trying to get better and
better and better it's just one of those
things daily practice continually moving
forward and see what you could do
it's unfortunate though ah because I do
think our boot camps more about making
connections know what uh what boot camps
are whoops um who is April they froze my
girlfriend we're gonna be continuing on
our lesson our one-hour lesson here to
text a software uh
do I feel like I'm in competition with
anyone in particular on YouTube I don't
think this is the thing I think if
you're youtuber in any sort of space um
there's no competition except your
I've of this um I don't think I I don't
really think about it like that cuz I
think I think at the end of the day what
you get is personality driven content
and um you may get you may find a video
that you like and but there's enough
room for everybody if you're putting out
good content or people like what you
have to say and at the end of the day I
don't need you to watch one video I need
you to want to watch all my videos and
you don't watch all my videos because of
you know because I've necessarily even
the quality you watch it because you you
either relate or you you think that
they're valid points so there are a lot
of people on YouTube who do the same
stuff that's all that's always the
that's all that's all it is is like it's
okay it's the same stuff do you enjoy it
do you enjoy them do you not it like
Deena do you guys don't how many people
I I have two comments are here they try
to they do the same exact video I do and
then they comment on my videos with the
link to their video so happens all the
time
no it's uh it's not a dab dispensary so
the essential oil diffusers there goes
nightbot with julia uh but anyhow oh I
don't know I don't know that I'm
necessarily it's not like you're in
direct competition you but you could
definitely have there's definitely a
overlap of like topics and stuff like
that so some topics that I cover I you
know
mark ez says want to say thanks for the
tutorials I got a deposition about a
month ago your Tut's for a big help to
see how it's done in the real world I
owe you some cash from the face cycle
catches up pal yeah money's no good job
man congratulations on your developer
roll it it is a journey make sure you
continue your learning and strive to
continue getting better that's I think
that's the number one thing that I've
noticed with people who get junior level
roles is that they plan on only learning
what they learn at work and that's not
really how you'll grow you will grow at
work but definitely continue your
learning that you're self-taught
learning um you know almost on a daily
basis so um like that when it comes to
when it comes to you too so uh okay I'm
gonna go over my analytics in about a
week
that'll be my two year anniversary on
like the 24th I think somewhere around
there but we're getting to the two-year
anniversary of my channel um and Marquis
yeah I'm glad you say that eagerness got
you the job because I tell this to
people who are trying to be junior
developers that as long as you have a
you know you have the basics right you
have the good LinkedIn you have the good
resume the github the portfolio the
portfolio site and then the number one
thing that companies want to see when I
hiring a developer to groom is eagerness
and communication so be eager want it
have some personality and communicate
good communication skills will get you
very far when trying to get your foot in
the door now it's not going to be the
only thing you should have two skills
but that will that'll help you out the
hardest part is getting started man so
good for you
where do I start if I wanted to learn to
code it depends on what you want to
learn but there if you wanted to learn
to code code Kadim ii is a great site at
free code camp is another site a solo
learn is another site and there's
algorithm sites but that's that's a
little beyond you if you're starting
john turtle says hey Dylan I'm currently
stuck on algorithms and the projects
after them on free code camp
uh do you have any advice for me
well uh I say this and I you just have
to do them you have to visualize it you
see right back there I got a whiteboard
I got a whiteboard over here I got two
more whiteboards in there and what I use
it for is I draw and visualize things
out um I
I'll actually been releasing sixty
videos in about maybe three weeks a
video every day for 60 days to promote
my course that I'm working on and
they're all algorithms so I I would
highly suggest that you watch those
you'll see me work through them and
that's also why I'm going to have a lot
of algorithm solutions as part of the
course where I draw them out and you
know instead of me just talking about
drawing them out you'll actually see me
draw out the the pictures to be able to
visualize how things work and I do
better pattern recognition a lot of it
is recognizing patterns and
understanding how to decrypt those
patterns and there's there's one that
I'm very excited but uh so the
competition thing it's all personality
driven man you you put out good content
and people find you but do they stay
it's about repeat business like anything
right so do you when I release a video
do you watch it yes or no and it's like
how often do you watch it if you sell
after watching one video never watch any
other videos again it does me no good
so it doesn't it doesn't matter if other
people are putting out content it just
means that there's more competition get
those people but of my of my views about
40% of them are for people from people
who are already subscribed to me that's
pretty big
so like usually it's closer to 10 or 15%
what that means is that people who watch
my people who subscribe
typically watch videos so as long as I
continue to as long as I continue to put
content out they will continue to watch
and that's really what you want so there
may be people that put it out there like
I've subscribed it a couple people who I
who are some of these coding channels
that you may think I'm in competition
with or vice versa I subscribe to some
of the
and then uh very quickly you know you
get very quickly you know it's like
maybe egos are developing or it's poor
content in terms of advice or not
actually they're just they're just
telling you the same old and not
giving you real life he's like you
you'll start noticing and then maybe you
never unsubscribe but you never actually
watched another video um but I don't
really think about that and I did just
get an email from somebody from a
channel who got upset with another
channel and someone was asking my advice
about I won't say who know coding coding
YouTube drama but um I think if you're
getting upset about people putting out
similar content you're probably you're
probably a little insecure and you don't
understand how the internet works like
what are you gonna do like like what are
you gonna do you know I what are you
gonna do um what should I could if I
want to start at mobile games Java you
Android is is uh Android is coded in
Java and that's what Android development
is in Dillon how do you handle the
asshole co-worker he broke the code and
said you fix it if you see your boss you
fix it brah the defense re bits of the
situation is um why did you choose full
stack web development was it your goal
along or did your your aim change over
the years well I mean it depends when
you're asking um my goal really was to
become a CS major and graduate I didn't
really think about what sort of field I
would I was going to get into and when I
decided that I when I decided that I
needed to start working and drop out and
you know I'll evaluate if I go back um I
I I kind of fell into it to be honest
with you guys I started doing coke atomy
tutorials and I discover free code camp
which is a full stack web development
site and I was like wow man I really
like like this may sound like a crazy
concept right
but up until I started working on freako
camp it never actually occurred to me to
build a web application like it never
occurred to me to build something and
once I did I really fell in love with it
I was like man I I just made that
it's there it's done I made it I created
it
one could say I'm a crater aka a coding
god and now now but that that was a that
was when I kind of really started to
like web development and I I did a
little bit more research I found out
that web development was on the rise
javascript was on their eyes and I just
did my research man how far where I ins
college eyes in my somewhere in my mid
end of junior year so uh yeah around
there yeah sweet love to the VCR there's
some kids in here that I don't even know
what a VCR is you want to feel old I
don't know Kevin I someone told I don't
know I've never had a co-worker break
code and just tell me off
I'm close to the JavaScript part in free
code camp but I go blank when I try to
work on my portfolio what do I do
also what do you have what advice you
have for those learning JavaScript
um well code daily is the best advice I
think there's really a accumulation
factor and if you don't do that you're
you're you're fighting an uphill battle
it really is one of those things where
you're learning a new something
completely foreign and you have to to
retain it you have to use it again and
again and again you see every day when I
when I do this with April um when I do
this with April
i I I go over what I think she already
knows to reinforce it and then I have
heard I asked questions and she's
getting we've been covering the same
like 20 minutes of or so it started with
it being like 45 minutes now it's down
to 30 minutes 20 minutes 10 minutes of
review and it's the same stuff for
reviewing and the reason for that it's
because she's actually retaining it and
so part of that is you have to do it
every day every day every day and
continue doing it but for the portfolio
might what my suggestion is some people
may disagree with me is why don't you
watch my portfolio videos as I braked
don't necessarily code it watch the five
parts or six parts whatever it is and
it's and see if you can follow along
just mentally as I say when I'm what I'm
doing and continuing through it and do
that for the web applications as well
the front-end projects and see if you
can follow along and then go do it and
go piece by piece by fuse no one saying
copy the code but see if you can
understand the logic as we do it and
then go do it but if you don't
understand how you if you're not there
yet where you can say okay I need to put
something together this this this whole
big application I want to build I can
break it down into the bits and the
pieces and I can conquer that it's going
what's what happens is I call it a
mountain top effect you just see like
the top of the mountain
and you're like how the do I get
there when you're overlook the steps to
get there you gotta go piece by piece
you gotta look at the base just like
your goals right look at what's directly
in front of you but if you can't break
it down into those steps to get to the
whole picture it's going to be a task
yeah bad man mike is a good sir one week
without coding will set you back
probably a month
and which is also why I tell people not
to work on more than one maybe two
projects at a time because it takes you
a second to review your own code to get
back to where you were mentally and how
everything runs what was that could you
tell me more about your first web
project how did you get started what is
the first web project I think it's the
weather API project the hardest part for
that of that for me was trying to
understand how API is worked so at this
point in time I was spending about 12 to
14 hours on Saturday and Sunday so about
20 somewhere between 24 and 30 hours a
week and Cody between Friday to Sunday
and I I spent that particular weekend I
had the HTML up so I understood kind of
the concept of I understood how jQuery
worked I went through the jQuery section
on Codecademy I went through the jQuery
section on free code camp I had done
three JavaScript courses I watched
Eric's bonus one hour video on
JavaScript and watched somebody else's
tutorial jQuery so I understood how I'm
supposed to use this stuff well I didn't
understand was api's at all how do you
understand him I wasn't sure what I was
supposed to do I wasn't sure how to
study them I wasn't even sure this is
the problem happens this sometimes you
don't even know the question to ask
about what you don't understand
like there's this it's not necessarily
terminology but you are so lost that you
don't know where to get started to go
down the right road or to find the road
you don't even know you're on a road and
you don't know what vehicle you're
in what planet you're on sort of thing
and so that was where I was with API so
I spent about 24 to 30 hours trying to
understand api's and trying to undergo
work with jQuery and the problem was is
conceptually I just didn't understand it
and I was just trying to power through
and power through and power through and
thinking I was going to get it and I
didn't so what happened was I asked a
co-worker I said hey ma'am can you
explain to me what an API is and in 60
seconds once he explained the point of
an API what it does I understood and I
finished that project that day but that
was that was the first web project I
just the hardest part was understanding
what the API was supposed to do and what
it was and conceptually I had no idea
and it did I think I didn't know what it
was I didn't know how it worked and that
was my first web project and how I got
started was I broke it down into bits
and pieces before I hit that major
roadblock what I did was I styled it I
built out the template parts I built out
the connectors and the jQuery the jQuery
selectors and the functions and things
like that functions I knew I was going
to need I broke it down into pieces and
I wrote it down nice like this connects
to this I was like okay how do I change
the whether I change it with a click so
what is an API and what does it do an
API stands for application programming
interface what that means is it's
essentially a a connection itÂ´ll app a
restful api means that a company a
company builds a connection to their
database so that you can either get data
update data delete data or create data
typically in that example we were
getting data and what that means is at
an endpoint in a specific URL we are
then pulling data in a certain format
back to our front end and then we're
doing something with the data but the
API is just a connect a way to connect
to databases and get that
data update that day to delete that data
and set that data in various ways that's
all it is and in my case I needed to get
data from the open weather API I was
able to get the latitude and longitude
uh or no maybe it wasn't no I was Mark
EC says working beside a real developer
and being able to ask questions on the
fly is like having that lightbulb moment
10 times a day you should do private
mentoring for new devs and the like I do
do private mentoring and I do do i do do
tutoring although I prefer the mentoring
because the tutoring is it's a little
drain between all the stuff that's going
on but if you guys are interested I'll
throw the link up in chat I don't
advertise it too much because I don't
charge it outrageous amount I charge $75
for an hour but I know a lot of people
are broke a lot of people are trying to
a lot of people are trying to better
their lives with code and $75 an hour
might be out of people's price range
but it's a fair amount I think for a
mentoring session and it's about two and
a quarter of what I make hourly so it's
it's about as cheap as I can I can get
it and still be still want to do it
because the heart the hardest thing
right now is time management
so I tier April I'm just buy this you
guys get it man 75 bucks a session it's
low charge but I try not to push it too
much I love to see more portfolio videos
like you did for someone in the 1k
milestone in our Facebook group bad man
Mike that is I that is such a great idea
that I'm implementing it into my course
so anybody who wants to anybody who's
part of the course one one of the
packages I have will be a weekly code
review where you get to pick my brain in
a Google Hangouts call and you get to
show off your you're get to show off
your
your projects and stuff like that and
I'll critique it if you'd like so that's
one of the things that I'll be
implementing into the course as well I
don't want the course just to be like
hey here's some content thanks for the
money I'll it'll be if there's going to
be like two tiers where one's gonna be
like ten bucks a month one's gonna be
like twenty and maybe a third one for 30
if you really want to ball out and
you'll get code reviews you'll get maybe
some help with debugging and stuff like
that in a group setting so that's that's
part of what I'm going to be doing with
the course as well we'll see I'm still
working out the details on the the other
tiers but I do think and the reason I
I'm offering that it's not just because
I'm a greedy I want to make money
is that if you can spend 30 minutes with
a developer asking your question that's
really why I do the EMAs as well and I
like answering your guys's questions
because there is nobody there to answer
my questions I got that one question
with the developer and a light bulb
click hey baby you coming in
but uh yeah anyhow let's get going now
that the star of the hour is here the
star of the hour our baby so by the way
I kind of like that you've got a job mid
uh mid this goes mmm here we are
continuing on can we pay for the script
subscription for whole year yeah
I'll add an option where you get like a
20% discount or something if you pay for
the subscription for a whole year I'm
gonna try and launch seven courses when
I launch it and then update weekly that
that's the game plan anyhow so uh just
uh but yeah I'll definitely I'll
definitely offer something where you can
you can pay for the whole year at a
discounted rate just good business at
the other day all right
so that's always saying I like the fact
that you um boom gotta be sick son of a
bitch I knew it Oh
I'm just like all you guys now working
and codon I think that Dylan is about to
say whoa he likes that I'm working in
code and because I think it was people
who think that wasn't working hard
enough um all right let's soon so go to
cut academy or think I don't stand up
hey I'm too tired
um
cuddles grit for a donation of $9.99 I
can tell you how I'm a knight god
I'm just kidding man um go to nightbot
TV or nightbot calm that's all you guy
do you'll figure it out from there so uh
we want to go to Kok Adam II we're gonna
start by reviewing what April worked on
today uh let's see here so go to what
are we going to
I was the last of the array and it was
the first of the scope because I always
typing in which one you will do the
first two scope first doing a word Milo
no no I functions and scope this one
okay so this is the first problem yeah
so it talks about set up a function
global scope
Shh
okay see that bar my appointment equals
function yes that is what I don't
understand because it says in the
instructions put up a function that
equals my apartment now when you look at
the hint the hint looks exactly like how
I would set it up but when you try to
hit next it won't do it so anyways I had
to input the code to see what I was
doing wrong and that's the only thing
different between my code and it's code
so I don't understand what the hell bar
my apartment equals function means all
right so write two variables one name
laundry room and set it equal to
basement okay it's not the first one
that it's not that one go does it go to
the next one all right Milo it says set
up a function equal to my apartment okay
that's it what is it know something
Milo daddy's going to murder you after
you murdered your here he's going to
murder you
yeah now you met you skipped a well no
no it wasn't
please get it
so what's happening here is we are
that's a cat
yeah this is it I told you okay write a
function named my apartment before the
console dot log so this is the last what
I put up this console dot log so that
means that these right now don't
currently exist and your and in the hint
function apartment this is it right here
yes okay so why the does it look
like this they you did this or they did
this they did this because I did I did
this but it wouldn't let me finish it
wouldn't let me go to the next step so I
just let them put their in code on so
that I could continue on because I sat
there for like a hour trying to
say out what the hell that was this is
something different
like yeah but it won't let you continue
is it a polygon now because I finish it
once you finish it unless you reset the
code it is you probably had a syntax
mistake but what what's it do not talk
to me like that I'm not in the mood
I spent a hour trying to finish
it out I wrote the code that's right
there I baby I so don't talk to me I'm
like I didn't look at my notes
nothing everything else like that I'm
not a baby I'm not saying you didn't
look but maybe you didn't see it my shut
up that's all I'm saying
let's say to look baby I just say see it
all right oh it just pisses me off
because their hint anyways I know I'm
probably overreacting I'm like super
tired I want to go to bed right now
we'll talk about anonymous functions
another day but anyways it won't let me
continue without man I didn't understand
what this book it was I'm sorry
Thanks
and you know what was the only thing
that was different in my code I don't
appreciate you
hey nope baby no let's say anything I'm
just telling you there you just do that
to me like that's how there could have
been a syntax mistake I mean all right
now I'm just saying that that is a
common statement that you like to say to
me that there could've been a syntax
mistake no you know exactly laughs I
don't what are you getting upset what
happened I'm not really sure I think I'm
tired I know baby it's okay Oh
I can't bear witness to this domestic
abuse I have boys yeah oh if I could
meet the okay baby what was your a
question that was my question
yeah scope question said you had one in
your raised also yeah um I don't know go
through the six month in the white not a
six last one why I didn't complete top
method okay
Thank You Joshua no I mean obviously
there's a bug there but for him they
like say that to me without even like
trying to figure it out without even
listening to me
I shouldn't my side first it's just a
common reference what are you so
of satified it you free Uncle
Joe gosh you I know oh no you can't calm
down what is the problem
I'm trying to remember what why you're
angry no I'm just saying look Joshua
found out what was going on with
Codecademy and here you're telling me
it's my syntax error which I know is not
I just didn't know what a bar my
apartment funk equals function is which
is what they required and had never
talked about prior doesn't make any
sense so I just wanted you to explain
that to me instead of saying while you
probably made a syntax error and didn't
even bother to look no one no no there
was not a didn't volley to look there is
not a there is not a you didn't bother
look I say hey it's probably a syntax
error no big deal this happens all
right Jesus she
all right so let's explain push and pop
we're supposed to get frustrated look
freaking out over here I'm not freaking
out I'm just telling you what you said
how it affected me and I just tell you
you freak out this is what
you're doing thirty
seconds ago I mean yes you were my dance
are you doing what the is going on
that's exactly what happened
I need a what all this is on video
so when you say nah Dylan it wasn't that
bad you're overreacting everyone in here
saw you going crazy when I said
it's probably syntax mistake I hit the
desk I didn't mean for it that's exactly
how that went down okay raging oh
yeah alright let's let's work through
here lock and light out right would you
what are you trying to do hot okay
you're driving fine okay what what is
seemed trying to figure out all my
question was okay so it's item one
why didn't you seriously I think there's
a bug in the code that's it okay it
could be you know baby
only let it go whatever you just always
doubt me anyway Oh down in you hate me
saying it's a syntax there is 99% of the
time when someone's code doesn't work it
is subjective you didn't even try to
figure out what was going on as to why I
had to put that in there for it to work
in the first place it's good you know
why it worked because it's the same
thing you're calling a variable in that
you're calling a function remember I
showed you could call function on the
other side of a variable what's
happening there if your crane was called
an anonymous function and that is
getting stored in that variable called
my partner that is what it's going okay
so is there a big difference between
creating a variable calling a function
and just a function don't don't
create a anonymous function like that so
well the only reason why I had to is
because it wouldn't let me press next
unless I did okay and I'm saying that
chances are that it was a syntax of a
bitch that's all I'm saying
but let's let's move past that fart
we're gonna ask
you know so it says use the pop method
to delete the last element from your
array did you put anything in here yet
choose
yeah all right so I did yeah it's okay
we push these values to the array and
then we and what what is pop you again
hop good so my fourth day baby we may
twenty four days ago well I'm gonna have
an issue I don't know what I have an
issue my what I'm saying is that this
for you to take someone else aside over
me no I'm not taking anybody's side
there is no sides it's not like coke
Adam E versus April
don't be taken sides there's no sides
here
they're simply education as all that is
going on oh so then you should just hear
me out
are you I think you're like purposely
 with me like I could there's no
way you're freaking out over this that's
not funny
just yell I'm gonna get take this anyhow
so pop is an array method that takes off
the last value right so here we're going
to the last value
I swear to god this guy kicks it before
I dunno get that on his head
stop oh look at this look at this see he
can't believe it either why would you do
that so knock it off yeah yeah so pop
removes it so you see how starting
actually this printed out beforehand
but this is no longer there if we were
to run it one more time
oh you know what my issue was um
so when I did the push huh is it running
the push is it adding those last two
because when I ran it it wasn't running
it see it's initialized with these three
values and that's pushing this one it's
pushing that one and it's pushing that
one it's popping middle those
aren't my code though you race at it
because it wasn't pushing my code so I
didn't know what I was doing wrong okay
so you can push with multiple values or
you can push it's probably I think
there's probably a Sennheiser
it's from indexing what how do you want
to tell me it's not like JavaScript
decided to break today you don't
know there's been like a hat going on
alright so um yeah no I figured there
was the syntax error in that one I just
wanted to find it alright let's do some
review
you can be cremated in two essential
oils yeah yeah tell them for like a
grand a pop for every ounce George
Franco just be quiet you want with
higher is this it
water I tell her that your honor but you
know like George Franco's that taking
the easy way out
although I guess it is that statement
work you have to take your battles but
not battle we say it was a syntax there
is no battle over it Java scripts right
at some point you gotta realize there
your girlfriend's just with you
to see how mad she can get you
he thought something all the time so I
had to get him back somehow
oh no yes I do
okay um review every time what is a
variable to hold the volume Kurt a
variable gain grazie
you can edit the stream send it to drama
alert with drama alert doesn't sound fun
at all
alright so good so you created a coin
one alright what types of variables are
there's object array number string
Oh
Stream drupal's boy I'm William
all right and what is a for loop dude
for loop for loop is a reusable code
that can be used to run real statement
for loops are reusable functions oh wait
what is your thing what is a for loop
dude
okay what is it boiler okay it runs a is
it called is an algorithm yeah be part
about it runs code it runs code okay we
can run code within itself till it hits
the true/false statement yeah tell this
statement evaluates to false
sylia value okay tell us daemon
evaluates it all right give us an
example for loop
whoo
has three parts a narrator a statement
and an increment
no
so what is that
and equal go
where do we
we're design get initialized for his I
guess socialize
Oh
Lavar I equals zero your crane
Oh
we're buddy
good now what are your statements do
what if statements do if statements
evaluate to a bullion okay and whatever
else is alice is also evaluate civilian
if the if statement comes out false good
now what what about else's else's run a
statement if both if and else a good
alright let's talk about array Mantha's
create an array with two values in
hi
yeah your stink
Zeca really create an array
yeah
okay so assign it to a variable
so far is equals to that arrest so you
mean sign attorney very I mean I'm it in
a variable
yeah
I cook
forget your there closer all right now
how do we find out the length of the
array what's the method for that
all right so we have our two-dimensional
array what is the length of my array
yeah I've done say to find the length of
a two-dimensional array
checks what its indexes are okay so
good now how would we find the length of
this array the nested array
no you good yeah how would we find the
length of my first index I
you have to target it with its index
yeah IRA
how do we target an index
hi
what index is this
this is one so how do we get the zero
index
with the brackets
and dot length so remember these are
array functions so this is an array
these are arrays it just happens to have
be an array with an array and so this 2
is 1 and 2 this 2 is 1 and 2
my guess confusing in co2 - and - and
you be like oh so does - but there's
really four good so what does pop do pop
take something cool I want you to pop
off that - how would we do
right here James once
No
so these are array functions what you're
doing is you're targeting a number and
pop a number
you can't pop either they're too long I
do Chuy's another
or is the - is that a trick question
damn right yeah you pump the last value
off of the array can't pop a number you
pump the last value of an array so
what's happening here is you're trying
to pop - instead of last index so you
need to get rid of this
except it's a function
no well yes also but unlike length
just
right
good so
let's solve an hour
I want you to add together an array I'll
create the array so I created an array
and it has 1 3 5 6 can't hard-coded I
want you to solve
how would you add all these numbers
together
I remember I'll give you a hint
you're going to need to create a
variable you're going to need to use a
fork
three parts
the iterator the statement
what is the iterator useful it's used to
help with the statement they also keep
track of what each index that you're
going to be going up to the statement
evaluates whatever your statement is to
be true until it's false and then the
incrementer increases the iterator each
time
once I move this up so your
so three parts
they're not this rash man my goodness
so well what are you trying to do you're
trying to add for every value in the
array so how might you find out what
every time buying is to call the array
into function to run it because I have
to use based on yeah and you're going to
use your iterator here use your for loop
tranny use I'll give you another again
all right now for you you're going to
need to use three dot length well yeah I
don't know how to put it all together
okay
cuz I know I need my variable to hold my
array which is going to be mine iterator
but I don't know how to call my aerator
what do we what do we write almost every
time to use that as towards the link to
run through the code I know what I need
doing it I just don't want to write the
money hard-coded and then I don't know I
don't know how to do that I don't know
what you need okay I'm gonna hard code
it and I want you to rewrite it so it's
dynamic that make sense
so forget the for-loop
I am going to have a total here var
total and this is equal to my array and
I do it like this plus index 0 my array
what you doing
plus index on the hard-coding the
solution here
it's pseudocode oh good never talk about
pseudocode is essentially just writing
logic here and then my array index 3
and then that's our value so knowing we
know they're with me writing this I'll
write the values next to it so you can
kind of visualize it so this is one oh
this is 1 this is 3 this is 5 and this
is 6 and so when we add all these
together it's a painless C 11 14 15 so
our answer is 15 now what you need to do
is using a for loop not like in a
variable it's a hard-coding that it
needs to dynamically add in a value here
here here here and add it to total for
each iteration in for them
I could have told you that in which case
I did I just don't know how to do it
dynamically
oK we've shown
do you get upset from you about baby
Gianna no but you're the one starting it
I can hear your tongue will you talk to
her there's nothing to tell wait stop it
okay
trying to be helpful here I know but I'm
telling you is that what is what I'm
saying not I thought this would help you
clearly I was mistaken
okay well I don't understand how to turn
that I just don't know I understand what
you're saying on the logic part of it
but I don't know like the code in that
and the code dynamically just don't
makes like I don't know how to write
that okay so I told you we're going to
use a for loop now what action are we
repeating time and time again right
we're repeating the add is the read so
for loops are used to repeat actions so
if we hard code it and we see things
that repeat more than once it's like
okay okay
okay all of a sudden we there's a we see
a correlation the next thing that we're
going to need to start seeing is pattern
recognition and so what happens is we
see another pattern there's actually
something repeating here as well it's
just not us noticeable
I want to do is this this this and this
and what that is is each one of these is
1 1 this is plus 1
this is plus 1 this is plus 1 this is
plus 1 than the previous one now what do
we always add plus 1 in our for lift
your iterator yeah I know that the
incrementer and we keep track of it in
our area and so how might we add this
exactly 4 times using a for loop and
link dot length well you would increase
it so that it runs 4 times okay you
think you got it no no because that's
not the part I don't get what doesn't
you get I don't get how to use the my
array or the variable okay so I'm going
to solve this hole for instance
so
have I thought about stream on a free
cup games twitch ah I have something I
might be doing for them a little bit you
know
okay so why do we create this tool right
we credit a store value right we want to
store the value so let's start there but
this is new code right here we got so
we're in could anybody
so creating a toll today
maybe we should do that maybe a really
good promotion ah if I streamed for the
next 75 days on free coke dance Channel
us me trying to teach you how to so I
have to get back on free code camp no no
we do a bit of both jump around we think
ice of our total is equal to zero we're
initializing it right what's now you
told sir why do we create told to hold
the value also we can call it mm-hmm um
huh so we can call it so we can store it
store values into it later now
for
for loop here
why do we create this iPhone
as you inner your vote what what is in
the iterator holds the value it's the
item that's going to help us iterate
through the array as well as be part of
our statement so we're saying well I is
less than my array dot Lane
I plus plus
what are you saying Hey
don't just let me would have satisfied
now so we're initially on i-20 okay we
are then saying what is less than the
length of my array is lesson of it
increase I by one free time alright dot
length yes and then we have we have our
scope and notice how the tools created
outside the scope that's how you used a
because I wasn't sure the my array
so
let's look at what we have here elevator
total and I told you that we're going to
repeat each parts of these plus one plus
one plus one plus plus plus
you think you finish over here
maybe
he was shot
so we have add to something and get
values from something
so what's the bar total at the top then
and why are you saying my array instead
of my toolbar total for my total or
total so how many times do we want to
iterate through here
so how would total make a statement
where I zeroes lessons there are four
Luke would never wrong
but we needed to run four times we're
starting I at zero we're saying well
zero is less than four right now right
it's going to run the code that's in
here and then it's going to increase by
one and then we're going to is going to
reevaluate do we run this code again
then we're saying is one less than four
so my array dot Lane where is it getting
that from where's what
my array well it's this one
oh yeah well you said that that was
sorry my mistake it's the same this is a
same array okay so my array don't like
it's grabbing that array and saying okay
there's four in there so that's why it
does I is less than a four so then
okay so
what does the math is it feeling it's
calling this one
because that's right now it's a deer
sorry get down there hello
bully
okay let's see
so
someone snuck of the date okay random
dialing sorry I'm good okay so remember
remember for there's gold here so repeat
that repeat stuff it's calling zero
right now which is one okay so how do we
find the one so how do i how do you
write down that well don't forget you
have a very you have two variables if I
in your total so how do we use how how
does total working is that part of the
function that it's going to be running
through well we have two we want to add
two total that's where we're storing our
value that's a variable we're changing
see how we're adding everything the
total so how do we what do we want to
add to total okay so how do we add to
total
how do we add the variables
yes you do both I do when did we go that
all the time
no I don't know I used specific time so
I can recall back to it so I give an
example far e^x is a goal of 1 + 2
what's the X
you know what is the value of you guys
question no no what is the value of it
they may be what and I had to
console.log to return that no we're
studying the value values three so if we
were to say ax plus plus what is the
value of the episode now for glory
because here's three and now we're
adding 1 to it so it's equal 4 so what I
can just be like
no because we're not trying to add one
to it we're trying to add each one of
these values to it it came off hey Dylan
okay so we got a total we're trying to
add this we're trying to add each one of
these indexes to it so how are we going
to target the indexes
okay but that's going to hard-code it
yeah so how do we and like I said and
also that's just said in the total -
it's not adding to it
while you're doing that baby I'm going
to shamelessly message Quincy
and see about doing some self-promotion
actually wait till after the livestream
now this is just resetting value not
adding to the belly so how do we
I'm going to show you this because I
don't think you're good I'm not but I'm
trying to understand if two variables
give three the error a which is where
the values are and you're using that
also to get the length you're also have
the total to keep track of all the
values you're adding together so how do
I add a total that I'm not going to have
yet so am I saying my array equals total
no you're saying
remember this is running four times all
we want is one index at a time so how do
we yeah but one index at a time you want
to go want it to go into total you're
going to add two total not assigning
you're going to add to it
your oh I don't know I'm going to add to
it sorry cuz it like you thinking
assigning it that's the same thing
that's not your reassigning the value so
what you need to be thinking well thanks
you're close you're getting somewhere
what were you need to be thinking is
total is equal to so so that we don't
override the value all we want to do is
add to it so we can say total is equal
to total oh I was going to say that
damage or you could do plus equals are
not right toll I mean that's a plus
equals owes okay all right so total now
what do we we're gonna add
now what goes in here how do we target
so this runs how many times for how do
we dynamically write the variable into
here the and X variable I is equal to
zero while I is less until Cilicia the
first iteration I oh yeah the yeah yes
think you got it understand it now yeah
because I was thinking total is going to
be equal to total why did you do that
I'm still processing you're angry
you can tell you're ready you got it we
got it
so why do we create total outside the
scope
- Claro not because we're adding your
values to it to hold the value yeah
because it's not only going to exist in
the for-loop scope we want it to exist
outside so we created outside of that
scope remember because it exists nested
in words so we create one layer out
so why do we start a variable at zero I
add 0 in this case because
yes because we want to add all the
values and our race starts and ends in
zero good
plus equals means that you don't direct
that total there we're saying hey total
is equal to total plus this number
how do we target in Dixie's
good
so let's write let's try out each
generation here right below write it on
the ring so first iteration after this
what is total so iteration one what's
value of two so we're going to go all
through folders so total this is the
total is equal to one hope then two what
happens
more total
is equal to 4/3 total is equal tonight
for say five
good
now should we make it harder try
question I saw I think we we did our our
our for the day baby thank God um
that's for news hey get better of those
mom saying say
Apryl do or do not there is no try
obvious what I've been saying for a
while huh um but uh just be truly you do
hmm
a couple syntax mistakes on that good
alright guys uh any questions before we
take off for the day as always I
appreciate you being here
uh hmm maybe I'll reach out to Quincy
and see about about um she should how do
you know for recruiter had a crew center
liked you were just being polite
oh I don't know man what's it matter
you'll find out most of the time they'll
be much more interactive with you so
instead of getting them giving you your
their number they'll ask for yours
make sure you leave your resume with
them and stress the fact that you're
studying daily and you're eager and
again good communication so that's going
to be the selling point if someone's
looking for junior does um
it's been fun guys ah it's 8:15 it's
almost time for bed your boys got one
algorithm of his own he's been trying to
solve today
some just gave you a card if they gave
you a card Colin tell me how your it is
to tell me what you're working on with
technologies your own and go from there
I've only gone to a few career fairs um
well get them interested call them tell
them what you're all about nagging I
don't forget you just don't have any
grass fern wishing that you did
something that you didn't I guess I only
got that thank you for watching don't
forget to join our Facebook group Kotak
and caffeine the link is in the
description if you want to support me
you can at patreon.com slash coding
tutorials 360 almost time for about a 15
I get up at 6 and then I go to bed at 9
I fall asleep by 10:00 I got it I got to
go to spend the next 45 minutes on
algorithms and cleaning up a little bit
um so yeah I'm film on man
a man I promise you guys once your boys
self-employed making his own money I'll
be working my own schedule and that'll
be I'll be out like when those rotating
sleeping schedules where it goes 30 20
different hours a day sort of thing some
days I'll be sleeping at for some days
I'll be sleeping at 9:00 I'll be I'll be
a weird non sleeping person I only get
up at 6:00 and go to bed because I'm
employed individual night
but as I've talked on numerous occasions
my goal eventually is to be
self-employed working on my own schedule
uh get the net buyer who's got the fire
put the fire under um
oh I'm tired all right guys thank you
for watching I'll uh I'll see you guys
next time and I'll be tomorrow it's all
please do you want to lead us out there
yeah you're good code long and prosper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
