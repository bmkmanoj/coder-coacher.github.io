you doing guys uh so we are at our 20
we're almost at 26 thousand subscribers
believe it or not I find it hard to
believe
twenty-five thousand was kind of a
milestone 26 just as important because
it means we have a thousand more people
in here supporting the channel
supporting me and learning to code it
the other day so today is Tuesday it's
about 2:30 Eastern Time normally I would
be at work at this time but I decided to
take a day of PTO and I was a little bit
worn down from driving all the way back
from New Orleans home after Hurricane
Irma had passed but uh that's not I here
nor there what I wanted to say
essentially is thank you too for those
of you who knew the thousand new people
what I like to do is every thousand
subscribers to channel to get I like to
do a livestream where we sit we talk I
answer your questions you get something
an hour long something to listen to at
work in the background and have some fun
with it so for me so first off thank you
guys for for watching and thank you for
joining into the first 25,000 thank you
for being here are my cats safe yes so
we April and I took all three cats with
us we drove down to New Orleans New
Orleans and we stayed in a motel 6
there's going to be a video blog
showcasing the shenanigans involved at
this motel 6 and the trip eventually
everything is good a little bit of dirt
in the house but nothing nothing broke
nothing everything wood solid our we get
throw out some food in the fridge
just power went out for a couple days a
couple of our neighbors windows were
broken and a tree fell down I'm I'll
showcase that in the vlog big you know
big 20 30-foot tree fell down who
basically blocked off two-thirds of the
I don't call it a road but you know the
throat in the parking lot where you kind
of go around your complex so that
happened but we are all good was it is
it hard to find a motel that allows pets
no not really Motel six allows pets the
thing is is we tried about a lot of the
motels law pets but we tried about a
hundred different motels on our way out
from Tallahassee on on out and
unfortunately they're just all booked
they had something Florida had something
like 7 million people evacuate we were
in a evacuation area we left the day
before we had a mandatory evacuation
because I don't know too much about
flood zones it's not something happens
in California all that often but flood
zones essentially our areas that are
more likely to flood and zone a it's the
most likely zombie is the second most it
goes all the way up to e so weird zombie
is so when they evacuated zone a we we
we said you know what let's go you know
like let's let's not stick around right
what's the worst case scenario the worst
case scenarios were here and it floods
and we're completely hating life and you
know going on a mission right the best
case scenario is we leave we leave
nothing at risk our cats come with us
and we pack up the car with our cam
goods and all that so yeah it's tiring
I'm exhausted right now but I wanted to
do this last year because it's probably
only day I'll be able to do it in a
while the cats were fine man they they
they me out a little bit
milah threw up on Tino at about 20
minutes into the to the drive we had to
we had to clean him off but after that
they were good unfortunately getting out
of Florida to New Orleans took about 19
hours which is normally about
nine and a half to ten hour drive and
then getting back in took about 12 hours
but um yeah so it was a little
interesting I definitely have some
videos and showcase the they don't use
chaos is free dramatic but the the the
the shenanigans that was going on with
getting gas and people running out of
gas and traffic and we had to turn we
were wheat so the we packed that we had
everything prepared except I didn't
really anticipate how I thought okay
well my tank can go about 400 miles and
I was like we'll be able to get gas at
400 miles so I didn't really think we
were gonna need a gas caster and we
weren't I wasn't convinced we were gonna
leave anyhow until the storm actually
curved closer to the Tampa Bay area
instead of going up the East Coast like
everybody said so as really the deciding
factor when we left and so gas was the
only thing we do have now we have two
gas canisters we brought them back with
us when we came back for New Orleans but
yeah every everything's good
just after awesome food use some PTO for
for Friday Monday and Tuesday today
slept in till about 10:00 which is about
four hours longer than I normally do and
just trying to get back into the grind
right uh
get back to life starting your job on
Monday and this job on Friday and
unfortunately had the use of PTO for the
last three days but I'll work late the
next two days make sure everyone's good
and I'm always as a developer you should
always make yourself available if you
want to be on good terms with your
previous work so they have some
questions about your code and things
like that I think it's important that
you answer those calls and that you you
you know they believe in pay you I know
I know I'm not going to do this but I
know several developer friends who they
had to actually call in other developers
that used to work for them and they
charge five times their hourly rate and
the reason for that is because you know
it's outside of work and they
you know they charge a premium it's fine
but uh as lonely a family personally I
probably just go in and spend an hour
and if they want anything more than that
I don't imagine that to be the case I'm
gonna finish up my tasks before I leave
and all that sort of stuff
but it's been a long week so anyhow the
reason I like doing these live streams
every every thousand subscribers is I
want to give back I want to try and
offer one way of you know one guys
one guy's thoughts on your your problems
your issues so if there's any topics any
questions that I can answer to try and
help out I'm happy to do that I am a
little fried be honest just because we
drove we got back here at about eleven
that was about twelve hours of driving I
basically spent two and a half to three
days in a motel 6 watching Law &amp;amp; Order I
couldn't get the internet you if some of
you saw I did a live stream a couple of
days back in the I tried to do a live
stream the hotel it came out awful
because of the bootleg ass internet
which is just one of the great features
of of the motel 6 but uh yeah well
there'll be a lot of coders don't stay
in Florida you know I don't I don't
think I think it you just have a lot of
people who decided not to stay and risk
here I've so like for me I don't own
this apartment I have flood insurance
the only thing the only thing that
matters is April myself and the cats and
the only thing of value we took with me
was my PC everything else we're just put
on top shelf we left it say hey if it's
here only come back great if not
hopefully insurance won't be shady and
we'll take care of it I filmed the video
before we left of all our stuff right so
I'm ed welcome welcome sir so but yeah
so it's it's been a it's been a journey
just do in life right
26 thousand subscribers pretty exciting
for those who don't know I'm working on
a how to make a coding channel of course
pretty excited about that actually I
think it's gonna be a unique project
that hasn't really been covered and a
lot of you guys seem very interested in
it so I think I think not only want to
enjoy making it and can provide value
but I also think that it'll be something
that you will enjoy it'll be my first
course I've ever made so I don't have
the biggest channel in the world 26,000
isn't a lot it's it's more than I
thought I would get anytime soon and I
promise to that but I do think that if
you want something to help you get
started with coding channel and really
understand what it can do for you I
think I can provide some insight so I
wanted to have my first course be unique
and it's hard when you're competing
against
you know developers with twenty years or
ten years experience and stuff like that
so like for me I always want to I want
to put out a quality product so this is
something that I thought I could do very
well at so I'm excited to be working on
that I wanted to have that done by the
end of this month it doesn't look like
with the hurricane and the job
transitions and all that that out that
will happen but it all comes - so that's
exciting
on my end definitely doing the podcast
with Nicolas Espinoza who is a hack
reactor grad just left his job for a new
startup used before that was working at
Bank of America and very smart guy very
very in depth into a lot of these more
complex things such as functional
programming and all this great stuff
my school full stack web dev is in a
different city so it takes me four to
five hours from door to door every day
who 4 to 5 hours of driving roundtrip
this is why I recommend em mountain man
def Mountain includes housing I get
super tired each tank can't do as much
as 4i I understand man four to five
hours is gonna kill you
those are LA traffic rates man uh-huh
well the fog machine be included a you
guys see if you've been fought if you've
been on the Facebook page
you guys are catching on some of you
guys are jumping on the bandwagon I'm
the oil diffuser David yang welcome uh
so 26,000 pretty cool man
it's uh it's an interesting thing having
a YouTube channel because for me is
become so much more than just a video
portfolio which was always the goal in
my in my case I want to show somebody
that I'm a I'm a passion developer and I
can explain my code via video and I will
continue to get better and it's become
such a a cornerstone of my life that uh
it's not something I ever expected which
is very very humbling and very exciting
which is why I'm excited to make the
course so that you can kind of do with
it what you will and maybe I can help
you avoid some of the mistakes I made
along the way speaking of trying to get
started right now there is a great
Humble Bundle on
it's called texture tech job for dummy
so I'm gonna throw it up in the chat
here if you guys are interested but they
if you're a fan of the dummies books
like I am they have for one dollar you
can get your dream career for dummies
resumes for dummies job search letters
for dummies and productivity
productivity for dummies if you go up to
eight or more you start getting books on
how to get a coding job game development
social media LinkedIn profile
optimization and give me a web
development job
there's something I think you guys might
be interested in so I posted the link in
chat it's also in the description if
you're interested in that I think that I
think it's I'm including in a video
coming up but I think that for $15 you
get 12 books all on how to get jobs in
software how to have a better resume how
to have a good LinkedIn all stuff I've
been talking about here are some books
and even if you pick up a couple things
it's they'll teach you a lot of a lot of
good stuff along the way um keep doing
what you're doing you'll be f50 came for
you note amen under care bus baby
we're only or only 26% of the way there
that's a F that's an F we got to get out
of the episode so uh I want my I want my
play button I really do yeah we're
working hard I'm not going anywhere
I enjoy this too much I really do the
money is okay I don't make a ton of
money but always it will always get get
better as you get larger and stuff like
that and I'm learning to monetize it and
I would say I'm learning I've know how
to monetize it but now I'm actually
implementing the monetization which I
don't know if you guys have ever got
paid for doing something you love it's
much better than doing something you
love and not getting paid okay so is it
makes it that much better yarn so that's
all that's all that's one way of putting
it okay not a very clever way but it's
just definitely a truth how much content
would be enough for a video portfolio
you did mention that was your original
intent it kind of kind of pens right so
so in my case I was doing my Co kami
tutorials free code camp tutorials it
depends on what your goal is if you just
want to build your projects out and
showcase it that way that's always cool
for me I was just trying to put up as
content as possible I think it's about
the quality of your content if your role
is really a video portfolio now that was
my goal I don't say I don't necessarily
say that I implemented it the best I
think if you have projects on your
github if you went and actually did a
maybe a tutorial showcasing how your
project works the features it has and
actually walking through the code that
would be one way of creating a video for
flowing you could do that for just a
single project on a single project basis
am i investing in crypto currencies I am
indeed I'm using a lot of these very
shady you know earn 1% a day back sort
of things through control finance
although it looks like that one's about
to shut down we're all about to get
scammed out of our money
there's also there's also a bit Petite
which is pretty cool which bid petit
comm if you if you're interested let me
go ahead and throw in my affiliate link
so you get a little bit of extra money
and I get a little bit of extra money
but essentially what bid 15 is is you
actually are lending your money for six
or nine week increments and you're
earning back on the weekdays of on a
6-week one you earn four point five
percent interest per day and at the end
of your six weeks you'll get one hundred
and forty-seven percent total return or
basically forty-seven percent on your
money in six weeks oh there's my link
right there if you use it you'll get a
little bit money I'll get a little bit
money although sort of good stuff but I
am investing in crypto currencies via
bit petite there's also another one I'm
using which is which is bit connect bit
Connect is interesting in the fact that
the way that it works is they don't
actually guarantee you an interest rate
the way big kinetic works is they have
their own software that by
so high and low that's the objective of
it and your money based on how much you
invest you earn an interest rate back on
that so let's say they earn 5% maybe you
get 4% of it I don't know the exact
breakdown but you get a percent of
interest every day based off how well
their algorithm does you don't lose
money that day but you get a percent
back when you when you make money and if
you're interested in that to help me out
and for you to get started there's the
bit connect one as well and the way that
it works is you get your interest back
and you can get you know I've seen
people get as high as 58% back in one in
one month don't expect returns like that
though that is a that is a very high
return some reason I won't let me throw
that in there huh thinks I'm spamming my
own side how strange
yeah it's bit connect comm if you want
to use my reference number it's coding
360 but at the end of depending on how
much you invest at the end of two
hundred ninety nine days you'll get your
entire deposit back in one bulk one bulk
statement one bulk one bulk description
and on top of that you'll also get your
interest back daily and you can withdraw
it and however much you want now all the
things I've told you about our very very
high reward high risk and a lot of them
are considered scams at times because
they do eventually shut down but big
connect is probably the most respected
control Finance looks like it may be
shutting down this exact moment and then
and then bit petite I've had no issue so
when you are going about investing in
these sort of crypto currency trading
investment companies do know that it is
highly volatile highly shady we're
talking about digital money at the end
of the day I'll definitely put in the
description as well here
well I forgot to put the link in there
so bit Connect there and then if you
guys are interested in the Humble Bundle
I'll put it right below there as well
you may have to refresh the page to see
the updated portfolio but big connect is
in there and uh well I'm but but yeah so
I I invest that way have you looked at
big connects github I have not looked at
their github it's totally a Ponzi scheme
hundred percent I would not even try and
tell you that it's not a Ponzi scheme
so there's definitely aspects of it that
are Ponzi schemes and so I would I
wouldn't even try and argue uh that's
not you like Robin Hood Robin Hood it's
a legit non Ponzi scheme wait but um
again I also say that we're talking
about digital currency so that I have
like about a thousand dollars spread out
between the three of them so if you do
take that chance just know what it is
what it is right so the bulk of my
investments in cryptocurrency is just me
buying on coinbase and if you're
interested in that I will go ahead and
share my link with you and you can get
ten dollars first time you buy or sit on
on some really actually keep their
Africa but coinbase I have I have some
money going into coin base right now and
basically I'm just sitting on it I just
buy like coin aetherium and Bitcoin
whenever I can and sit on it and
although right now I bought some in the
markets crashing horribly so I think
I've already lost about twenty dollars
for the day on my three hundred dollar
purchase
but um yeah i do i do biker club
currencies but this is what I'll say if
you are looking to get started with
crypto currencies have it be at at most
one third of your total investments
because all this stuff guys is really
the sort of Wild West sort of you don't
know what's gonna happen because it's
never happened before so be prepared in
and when you use something like control
finance when you use something like bit
connect bit petite be prepared to lose
that money uh and if you don't great but
but truly just understand that coinbase
you're gonna do fine but uh because all
you're doing is sitting on it buying and
selling you actually have that the other
chat places you're actually giving your
money and here's my coin base as well if
you guys you want to get your point base
there you'll get ten dollars a free
Bitcoin when you when you wanna buy or
sell a hundred dollars first how is your
area after the hurricane electricity is
up in some places it's not everywhere
gasoline is still out and the grocery
store we just went to Walmart a lot of
the shelves are still empty so it's
slowly coming back together I think I
think most people will slowly get all
their shit together piece by piece but I
mean we are we are at the a stage where
it people just got back in town like
yesterday basically but you know what
can you expect at the other day of
everyone is slowly but surely gonna
restock and you know there's water now
they it's not like
the you know Walmart's are empty they
just don't have everything do you
foresee the groceries to find their way
back sister yeah of course
when we drove in the the roads had been
cleared and we were able to drive in but
I would say about half of the places on
the way back in had had electricity I
know that my corporate office and campin
doesn't have electricity while my my my
work in st. Petersburg does and my house
does so it just depends on where you're
at just one of those things it's just uh
that they're getting it all back up
slowly but surely but it I mean it is
gonna be a process right so I I don't
know how the the hardest area hit was in
the Miami Donna area a County which is
in South Florida and last I heard I
haven't checked today but yesterday they
said that seventy percent of the county
was without power which a lot of people
men so yeah but seventy percent of the
county without power I'm sure they're
working on it and when we when we drove
in we saw 20 30 or 40 trucks electrical
trucks driving in like they're going to
warm and just want to look at another
after another going into to handle
business I guess
but you'll see all that in the vlog when
I when I get to it um try to be an
affiliate for udemy for my youtube
channel
I started up and got tonight because I
don't have many subs hey Manny it can
happen you can indeed
trust postman the JSON API that's fine
how was the audacity react courses are
at the first third was great
the reduc scorch needs some work i I
because of the new job and because of
the hurricane I haven't finished the the
reducti I plan to get back to it
probably in the next day or two probably
this weekend really is when I'll be able
to dive into it maybe not even this
weekend I want to kind of review a few
things before I start the new job you
don't want to go in there as a dunce on
day one alright you want to it it's kind
of running but I'm very happy with it
what I recommend you've asked the
Coursera is learning out areas to boot
camps and colleges I think it's a
possibility I definitely think it's not
out of the realm of possibility so it
kind of depends on how hard you want to
work and how hard you're going to work
and how focused you're gonna be a lot of
people think they're gonna do one course
on udemy or Udacity and all of a sudden
they're gonna be a coding god doesn't
really work like that it's kind of a I
mean can't for some but a lot of people
a lot of people like I say this before
and it it's not about how hard you can
work it's about how long can you work
hard for and a lot of people can do it
for less than two weeks is what
mike-mike or a weekend sometimes it's
like I think it was uh um I think it was
god I'm forgetting like of the rock off
record who said this but someone said
god it's so funny to see people say
hashtag grind at 10:30 when you've been
up since 5:00 a.m. or 6 a.m. you know
actually grinding I don't think people
really who are grinding it out actually
go and say hashtag grind so I mean
that's but about so that's the thing is
um I've been working hard for like two
and a half years maybe three
where every single day I've been working
at making myself more valuable more
educated in software and a lot of people
and I surely do mean this I would say
about 90% of people can't work harder
than a weekend and then they have to go
back to whatever it is that's important
to them more so than studying and
getting better and making more money
it's easier to complain about not making
enough money than actually do something
about it
and to do something about it you have to
work hard for a long period of time and
if you can't work hard for a long period
of time you should get there one thing
and it's very easy to see because I do a
lot of these mentoring sessions where
I'm talking with people they're saying
how can they you know they won't know
like hey you know what what can I do to
get better and this and that a lot I
just are you coding every single day if
you're not you're really not trying hard
enough because that's the bare minimum
right but the the one of the surefire
ways to tell if somebody isn't grinding
as hard as they can at least when I talk
with them if they always compare
themselves to somebody else and say well
so-and-so got a job after he or she
studied for three months and then they
were good how come I can't get a job if
you're really sort of trying to you know
I'm better than them to how come this
and that and that don't don't worry
about what they're doing learn from what
they're doing and take it and try to
make yourself better that's one of the
things I've always really noticed it and
it's it's pretty easy to see because
when you're actually working hard and
you're grinding it out you got time to
worry about what anybody else is doing
because you 24/7 you're in this huh
24/7 can freelance work count as working
stress of course again you can build a
portfolio that way and you can put it on
your your resume and go from there anthe
up thank you man uh yeah it's it's very
interesting right so it as my channel my
channel uh
my channel has been around for a little
less than two and a half years and on
the beginning you saw a really depressed
college student in computer science
trying to to build a video portfolio and
get better at coding and two and a half
years later you saw you know I guess at
a year and a half
you saw a developer get my first
developer job two and a half years later
me to my second developer job and
continuing to grow and immature as a
developer and get better it's it's a
it's definitely been a journey
Neil floyd makes a very excellent point
that the people who got a job that quick
two years worth to work in three months
that's very true one thing that i have
trouble answering for people is people
ask how long have you been coding for
because it's not really how long you've
been coding for it's how much have you
code it you know how many hours have you
put in right so if i if you and i both
put in you and i started learning to
code a year ago i put in five hours a
day and you put two hours a day and
assuming that we learn at the same rate
I'm probably twice as good as as you are
right and so if you're putting in 30
minutes a day you're gonna get a 30
minute return so um that's what I find
so funny when people are looking for one
learning resource you should have one
learning resource you should be putting
in so much time that you've knocked out
all learning resources you really should
you should okay well I want try code
cadmium free code camp try that that's
free it's interactive
cool that was a little basic I'm gonna
build something of my own nice you know
I've heard good things about Colt stills
developer boot camp BAM let's jump into
that oh you know what's the new
framework let's go ahead and go through
the documentation the YouTube video so
you just start going through it all man
if you really are trying to learn all
this stuff you will slowly but surely go
through it all in one fashion or another
I understand it's hard though because a
lot of people are
and don't have a lot of money but all
the courses on like udemy you can pick
up for 10 or 15 bucks on a cell and
they'll keep you busy you know what
course can keep keep you busy for two to
four weeks depending on the size of the
course and what you got going on and the
other thing that's upsetting is people
all the time say you know people all the
time go you know well I have a job and
so did I you I mean having a job isn't
necessarily the end all be all of
studying the learning development right
is it an obstacle of course it is life
has obstacles very few of us who are
adults now will be able to go home and
live out our parents house not have to
work a job and just study 80 hours a
week very few so you have to find what
will work for you why you can still get
a number of hours in right
I would I would love to stay as much as
I hate living with my mother if I could
live rent-free and I could could have
stayed there and studied instead of
working you know forty five hours a week
in Los Angeles I would have done that in
a heartbeat
my name is Scott and after studying with
tree house after six weeks I got a job
as front-end developer is that even
possible it's definitely possible um I
would imagine there's a little bit more
to that story
but nothing's impossible guys really if
you are an eager guy and you got it and
someone's just gonna hire you as an
intern unpaid intern low wage intern
course is possible a lot some people
think this stuff up quick man and you
don't know either
you know maybe they've been maybe
they've been doing it for a while and
that six weeks is actually they've been
doing it as a hobby for two three years
I would find it hard to believe most of
the time but it's not impossible it
where did you see that is that on their
website six weeks they got a job do they
get a job at tree house so they can put
that quote up there but starting at zero
to six weeks
I mean think of it this way guys boot
camps are ten weeks right so we're
saying a little sixty percent of a boot
camp and we see that a lot of boot camps
have been successful
so I mean it just kind of depends and to
go of course I haven't haven't seen that
guy was a CS student before I see that
that's not talking about this is not not
not uh there had to be something else as
I was trying to get at so it completely
makes sense that he was a computer
science student or grad beforehand oh
they probably don't tell you that until
you click on the link and read the fine
print right so uh and Russ Wilkie says
if you're talking about Scott Koch story
he also meant she was coding with other
reef he researches since 2011 before
going to treehouse that's what I'm
talking about
it's highly unlikely it's not impossible
and almost impossible slightly unlikely
right how helpful was your college
curriculum and learning web component so
on a scale of zero to zero it was a zero
okay so um I will say I would say one
thing she don't learn any web
development you don't learn any web
development NCS program you might have
one course on HTML and CSS very very
basic course on HTML CSS that's it I
don't have any JavaScript courses or
anything like that I will say that I
will say that it it did help it did help
I had about five four six programming
courses and the main point of those
courses was that it does help you - it
does help you to learn
how to think like a program because
you're doing courses right nowa Mike my
coursework was in Java I wasn't a C++ uh
so but I had a course in Python I had a
course in c-sharp
excuse me C++ but the bulk of my
coursework was in Java I also had a
course in Scala so it just depends
should I learn PHP or node.js for back
in you live in Tampa kinda fens there's
a lot of PHP jobs there's a lot of
node.js jobs I know that's as I have
work experience of PHP I get a lot of
people interests and then working in PHP
with me I don't want to work in PHP so I
turned them down I much rather work a
note I like JavaScript I think Java
scripts going to just continue to grow
and everything like that but but in
terms of how helpful was the curriculum
honestly if I was to give it an honest 1
to 10 scale I would give it a 3 and the
reason it gets those three points is
because at the other day I was coding
but I had nothing to do with web film it
helped me think like a developer a
little bit but the other seven out of
ten is all me on my own time am I still
thinking about going to rescue some
university this is something I've been
this is something that I've been
debating debating about for awhile and
I've decided not to there's there's a
lot that goes into that the main thing
is I don't need to and I don't want to
take out debt and it was gonna cost
about $15,000 in debt now it may happen
in the future where an employer pays for
it but
I've just got a new job and having
interviewed with a couple different
companies I kind of could tell it
doesn't really matter at the end of the
day for me anyhow I kind of felt like I
was going backwards instead of forwards
I don't like and it's it's just one of
the six where I understand that it hurts
me to a degree but there's a lot of
things a lot of things what I may forget
it said forget the platform let's just
talk about getting for me specifically
getting a degree is I study all the time
every single day this has actually been
in two-and-a-half years the longest I
have gone without writing a single line
of code and that goes because I spent
three days for peri Tuesday Wednesday
and Thursday right after work I had to
go I had to go get supplies how to go
get gas to get water I had to go get
flashlights all this sort of stuff and
once it's out of the stores out of that
you got to do multiple days and to get
my car fixed oil change new battery all
this sort of stuff and then the
obviously expecting you have internet in
the hotel I did it so I even actually
written the line of code in six days and
I'm kind of going stir-crazy about it
and my brain is still kind of jumbled so
I'm probably going to work on YouTube
stuff tonight and then tomorrow I go
back to work and I'm gonna study but
this has been the longest time by far
probably twice as long as my longest
yeah they they need a category-5
hurricane to stop me from coding man
that's the truth um but uh but yeah I I
tried to do some algorithms on code
fights I tried to do some algorithms on
code fights but the internet was killing
me
so I did I had to give up on that
am I still pursuing algorithms putting
on the shelf to focus on yeah so the
algorithms like code fights I did about
80 or 90 on on their site Russ and I I
really enjoyed it
but right now I am focused on two things
actually three things new job that start
on Monday the react down degree which I
plan on fishing up and then my my coding
course my coding channel course that
I'll be working on so that that will be
what my main focus on the reason for
doing algorithms is I wanted to put
myself in a position that I felt like
I'd be learning JavaScript a little bit
better and I did I became much more
familiar with a lot of the a lot of the
array methods that are built into
JavaScript and just wanted to kind of be
able to prepare myself that if I needed
to take a technical interview I can and
I will pass it and I I would say with
the the fact that I got a new job at
work but um well yeah so uh although I
although ancient enjoy doing those
algorithms they're very time consuming
especially now that I've you know ninety
deep in them basically I don't imagine
that I will continue with them just
because there's there's really no reason
for me to there's there's a lot of other
things they serve their purpose of
making me more prepared of helping me
learn JavaScript a little bit more let's
just think a little differently which is
great but in terms of spending time
doing it well I get something out of
course I will will be the best use of my
time now so I have to I have to kind of
figure out what I want to do in terms of
the best use of my time and right now
it's the react now degree preparing for
the new job and and closing out my
current job and building my how to
create a coding Channel course and after
that start studying all the new stuff I
have to study
the new job right so every workplace you
go to is going to be slightly different
it's not like they're going to have the
exact same stack they're going to have
different tools that they use different
you know maybe instead of CSS they use
sass or less so you have a you know
brush up on that you know different
testing environments all that sort so
there's a lot of stuff that you have to
get caught up with anyone to do it as
quickly as possible so I got to refocus
that um in terms of the cs degree where
we're talking about that before I think
for the most part if you were to ask me
should you go and get a CS agree yes if
you can't you know if you're starting
from zero and and you have the ability
to and you you're not going to tag out a
ton of debt it's not a bad idea but it's
not the only idea which i think is one
of the things that a lot of people have
trouble wrapping their minds around a
lot of us myself included i've talked
about this is i have this fear that if I
don't go and finish my degree I am going
to be a failure and I'm one day going to
be homeless that's very unrealistic fear
at this point in my in my life and but
it is something that is deeply deeply
ingrained in me can react replace jQuery
should jQuery be a vote avoided uh no
it's not gonna replace jQuery should
jquery be avoided not avoided but there
are other frameworks and libraries that
are more valuable a lot of websites
still use jquery you should still be
familiar with jQuery and you can you can
you know build a couple projects in
jQuery and move on I think if you're
going to try and land a a front-end roll
you're gonna need angular 4 or you need
react that's gonna be gonna be that's
gonna be where your focus needs to be
I got a new new position I am I put in
my two weeks about a week and a half ago
a great opportunity came along and kind
of fulfilled what I was looking for and
I'll dive into that more in the future I
don't really want to talk about it
too much in detail right now but uh but
yes I have a new employer and I'm very
excited about getting started with them
I really liked what I saw who I met and
what we'll be working on so pretty
excited about that I use angular at my
job I'm yes I use angular why am i
learning yeah uh mainly to two reasons
one react was growing faster than the
angular for two I I tried them both I'm
gonna learn both but react seemed like
something was a little bit more fun a
little bit better for smaller projects
while angular 4 is really for those
massive enterprise applications that was
really it I just happened to like react
and I wanted to do a nano degree program
for a long time and when they they had
their sale for $300 on the react
nanodegree program I kind of said okay
this is going to seal the deal and I
dived in that direction but uh also from
a from a from a employment standpoint
say there was an angular four job the
fact that I am angularjs it's first
maybe will let me slide into that
angular four position if necessary that
was kind of a thought process as well
because see I am worked with a new grant
it's a whole different monster and beast
but some things do carry over what CSS
grid
he's talking about the grid system in
bootstrap uh hey guys he's talking about
let's do something called CSS grid that
I'm not really with um he took the full
stack down to green it was great I heard
a lot of people liked it and one one
critique I heard was that they didn't
feel like that they felt like reaction
have been a part of it which is a fair
statement I think but if you've gone
through it you should by then have the
skills to learn react on your own um
there are a couple of courses or whatnot
it's not bootstrap okay I have to check
it out
I haven't even touched it yet
hey Dylan I was wondering if I could
have some help I'm going to help a
friend with their website redesign they
want to have a wordpress site on their
life site and I was wondering how I
could do that when you're building a
wordpress template Eric music there are
a lot of things that you have to build
for it I would say get started by
watching some if you have tree house I
know they have a whole WordPress section
if not jump on come on YouTube see if
you can find how to build a WordPress
template because there are a lot of
finger called hooks or essentially
there's functions that are built into
WordPress that you have to call to
connect a part to another part and so on
and so forth but there's a there's a
special way to design wordpress
templates you're going to need to follow
that I've not finished to react now to
agree yes I plan to I have plenty of
time I think I have to like December or
November or something like that and also
one of the things I did was not only I
want to take down okay actually I have
something else to throw on the education
section so I can have a conversation
starter that's really all my education
section is when I have the react now and
agree and I have the free code camp you
know I don't have a CS degree but I do
have something on there that they look
at that and say what the hell is this
and what the hell is this and then I can
you know sell it and kind of explain
well you know this is 500 hours of
course works focus specifically on
front-end web development HTML CSS
jQuery
12 projects 40 algorithms you know so on
and so forth on same thing with the the
now degree which is another reason I
decide to it how much of your previous
position was actually coding versus
meetings and planning uh well my
previous position I was a technology
trainer and what that basically entailed
was I had to make you
I'd occasionally I would do wireframes
this is the most I'm gonna start with
this because this would be the the most
complex and relatable stuff I would have
to create user stories and wireframes
for upcoming feature requests or
upcoming features and that would be the
most relatable information the rest of
it was communicating with clients
gathering requirements going to meetings
building documentation building training
materials so not too much to be honest
with you at most 10% of my job my
previous job so my current position as a
web engineer 100 percent 95 percent
we've probably had four meetings in the
year
like for real meetings where you sat
down talked hashed it out you know with
very few meetings like my current
employer so but well I but that doesn't
mean that it was a valuable experience
just because 10 percent of it was doing
stuff that I thought related better what
was great about it was not only do I get
to work with developers and see you know
this is the first real developer shop
I'm granting I had an internship and I
work contract position with them for a
while and then I freelance but I was
able to work at a real software company
where a user where people are developing
enterprise applications and you know
there's 20 software developers there's
you know five database guys some
technical support on the lines and and
got to see how people architect projects
out got to get introduced to tools and
like JIRA and confluence and introduced
you how a a jalopy works all these sorts
of great things that really uh you know
like that made me an attractive
candidate cuz he okay I've worked an
agile grin I haven't coated but that's
one thing that's there kind of like some
of the things that I make
sided to work in in my my new work is
we're doing test-driven development
which is something I've never done
before what that basically means in my
understanding and this again I've never
actually worked in test-driven
development but it basically means that
we have our tests that are already
written and our code need to pass all
the tests it's almost like the
algorithms on code fights is how I see
it where you have a bunch of use cases
that you have to make sure that you code
for so that you're that you were writing
solid code you're essentially writing
code to pass the test
not hard coding of course but you need
to make sure that your logic is sound so
that you can build a nice application so
that's the test-driven development about
as well as code reviews which is
something I was hoping we could
implement at my current work but never
it never came to be so these are all
great things that I'm excited about for
my new role that I think I'll be
learning a lot in the process user
stories the users get whatever we fuckin
give them right is that how we do it God
name users
let's say you stopped at the toy JPI
project should I finish the friend
insert in free cocaine our hone HTML
with scroll bars and responsive design
to make my portfolio better for job
prospects or both should do both men
don't necessarily what one thing that
people kind of get burned out on is if
you are really on a project you just
don't want to do anymore it happens
right
so maybe the twitch API project you just
struggling with it something something's
not clicking some issue whatever it may
be it's okay to pause that and work on a
second project in this case maybe make
your portfolio look a little better
maybe building a portfolio website
something like that it's okay to do that
you don't always have to hammer Hammer
hammer hammer on the one project don't
don't get more than two or three though
because then you'll start you're certain
bumbling around but it is okay to have a
second project where you say look I am
completely and utterly burnt out on this
let's go do this and it happens to me
when I was doing the algorithms I was
hammering hammering away
knocked out 40 and then I got stuck on
one or two and I just didn't have it in
me to sit down for five hours to do more
algorithms so what I do and when I
started learning node and I've started
doing the micro services projects on
free code camp and stuff like that they
just started because I want to always
continue learning and the second it
really becomes unfun because i'm just
smashing my head against the keyboard
it's it's okay to back off and and go
and learn me in different direction
right maybe I maybe I'm gonna watch some
tutorials from traversÃ©e media to get
better at you know I think that I think
I saw part two of Dom manipulation which
is something that traditionally I'm very
poor with vanilla JavaScript I want to
get better which one the reason I chose
the react now degree as well let me
mention earlier but I have a video
coming out it's funny because Eric just
released a video about how to get hired
I haven't watched it yes I'm gonna watch
it I think my points are gonna be
slightly different than what he will do
when will I do the backend dynamic web
applications I don't
man those are so time-consuming and the
fact that they're getting removed I
don't know maybe I'll do it in a paid
course that's really the only way that I
see that being worth the time to be
honest with you
Tran Huy because those each one of those
is probably gonna take five to ten hours
of actual sitting down and coding I
don't know I just think it's kind of
weird to do free content and then make a
paid course for us I haven't done it and
if I think it's weird it probably is so
it's not about the template code man
it's about sitting down and
familiarizing myself with all the
aspects of passport Express MongoDB
Mongoose so the hiring process from my
current job it was uh for my upcoming
job I should say start on Monday
it was about a ten day process maybe
maybe a little longer a little less it's
all kind of a blur last couple days
started off with a recruiter reaching
out to me answering a couple recruiter
questions so that's step one
sending my resume in and say yeah
sending my resume in and I was step two
from there they they were interested in
me so I had a phone call with with I
believe it was two individuals on the
phone and that lasted about 30 minutes
some basic HTML CSS JavaScript angular
questions not too technical so that's
the phone though that's that was part 3
part 4 I got called in to a technical
interview in which I met with two
developers and a person from HR that
took about an hour did a whiteboard
problem
answered some questions for me there
they're always going to be a little bit
because I'm originally from California a
lot of times people are very concerned
that I'm looking to go back to
California and this is just something to
kind of get my foot in the door sort of
thing I'm not looking to go back to
college so yeah so I had a technical
interview then which I they basically
gave me an algorithm I have a video
going over that as well talking about
what your typical technical interview is
like and this was filmed thirty minutes
after a technical interview I had I
think it's gonna prepare you guys very
well so that was part four after that
they sent me a iPad so I passed that the
technical interview after that I got
sent a a it take home project after they
approved me I got sent home a take home
project that took about two and a half
hours it really probably should only
take in about one and a half hours or
one hour but I got it was I was pinging
innate API they provided and it was
returning nothing when it should have
returned something when I deleted or
updated but I just didn't look through
the documentation clearly enough so I
spent an hour and a half trying to
figure this out and then I eventually
went back to the documentation and saw
that it's supposed to return nothing
because it's it's just for testing
purposes purposes which is the hardest
part I so what it wasn't anything too
outlandish pretty straightforward and
then part six I had to go in I met with
the big bosses and someone from HR and
they just kind of dive deep into me a
little bit more as an individual and
yeah I mean that's basically I didn't
then the offer was made and we
negotiated for a little bit and and I
accepted how are the cats doing very
well I'm doing good man I'm exhausted uh
it's it's tiring in about four days we
did we were in the car for about 30
hours so um my sister lives over west of
st. Petersburg a treasure hunt any
advice for her flowing backing no I mean
everything the roads are clear there's
not any major flooding in st. Petersburg
there is some power out in Tampa I just
say just have a ride set up that's it
did they check my channel they will
always check my channel cuz I include it
on my resume it is one of the number one
selling points of me as a developer it
shows a lot of shows a couple very
important things that people are looking
for especially when hiring junior
developer is one are they passionate if
you're putting up a video every day and
you enjoy talking about this stuff at
the very least granted my old videos are
more code heavy a lot of stuff we're
talking about now it's more topic
warnings because I'm spending a lot of
my time studying but still very shows
passion shows that I'm learning shows
that I enjoy this stuff and those are
all great great traits a half and there
was like did you have to take time off
work for the on-site interview so you
just leave work early each day it worked
out that because uh it worked out that
the the time wise I was able to to go
after work so I go in very early
sometimes 6:30 a.m. in the morning get
off 3 or 3:30 in the evening and so
because it's local I was able to scoot
over and do all that but yeah I know I
know they checked my channel not only
cuz I put on there but one of the
developers that I I really that really
intrigued me for the role was talking
what starting a podcast and and he said
I decide to channel and I you know I he
gave me a compliment which is very nice
to him saying you know it takes
dedication to to commit to something
like that for so long to put a video up
a day and I just want commend you on
that he's
very nice about it and I really liked
talking to them because it is equally
one of the things that I always look for
is I want to work with people who are
are sort of as passionate as I am about
developing and kind of you know when
someone says if I'm working with a
developer and they say we're gonna be
switching at test-driven development and
they've never done touched it like me I
want them to say have the same response
like hell yeah let's use something new
instead of oh okay
you know I mean so when they when
someone has side projects that's why I
always returners always tell you to ask
questions at the end of the interviews
and you really have anything to say I
usually just kind of try and sell myself
and tell a little bit about myself what
I'm looking for but one thing that I do
ask now is one thing I do ask now is
what side projects are you working on
and they don't have any it starts
concerning me or at least one person
doesn't right usually an interview with
two to three developers and if all three
don't have any start whirring all right
some people want to have lives outside
of work is that bad
it's not bad I'm not saying you can't
have a life but like for me I consider
this part of my life right and also I'm
not saying there's anything wrong with
not having side projects but if I've
seen as an employee and I want to devote
the next year to two years to three
years to five years so ever it may be of
my life with people I want to work with
and I want to here's the thing guys when
you're a developer and you're in demand
it is us important that your work wants
you to be part of the team as you want
to be part of the team right and that
should go for any any any job I
understand less so and jobs where you
have your less demand but I want to be
part of a team where at least some of
the people code outside of work at least
some of the people are as passionate in
different avenues and I'm not and you
can beat or whatever I want to find
people who
our enjoy this and that doesn't mean
that so if you you know some of us don't
want to code 12 hours a day that's fine
that's completely fine I have no issue
with that but if I'm one of the things
that attracted me it was that somebody
was doing something like that right so
what languages are using your new job
I'll be focused in angularjs I'm a
front-end roll and we'll be moving to
angular 4 in the near future so
volunteer side projects from nearby
churches nice man and by the way I
encourage you all I just resigned up for
code.org to volunteer for our if code I
think it's coming up pretty soon as well
as any organizations but I'd like to go
in there resubmit myself into the the
pool so I can get notified if the
teachers and stuff want someone to talk
I did it right when I got down here for
the Florida great American teachin oh
yes so to summarize thank you so much
for the new 1000 thousand of you who
have decided to subscribe to the channel
if you're interested in some books on
how to get a coding job there's a
limited time Humble Bundle with a link
in the description that I added midway
through the stream so you may have to
refresh the page if you if you are if
you are if you started writing the
beginning uh you can go ahead and treat
yourself to some coding books and as
well as how to make a better resume
LinkedIn advice all that great stuff for
really low price and for the twenty five
thousand if you have been here before
thank you as well right so we don't only
appreciate the new people we also
appreciate the oh geez and one day at
27,000 the new 1000 view will be an OG
as well so
I like to leave my live streams as a
piece of advice piece of a final thought
if you will so um one thing that stood
out to me is the Crusader rabbit said
some people want to have lives outside
of work is that bad so that's going to
be kind of where we're going to wrap up
our final thought for today and and what
are we going to be talking about in
specifically we're talking about that as
an employer a lot of times that there
I'm not so as an employee I'm very aware
of what an employer wants they want
somebody who enjoys coding twelve hours
a day they want somebody who enjoys
software right because there are a lot
of people who go and they they choose
software as a career don't really enjoy
it and a lot of that it's going to cause
them not to be successful does that mean
that you have to go home and code 12
hours a day you know four hours
afterward and not have a family not have
a kids no but don't don't be upset when
you're not an attractive hire right
there's a lot of ways that you don't
have to write a single line of code that
you could go and still be a very
interesting candidate especially when
you're getting started when you you know
when you have five years experience it's
not gonna matter if you have a podcast
for a senior role right it's gonna be
interesting but it's not gonna matter as
much as when you have zero years or one
year experience and you're trying to
move forward so what one piece of advice
out I would leave you is that if you are
just getting your life started in the
software realm is do something to make
you seem like you're not doing all this
for the money do something to make you
seem like you want to be there because
you enjoy it because and if you can't
find that thing that you do enjoy nsa's
makes lie so
I'm saying find that thing that you
enjoy they say hey I just got off work
coding for eight hours but here I can go
and do my YouTube channel here I can go
and do my blog not because I I want to
force myself but because I enjoy it and
it's part of my life and I like to do it
and not only will you be a better
developer you also be a more attractive
hire so if you can find something that
maybe it doesn't even have to involve
writing code but if you can tie
something in to show that you have side
projects portfolio projects websites at
your bill building and maintaining
anything that really makes you be unique
as a hire that would be what will help
you get your foot in the door so I hope
you take advantage of that and I fully
understand that if you if you know you
have a family and kids and you can't
spend hours on a side project and stuff
like that that that's not that's not
that's not for everybody in Sun
realistic sometimes but if you can it is
in your best interest and you'll become
a better developer in the process but
those are the type of people that I'm
looking to work with because that's the
type of person that I am and I want to
surround myself with people who are the
the best and the brightest and a lot of
times that means that they have side
projects cuz they enjoy it I want to be
around people who enjoy what they do
because I enjoy what I do so that's my
thought process on that that's my final

make you that much of a better employee
and candidate so that you can get the
money you deserve in the job that you
want and continue to work towards so
