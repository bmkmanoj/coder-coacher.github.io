in free code camp today we're going to
be going over the tic-tac-toe advanced
project now I made kind of a janky one
I'm not the best with CSS and I just
kind of like the logic aspect of coding
but this should get you help get help to
get you started you'll see from our
little quick example here we it's pretty
bit basic we have a turn x and a turnout
but n' so you can choose this a little
bit of logic so that resets when we
change our player turn so whichever one
is selected in this you'll see that's
going on and then the computer will
generate a randomized chart at which
point if we or the computer wins so like
right now this is this is done so we
could we probably should create a reset
button for me I just go ahead and click
this and it will redo it let's see
and then BAM and then we'll throw up if
the computer or I win we'll go ahead and
throw up who wins and what rows they did
across so it's 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
definitely spice it up on your own but
this should help to get you started
we're going to be doing this in HTML CSS
bootstrap and jQuery so let's go ahead
and get started
as always uh go ahead and rename what
you're doing here so this will be a
youtube tic-tac-toe what's going on here
gonna save that and then definitely
import import your import anything
you're using as I said we're going to be
using bootstrap and we're also going to
be using jQuery
cool so I'll be doing a much more
complex version of this when I redo it
in angular so that's what I'm kind of
just going ahead and throwing it up
right now all right so let's get set by
just go ahead and throwing out all our
HTML code that's typically what I like
to do so we're gonna go ahead and create
a div here called and give it a class
we'll set this equal to container this
is a bootstrap class inline just text us
Center you don't have to do this if you
don't want to just a little bit styling
button throw a diff here and then we're
going to go ahead and create an anchor
tag and this is going to be our turn X
and turn Oh buttons so just go ahead and
assign a class here this is going to
just use the standard BTN and then the
BTN - primary classes and we're going to
have an ID here this is going to be how
we target this later on as our selector
so we're just going to call it turn X
and then put some text here turn X close
it and then we go ahead and copy this
over one more time and do the same
except we're going to change this turn X
to turn 0 or turn oh excuse me
no now because we want our tic-tac-toe
rows to go you know left to right we're
going to go ahead and add a div class
row here and we're going to add some
columns let's go ahead and do this if
you're not familiar with a column and
grid system for bootstrap the way it
kind of goes is um you have basically a
set of 12 and you start breaking up your
columns into that so you can maybe have
4 or 4 &amp;amp; 4 or 6 &amp;amp; 6 and you get the hang
of it
in our example I think I just use call
mid 6 column at 6 so I'll go ahead and
forth this which now that I'm looking at
it doesn't make a whole lot of sense
so we're gonna clean this up quite a bit
this is one of those times you look back
at your code after like three months
oh man I got so much better since when I
did this it's going to close this div as
well and then within here we're going to
go ahead and add some anchor tags we're
going to give it a class equal to VTN
BTN - primary and then we're going to
add this custom class called tick that
we'll use later on and then we're going
to add the ID is 0 remember I use this
ID here to kind of use as a selector and
then the way I set it up so that we know
it's default is I just have these
hashtags now we're going to go ahead and
copy this twice over and this is going
to be ID 1 and then ID 2 and then from
here we're going to go ahead and just
copy this over twice the Col mid-six
these we're going to change our values
so we're going to have ID 3 4 &amp;amp; 5 and
then 6 7 &amp;amp; 8 so why is our div missing
oh because we need these DIF class rows
that's right so make sure you add I
forgot to copy the full amount just
throw a div on here and then we're going
to throw another div class rail right
here like so / div and we should be
solid why aren't we solid it looks like
I messed up I have one too many here one
two three it is good for us calm it
that's a container that's the row then
we have Dib div come in div and then
right here I'm just taking a dip there
we go so everything is kind of lined up
neat and nice just to stick with
consistency working on ahead and add a
little bit of CSS right here and we're
going to do the body and
ground - color of black just cuz that's
what I did then that's basically all the
CSS I do um now we're gonna set up our
alright our jQuery and then we're going
to go ahead and do some of the easier
functionality before we move on so now
that we have everything set up it's not
doing anything at this point but uh it's
just there we need to go ahead and get
our document ready this is basically the
start basically saying when our
JavaScript loads or when our page loads
go ahead and run this jQuery let's go
ahead and do that now we're going to
create a turn parameter here that we're
going to use later and this is going to
default the players turn to X so let's
go ahead and put some comments in here
as we go along so defaults turn elite
players turn to X now we're going to
create an array that's going to actually
store the turns that are in there
remember how we had this zero one two
three four five six seven eight
we're going to use that array to check
some values to see if anything across up
and down or left and right actually met
met a winning score for either player so
we're going to go ahead and add an array
that stores the values that we will
check later for a winner so this is just
going to be a we're going to call this
VAR turns this is going to be equal to
an array and I'm going ahead and copy
this over here with nine hash tags in it
so we're going to initialize it with the
same values that we start out with
because we want the array to basically
be empty we're also going to default the
computer's turn so we're just going to
say default computer turn and we're
gonna start this at computers turn and
we're just going to set this equal to
zero
so the players will start automatically
with EDX and the computer is going to
start with a o for their turn and so
we're gonna also the way I did this was
I kind of just created a Chilean
variable that would detect if it was the
computers turn or the players turn and
after the player is turned it would then
change the boolean variable to true at
which point the computer would take its
turn and then it would change back to
false so this keeps track this is going
to be called a VAR game on and we're
going to set it equal to false if it is
the computers turn there's a lot of
logic with this and it's not the best
logic in all honesty I could I'm
definitely including this up line doing
this and angular do it fresh but up at
least we can put some comments in here
kind of know what's going on right now
so the first thing we want to do before
we get into a lot of the more logical
stuff is let's go ahead and and change
our turn value so if we change our turn
value we want our turn X and turn Y to
be 2 B we want it our turn
B X and our players turn to be Y let's
go ahead and and the weight we actually
want this to show up when we start let's
go ahead and do that first we're going
to target this turn X we'll just do a
little change players actually since
this turn X let's go and target and make
it turn Y change players turn to X and
computers to why excuse me help
so we're going to do that I'm just going
to go ahead and set this like so and
we're say look when you click on turn x
remember because this ID we use the hash
tag and click on turn x go ahead and
click
a function that's going to do some stuff
now what do we want to do when we go
ahead and reset the variable that we did
before we're going to set turn oh we're
just turn to oh and we're going to set
computer turn computers turn to X now
from here what we want to do is we
actually want to note this so that what
we can kind of tell we can remember
which turn is which and the way that I
did it was I just took away the BTN
primary class so it looked like you're
switching values when you click so we're
going to target our turn X and we're
going to go ahead and remove the class
this is just a jQuery function that
removes a class from the CSS and we're
just gonna remove the class BTN -
primary and then because we're going to
be having two functions one where it
changes the players turn to zero the
computer sort of X and vice-versa one
where it changes players turn to X and
computers turn to zero we're going to go
ahead and add the turn Oh class right
now because you're once always going to
be on and one's always going to be off
so we're going to go ahead and target
this right now as well and then we'll
test everything out so we're going to
say turn o dot add class BTN - primary
all right now let's go ahead and see
that you'll see right there it turned
off so that's working and then we can
assume these variables are working as
well let's go ahead and add the same
functionality to the clicking on and off
here for the most part we can just copy
this first little function here paste it
in here it's change this turn x to turn
o so when you click turn note set our
turn back to turn x and set the
computer's turn back to turn o and then
go ahead and swap out the X's and O's
here as well
save that and now you'll see we switch
back and forth between whose turn it is
now in the next video we're going to do
all the ridiculous logic there's about
three functions worth actually before we
do that before we jump into the logic we
can actually just go ahead and start
inputting our turn on to the buttons
that's a pretty straightforward thing to
do so remember how we added the tick
class we're going to say when you when
you click on that tick class if you
forgot each one of our buttons here we
added this custom class called tick
that's because we wanted to target it as
our selector and remember our classes
start with a dot and we're saying look
when you click one of these classes
we're going to run a function that is
then going to do some stuff we're going
to create something here called var slot
and this is going to basically be a
variable that's going to store the value
of the object that we're clicking that's
what does this is when you click this
that's this when you click this that's
this that's what we're inheriting we're
going to take the attribute from that ID
now this is why I named the IDs equal to
a 0 1 2 3 because they're going to match
up with our index arrays and then we're
going to go ahead and pass it in to and
for the time being will comment this out
a player a player turn function that's
going to take in our turn which is going
to be an X or an O and it's going to go
ahead and take in the slot basically
where we click so this is going to be
our X or o and this is going to be the
location so before we do anything else
we can go ahead and do player turn we'll
go ahead and define player turn at this
point so that we can see it in twerking
in action so we're going to create a
Shemp call a player turn that's going to
go ahead and take in a parameter that we
call turn and ID remember what it's
supposed to be and then where it's
supposed to go and we're going to create
a variable here just called spot taken
now this is going to be equal to Z
basically the ID that we're going to be
checking so remember how we used ID so
it is hashtag zero hashtag 1 hashtag 2
and we're just going to check to see if
this is it so it's going to be the
hashtag and then concatenate that with
our ID that we're passing in which is a
zero to nine or zero to eight dot text
we're going to set that equal to give
the text value which is a hashtag so
what we're going to do next is just
write a simple if statement now the
reason we have an if statement so we're
going to say if spot taken is equal
equal equals the hashtag this is
basically going to set up we're going to
go ahead and add this we're going to go
ahead and put this logic in here so that
you can't click on a spot that's already
taken these are going to change when we
click on it
but as of right now we don't have any
way of testing it but that's what this
logic is for all right so
the next thing we're going to do is
remember our turns array here stored all
our hash tags we're going to go ahead
and change that value because we know
now that it's not taken so right we're
going to let the player add the turn
that they did so we're going to say
turns and we're going to pass in the ID
remember the ID is the same as the
location so that's why this is going to
work we're going to set this equal to
our turn let's go ahead and try this so
it's not working which means I forgot
something oh excuse me so remember our
turn we now have now that we've gotten
the text from it to check the spot taken
we actually have to go ahead and set the
value in the button that we're clicking
and that's pretty straightforward
we just need to use our selector and
again our hash tag and then we're going
to concatenate with our ID and then
we're just saying look the text set the
text in there to our turn here we're
actually getting the text and then here
we're actually setting the text we're
checking to make sure that it's a hash
tag and if it is we're going to pass in
that value into our array that later we
will check to make sure that there's a
winner at every step of the turn at
every turn player computer and then here
we're actually going to set that value
now I'm a little bit dumbfounded as to
why that didn't work right now okay
oh I remember right here so remember
when we clicked we've counted this out
let's go ahead and save this and now
when we pass in our turn when we click
on a button and the location it's going
to go ahead and change so let's see
right now and right now we don't have
any logic to reset this but you'll
notice how we're not able to actually
override the value that's in here that's
what that is statement is therefore so
when we come back in the second video to
close this out we're going to go ahead
and show how to reset all this and then
we're going to show the computer turn
logic and then finally we're going to
just set the winning conditions I hope
