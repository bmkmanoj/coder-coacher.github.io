part 1 so finally getting to the meat
and potatoes of programming in general
so it says right here PHP has 700
built-in functions so there's probably a
lot of functions that you won't need to
write to get what you need to do so you
use index dot PHP to tab to write your
own code get the length get the length
of your own name as I did for mine print
to screen okay so I'm just sure what he
meant by the index dot PHP tab to write
your own code but uh it looks like we're
going to create a variable called length
now we're going to set it equal to STR
when is the built-in function and we're
going to say Dylan and then we want to
echo it to the screen so this case we're
going to see some print and it's already
in the PHP and print a built-in function
as well so let's look over at an example
there substring here substring function
which will get us part of our string
uppercase you know and then there's a
lower case as well alright so you get a
partial string from your own name to
print it to the stream all right so
let's create a variable name
we want to get a partial strength so if
you remember or hand we'll just call it
partial doesn't matter we've got partial
equals and let's go back up to substring
function so it goes variable then index
imagine this is each position or each
position of the string in this case
there can use David so 0 1 2 3 4 and go
into there so you want to go 1 past so
it will not count the last one so this
is substring so that's gr and then we're
going to use the name on it and we're
going to start at 0 and we'll just go to
3 so we should get dy L then we want to
print partial and let's see make your
native uppercase so uppercase s CR T
upper it's a string upper so we'll just
say upper equals STR t upper and then
we'll pass in our name variable and then
we will echo or two rather
prints upper and then last but not least
we won't make it lower case so we will
create something called lower lower very
well set it equal to
scrt oh whoops CRT Oh lower string to
lower get string to upper oh there there
we go
and we're going to call the name
variable now we could have just kept on
doing putting the string okay again but
seems smarter to just create a variable
or better brother the variable and then
we're just gonna print flower and so it
should work it's copy so you can see
right here do IA yl dylan and then down
suppose save and so that everything
works nicely this next function its
built-in functions we're going to see
string physician passing your name as a
haystack and let it from your name is a
needle alright so we're going to call
this here we're gonna create a name
again
and then we're going to create a summary
so they possess you our position and in
here we're gonna call our name and we
need to include what we are looking for
in here and i'm not sure if it's case
sensitive let's see if this does
anything in you doesn't like to say
anything about it being case sensitive
but all that later so we'll look for a
why in this case
and then we want to print out print
printer on you okay and we also want to
do which all my 13:13 we want this is
something if statement
so this year
so if we'll just do like this our
position sequel equal to false pretty
here
that should work
your first history call should output a
number
all right so let's see what's going on
here so if our position
this is gonna you the position maybe
wanted us to print out our position you
should print out a useful error message
for the field string all right so this
case or sorry
all right so we're gonna go to the
forums cuz I'm not quite sure why we're
having issues here we were on three of
eight
see here
alright so in this case it looks like it
wants their statements to be done a
certain way so we're gonna say if yes
you are we'll just we'll do it this one
Dylan and we'll just put a Z
you should print out a useful error
message all right so we're still
struggling with this
so let's say trout the position of the
do those here on hey all right so never
mind I fix already very sick uh got this
Turkish here so we're good
alright let's reset scope so obsession
later that's in your I'm sorry I'm
Krantz and we're going to do STR
position and we're going to do Dylan and
we're going to do and that should print
out the position of my name of that end
in my name and then we're going to my if
statement that if SC our position of
feeling we're going to change this to
lowercase in case some reason there's an
issue and equal equal the balls we want
it to print the error message search
will just copy their example sorry end
it with a semicolon
messed up your hair
fresh this does this should be working
surprise try and print out a useless ear
massage let's see what's going on here
mm should pronounce you still here my
sister's about South Stream should come
I did
yeah
oh maybe they want us to put a number in
here that paralytics okay so they wanted
it to fail
that's silly on my part so make sure it
fails I guess alright next we're going
to be looking at the math functions
equals 4.5 and then we want to round it
so we also want to print it all right so
try running flame point number two three
decimal places and print it to the
screen so we'll create it num-num to set
that equal to four point five six seven
eight nine seven one and then we want to
round it to and then we want to do it to
three decimal places we'll put in 3 and
don't forget that what you want to print
this as well and there it don't see the
output up here Thanks
all right so more math functions use
that are to print a random number so
French bread
so that's a random number
create a new variable name to store your
name in it so create a variable mate and
then then create a random character from
your name
use your knowledge of string lights
brand min/max
and so string at this okay so let's do
this we want to print a random variable
of our name right so we know starting
index point is zero and we also know
that's STR length but was this ser Llyn
will give us the length of our nave area
below and then so this entrenched print
random number between here and here and
then this yard line is chair so sure
okay so this will give us our let's
create a variable from this actually
letter equals that back and then from
here we need to take a letter and write
our substrate and I'm sure
best of all right so we're going to
print the substring letter and then we
have to print subs up to the letter plus
one
so I need to minus one there oh okay so
we forgot the pin in our name and our
position so name taker valuable where we
want to start and learn on it end and
that should give us our key there okay
just a good example of integrating all
our little functions together all right
can you push five elements onto it
so that's create an array games and
we'll set that equal to all right and
then in here you want to call right push
and we need to put our right here in
this case we want to put our capacity my
copy over things just save a little bit
time are then going to call codon you're
going to add to it another good classic
fire then we're going to add it it's
another good classic RPG I'm not a
dragon quest fan
let's crack the brain wreck the great
Wild Arms I read out push and finally
last but not least for our RPG games
array we're going to add to it let's see
here we're going to add it's got to be
good one this is a newer one but it
wasn't very good news after he
chronicles alright and now we need to
print out the number of elements in
there a so this is going to print out
not the array but the actual size of the
array I believe so
we just gonna call very games and you
can see right there it's all time online
six user rate to create so
sit ready it comes it's probably a bad
bad habit to create an array called
array object next sort the array so
let's add some other in here just so
that we make sure it's working all right
to call it we're gonna call sort put the
array in there so that sorts it that
pronounced join comma there right so
this looks like it's going to put a
comma in between the array so array that
is here it was Johnny so there's that
and then the next thing asks us is to
our sorry wishes I guess reverse sort so
we're going to our sort our right and
then we're going to join in print the
first
alright so join this case we'll just
comma and all right you can see right
there Princip reverse cool so that was
our right oh do we have more where you
have more creating right and push on the
names here family and friends so this
case we'll just call it name array
arrey empty we're then going to call
array consider a push or 800 support
push and we then put the array in their
camera and gamma ray we're just gonna
keep it short just put two friends there
match
alright now it wants to sort the list so
sure sort and then we just put the array
in there forget the semicolon and then
we are going to randomly select a name
and that's going to be between 0 and 1
and then
yeah what count us so randomly select a
winner
so ends it between zero on then we want
to print
and so we can get rid of that so you
want to print namearray and we're gonna
do it all in caps str upper str to upper
and you can see right there it's all in
caps and it's selected at random
almost
I so wants to see us count so here it is
count in the array their name array well
so that was our first section of
functions kind of getting into it now so
pretty cool stuff you're seeing all the
things you can do with functions and
this is they have 700 built into here
and we've only seen about six or seven
so there's lots more to do next I shall
be continuing functions and the
functions part to see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
