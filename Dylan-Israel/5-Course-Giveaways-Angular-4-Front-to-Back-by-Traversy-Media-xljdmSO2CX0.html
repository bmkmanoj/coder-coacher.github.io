things up fresh the page here chat up oh

how's everybody doing today live control
room give me one second to get going
here guys there we go art P Nicole
Maxwell welcome welcome welcome
so I forgot to do a video today and I
normally it's like the webcams lagging a
little bit so lagging for you guys oh I
see here yeah it's jumping around a
little bit
hmm let's see if we can fix this little
bit if not no big deal
uh the Udacity course uh yeah all the
courses are free guys you don't owe when
the I've started this a little bit early
just kind of take questions and whatnot
so so that what the deal is is
traversing media who if you're not if
you're not a follower of his on YouTube
or subscriber you definitely should be
it's probably my number one go-to source
right now on YouTube he he sent me email
said a Dylan I'm releasing a angular for
course called angular for front to back
and I would here are ten copies for you
do with them what you will I said I said
thank you sir
I said thank you coding got that's who I
prayed you this the coding God prays to
the other coding out all right asset all
right well thank you mister coding up
coding God's senior and I uh I took one
for myself and I got nine to give away
I'm going to give away five today the
other three or four are going to be one
or two will be given away to some some
long-term patreon subscribers of mine to
say thank you I unfortunately have been
able to do as much as I would like to to
to the patreon subs and so depending on
if the one or to take it
I'll have somewhere between three and
four to give away after that I'll go
ahead and use those to give away in the
videos we'll do our first giveaway at
4:30 in a second here yeah I forgot to
put a video up today and and I uh I I
was still sick uh uh and
I uh I wanted to do something special I
was thinking of how to give away the
courses if I was just gonna give away in
the videos like I have been but I since
I forgot I I decided that oh you know
what I didn't do a video today let's go
ahead and just give back to the people
who support us should we do anything to
enter the giveaway I'll tell you when
when the time comes we could do a quick
test actually if you want to help me out
here
I mean so we're gonna be using nightbot
to do the giveaway alright if someone
could say the word code in all lowercase
just so we can do some tests real quick
make sure everything's working
essentially when the time comes all
you'll need to do is enter the keyword
and I'll roll I'll roll it you all see
it live I'll switch over to it and all
lowercase up all lowercase alright so
let's see if this works there are no you
eligible users all right so slash mod
right so for some reason that didn't
work where's nightbot is nightbot
sleeping on the job again
damnit it's not working I wonder if it's
because we are doing a event instead of
I oh I wonder if it doesn't work for
events it only works for live streams
that would be interesting and that would
really mess up what I'm trying to do
right now
give me a skirt let me see it does
nightbot giveaway work for Michael
welcome welcome work for YouTube event
oh we may have to figure out a different
way of giving it away
yeah unfortunately giveaway thing did
not work it's not even getting any users
reset eligibility its kind of refresh
this page let's see if that helps
oh there we go we have life shot alright
alright why is it code working hmm
let's see here yeah I don't know what's
going on here guys we'll figure out a
way to get don't worry we'll give away
some courses it may just be that you may
have to comment on the video after it
ends if we can't get this going
looks like nightbot isn't compatible
with the YouTube events even though the
chat is showing up
does anybody know any other giveaway
tools that we can use you guys can see
right here I'm trying to I have the code
I'm trying to unfortunately it doesn't
seem like it wants to get anybody from
the thing here Danny we got someone from
Tampa Florida what's up nothing huh
let's try refreshing page one more time
see if we can get this to go
we're going to YouTube make sure
nightbot is modded then we got to wake
up night bot
click the alright let's uh let's get out
of here real quick well I try and set
this up let's see here
youTube Live dashboard we're gonna get
you guys some courses so I'm
worried
we're gonna figure this out where a
developer met since he's loaded
all right let's unmod nightbot save and
then let's Reem on night fun all right
so nightbot don't be a little asshole it
is an essential oil diffuser but yeah
pretty much the same thing all right
there are some nightbot commands let's
see here
I don't think night BOTS there he goes
alright night BOTS here baby let's see
if we can get this going we're going
back to the giveaways

I kind of I thought it was a fairly
reasonable video I was gonna do like a
mock skit for tomorrow for Friday's
video rally where I was gonna it was
gonna be a it was gonna be me kind of
like doing a code dudes video or you're
like hey you know I got some feedback
that about blah blah blah and blah blah

took some inspiration from them with my
new cup company coding dudes and it's
supposed to be a joke and then the joke
was here at coding dudes we start we
take the coding babes logic and start
one step closer we actually start with
no clothes on and because you want to
see us put clothes back on every time
you get into the question right we go
ahead and put more clothes on oh that
was there's gonna be a joke but I didn't
really want to get down in my underwear
at the end of the day it's
came down to it is an essential oil
diffuser that's what it is did the
social justice warriors I had one guy
tell me that he thought I was being
sexist cuz I said chicks all right it's
like when you shake chicks you really
mean bitches I was like no no I don't
well and you know I responded back in
and I had one guy that tell me well I'm
far from constructive criticism is fair
