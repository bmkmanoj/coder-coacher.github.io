gentlemen we are back in learning HTML
and CSS part 1 on borders for the CSS
box model so last section we kind of saw
how the boxes around like elements kind
of work and now what we're going to be
doing moving forward is messing around
with borders which we assigned a border
but we didn't really do anything with it
so let's go ahead and go on so there's a
whole mess of borders you have solid
which is what we had before where you
had a solid line you can also have a
dash border you can have a dotted a
double a groove I haven't seen I haven't
used any of these before let's go ahead
and just start following the prompt here
so we want to find the dot hotel which
is our class hotel and we want to give
it a border so undo border stash style
now you do typically usually you'll do
this all in one but if you just want to
set one element everyone not parameter
attribute just want to set one of these
things such as this border style we can
go ahead and do that to solid
you'll see now we have this solid border
that's going around here however if you
wanted to actually just set the width of
the border we could do that as well
we're going to go ahead and do that
doing border with and similar to how
your fonts were you can use multiple
things here but typically pixels are the
best way of going about it go ahead and
run that and now we are a border has a
pixel of to it they also have these
other property names in here thin medium
and thick so let's see what dick looks
like it's going to ring that you see
it's a little bit thicker than what it
was before let's change it back to two
pixels now you'll find out that
oftentimes your attributes that you're
setting in here or your property 60 that
you're setting in here you can typically
put 11 value in there such as maybe just
three pixels and it'll go around for all
or you can customize each side of going
top right basically top right bottom
left in that order and so you'll have a
porter in this example you have a top
border three pixels a right border of
one pixel bottom border of two pixel on
the left border of one pixel so let's go
ahead and jump into the hotel and here
they want us to set the right and left
borders to width of two pixels
use one declaration this at the top and
bottom
alright so we're going to do 4px top 2px
left 4px bottom I really this is what
they're asking to fix there we go so
you'll see right here we have a slightly
thicker border and dinner border here so
you can also do the properties like this
border dashed off with border dash right
with these are all the same except just
more detailed and you can use them in
different things really just got to
choose what works best for you how
detailed you want to be in your calling
of the properties all right so and so as
yes its top board is with the point 5
hotel open alright so we're going to
border gosh top dash with and then here
we're going to go ahead and they want 5
pixels 5px
I guess maybe they just wanted us to
change it in here
with that nope already
maybe they want us to do this we're with
2px then border dash with or dashed off
excuse me with and they wanted us to set
it to 5px let's see if this is what they
wanted let's go ahead and get the code
I'm not quite sure what they're asking
for here do they want us to set all of
them like this so let's go ahead and get
a little help we'll jump into the forums
real quick check out what they're trying
to ask here
all right so it looks like it's an issue
on there in so we're going to go ahead
and add X here and this may or may not
fix our code
reset this exercise or what
yeah you can see right now we're even
having trouble here
alright so they want to choose border oh
maybe they want us to get rid of the
border all together for everything
subscribe XD X on there's well ok so I
think what's going on is they want us
only to have a border with top
having some issues here with their
system
interesting so we are at a impasse we're
going to go ahead and try the adding the
X on these classes real quick one more
time
let's go ahead i refresh the page seems
from what I kind of gathered that
there's a little bit of an issue with
this
is not getting an arc
code shift f5 let's try a hard refresh
just going to clear the cache
so we're having a little bit of an issue
here
huh
Oh apparently there's more than one dot
hotel what we'll do here is we'll go
ahead and change this over real quick so
till X auto till X they said there was
five this may be what we need to fix
what we're trying to do here
kind of a bootleg of way of going about
it but there we go so we're able to pass
that not ideal but again this is the
preview version that we're doing which
is ninety-nine percent the same as the
updated version but they still working
the kinks out same thing shows you a
little bit of a interesting way of
trying to problem-solve some York
Academy issues all right so in the hotel
class selector we're going to set the
colour of the border to this so you can
also set different colors for the border
they don't have to just be they just
don't have to be black and you can do
that using any of the color schemes that
we've used before any of the color
methods just go ahead and jump down to
our hotel X here which we may have to
change right now we'll find out if
border color doesn't take and then we're
going to go ahead and put that in there
like so it's going to run that change
our color here unfortunately it looks
like we're going to change our ex back
here and take out all the x's just one
moment that's two three four five and
now we're in it
wait a second
oh so change this one more time and now
we should be good so we're changing the
color here again you can use RGB you can
use our GBA you can use just a
straight-up one the like hundred forty
plus built-in colors lots of cool stuff
that you can do with that in terms of
color so they start talking about code
bloat basically just saying that we're
having a lot of code with this border
style border with border color when we
actually could do just border and then
apply it all in there so this would go
around the whole thing in terms of
thickness should be thickness type and
then color so let's go ahead and do that
we're in this real quick so we're going
to jump right back into our Sal CSS HTML
we're going to kind of combine a bunch
of these so what we want is a border so
there's that and we want to give it two
pixels around the whole thing we want it
to be solid and we want it to be the
color / FF which i believe is black
excuse me it is wife the exact opposite
so there's also border-radius let's go
ahead and run this real quick
border-radius really is the corners of
the border you'll typically use it to
make circles and things like that or
curved corners so you see how this is
not curved at all what we're going to do
is we're go ahead and target this and
we're going to set border that's radius
now we're just going to go ahead and put
that 10px now when we run it will have
nice little curved corners right here
all right so a little bit of a hiccup
there is a new thing so they're working
through some of the kinks what we learn
we learned about borders and we learned
that that you need to set the width of
the border you need to set the style you
want to use and the color and we also
learned that it's you can go and set
just the top just the bottom of various
ways but at the end of the day the 99
percent of the time you'll be setting a
border like this in one one parameter
error one property so hope you guys
