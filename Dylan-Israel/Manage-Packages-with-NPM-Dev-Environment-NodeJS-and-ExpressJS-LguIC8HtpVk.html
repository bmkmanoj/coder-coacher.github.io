back in managed packages with NPM doing
dev environments so let's go ahead and
jump into our cloud 9 instance right now
get it going here just to be a second oh
all right
oh it's almost sick so we're gonna cover
a lot of cool topics right in every one
of these slowly but surely damn it this
ever loads there we go
okay so if you forgot how to open up the
current section we just got a call to
package how to NPM and we're gonna jump
down to dev environment now as always
just gonna start off by telling us what
we're looking to do and this in this
example we're looking to make a
directory something we're gonna be doing
a lot of and as someone who's not very
comfortable with the command line
because I've just been using gooeys all
my life all this stuff that we're gonna
be learning is gonna make us much more
comfortable with command line so
sometimes I'll tell you to do something
and you may say I actually don't know
how to do that and so such as make a
directory which is why I always do these
before and they get going not that super
complicated but you just have to know
how to do it so in this example we're
going to start installing some things
let's see here so it's basically telling
us we want to keep all our stuff
organized and that's exactly what we're
gonna do so we're gonna make a new
directory which the command do this
mkdir so like make directory and then
name it in this in our case we're gonna
just put CT 360 now if you want to see
how to see the command for that after
the fact or that see what's in your
current directory you should just do LS
like I just did there but we actually
want to change directories we want to go
into that directory so all we have to do
is CD or change directory CT
three-sixty and you'll see now our
pathing here is a little bit a little
bit different it's it's exactly where in
our current one and now we can just
check to see if we've accomplished this
this challenge here and we can do how to
NPM verify and it says our solution is
correct so now when we go how to - NPM
you'll see it's time for us to move on
so really three things three or four
things keep to keep in mind for this
quick example here first you're gonna
really want to get comfortable with
command line stuff so you saw we used LS
- look what's in our current directory
CD - change directory and then m'kay dir
to create a directory followed by the
directory name so these are all things
that you if you don't have a memorize
from years of practice or just
repetition go ahead and make a little
sticky note you'll see I have a sticky
note up with a bunch of stuff as well
that I'm keeping track of until I
memorize all this sort of stuff but just
and be aware that we're gonna you're
gonna need to be very methodical with
how you keep your files to keep
everything organized because we're
really going to be doing a lot of stuff
in the command lines could be important
to be able to see where everything goes
and it's all it going to make sense but
as always guys don't forget to Like
subscribe and share and I will see you
in the next video when we'll jump into
the login section thanks for watching
thanks for watching the video special
thanks to our sponsor dev Mountain
definitely check them out at dev
Mountain comm if you're looking for a
boot camp that's in front-end
development iOS or UX go ahead and give
them a shot tuition includes housing so
you can get up and go and fully immerse
yourself in the program as always thanks
for watching I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
