in the final part this dot state for the
first react j/s course so let's jump
right in so so far we've learned about
props being able to make our web app
using react dynamic there's also states
so states are props kind of our like
variables that change states are kind of
like just think of them as states well
Joe will jump into right now you'll kind
of see so but they both basically do the
same thing while props you'll think of
in a more dynamic sort of variable way
while states are going to kind of be
more like an event so a react component
can access information in two different
ways you'll see that what you're really
going to need to take away right here is
just get initial state this is basically
going to set the initial value for our
state and this is going to be pretty
pretty important so let's go ahead and
just create that in our function here so
we're going to create a function called
get initial state this will be the same
for all your states
and what you're going to do for this is
basically just returned a key value pair
for your state and we'll say title and
then we'll have best app as it is here
it's going to run that so this is going
to initialize our state right now
so I'm similar to how you would access a
prop using this props and then the name
of the property you same thing so does
this state so we'll go ahead and output
the state title here as the titles right
here so similar how we do anything else
so it's going to be this dot state dot
title
and it's not going to render out yet
because we haven't actually rendered it
we're going to do that right now so we
wanted to go out and react down to our
render and then what are we rendering
out we're going to now tower component
our app and then we're going to render
it out to the usual spot document dot
get element by ID and then and now we
should see our title best app
oh except app is actually a lower case
so let's make sure we don't make that
mistake there we go now so far you may
be singing aam and this is pretty
similar to props and there there is sort
of a similarity between the two so i'll
set state is how you would change the
state of something such as mood or
hungry here so you'll see right here it
goes into a little bit more that'd be
this you'd be within the object simply
how you do props this dot set state
within reset it so let's go ahead and
move on we'll actually get into doing an
example so this goes on to say the most
common way to reset a state is to just
create a function that's going to reset
it so you'll see right here make some
fog is then going to set the state of
whether to foggy so it's kind of just
like a way of doing things and I'm not
too familiar with the difference between
states and props other than I believe
States reset on load okay so if the if
the call isn't happen again when you
render it the state's going to reset
ma'am so let's look at the line 12 it
says here and you'll see that there's a
ternary operator going on here the same
look if this mood is good set it to bad
else set it to good and then we're
setting the state here for mood which
has an initial value of good to our new
mood variable so go ahead and jump and
toggle that Jas and we're going to do
something quite similar so we want to
give an initial
function initial state here so we
recycle a good initial state and that's
a function and what we're going to do
here let's just go ahead and return the
state color to green and ran our green
is a variable not a string so there's no
quotation sir
so inside of toggles render want to give
the following attribute to the div now
it says right here you may be looking to
is like well why are we using 22 pairs
of curly brackets and they actually tell
us not to worry about it and we'll find
out in react j/s part 2 so make sure you
watch that tutorial as well all the
tutorials um except the JavaScript ones
from free code can i redo those those
are bad those are the dark ages but um
alright so over its st. sing here if
you're sending the background which is a
simple CSS property and we're going to
set it to this the color that is this
state which happens to be green then
finally on line two we're gonna also
create it looks like we don't have our
react dome so we're going to lie ahead
and require that file
and then we're going to go ahead and it
looks let's run this order so in between
gay initial state all right so now we're
going to actually change the state value
here we're going to create a new
function called change color and
remember when we want to set the state
they recommend that most of the time
we're going to actually just do within a
function so we'll do this and what we
want to do here is we want to change the
color to yellow if it's currently green
so we'll do similar to how they did
before or oh we forgot to render render
it out here for this first step so let's
go ahead and do that so we'll just do a
react Dom da render now what are we were
entering out we are renting out our
toggle component
and from here we just want to do it to
document dot get element by ID and we're
going to do it to the application like
we always do so now we're going to jump
back in to where we were creating change
color we're gonna create a variable
called new color we just do a simple
ternary operator like we did before
we're going to say look if it's green if
new color is equal to green then set it
so States color yellow if it's currently
green all right so if it's green set it
to yellow else set it to green and then
from here all we want to do is return
the value so we're going to say color
and then where it's set it to new color
how to run that
oh wow um
so it looks like i did something
incorrect so let's go ahead and take a
look at our example code so when we go
into mood j/s oh excuse me I returned it
what we actually need to do is set the
state my bad so we're going to set the
state and what are we setting the state
of like so it is going to be the color
and then new color let's double check
make sure it looks like we are on point
this summer D'Ablo confused with the
initial state and of course make sure
that you put that in the correct
location so you'll see right here i put
in good initial state we actually won't
put a name to change color and then you
remember that this is actually a return
statement that i am just butchering
right now alright buddy now so we're
returning color and then the color here
is by default green I believe I don't
think we need this either
oh we do actually worse
yo yo yo what did I what did i do here
guys so I'm totally butchering something
up so of our new color 30
our new moon is equal this state move oh
whoops alright so I messed up this so
this dot state dot mu dot color and then
we pass in if that is equal to our
ternary operator there we go I'm still
kind of new to this as well okay so i do
apologize this state dot yo yo yo yo on
the day has come back my friend so our
new color is equal to this dot state dot
color which is equal to it is right
please be right
hi there we go um
so our wonderful ternary operator that
we finally after having a few brain
farts kind of kicked through sorry about
that but now what we're all we're going
to want to do is create a button here it
says underneath the h1 tag so let's go
ahead and jump down to here create a
button and we're going to just put
change color it's going to run that
very nice now let's make the button
actually work so we're just going to go
ahead and add a on click attribute that
is going to call our change color
function and don't forget that this is
i'm typing this out as if we're doing
regular HTML we are not we're doing your
neck so this does change cullet and now
we run this once this renders we will be
able to click this and it's going to
change every time and the reason that we
can't do this within the render function
is it would in theory create an infinite
loop because every time we set the state
or change the state it actually then
rear enders
okay what is going on here gents pretty
sure was
it's going to run this one more time I
thought we already did this out this is
what's going on i spelt color
capitalized look how now alright so on
click and then we're studying it equal
to this dot change color spelling and
syntax will be the death of me all right
let's go ahead and run this for the
final time banging let's see it we got
it this time I'm positive I see no other
areas i could possibly make with naming
and setting up this
yeah I don't don't disappoint me right
now okay cookout oh there it goes almost
done it's really just load really slowly
it doesn't love this slow for you guys
please do let me know now you'll see
right here it's changing color so it's
changing the sick state in our setting
the state here base of our our new color
here it's running render each and every
time pretty cool well that's pretty much
it goes into more detail over these next
two things here about how change color
calls this set state so right here our
on click function is called to change it
between green and yellow and it goes in
a little bit more about these brackets
it talks about how we we should also
have to call render and grin right but
it's actually by default set up so that
this set state automatically calls
render this is why you can't call it
within the render function because I
need to have an infinite loop um so
after that just kind of congratulate
yourself on finishing up the first part
of react Jas I'm kind of curious why
they just make it one course but hey I
guess we'll find out going on but as
