algorithm scripting in the bonfire
section return largest numbers in a race
so let's go ahead and get started so
basically what we want to do is we want
to iterate through this for this array
and then we want to return the largest
number from the array so instead of a
normally we would have one for loop
iterating through right because there's
multiple arrays in our array we need to
it's an array of arrays we need to for
for loops and we also need to return a
new array so the first thing you can do
this thanks for the encouragement they
said thank you first thing we want to do
is you want to create an empty array you
can name it whatever you want I just
named mine largest array and while we're
at it we are going what we want to
return is the largest array I want to
return our new array okay so what what
do we want to do next so we need to
iterate through the first spot of our
array so standard for loop so RI is
equal 0 started at 0 while I is less
than the array we're taking in which is
our our dot length continue on I plus
plus so this all up good but before we
start our second for loop what we need
to do is set a baseline number and we'll
save our largest number there's equal to
0 you see here all the numbers are
positive so we can set it to 0 and it
should work just fine
so in our for loop and the reason we set
it here instead of outside is because we
need it to reset to zero every time it
reiterates through this for loop so
let's uh
so basically when we're running through
out there
I we're running through this and when
we're gonna run through the air the for
loop of I when we ran through our second
for that we're gonna run through each
one of these so that's the way to think
about it and now we didn't do our second
for loop so here we're gonna say for VAR
j and we'll set that equal to 0 IJ is
less than r dot lands and then we will
do j plus plus cool
so what do we want to do in here this is
where you do an if statement and we want
to say if the largest number that we've
kept track up is less than our current
array index so the I and then the J so
like 0 1 would be 5 0 would be this then
then the J of 1 would be this so if
that's true
let's reset largest number equal to it
go to R and then J okay so in sight
still inside the largest array so we
want to be in this for loop here so you
can see right here it's underlined we
want to push it into our new array so we
wanna say largest array dot push cuz if
we if we were to do it in the if
statement we'd do it for every value we
only want the top one from this for loop
so once it's done running through here
we run this and we add whichever the
largest number so once they largest or a
dot push and you don't if you don't
remember what push means push is what we
use when we are trying to just add on to
an array so it just adds it on to the
end so in this case the first one is a
it start it would start at 0 when it
does it then we return largest array and
that should be it so you can see right
here let's check our work so 5 is the
largest here
27:39 and
a thousand and one so let's just run the
test and as always tell everyone and
their dog say we're killing it at free
code camp and submit and go on to the
next challenge
and see what's going on here oh and as
always let's let's go ahead and actually
head back and put in our comments so I
suggest you know doing this just to
really understand what's going through
so create an empty array to fill later
largest number placeholder to fine
largest number and here we set the value
and here we add our just number to new
array and then here we just set so you
can just leave that blank so there's not
too much comments right here but as
always guys I hope this helped and I
will see you in the next video which
before I got distracted it looks like
it's going to be on confirm the ending
so we're looking for substring so it
looks like so we're basically going to
check a string and see if it's contained
within it so in this case Bastion n
should return true because there is an
end but we'll get that to that in the
next video and this video is only about
six minutes again but I spent about
probably about 20 minutes of prep doing
it beforehand
so don't don't necessarily be upset if
you have to go and do some research
because that's all part of coding and
keep on trying hard and I'll see you
guys in the next video
and as always comments questions
constructive criticism all that's
appreciated thanks thanks for watching
the video don't forget to Like and
subscribe that helps me out a ton and I
appreciate all the comments that I get
and all the questions I get in the
comments and I'm happy to answer them so
keep them coming and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
