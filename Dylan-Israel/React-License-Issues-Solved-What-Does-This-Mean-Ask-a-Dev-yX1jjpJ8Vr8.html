recent news with react so in the past
the react library has had some licensing
issues we're going to talk a little bit
about why that is and now that they're
gone what it means for the industry as a
whole so about two three days ago the
the people in charge of the Facebook
license decided you know what we're
gonna let's just open it up again we're
getting too much backlash about the
licensing and go back in history a
little bit most open source software's
have what's referred to as an MIT
license what that basically means is
it's a very basic license that says hey
you can take our software you can use it
it's open source he'll you if you really
even wanted to you could resell it right
you can use it in your application build
something within the sell that
application right and what Facebook
Facebook did a while back was they said
you know what we don't really like the
wording of that license and it doesn't
really protect us as much as we can
as Facebook we're a giant corporation
and that paints a giant target you know
that's where the money is and so that's
who's going to get sued right they use
their open-source library even though it
says you know use at your own risk they
didn't like the wording of it basically
and they wanted they wanted something a
bit stronger so they came up with their
own license that basically said that if
you sue us then you can't use our open
source software that's basically the
gist of it it's a lot you know it's
legal stuff it's a lot more complex but
what what ended up happening is people
really started worrying about the
licensing issue with react and although
a lot of react projects definitely kept
going and a lo a lot of react projects
still exist it did have an effect where
it wasn't a concern for angular for
instance now why is this a big deal well
one it's one it's no longer the case of
Facebook released with about three or
four other frameworks that they've
they've worked on the
lesser known ones that that hey we're
back to MIT right we're reef weary
throwing them all back into MIT and the
react community rejoiced I think you
know everyone's really happy about that
but what sort of impact do you think it
had and well for one I can tell you that
it makes so with starting a new project
you have to think about it as a business
right as a corporation and and
corporations largely are very timid and
what I mean by that is when you have one
or the other right and they are not
identical right reacts very different
than angular angular is very different
from react and they both have strengths
and weaknesses but at the other day you
could build something in reactor you
could build something very similar in
angular vice-versa so when you have this
option for corporations and they say
look we typically want to err on the
side of caution caution being that this
license is a little bit more aggressive
than we feel comfortable with meanwhile
this this tool that we can use over here
doesn't have that issue and for a while
you know that would affect a couple
people and people is a major concern
right
it's just on their mind that this
license may be an issue and the trend of
react has been going up steadily but
maybe not as much a part of that part of
that upward growth for react developers
and reacts projects is that for the
transition between angularjs to angular
was not a smooth one to say the least
right it's not backwards compatible it
had its own much more serious drama
going on and you know yet all these
developers in angular that were
investing time and energy so investing
time and energy to build to learn this
framework really well and then to find
out it's not backwards compatible pissed
off a lot of developers it also from
that same business standpoint of people
saying hey you know because we're as a
company we're timid that's that's the
sort of thing is most of the time we
want to err on the side of caution does
it really make sense to jump into
something
in beta and still having the kinks
worked out and do we want to start an
angularjs project knowing that in the
near future
near future a year or two it's not it's
gonna be considered legacy and there's
going to be bigger and better things out
there and the answer is no and for a
while
reactors climbing climbing climbing it
still did but the concern became you
know time has passed angular has made up
for some of that gap that react jobs
were like up a hundred and fifty percent
in like three years which was pretty
crazy and now the part of the angular
catch-up was okay well that time has
passed people have started adopting
angular now that it's stable and there's
multiple versions and there's more
documentation out there there's courses
out there it's a lot more well
understood by the developer community
and then react comes in and everyone's
loving it but angular is finally hitting
its stride and then the the licensing
thing happens and people start it starts
being a concern and it's I don't know
that it was necessarily justified I
could just say that from a business
standpoint you're gonna err on the side
of caution but now now now now that's no
longer the case the MIT license is here
react developers don't have to worry
about that as well as future projects
that when considering how to architect
and what tools and frameworks and
libraries to use it's not going to
dissuade individuals to use them or to
not use them and so now we're back on an
even playing field so you kind of have
the less legal aspects of do we need to
consider this from a legal standpoint
and now you're back to the aspect of
which tool actually in its functionality
works best for what we're trying to
accomplish is a large infrastructure
heavy massive architecture of angular or
is react which is a view library and you
know it gets more and more complex as
you start using additional modules and
plugins and libraries that's feed into
it like Redux and so on
so forth is this something that we're on
use and we don't have to consider are we
gonna be you know out of luck if we if
this license issue bites us in the ass
not anymore so that that's a
consideration that straight it's really
exciting right because no one no one
wants my girlfriend's excited about
something nobody wants to wants to wants
to have to worry about a licensing issue
we want to say look let's take the
technologies let's apply them to our
specific scenario weigh the pros and the
cons and see what is the best decision
and in in Facebook's case what I think
happened was that somebody from legal
and I'm sure they get sued all the time
when you have when you're where the
money is right there's a reason that
like when when someone at your work does
something they shouldn't do usually that
person gets fired but they'll sue that
person they sue the company right
because that's where the money is at and
I say Ella it's on the company that you
cut and it probably is but there's a
reason they sue the company same thing
happens with Facebook fish looks a big
target and they said look we just won't
be more protected they probably get what
they have a lot they have a they have a
legal department I'm sure of many many
people and handling frivolous lawsuits
all the time and they just want to be
better protected and in this case I
think they they they let the legal side
impact the development side of the
business and I don't even know that it
was a bad decision I think it was a
probably a very logical decision but if
you want people to use your framework
for how great it is or your library for
how great it is they're gonna have to
take that aspect out and I'm glad they
did this has been and and if you read up
on it that they say that's the reason
why they wanted to change the license
the first time to something that was
more protected because they were getting
so many frivolous lawsuits and this
basically protected them and made their
life easier so they don't have to worry
about getting sued and spending time
money and energy to handle these
lawsuits so I understand I hope they
don't end up getting sued more because
of it is then they might switch it back
right
like they might say damn man how many
lawsuits were we actually saving having
this old license but uh I don't think
that's gonna happen I don't think they
would have ever changed it if they
weren't gonna stick with a my team but
it is something to think about right
maybe they have a good point of we were
really protecting ourselves so maybe we
cut our lawsuits in regards to react by
half by just switching the license and
giving us more legal protection I really
hope that's not the case but then having
MIT I use a lot of open source software
at my previous work and inside projects
I'm glad to see that they're they're
adopting a more loose license for MIT
and developers can now just weigh the
pros and the cons of the framework and
the libraries to against one another
instead of having to worry about legal
aspects because that's no fun that's to
real-world so that's my two cents on the
the MIT license issue glad to see that
it's solved or an MIT license and I'm
glad to see that the previous licenses
they gave that the old boom get out of
here so I would suspect that you would
see a slight increase of react jobs
because of it right more more people
willing to architect projects out in
that that maybe we're leaning towards
angular because they they didn't want to
deal with the licensing issues because
it you know most people tend to err on
the side of caution
