ways of preparing for technical
interviews one of those things it just
kind of sucks about software and that
the job market and oftentimes people
don't get roles because of that and
we're going to talk about how we can
maybe with a little bit of hard work
make it easier so that you do get those
roles and a good opportunity doesn't
pass you by so so the the most important
thing about passing a technical
interview is to be prepared and to be
calm a lot of times I know at least for
me is I get it when I'd be doing
technical interviews I was I tried to
prepare but I still would get
overwhelming do much worse than I
probably should
based off the problem that was given in
the situation and one way that you can
really overcome that is by doing mock
interviews and you can do this in person
with some developer friends or for
people I meet ups or colleagues or
something like that but another tool
that you can use if you don't have that
situation is pram comm which is a free
mock interview for a technical interview
in the way that works is you basically
get paired up about somebody for the
subject matter or language that you're
looking to let's say you're looking for
a senior JavaScript role and they would
pair you up with somebody in that role
who would then you'd have a video chat
live chat and you'd be solving this in a
browser as you're as they're kind of
going through the motions with you which
is very similar this is how my interview
was for the most part - the video chat
we had a phone call and a text editor
where they could see what I was typing
at any time with Amazon and but you know
so one this is one thing that you can
use and honestly I it's it's something I
feel like a lot of inspiring developers
who maybe just have had an internship or
haven't got started may not take
advantage of and may be intimidated -
and I completely understand that but
here is a tool that will really help you
be prepared so that you're not as
awkward when game day comes right when
it's Showtime and you can't mess up
and so I whether you do mock interviews
with with
other people or you do it through pram I
would definitely recommend doing mock
technical interviews this is something
that at least it'll make you feel a
little less awkward when it's time to
actually hit the ground running so the
next thing I would say is actually solve
algorithms practice practice practice so
you see here this is a site that I use
to prepare code fights comm which is
just an algorithm site and between the
Arcade Mode which are algorithms I
solved 92 and I solved 9 interview
practices and I actually solved like
another 20 but they changed their system
so in about a 6 week period I did about
a hundred and ten hundred and twenty
algorithms on here amongst studying
other things when I knew that I was
going to start looking for a role in the
near future and I was like okay I need
to prepare so I need to get into the the
business of being able to break down a
problem and and solve it and I need to
start thinking very analytically about
how to solve these and how fast and just
be accustomed to it because
realistically every role is different
but a lot of times especially in
front-end development
you're really not solving algorithms too
often you're not solving things you're
connecting data you're doing you're
doing sort of the the main HTTP verbs
that gets the post that puts the deletes
and you're using frameworks to move data
and display data and make things look
nice and make sure authentication is
working and all that sort of stuff and
but you're not really usually solving
complex complex equations except or
algorithms unless you're looking for a
job at which point you may again every
role is different I'm mainly talking for
front-end but at the very least most of
the time you'll have roles like this now
it depends on the technical interview
and the company some companies will
actually give you like a front-end
assignment say hey we just want you to
build a calculator hey we want you to do
this or that especially if you're on the
junior end I can't really speak too much
to the senior in I've you know I'm I've
all I have less than two years
experience in the field but I'd imagine
that stuff like similar may or may not
happen maybe not as much the more senior
you get but
it is important to practice these
algorithms because that more than likely
that is going to be what you get tested
on that is how you're going to get
tested and you need to practice that so
that's number two the third thing is
actually do company specific research
anytime I have a in person technical
interview or a technical interview over
the phone whatever it is I always start
to do company specific research and this
may not work for every company but it's
definitely the ones that you you can and
all it takes is just the literally type
in company name interview questions and
see what may be there and you can do
this at any part of the interview we're
mainly talking about technical
interviews but this can actually help
you be prepared to answer questions for
the maybe the more personality driven
ones or the the right fit driven ones
where you're trying to people are trying
to figure out is this guy it's like
gonna be there so that they're going to
be a right fit you know what it and
sometimes questions will catch you off
guard this is your opportunity to go and
do that research and just prepare so
that when the time comes you can answer
it accordingly and not be asked on often
maybe give a better answer than you
normally would get so a company's
specific research is my number three and
honestly it's a little bit of work these
are all a lot of work this is the thing
but if you say if you actually think
about what it is when you're getting a
role you're probably gonna make more
money it's probably gonna be a better
job and if you just say okay well I'm
gonna devote 200 hours to this all right
200 hours of preparing and you're that
mates to some of you sound crazy sound
absolutely 200 hours I'm not preparing
for 200 hours well if you study for 200
hours over a three-month period you're
putting in what about 30 hours a week
studying not necessarily for technical
interview but preparing for that for 3
months that's about 200 hours and so
maybe 25 hours a week and that's really
what it takes but if you actually think
about what you're getting paid out be by
that so you get a $10,000 raise on that
200 hours that you put in over three
months it's totally worth it fine
so that's how I think about it when I'm
preparing I do prepare quite a bit for
these things and fill out job apps when
when time comes but do companies
specific research because it can really
help you so number four and I hate that
this is even a thing but it does work
from I've yet to read it but I've had so
many people recommend it that I find it
hard not to recommend it myself so many
people I respect and so many people who
I know have succeeded through doing this
but reading the book cracking the coding
interview it's kind of crazy right that
we have to have actually go find a book
about how to prepare for technical
interview I don't know
it just it just blows my mind for some
reason but cracking the coding interview
is people have been there on the sixth
edition now people have been using this
to prepare for those technical
interviews for so so long and I'm sure
if you can solve these eight 189
programming questions and solutions
you'll probably ace almost anything that
goes in there and prepare yourself it's
just kind of crazy to me it's very very
kind of crazy that this is the state of
software development where we have to
study more so to get the job than for
the job which is kind of exactly what I
hated about school was more theory than
practical but that's a separate video so
the last but not least number five is
preparing for specific framework
specific language questions that are
common throughout the field so in this
example is angularjs again it's as
simple as typing in something like
angularjs interview questions and seeing
what are some basic questions to prepare
and every company is different but this
is all about covering all your bases and
preparing yourself in this field for PHP
Python node JavaScript whatever it is
but being able to answer the the basic
intermediate and advanced interview
questions and so that you can you you
don't sink you swim right and you need
to do this for the specifics usually
when you're getting a roll full stack
front-end back in but there's usually a
core part of that if you're back in
maybe c-sharp or PHP or front-end
JavaScript you need to have that one
language that one that's what you need
to prepare for and if you're going in
for an angular role you should be able
to pass the interview questions for the
angular role now that doesn't mean you
have to be a guru or know absolutely
everything but there are some questions
that you need to be prepared for and you
need to make sure that you can answer
them that you know if if you could ask
hey what are the four main HTTP HTTP
verbs and you don't say get put post
delete people are gonna look at you
strange when you say that you have
front-end developer experience and it
could be stuff like that or it can be
much more detailed that's a very
entry-level question but you need to
prepare yourself as much as you can to
do these things to to be prepared and
it's not it this part isn't asking too
much right the other ones are a lot of
time a lot of effort but financially if
you prepare yourself and you get a new
role I'm assuming you're leaving a role
for more money and if you do you get a
$10,000 raise and you invest 200 hours
preparing it probably will pay off
financially for you otherwise you won't
take the role and you'll wait for
another one right so it's just these are
five things that you can do to prepare
yourself for a technical interview and
hopefully some of them you're already
doing hopefully some of them you'll add
to but it does take a lot of time and
effort when looking for a new job and
transitioning or you're looking to get a
job and starting in the field and it's
not an easy thing but there are
resources and there are assets out there
to help you to do that so I hope I hope
you found this helpful
as always thank you so much for watching
the videos guys I appreciate you so much
good luck in your technical interviews

patreon all that good stuff I'll see you
next time bye hey baby what's one way
someone might prepare for a technical
interview oh I don't know maybe not
study the table
