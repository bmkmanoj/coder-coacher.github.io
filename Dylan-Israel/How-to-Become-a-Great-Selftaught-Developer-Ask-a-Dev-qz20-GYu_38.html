self-taught developer and I've been
working in the industry about two to
three years depending on if you count
just development time or not but uh so
I'm still fairly new but I'm doing quite
well for myself I had to say and one of
the more common questions I get is how
do I become a self-taught developer what
are the things that you would tell
yourself you know the steps the guides
the sort of tips and tricks if you will
as the kids like to say of how to become
a self-taught developer and so today I'm
going to give you my top ten and if
you're a traditional developer really I
think we're all self-taught developers
at the end of the day even if you've
gone and got a computer science degree
because oftentimes you're gonna have to
be a self-taught developer seed in this
world learning doesn't stop at the boot
camp learning doesn't stop at college
and so these are my 10 tips for
specifically for self-taught developers
but I think you apply it for any
developer and be very successful with
them
if you're looking at how to sort of
break into the industry I am 300 pages
in the 700 piece of genius by John it is
absolutely phenomenal I'm loving every
minute of it I read like a hundred pages
last night slowed me down a little bit
because I had engineer truth over for a
week he broke me off my nighttime
reading but I'm loving it and I would
recommend for everyone who's interested
in software development regardless of
your career to pick it up on Amazon I
have an affiliate link in the
description below you can help me and
John out in at the same time I took
number one of the top 10 tips' all right
tip number one is I haven't defined
goals slash skills that you plan to
learn a lot of times one of the most one
of the hardest things for you to do is
to actually know what to learn right and
so it's it's quite intimidating
especially in the world of web
development which I'm assuming most of
you are interested in because that's
where a ton of the jobs are that you
need to you need to know what you need
to learn and before you can learn that
stuff you need to define a define the
goals so if you want to do front-end
development you're gonna need to pick up
HTML CSS JavaScript a framework such as
reactor you need to know version control
you should be familiar with testing
maybe even dive into a little bit of
agile methodologies if you really wanted
to go the extra mile right
pick up some jQuery these are things
that are you're gonna have to know
period and you need to you need to have
a goal you need to have a set of skills
so you say okay when am i ready to be a
developer what am I ready to start
working as a developer and you have your
checklist so that's what my first bill
is for you is go and define that
checklist if you're not sure what that
checklist should be there's wonderful
videos on these awesome coding channels
like myself or that you can go but also
what I what I do to know what I should
learn and how I did it was I just went
to I said okay I want to be a front-end
engineer that was my goal I want to be a
front-end engineer and then maybe later
I moved to full stack but full stack is
farther down the road how can I be a
front-end engineer I just went on indeed
I went on LinkedIn and I found out what
the skills were when I
typed-in junior front-end engineer and I
saw what they were and over and over and
over again these ten things stood out
and then that was how I was like okay
this is how I'm gonna miss a sound I'm
gonna do it I gotta get these skills
once I have these skills they're gonna
want to hire me that that's how I looked
at it and it worked quite well and they
can for you too so that's my first tip
is going to find what those goals and
skills are that you need to have for the
role you're trying to get oftentimes
people just sort of wing it one thing at
a time no you need a game plan go and
start making that game plan so tip
number two it's code every day I will be
screaming this from the mountaintops
till the day the world burns and ends
but coding every day is something you
hey I have to do and how many hours a
day three to four if possible that is my
my go-to not really more I don't
discourage against more but I think
consistency is more important than the
amount I think if you do seven days a
week four hours a day versus you know
eight hours every other day I think
you're gonna have twice the return
because it is about just keeping it
fresh in your mind and being able to
start thinking differently every day and
putting you in that thought process so
you have to put the work in right a lot
of us have kids a lot of us have family
obligations job obligations it's no
excuse you're going down a hard route
man going down a to learn software
development is not something that's easy
it is something that you can do a lot of
people can do not everybody but a lot of
people can do if they put the work in
and so you have to put the work in that
and that's true thematic so you're gonna
put the time in that's really tip number
two is just expect to put in about three
to four hours a day now if you if I say
that and you think there's a dedicated
bed this really read that doesn't means
like 30 minutes a day no let me be
extremely clear I mean three to
four hours a day and tell you have a
 job I can't make it any more
clear than that so if that sounds like
an awful situation to you this isn't for
you
self-taught route it's gonna be hard
alright so just understand that that's
part of the process so tip number three
this is something that I didn't do and
when I first started but tip number
three is don't waste time and on when
you're being blocked when you're stuck
don't force yourself to hammer away at
that algorithm and spend waste a whole
day making no progress it could be that
you've you've ran into something you're
not quite ready for yet
that's alright so I give the algorithm
example because that's a mistake I've
made where it's like spending eight
hours on this one algorithm when in
reality what I needed to do was I needed
to take a break from this specific
problem say well you said three four
hours day I can take a break I know you
can you just move on to something else
right when you're stuck on an algorithm
you start a project you go to a meet-up
you do all these sort of other
activities that you're still making
progress but you're not hammering away
making little to no progress on this one
problem that doesn't mean that you are
giving up in a bamming I entirely know
what it means is that you're giving your
mind a break who the reason you can't
solve is because you're attacking it in
the same way and you or you may just not
be ready and so you're gonna go and use
your time productively it's not
productive to sit somewhere and make no
progress that doesn't mean that you go
up and look up that solution or anything
I really advise against that but what it
does mean is that you go and use your
time productively so when you are
blocked take a break from that specific
issue and go move on to something else
build a project you blocked on that
project go and build another project it
really really the cool thing about
software development is you're taking
the abstract and making it concrete so
when you have abstract you make anything
concrete right so you can take these
ideas and you just build them this it
doesn't matter you start started this
project you're halfway through you got
some stuff y'all come back to it start
this other one it started knocking out
Bam Bam Bam now should you leave those
projects off built should you not solve
those algorithms absolutely not but you
need to be able to consistently make
progress and if you're spending hours
upon hours just hammering away wanting
to solve something where you're clearly
blocked I highly encourage you just to
move on and come back to it so tip
number four go to meetups I'll say this
till I am out of breath try and go to
meet up about once a week
everyone's Geographic
location is slightly different but
meetups are an excellent resource for
entry-level developers when you do go to
meetups bring copies of your resume
every single time make sure they're
clean make sure they're crisp make sure
your resume is excellent there's no
spelling mistakes all your contact
information is is good you know I have
redone my resume about once every three
months redefining it and making it
better and you're probably gonna need to
do the same if not more often because
you're going to be increasing so
unbelievably rapidly as a someone who
started coding for three months the
developer you are at three months first
the developer you're at six months
should be three times better you know
not twice as good but three times better
because you're getting up and running
and then those extra three months BAM
you are in your groove right if you've
been sticking with it for hours every
day so you need to be updating that
resume you need to carry cautiously well
why'd you carry copies to go to meetups
well not only you're gonna learn at that
Meetup maybe get some free clothes like
a free shirt free pizza free is awesome
right but also companies are looking to
hire right there is a shortage of good
developers are there a shortage of bad
developers no there there's a lot of bad
developers which is why a lot of people
can't get a job and that's not to say
like I'm the god tier like sometimes I I
jokingly call myself coding god and some
people think I'm like obsessed with
myself it's more so uh just humor guys
it's trying just me being a little over
the top but what I'm trying to say is
that companies are looking to hire good
developers have your resume be willing
to be able to talk very intelligently
about the subject matter on your resume
and be able to introduce yourself to
people who are hiring last meetup I went
to there's three companies before we
started me and the talks was like we're
looking to hire we're looking to hire
we're looking to hire if you got these
skills come talk to us in the back three
different companies this happens all the
time so I highly encourage you to start
going to meetups and starting that and
so that's tip number four tip number
five is slightly related to tip number
four start building that network right
and this is something that's going to
probably pay off later in life then
sooner but it can so your network
you need to start meeting other
developers people in the space project
managers recruiters business analysts
back-end developers front end developers
you start making these friendships these
connections he's ever know you never
know maybe in the near in the short term
you've gone to some of these meetups for
instance because a lot times people well
I don't know anyone deal and I work at
Domino's delivering pizzas they know
they know developers there doesn't like
I get it you got to go ahead to your way
one thing that I do when I say hey I
want to move across country I want to
move to these five cities what can I do
well I could start adding all the
recruiters in that area for the
companies that I want to work with so
that on LinkedIn at the very least when
I see that they're posting I can then
reach out and say hey I saw that you had
this job opening I'd love to you know
throw my name in the candidate pool I
think I'm well-qualified bam-bam-bam do
that you can also go to meetups start
meeting people so you know they have you
start making these relationships and
then you know an internship or junior
level role comes out and say Amen we're
about to have this internship would you
like to apply I thought you'd be a good
fit for it
these are the types of things that you
can happen then later on those
relationships flourish like a flower
all right flower flourish and you're
able to maybe get roles at larger
companies you know that everyone's
progressing in their career there's
people I worked with seven years ago
that I just you know worked a normal job
with that now work at Google right and
so that's a good connection I've seen
you so I'll start building that Network
so that's tip number five tip number six
side projects side projects side
projects side projects I have a whole
video giving like 40 ideas or something
like that for side projects to get just
get the juices flowing but side projects
are a great way to show that you have
the characteristics of somebody of a
developer that a company is looking to
hire you are building something of your
own right you are building something
from scratch that no one else has built
or you're you know and when I say side
projects I'm not talking about building
a calculator or a weather application
I'm talking about building your own web
application it doesn't have to be super
technical it oftentimes doesn't have to
be you actually writing code now most
it will be my best side projects I said
this a million times is my coding
channel my youtube channel because it
shows what we're looking for it shows
too that you're passionate interested
and often times that you're technical
even though I'm not anymore anyhow doing
too many tutorials I still do my udemy
courses I build and I'm always building
a little fun things learning new stuff
but in terms of my channel I'm mainly
just talking about things but what it
shows is that you're passionate you're
working towards it and that you're
progressing as a developer that's what
your side projects do they show that you
not only they give you a portfolio item
but they give you a something that some
direction to continue learning you say
okay well I want to add authentication
to my app now how do I do that and now
you continue your learning progress with
this portfolio item it also just shows a
little bit about you as your personality
which is more important than a lot of
people give give themselves credit to do
so please start building side projects
it's gonna be the thing that really
makes you stand out above other
developers that's really what this whole
list is about is make sure not only that
you're prepared but you stand out and
that you are a a developer that when
they look at the stacks of resume
because they will have a stack of resume
that your resume pops out a little bit
more because I'll unique you are so
number number six at number seven I
think
number seven is use your experience to
your advantage the old domain knowledge
so um what does that mean what domain
knowledge me well a lot of times if
you're watching this video a good
portion of you are leaving a job or
trying to leave a job that you either
don't love anymore you never loved
and you want to just have a better
career have a better better life and so
you're coming from these these places
where there's not really any relevance
right if you're a cashier or a pizza
delivery driver like I was there's not
too much that you can relate there right
but on the chances that you can use that
to your advantage so one of the things
I'll make you stand out as a junior
developer is they will much more that
they're more much more likely to hire
you if you have experience in their
industry or knowledge about the domain
knowledge of how things run and so one
at one
of search technique you could have is
start applying to roles where it's
relevant right my last work the
co-worker got his very first story now
there's a military contracting company
he was ex-military thus he had domain
knowledge of what their their industry
was about which was one of the reasons
he got the job and so it's one of the
few times that I would suggest putting
your previous experience on the resume
so in my example I might I have like
five years delivering pizzas
you could say I'm a pizza industry
expert at this point but all jokes aside
if I was one thing I actually actively
did was I went and I made a resume
specifically designed for applying to
software roles in the pizza space in the
food delivery space and I I had a resume
specifically done designed to that and I
applied to junior level roles at all
these companies they didn't work out for
me but it does for a lot of people so I
encourage you to take your domain
experience and at least put some of your
time towards having a custom resume in
that space as well as like if you're if
you work at Home Depot you trying to
make a transition there's a ton of
construction companies I need you know
web developers and things like that that
you could go and apply to jobs like that
and have the your resume catered to that
so I encourage you to use that so um
number eight is read the right books and
use the right materials so start this
this this um video I did a little self
promo slash affiliate link right for the
complete software developers career
guide which again there's a link in the
description honestly this has been the
best software book I've ever read which
is one of the only ones I've ever read
true but one thing that I would suggest
when I say read the right books I don't
encourage you to read books that are on
actual coding I think that's a waste of
your time I think you'll have a much
better time reading books that are more
soft skill related more change your
mentality about software development
which is why I like this book so much it
actually gives you a lot of very
specific examples of how to go and get
what you want
none of this sort of you know
over-the-top I will say that you
probably won't like it if you don't like
hard work because a lot of things
suggested are hard working in our
immediate get-rich-quick seams but use
the right material isn't mean just make
sure you're learning the right stuff
right and from the right people
sometimes we always want to skip paying
for stuff and and but courses are
relatively cheap you can buy a course
for $10 $15 and learn everything you
need to know and then go and apply that
right so this is something that I think
that you just need to make sure that
you're not wasting your time with the
wrong books it's kind of it I know a lot
of times people really are over the top
with I have to read these books to be
successful not necessarily this this is
I'm you know I've had two software jobs
this is the first book I've read I
actually wish I read it so much sooner I
would learn so much more and I would be
so much farther ahead in my career
without a doubt but I have four other
books that I've cued up such as cracking
the coding interview clean code these
are all things I'll do reviews on
eventually but basically just read the
right books and use the right materials
in terms of courses that you're going to
be doing online so number nine is it's
kind of this is kind of like a
three-part number nine so continue
learning after your first job now you've
got the job
all right congratulations if you did
these first eight you probably got job
but continue learning be willing to
potentially job hop and I'll explain why
and circle back to the principles the
writing clean code the what is rest what
is saw it because a lot of times and
often times I've been a victim of this
work
I don't know these sort of technical
terms like I if you explain to me what
they are I can go and I can review them
and I could go and I oh yeah so you're
talking about you know singular
responsibilities or whatever it is the
point the point being that as a
self-taught developer there's some
principles that you're gonna miss out on
right and this doesn't mean that as a
computer science graduate you're not
gonna have these either but there are
principles of writing code that you may
not even know exist and it's up to you
to go and can
to your education in that and that so on
the principal's access there's that
there's also the continued learning
after you're getting your first role you
need to those three to four hours that
doesn't stop when you land a role now
will your learning be more catered of
course for the first three to four
months you're gonna be learning the
stack at your work but when after you
learn that stack I would highly suggest
you sit and you look at your workplace
six to seven to nine months I don't say
am I still growing here as a developer
because oftentimes your first role this
isn't for everybody
often time your first role you're gonna
sort of be a bottom of the barrel thing
and that's okay there's nothing wrong
with that because you're still gonna be
growing but are you are you when you
stop growing at a workplace you need to
you need to one leave to leave for more
money three leave for a lot more money
alright so but and no but honestly you
need to evaluate if you're at at the
company are you still growing are you
still learning and if you're not you
need to you need to reevaluate you're at
because it is so crucial for you to keep
growing as a developer to get to those
to get to those massive companies with
the big salaries and the the extra
benefits and but really it's just it's
gonna be boring and dry and you're not
gonna like it so I would encourage you
to continue your learning outside of
work and then when your work dries up in
terms of learning because a lot of you
are going to start with some maybe basic
jobs not that there's anything wrong
with that we've all been there but
considered job hopping for more money as
well as a better work environment as
well as just to learn more and then
circle back to the principles of writing
clean code and concepts that maybe
you've skipped over and this is number
ten the mack daddy the one that
everyone's going to ignore the one that
people are going to not spend as much
time as they should prepare for
interviews and I'm not just talking
about technical interviews you got to
prepare for a technical interview
otherwise you're gonna be everyone in
that room is gonna be awkward
everyone hates that guy who shows up to
the technical interview you have him
write a for loop on the board and he's
like oh
I don't know what a for-loop is right
now and then it's just awkward right
don't be that guy nobody wants to be
that guy the guy who's riding the floor
Luke doesn't want to be that guy the
people in that room who's watching you
not write a for loop don't want to be
there either so prepare for your
technical interviews that's a given
right um I'll still prepare for your
soft interviews know what you're gonna
say know how you know phone interviews
are gonna go know how you're gonna pitch
yourself know what you're gonna say in
terms of certain questions right if
you're interviewing for a front end role
you should be if someone asks you what
you know the main HTTP verbs are you
should be able to say get post put
delete just basic things for the
technical phone screen if you're if
you're if you're going at the end of
every interview they ask questions like
hey do you have any questions for me
have at least one question have a go-to
question I have a go-to question I'm not
gonna share it with you not well
my go-to question and this is something
that's very true is I want to know if
they have any side projects because I am
interested in developers who are getting
better and to me side projects mean that
I want to work with passionate
developers that as always might have
been my goal and so that is the question
I asked because honestly until I meet
the developers I they're just trying to
sell you on a workplace and you'll never
really know if you're a good place or
not until you're actually there and the
people you work with directly so prepare
for your interviews the soft interviews
and the technical interviews and it's
gonna take a lot of time for my last
roll I prepared for about three months
doing about a hundred algorithms and
redoing my resume redoing my LinkedIn
when I knew that I was going to start
going on to the next endeavor the next
the next adventure right so it is a lot
of hard work and I think that's kind of
what this list is is hard work and just
working smart right and so I hope you
found this helpful again I think these
are the things that made me successful
for the most part I did probably about
eight at ten of these when I was when I
made the jump to like okay I'm dropping
out of school this is not enough I will
go the self-taught route I can do it and
these were the things that I had to
stick to that made my life easier
and things that I for the most part
still pretty do pretty much do every
single day so we found this helpful
whether you're self-taught or whether
you are a a traditional educated you're
really gonna have to be self talking
this industry that's just the way that
it goes even if you have a masters or
PhD you have PhD I mean it never I've
touched whatever you're gonna work at in
life so you gotta you have to learn it
learning doesn't stop after you give job
is one thing that I just really want to
stress and I hope that you take that to
heart because I've seen too many
developers go get their first job in now
you know they're they're making much
more money than they were making before
but they're in the same role doing the
same thing building
restaurant websites or something like
that there's anything wrong with that
but my goal has always been to make sure
that the developer I am a year from now
is twice as a developer I am today and
so I hope that you guys try and take the
same mentality but I thank you so much
