are this next video will actually be the
part that you're going to have need the
most help with so in interest of time
we're gonna be changing these 25 to
fives because we're actually gonna see
the countdown now so I'm gonna just run
that so we're all on the same page so
what we're actually gonna do is count
down in terms of second space off this
value when we click start so we're gonna
do that first for the session time so we
can go ahead and just this is gonna be
pure JavaScript at this point similar to
how we did the add five minus five we're
going to be using the click function or
event handler I should say so we're
gonna set that up where we are going to
target our start and we're saying look
when you click this we want you to run
some stuff
now within here what we're gonna need to
do is we're gonna create a variable and
in here I simply call it counter so
we're gonna set in there's a there's a
function called set interval basically
what this does is it's going to take in
a callback function and a set amount of
time 1000 I believe it's milliseconds
but 1000 is 1 seconds so that's that's
all you really have to know so we're
gonna take a in the timer function now
we haven't created this it yet but we're
going to so within this click function
we're gonna create a local function
called timer now in timer what it's
basically going to do is just kind of
decrement by 1 and when it hits 0 we're
gonna finish the we're gonna say look
stop counting down because it doesn't
know when to stop until we use clear
interval so here we have this we're
gonna say look and timer count is equal
to count minus 1 so if every iteration
of timer it's going to minus 1 second
again this thousand means one second and
this is the function that it's running
it on so run this function every one
second so the first thing we want to do
is basically just set up our if
statement I guess we can just show up
how to output it so what we're gonna do
is target our code our number and we're
gonna output the where's our so I'm
looking at my code right here so the way
I did was I just argued don't know and
we're going to decrement it each time so
all we're really gonna do is output
right now the current value of count so
let's go ahead and do that and I'll show
us how to decrement it but then we will
we're also gonna have to show how to
clear the interval so that it doesn't go
on for infinity just gonna start that so
every second you get see that this is
going down unfortunately it doesn't stop
so what we're gonna do next is we're
gonna set up an if statement says look
if
our count is exactly equal to 1 so if
count is equal equal to X user equal
equal to 0 we want to break essentially
break it so the way that you would do
that is you say you would target that
that counter function that we store the
counter variable that's running the set
interval function so you look clear the
interval counter so let's go ahead and
run this and make sure everything's
working so now when we do it it's going
to stop at 0 4 3 2 1 0
cool it's also a good time to go ahead
and put in the buzzer dot play cuz this
is gonna let us know that our count is
done so we're just going to put this in
here you don't remember buzzer is our
audio file that we imported and we
stored it right here
so when we do hit the count it's going
to go ahead and run this so Swango 5 4 3
2 1 0 times up there's our times up
everything's good so we actually want
all this stuff to go away now how do we
do that
well when we click start we're gonna
want to hide some stuff 1 is start so
let's go ahead and hi variables so
that's what we're gonna do right here
we're gonna go ahead and just simply
target all the variables we want to hide
we'll start with start dot hide now you
can do these all in multiple comments
the smart way of doing it there's not
how I did it originally but we're gonna
do that for this video is to do it in
one comment so we click start see how it
vanished now we have now we know our lot
we you're not gonna double turn this up
it's gonna mess with our logic that's
basically what we're doing here
so we want to do that we don't want to
be able to add new
values will put a comma so let's let's
just go look we don't want the minus
five o'clock there because we don't want
that to change our values we don't want
the add five o'clock there as well
so let's go ahead and save this run it
and you can see that that those are
gonna vanish as well so when we click
start this should be gone and this
should be gone so BAM that's gone cool
we're gonna do same thing for break time
and everything within it now those
values still exist we're just hiding
them so don't think anything is getting
overridden or anything like that so
we're gonna hide the values here as well
4-5 break
don't forget your ID or hash tag for the
ID add five break again don't forget
your hash tag or the ID and so we add
the five break - the Butterfree let's
see we want to hide break them as well
we're basically just cleaning up the
page so that nothing inter interferes
with our logic and then we're gonna
actually want to hide title 1 and title
2 because we're gonna switch those in
the mouth so those are our divs excuse
me those that are headings so this
session time we the way I did it was I
put in a new I basically changed the
time type at all times so we're just
gonna go ahead look time excuse me we're
gonna hide title 1 we're gonna tie title
2 and I believe that's all work hiding
for the time being let's go ahead and
run that so now all we should have is
our basically our heading and when we
click start and let's see and then our
countdown cool pretty straight lines up
but we kind of want to remind the user
what that is and why we have that there
so we're gonna do something that is
going to put a time type I'm sorry I'm
looking through my code I have a time
type and it doesn't look like I put that
in here so I have an empty h2 tag that
we need to add this is basically just
something that we're gonna be chart so
we remove this and we we put in a
session time within our num here we have
this empty time type tag so let's go
ahead and do that and then in our time
type
we're so swap between session time and
break time so now that we're doing we're
in the first aspect of it we want to go
ahead output some HTML now note it's
always there except you don't see it
because there's nothing in it so when we
change the HTML that's gonna become
apparent so we're just going to go ahead
and target time tight and then we're say
let's change the h2 to be something like
session
time so they know what time we're on
going to save that run it alright start
there's a recession time you're seeing
the countdown alongside of it times up I
cool
so up next guys in the next video what
we'll do is we'll have this transition
from the session time to break time
after that will format the code a little
bit there's a little bit of logic with
that and how to use modulo and things of
that nature
but as always guys thank you to everyone
