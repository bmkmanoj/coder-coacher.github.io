aggregate functions unfortunately
they're having a little bit of an error
on these kind of labs that they're doing
not allowing us to run the code so we're
gonna weight off on that and hopefully
by the time we finish this all I've
found a workaround or they will but you
know let's jump into aggregate functions
it looks like I may have done one slide
here so so aggregate functions compute a
single result from a set of input values
so let's go ahead and see what we can do
here take a look at the fake Apps table
so we want to select select all from
fake underscore Apps we want to run it
let's see what's going on here so this
is all the data we have on our fake Apps
now count how many apps are in the
database in the code I replace the
previous statement one alright so let's
see what this does
so select count so it looks like it's
going to count all the things from the
fake apps so let's run it
so type in the text code editor using
the appropriate function select account
from fake Andrus perhaps I think we have
to we have to get rid of this cuz we can
only do one query at a time so there go
so there's 200 unique unique counts I
believe is what they're saying so use
count to return total number of free
apps in the table all right so it's
right there but we're gonna we're gonna
type it out so select count so we're
gonna say count the count from our free
apps or fake apps table where the price
is equal to 0 so we have 73 73 free apps
now we want to select the price and
count all from fake apps and group by
price let's see what this does
so this is the count okay so this is
cool
so this is gonna select the price it's
going to count all of them from the fake
apps and then it's going to group it by
the price so there's 73 free ones
they're $0.99 etc and there's 12 $14.99
apps should be a hell of an app for
$14.99 so next all right so now we want
to find out how many have been
downloaded 20,000 times so we're gonna
select the price count all from fake
apps where downloads are greater than
20,000 and then we're going to group by
price so we're gonna group it by the
price that's why we select the price but
we also select the count of the toll
from the fake apps where downloads are
20,000 and then we're gonna group it by
the price
so there's been 26 free apps that have
hit that total that's cool
what does still number downloads outs
can find I think so we got to get rid of
that so we want to select the sum of
downloads from fake underscore apps so
there's probably a downloads category
and we are sum of all the downloads is
quite a bit 3 million calculate the
total number of downloads for each
category in this code editor so we're
gonna select the category category as
well as the sum of the downloads from
the fake apps and we are going to group
by category so we're selecting category
as well as the sum of the of the total
downloads from our fake apps table and
we want to group it by our category so
category this is how many books there
are this is how many business there are
businesses I guess at that point so next
I want to select max downloads from fake
apps so let's see this is good news so
the maximum number of downloads probably
the highest number a downloads for once
single app there's 31 thousand I think
that's what's going on there yeah the
largest value is max all right so now we
want to select name and category and max
downloads from our fake apps and then we
want to group it by the category so
we're just selecting certain parameters
of our database in this table and we're
grouping it that's all we're doing here
cool
next up we want to select the min
minimum amount of downloads from the
fake app so exact opposite of max this
min oops and make sure you spell your
stuff right
run it again so the minimum downloads
out of the tables thirteen hundred and
eighty-seven so select name and the
category columns as well as the result
of the min Downloads column from fake
apps
and then we want to group it by category
not bad
now we want to calculate the average
downloads for an app in the database so
that's pretty cool so now we can do some
maybe more useful stuff so we are going
to calculate that it's like we're just
calling a function on the Downloads
parameter that's kind of how I think
about it probably people who use
databases on a frequent basis would say
that's an awful way to think about it
because you think they're not objects
but to me whatever it for me if it helps
me remember it sounds good to me so the
average amount of downloads a sixteen
thousand six hundred thirteen point
eight all right so select price on the
AVG and the average of downloads from
fake apps and group by price so this
might be useful because now we're going
to be able to see what people on average
how much how many downloads in that
price range and that might help people
figure out what to price their app at so
let's do it again we're gonna slice
price there select your sees new price
and then we're actually going to around
the average so this is probably gonna
make it so that it rounds it so we don't
get all these you know eight nine
decimal places to 2 and that two primers
how many points from the decimal place
that we're gonna do it by so we're gonna
group by price let's run it and you can
see right here now we only have two
decimal places and it looks very very
clean so what else do we got here we
have select price come on round AVG
downloads from fake apps and we're going
to group by price now bet
so we're rounding the average of the
downloads kind of what we just did and
what's going on here is if we don't give
it a parameters just then round it to 0
up or down
all right and then just a little bit of
a reminder of what we just finished so
we just finished our aggregate functions
and we learned how to count we learned
grouped by some max min average round
all great mathematical mathematical
operators and so I will see you guys in
the next video and hopefully I'll have a
fix to lab so we can run it and not save
it along the way that way we can see our
work it's a lot help more helpful but I
just keep in mind that this SQL Pro this
SQL just literally came out a week or
two weeks ago so only a thousand people
have enrolled so they're still fixing
the bugs but thanks for watching as
always comments questions concerns and
anything else is appreciated
