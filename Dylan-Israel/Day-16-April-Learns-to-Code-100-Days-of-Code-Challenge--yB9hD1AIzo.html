[Laughter]
all right so let's go ahead and get this
going all right um so as we get getting
everything up right now so what what
have you worked on the last day or so
I've been trying to do the portfolio
section but I wrote some code and then I
broke my shades do you want to work
together on it today
or would you like to continue doing what
we're doing I'll leave it up to you
tomorrow sir so you got two days if not
I'm a shame you so um what what would
you like to do we like this taste
Wednesday so hi James hi Joshua will say
will continue with what we're doing and
then tomorrow if you haven't made
progress that's that's like the last day
before homework is due all right I hope
do you wanna do it today so if do you
I'm gonna do it I want to finish it I
don't really want your help
all right so we'll continue on what we
were doing today which was going over
the HTML library I believe we were on
layouts so has just been helpful so far
you're learning learning the things of
this because that was the idea
no it's very helpful okay good
um you see me even there's some things
in here Mele well shit you know about
this ancient piece of shit and so it's
pretty common
all right one high godless monkey
alright so we were on Leia all right
are you doing I don't know where you
take it okay said better yeah okay we
have it all on you you probably get us
better fucking we use ah all right so
remember we talked you were asking hey
how do I name certain things um
we're like what's good naming convention
well um though you should come a time
where you would start
you would start um like your header
would be like your header image and you
see this image here this breaks it down
pretty pretty good good
but now there's actually these tags that
help you kind of find what it is you're
trying to do now you're still gonna have
to have name your class names and yours
and and your headers but you have these
tags which are kind of like divs to a
degree um but they're just like your nav
tag would be very navigation your header
you would use that as kind of your your
container your header image a side
footer so I mean the ones that you
really need to know ah godless monkey we
will talk about off-topic things like if
I find people from East Coast more rude
or not there or west coast yeah I read
that I was like wow that is alright so
what we're doing here um let's so how
would you go about using like the
section tag or the today I'm closing
tags or is just yeah they have closing
tags all of these are containers so in
order for a container they have to have
opening and closing so you don't need to
use days you can use section um you
could but like header refers to a header
of a document or nav refers to the
navigation section defines a section in
document I want to use that article is
independent self-contained article a
side is usually for something like a
side
bar as you can see right here details
summary basically the ones that you're
going to use our header nav and footer
most of the time because you know every
page typically has a navigation and
every page has a footer and so now in
html5 they've kind of predefined these
layouts to help these containers to help
with that Kassie example of those we saw
one yesterday when we were looking at
the code pin that remember how I said it
was like by dennis white in the footer
or something like that he use a footer
div there for the time being you can
think of them as divs that are just
specific tags setting called div class
is equal to footer you just have a
footer element that does something
similar alright so I don't know that I
want to go do we want to go into
responsive web design this might be a
little I think this might be a little
advanced um yes room we're gonna square
skip responsive web design just over
blogs classes iframes yeah we did yeah
yeah we're not we're on layout computer
code
I don't understand what this is the kbd
4 cubit represents the user input like a
keyboard input or voice command hey will
so let's see this ah this is cool I
didn't know this so if we want it to one
way that we can say hey the user can if
they hold ctrl s now this isn't going to
do anything well this is going to
because we're on a page you'll say
something but I'm saying in our code it
doesn't actually do anything a browser
does something but one way that we can
see how the fonts a little bit different
this is another tag - got a free code
can meet up good man meetups are
probably one the best ways for you guys
the networks on Glenn I know one
tomorrow we are going to an angular to
meet up at a coding bootcamp called the
iron yard that hosts them regularly in
the st. Petersburg area it's smart
tomorrow at 6:30 um ok so uh this is to
denote this is basically giving context
it's going to change it as well but it's
basically user input we can use the KBD
key for a keyboard input okay we D it
just made it it changes the way that
looks
that's basically it also provides
context to match em again imagine
imagine that someone's blind and they
need context for everything there are
tags that will do that and this is one
of them and they're there maybe SEO
purposes to do something like this
so samp would be at example the opposite
instead of user input it would be pure
output user input for your output
Brian Richards are we going off a
scheduled output so III basically have a
mental note about three to four days
ahead of where we're trying to go and I
kind of basing it off her pace so today
we were going to continue going over the
html5 of w3schools ik's she's already
been working with HTML but there's a lot
that she probably hasn't discovered on
her own and we're going through it right
now to kind of just hey this exists when
you're working on your projects remember
that you need to go find this and we're
gonna right now she's finish up the
portfolio free code camp we've gone over
the JavaScript section to kind of
introduce her to that she's doing that
on her own but by Friday I hope that
she's done with the portfolio and then
Saturday airfreight so Friday she's done
Friday's lesson will be me refactoring
it and then she'll go and do it on her
own Saturday we will actually take her
out of the out of code pin and she will
be exclusively working in a text editor
at which point I will teach her git and
we'll start to do commits and things
like that as well and after that we will
continue on the Java Script path of
w3schools
while she's finishing up the Java Script
note she's doing a free coat kit and
she'll be on the algorithm section which
will be an interesting thing because I
don't know how well that's going to go
at this time
but anyhow so so remember remember how
we were console logging yeah um that
would be an example of computer output
the computer is outputting that any text
editor in specific I will be starting
her off with Visual Basic of Visual
Studio code or Adam I'm going to give
her options but my personal favorite is
Visual Studio code so that's probably
what I'm going to start out with
okay so there's also this code block
Thank You Ryan appreciate it appreciate
the support from all y'all it's very
very very appreciated in fact when I am
struggling I just think of everyone and
saying all the nice things that you guys
do helps me stay confident in myself so
I appreciate it thank you so this code
tag defines it will slightly change what
it's looking like but basically just fun
just defines that hey this is code it
doesn't actually run anything it's just
defining that this is containing code
you can do the same thing with var if
for a variable e is equal to MC squared
and don't notice and notice how it's
getting combined right we're kind of
combining our HTML where a this is a
variable this is a variable which is
what's odd and then remember superscript
that's how we got the two up there where
do where you touched on that a little
bit all right
HTML entities
um so does it give us an example
no alright um
yeah deuce it sometimes you have to put
in special entity names for your browser
like a quotation it's it you don't
really have to worry about this so when
we when we get farther into advanced
JavaScript there's going to be something
that takes care of this for us it's it's
called string literary string
alliteration JavaScript yes six I'm I'm
forgetting the name of the term hey
that's good so let me show you
so yes right here is that will do things
okay
it is string interpolation and
multiplying string literals that's why I
was looking for in raw string literals
you don't need to worry about that right
now
what the point is is that sometimes you
have to put out your text in certain
ways in JavaScript to get like an app
sign or greater than sign or less than
sign so it doesn't interpret it as HTML
tag and so one way that you're able to
do that is by putting this in jerko yeah
like the slashes - yes similar to that
symbols let's check this
so there's also that for specific
symbols which is kind of how like icons
work to degree so see at Euro you got to
look these up known as these where you
get the Euro sign and then there's a ton
right so if you wanted the for I guess
that's for all okay partial difference
an array an array summation all those
are stuff so it's Greek letters and
other entities so you have the C sign
copyright number all this sort of stuff
char set
you don't really need to worry too much
about this URL and code let's check this
out okay
yes more Manzo's alright
um you don't really work with it XHTML
anymore so we're not gonna what is that
it's just another type of HTML
see if there's anything that you need to
be aware of
ah
yeah okay so forms this is super
important so forms are going to be a
little tricky because they're they're
not like anything else because they
involve JavaScript at the end of the day
when when you actually want to use them
in a real-world setting so duvall boy
MLG bruh welcome man welcome welcome so
so forms are form tags are what you use
when you want to submit data this is
perfect I want to do this for my contact
I don't but um you have to have a
back-end and database for it to go
anywhere so it's not going to work you
can set it up so it looks like it works
but it's not actually going to do
anything but it's just as good to get
started so let's take let's look at an
example here we have our form tacking
notice we have a closing and opening
tack and everything that we want to
submit is within it right it's like a
div it's only valid what's contained
within it just like you know how in
JavaScript we have a scope a local scope
same concept um so here you'll see that
we have an input remember input is
nothing back is nothing but a dropdown
and it's type enter a input and input is
one way of putting in something
depending on what type you have typed X
is a box like this alright there's
numerous other types we're going to get
into that in a minute
so we have name is equal to first name
this is what this this is name is don't
get not to be confused with class or ID
this is basically just naming the value
of this so if I say first name we know
it's this input so the value you'll see
is Mickey that's what it is now this can
change but we can also set a default
value so if I set this to Dylan and I
ran my code the default value here would
be Dylan that's all we're doing is
saying do you fault value
and if I put Dylan one two three it's
like a show in your HTML like this but
the value here is Dylan one two three
all right and so the value is what we're
storing and same same thing here that
except this one's last name and what's
happening is we're having another input
type is equal to submit and value submit
and so that basically creates an input
that's a button and when we click hit
submit you'll see the action saying okay
the value submit in that case what's the
forms action submit means hey we're done
do the action of the form and in this
case it says hey go run this action
underscore page dot PHP which it goes
and sends the data somewhere it's all
PHP logic make sense about the general
logistics of forms so you have you have
your inputs these could be dropdowns
these could be anything else and then
you have input you have a submit which
runs the action form but all has to be
nested within the form tag to do that
all right
otherwise the submit doesn't know what
action to use cool so let's we talked
about the format elements the input
elements so there's a couple different
ones and as you use other libraries
these may be different but input type
text that was the one we're looking at
where was it text and then there's radio
which is like a radio button yes I've
seen all this yeah and then submit and
let's see we already talked about that
showed that radio button input so let's
see here
and you'll notice so the thing that
differentiates the way the way that
radio buttons know that they need to
work together is you give them all the
same name and so you'll see here we can
only have one of these radio select that
time and you can if you want to have a
default value the way that you can do it
is put checked in it to start
and so you'll see the value here is male
female or other it doesn't have to
necessarily correspond a lot of times
what it will correspond with is an ID in
a database so it might be a 1 to 2 or 3
or something like that but the way if we
were to actually change this to Dylan
for instance we would actually be able
to have two of these checked because
they're not in the same group they're
not in the same name but we can only
have one of these two selected all right
and so this check just basically marks
it as the one that's selected any
questions about the radio ones we've
already talked about the submit button
it crates button submits it it runs the
action alright the action at review
um you can also put the method in there
this is fucked up and they talk talk
about this foot uh before your get to
here um let's talk about restful api
alright so restful api is our and I have
a video about this by the way so I
encourage you to watch it um what you
have no okay
uh I mean who has it right yeah that's
awesome
so a restful api is we talked a while
back about api's do you remember what
they were stands for application
programming interface say something
about it
YouTube statistics alright so on my page
on my website that you didn't know
existed when we go here and we want to
see that hey this is my last video
uploaded I don't hard-code this it pulls
it from a database oh yeah I remember
and so an API is what does that it's the
and so yeah yeah I already telling me
about the weather thing and you're like
oh I'm gonna dig into this a via and
here yeah and so what that does is
there's these to be a RESTful API
there's a get call which all the get get
does is going gets data there's a post
which creates data there's a put that up
States data and there's a delete that
deletes data from the database so that's
what a restful api is so the reason
we're bring that up is in this case
sometimes you need to put a method that
says hey what what this PHP action
that's getting called in PHP as a back
end will say a middleware it's basically
a back end language that does stuff to a
server and a database sometimes and so
in this case run this and if the Mets as
I get play to get if it's a create new
put a post
there's also more to it if you are doing
a get call what is visible in the page
adjutant
so there are security things as well so
you can use either but get is not give
it only when you're retrieving
information it's not sensitive post is
when it is sensitive so like if it's a
password that's being passed in there
you don't want to use a good call when
you do post call yeah
all right so let's talk about field sets
field sets are pretty cool this is a
field set that goes around here so if
you it's kind of like a cool little
container to organize your form and if
you want to put this personal
information colon in there you'd use
what's called a legend like I am a
legend of YouTube yeah yeah alright now
this is a bad joke said but uh but the
legend is basically the title of the
field side and you have as many field
sets as you you have a field set within
a field set if you wanted to so if we
wanted to do something like this we do
field set slash shields set and maybe we
wanted to give it a legend and we'll
just throw a last name in here
and we'll throw an input in here and
we'll run it you'll see now we have our
field set within a field set all right
so that's a fieldset and the legend that
goes with it all right
um same
you can also turn autocomplete on by
default it's on our formulas alright so
this is more so far we've only been
dealing with radio buttons and input
boxes there's also other ways
Tye cam to 808 welcome welcome all right
um shout out to our twitch boys man we
got a few now that we're live-streaming
to both pretty cool hi what's happening
here I am running over we are in a
hundred day coding challenge where I'm
it I'm a full-time salary developer and
my girlfriend is trying to become a
developer and she's been studying for
now 15 days and every day I spend an
hour with her going over topics
elaborating refactoring her code and
with the hopes of than a hundred days to
get her ready to have a portfolio as
well as be able to get an internship or
a a entry-level role of some sort that
is what is going on here so today we are
going over everything on w3schools
that's included in HTML CSS and
JavaScript piece by piece for the next
day or two while she works on other
things which she spends about three
hours a day going over that's what's
going on so here how you create drop
downs is it's pretty straightforward you
have a select tag and grant mind you
this is all still in the form right and
mr. Boston 24 welcome welcome alright so
here we have our select tag within there
we have the options for the Select tag
and remember the value this is how what
values being communicated over so you
may not always want the value to be
Volvo it may want to be an ID which so I
put this in here but it needs to have a
value otherwise you're selecting
something that doesn't have a value is
just going to be air so I'm gonna be air
Cimino um
now name cars is where that value is
stored essentially so here we have Volvo
and and one thing to keep in mind is
that all fancy cars but no damn Honda
their thing to keep in mind is that if
you want a empty value you will need to
put it in there there's not like a key
word to do that so there are so many
empty values people gotta put that shame
and here I thought I was automatic nope
uh-huh so you have to do that if you
want to now you may show up with nothing
in it so you'll see this nut shows up
but once I go and I select something
here let me take it out I won't be able
to go back to it oh actually this one
does it which is strange
I've been working with a lot of other uh
drop downs that are styled so maybe it
has something to do with that but um you
have to put a an empty one in there if
you want people to be able to use an
empty one make sense cool
so select and then the options nest it
in it what's up
what what's going on nothing what am I
missing just feel like I wasn't a DejaVu
right there all right so remember how we
had checked for radio I'm trolling his
ass so remember how we had checked for
radio to be the one that was selected
yeah there's also selected for dropdowns
if you want one would be selected on
load they have Fiat selected I feel like
oh that's the average car it could be if
it's written in Oh
and he's talking to you I know he's
talking to me hey Kevin uh you know what
Kevin I'll have you know that yeah your
boys going to an angular to talk
tomorrow to step up his front end game
man and I know you'll be proud of that
anyhow so textarea we have been dealing
with one row a text input there's a
difference between text area and text
input one by default you can drag and
drop this if you want to and two it's a
larger input right so you do that
you do that with text area with a text
area tag so input tag with type text is
a text area attack then you have rows
and columns that if you want to put it
in there as well for how big it should
be
I'm not sure what the default size is if
you run it it's just a default whatever
and you can expand and type it might
even experience or I'll do the arrow on
it if you want
drag and drop but same thing you've
signed a name as well for it the the
button type clickable button this is
more so I'll show you quick you don't
usually see too many alerts anymore
but remember button button elements so
it's usually better to create a button
instead of putting input just more
standard I would say and so you can
still put type is equal to button and
then on a click is Java screamer the
dome where's domme stand for No
document dawn what is the abbreviation
for what is the do M stand for document
something something Oh Dom ah ah
document
I was it over iPad precious it is a
document object model and what that
means is that we're going to manipulate
the document which is the web page
document object model object model yes
and so on well if you think of if you
think of the page as your HTML document
which it is you do to know what Dom
stands for fucking Kevin I so uh alright
so it might shit I thought you were
saying DOM and and think you're saying
let me see if I can it might be here we
go yeah so I was thinking so here let's
bring this up real quick so remember our
HTML tags where the root one level above
that is the document the whole text
element
the root system the document Oh
the source it's not the base code yeah
the mud the dirt
it's the dirt all right enough with this
all right so the Dom when you talk about
manipulating the Dom what document yes
we talk about manipulate document was it
object model object model document
object okay so what we're talking about
is manipulating static data manipulating
static data on our document on the web
page if I can I'll I'll trigger this
okay and so now that we've discussed
that this on click remember is what they
call HTML Javascript meaning hey
sometimes we can put things in here that
will run certain things at javascript so
on click it's going to call an alert box
which is it this and what's it going to
say is hello world so javascript has
this function built-in called alert that
will pass take um that will take that
string and tell you it I said that
yesterday and I got yelled at for not
keeping the channel PG keep it down
yo man those were there D monetizing
videos out there man we ain't got time
for that I don't make any money on this
channel as it is I got anyhow um but so
this alert is a JavaScript function and
when we set up this on click what we're
doing is Dom manipulation which is we're
altering or alt
model manipulation what's happening is
we're altering how the page functions
and it's going from static to dynamic
today oh I thought I was going to be
responsive
no responsive is just changing of CSS
classes and things like that
here we're actually using some
JavaScript might look get the fuck out
of here
stop it go lay down
see you is right we're just going
straight JavaScript but this is still
working with the Dom it's not
necessarily manipulating it if we want
to get technical Sam you get the point
though that you can work with the page
to do things okay so another form input
list browsers data the data list element
specifies a list of pre right hair in
about 15 minutes we're going to be
taking questions at the end of the
lesson so I just hold off man I'd be
happy to answer that question so input
list browsers option value
now
it's just another way of doing just
another way of doing dropdowns input
list
Hauser's data-list-id browsers
so it's kind of like a combination okay
so data list is kind of like a
combination between a search and a
drop-down so what's going to happen here
it's like as you're typing it's going to
try and guess what it is that you're
typing um yeah so here you'll see we
have our input list is browsers name is
browser and then ID here needs to match
the list and then we have a data list as
a container and then we put in the
options for it and yeah so but you'll
see here it's not very something that
does not automatically so you don't have
to manually input everything or do you
actually know so what's gonna happen is
down the road you'll have remember the
array
what's the array again the list C yes so
say we have in a state we have a hundred
options and in an array what we would do
is we would use a JavaScript framework
to actually just print out we would put
essentially a for loop in a single line
as we do it for us okay we're to set
that up could you also set up a thin
array were you like let's say you put
all these options in someone types an
option that's not in there then instead
of saying that that was an option you
can use that as a new input yes but all
that none of that is necessarily I mean
we'll be using HTML but everything
you're talking about is more JavaScript
and like yeah
okay so hey the fast and furious
reference totally and like that's where
my mind would do that baby sounds like
Dom all icater okay so so essentially
the data list is a drop-down with a
search right okay and and just keep in
mind that you have to have an input the
list has to match the ID and that it
says we're only using HTML you have to
put in all the options okay
you can see the purpose of the King Jian
element is fries secure way to
authenticate users
it sounds like fermented CV
Oh key Janice for
alright hey Sookie Jen is used to it's a
security feature that creates a public
and a private key Jen so that one one is
local that's okay to be viewed for the
time being and one goes pop one goes
into the database which will actually be
your search okay I've never seen this
and I've never seen it used I've never
used I've never seen it so I can't
really say too much about it okay so
fuck is this the output element or
sensors out of a calculation
all right so this is more 8 with more
HTML at ish JavaScript now you usually
wouldn't do something like this but you
would actually probably use a framework
to do something like this bad guys in
theory you could do it this way you
still have a button that submits so you
have this output which is named X and
what we're saying is X dot value this
dot value comes from the name is almost
like variable you got that this one in
HTML as close as we're going to get so
we're saying hey the value is if we take
these or what sparse into again it turns
a string into an int right that's
JavaScript and we're saying hey get the
they turn that into an int a dot value
what's a name here is a and the value is
50 right so we're saying hey turn that
which is string 50 into number 50 and
turn this 50 into or string 50 into
number 50 and when we hit submit go
ahead and return that value this is this
is running this action but this is where
it would output that you won't I'd be
very surprised to ever use this so don't
sweat that there's there's other ways
that you're going to be doing that let's
see if there's anything we miss defines
the result of a calculation cool input
types all right
so we already talked about the input
type text which is the in the text input
right the little row this right here
varies all right
there's also input type password which
is blocks or characters so that type is
equal to password okay let's see what
else is there there is we talked about
submit text text this submits your form
action or runs your form action with the
data that you have and your name values
here need to be what's in the backend
otherwise it doesn't know what to do
with it right
nothing you need to worry about now but
just keeping keep in mind and there is a
input type reset so this type reset
there we go
well reset to the default value so
whatever these values have within the
format within the form right so whatever
the value change it's going to reset it
as if no one ever input anything in this
case it was Mickey and Mouse because
that was always the value right why are
they putting values in there just to
give an example so you probably normally
wouldn't but in this case is just an
example I show that you could I guess so
resets another type as well all right we
already talked about checked and radio
buttons
there's also checkbox now what's the
difference between a radio button and a
checkbox one is like a list and a radio
button is and I know this I learned it
one you can check as many as you need to
it which is wait wait don't do cheating
checkbox you can check as many as you
want
I just said that how is that cheating
you said one you didn't specify but you
can also mark if you want to mark market
is checked unload you can as well and
you can do it for both of them okay cool
so we've talked about the type on button
we've also a type button defines a
button you probably will just use button
this is El Faro type is equal to button
on it though type color I haven't seen
this one so there's an input so you
could do this for some iron I seen this
boy I haven't seen one of those look
like what sounds like six oh that's such
a flashback there's also type date
oh yeah I hate that shit so annoying
take the team yeah I hate that Oh
okay um sorry guys moves on I don't want
to resume applications and there I'll
put the date but the days so you can
also on the date type put a max date or
a min date if you don't want a date to
go before a certain point I don't like
that either there's a lot of date time
local which means that you're going to
select a date and then you're gonna
select a time as well apparently not
and then you'd send it more than likely
you're probably going to use a
third-party CSS thing like angular
material or some sort of you're not
going to use a generic one that's built
into HTML most of the time
input type email that's another
important one give an email some of
these things will not work in IE 9 or
below because I Internet Explorer oh yes
it fucking sucks big donkey dick PG yeah
let's keep it PG so you can also do
month you month we'll do month in here
not a big deal hello you put type number
you can have a max number and a min
number this is like a address little
clicker what's internet explorer I'll
show you I'll show you exactly what it
is there's a meme out there this is
Internet Explorer runs faster than the
government
there you go
this is an air Explorer so joke you've
installed absolute and explore or you
know um okay so we talked about input
types
we're in dive a little bit more into
input attributes name and value we
already talked about those what is the
difference between name and what's name
one's value name is I thought uh name
was a type of variable sort of yeah
name holds without so if value is on the
right side name is on the left side so
if we when we send our form and it
checks first it's looking for first name
the value of it would be John here ah so
they're kind of related name stores the
value all right
the read-only attribute this is another
one so this is attribute you can throw
on an input field where you see how I'm
trying to input it into here but it's
not it's cuz it's read-only you only get
to see you don't get the touch all right
all right not that you yeah i disabled
is another one where he'll you can't
enter anything it's disabled all right
it's just a way to fun so sighs ah deli
you can make it you can make it longer
if you want yeah you can't can you make
it look not that it needs to be any
longer all right
see laughing all right all right one
almost uh I will finish this uh oh you
know what this is there a lot started
that yeah yeah whoa
do we even finish input types yeah we
did let me see it maybe yeah yeah we did
I do oh we didn't shit that's all right
listen let's come back to this because I
we're at our 15-minute mark and I my
minds kind of jelly right now so let's
stand up we had some questions that we
weren't able to dive into what do people
are they nice or sweet
I need a word all right I'll tell you
right now I've had better interactions
with people in Florida than I have in LA
I've lived in LA my entire life some up
until the last six seven eight months of
it now
and I would I would never go back to LA
unless they doubled the triple my salary
so that me what it is for various
reasons um what is P G stands for rental
guarding guidance something somebody has
to actual real question yeah it was the
I don't want to answer if he's not here
yeah say you're here I'm not answer it
was a legit question let's see the
portfolio progress that's a good
question no I broke it so I took all the
code out and I'm gonna redo it milah
know what come here Bubba
coming yeah here all right Ryan's here
I'll answer the question was the
question I want to practice web
development but haven't had any ideas
lately what should I make
well if you're having already they have
a bunch of projects on free code camp
this is a for front-end if you're just
looking for projects for projects are
always great now there it depends on
what your skill set is also how advanced
you are my thing is my thing is that so
you can see there's intermediate ones
whether machine random quote machine
there's advanced ones as well and then
there's uh there's a data visualization
rack projects d3 projects back-end
projects and if you finish all those
there are ones on the beta that you can
aspire to that's a great idea so there's
about pink 25 projects on free code camp
and there's another there's new ones all
on the beta as well um now my advice to
you is to build something that you think
can make you some money and that you're
passionate about because I promise you
uh ill that's much better than building
a calculator or anything like that
how do I get rid of that page scrubber
on Visual Studio I Google didn't found
porn scrubber definitely not what I
require at the moment I don't know man
I do not know or Milo hey look he's
miles put on some weight she's so heavy
my husband putting on his summer weight
right now it's a little confused you're
like so split off for a winter buddy ah
so I've made a solution for most of the
products on free code camp but the code
seems really messy any tips on keeping
everything neat my advice is go back and
refactor your code if you can't
understand it after spending about an
hour or two you should rewrite the whole
project you'll learn a lot in the
process of seeing how your improvement
is go start with the easiest earlier
once and see where you can make
improvements not only in efficiency but
in just eliminating code same thing with
your HTML and CSS see if you can
eliminate some of it and you'll become a
much better developer in the process
refactoring code is really important and
something that I do regularly with my
co-workers sometimes and they do it for
me as well I'm sure but that would be
one of the ways to going about it is
just rebuilding it and see and same
thing with the algorithms right as you
have progressed you've gotten better
whether you realize it or not you may go
back and look at your code and be like
Jesus what sort of what sort of eight
FireMonkey wrote this um so he says with
your finger man healing pretty well
which it is you can see there's still a
let's see my wrist is a little bit pink
but that's pretty good and then my
finger is
scabby but it's getting better with the
finger Healing up pretty well on the
time set aside for April and work what
have you been working on for the next
build so I've talked about this a little
bit I'm actually going to launch a
company
and a product I haven't been 22 much
time into it quite yet I'm still
figuring out the financial details of it
but I will be launching of what I am
calling coders crate which essentially
is loot crate for people who are
passionate about coding that is the gist
of it
if you're familiar with loot crate it is
a monthly subscription box that you get
they have various things now but
originally it just started off with a
geek or gaming apparel or memorabilia
and mine is going to be somewhat similar
except it'll be every every crate you
get it will have a shirt it will have a
course it will have additional
educational materials as well maybe
flashcard explain what you do to other
people what yeah it's gonna be a little
pamphlet house a QA on how to get people
don't understand what the hell you're
talking about
a fidget spinner so but uh that that is
that is my current project so you may
not be seeing too many too many coding
videos right now um I I have gone
towards a one day I want to be a
cellphone towards the light boys I one
day I want to be self-employed guys and
so one night I occasionally will chase
ideas and this is idea that I I think I
could be successful in so that is my
next big project my next big build if
you will I am also working on finishing
up uh now that I before I hurt I yeah
yeah no where'd your openers uh so but I
am also going to be working on horse
eventually for the founder of coders
create and put jar open over there and
the picture of us for here be like don't
let this happen to protect your fingers
but that is what I am working on right
now yes and I'm too much time with
everything so I'm mainly working on the
details of it on the weekends during the
weekdays between work and tutoring April
and YouTube hang a time scope so I wait
till the weekend and that's when I am
working out the details right now the
hardest thing because I know what I want
to put in the crate I am I am I know
what I am going how I'm going to pay for
it I know I am all that figure I just
have to figure out the cost so over a
lifetime how many hours would you say
that you have spent coding have you
heard that it takes 10,000 hours to
master something how long would it do
you think it would take to master SEC so
that's an old stat saying it takes 10
hours to master a skill 10,000 hours to
master skill that's that's like an old
saying it's not really a stat I don't
think that's true I think a thousand
hours into a mean stack you can master
it that's what I think also depends on
how you learn yeah I don't know man it
for me this is the thing about mastery I
don't think as a web developer you
should strive for mastery because I
don't think it's ever you're ever going
to get to the point where if you spent
spending all your time trying to master
something chances are it's probably
already outdated but yeah exactly um so
to learn 8 if I was to give a rough
estimate uh let's go off what April's
spending her time doing I'm spending one
hour a day with her and she is spending
two two three sometimes four let's say
she averages uh we'll say she averages
three hours a day on her own so every
day she's spending four hours I'm
expecting her in a hundred days just
spent 400 hours my expectation for her
is to land a internship at 400 hours and
I would consider that a success so at a
thousand hours
I would consider which for her at
thousand hours 40 hours a week uh she
would probably be ready for a junior
role which if she's 20 40 hours a week
that's 160 hours a month all right 160
hours a month so she would basically
need four months of employment as an
intern and three months of self taught
so seven months of spending basically
full-time doing something to be a junior
deaf which is pretty pretty okay I think
that for an entry-level role but that's
my goal and also not everyone has a
developer living in the house to explain
these things so oh I know you are
actually got money on me I got a little
side bet going on what we don't know
about say godless monkey bought me the
book he's like I got money on April
[Laughter]
what's been the biggest challenge for me
or for April no the biggest challenge
for you that's an interesting question
let's see if he answers us honestly for
me um he's been fibbing lately so Lucy
um
the hardest part for me is spending my
time not on myself
so uh what and what I mean by that is I
am worse now that what I mean what I
mean by that is that I just talked to
you about something I'm pretty
passionate about and I want to be
working on coders great and I want to be
working on my my JavaScript course in my
courses and YouTube and things like that
and I'm happy to spend the time doing it
but at the same time I feel like I am
not getting as much progress as I can in
it and this is not this is nothing new
this is nothing new but II but I'm aware
that I want to be a certain place and
I'm happy to do it he would still say
this even if he was working on the stuff
he would just be like I'm not working
fast enough I don't feel like I'm going
to are fast enough yeah and it's like it
may I may have I may have said a little
too bluntly as in like oh that's just
how he is
he says everything so bluntly yeah I may
have said that so don't don't take it in
like oh I can't stand tutoring April no
it's just that I I hard for me to get 15
minutes of pure attention from him like
this one hour must just be killing him
inside like I don't know I'm always
working on stuff guys and and I'm used
to only working on my stuff and now I've
committed a hundred days and I'm happy
to do it but it's strange because I
usually I part of the reason that I not
working on it is by the time that this
hour because I usually would spend an
hour to two hours on my own stuff don't
hang on how tired I am by the time I'm
there I'm exhausted of this it's a it's
mentally draining going through an hour
of code explaining piece by piece
analyzing it because I'm usually going
pretty fast because I I'm reading it as
fast as I can I want cover as much as we
can because we only have a hundred days
and I want to just just throw it at the
wall and hope that she gets it on her
own time as well so um but that that's
what I mean is that I I I have things I
want to work on
how you turn baby so the biggest
challenge for me for a hundred days is
actually in front of you guys just
because I know it doesn't look like it
or maybe it does I don't know I I like
to think of myself as an introvert even
though I'm loud it's like I'm not like
your classic introvert I am can function
in front of crowds and I can speak to
huge groups of people it's just that I
recuperate you know being in my own
space and I don't always want to
interact with people you know it's so
for me having that dedication to see in
front of the camera every day you know
regardless of how I feel
that's a hard part for me like mentally
being like okay I just got to get
through this one hour that's it just one
hour you know and then being tutored by
Dylan um is probably knowing in the back
of my head that he may be wanting to do
other things and I may not be able to
reach his exact ideals of where he wants
me to be so it's maybe not accomplishing
what he wants me or falling below that
that kind of just like would be a bummer
but at the same time I feel like I'm
putting my 100% but he may have
different standards of what my hundred
percent looks like so trying to meet
those that would be like my biggest
challenge for that what language are you
learning we're learning the mean stack
so right now she's going to start with
HTML CSS and JavaScript and then we're
going to explain to frameworks and
databases down the road as well as
version control testing all that sort of
stuff and you guys can see kind of a
snippet of everything that we're going
to cover in my course I would say at the
end of it
that's exactly a run that was the
terminology I was going for all right
guys so I appreciate you being here
thank you for showing up asking
questions I do think questions are
beneficial for April and for myself it's
learning about new stuff all the time
but don't forget to join the Facebook
group Kotak and caffeine the link is in
the description and support me on
patreon if you're able to that's always
dope like comment subscribe and share
and I'll see you guys tomorrow we're
only in was today day 16 day 16
something some people said there's
someone saying by day 23 we're not
making it so I don't know who said that
in the comments but I read that I hope
you guys know I read every fucking
comment on videos I mean so uh I promise
you we will make unless one of us is
dead or dying dealing with the lipid
blanket over and the sniffles yep yeah
I'll have the mask on I've liked the
oxygen I thought I mean like okay a
boolean only going back and forth yeah
last day nine and a half because we'll
just be killing each other so uh but I
also want part of this is I want to send
a message to all those people say hey I
can't commit an hour a day to learn to
code here we are every day jump on put
us on or we're here for an hour
yeah you got some study partners maybe
you know maybe if not just ones like the
ones in the library we're like Shane
fucker I'll kill you
we're here alright um yeah his his very
delicate fingers I will be well taken
care of all right baby you wanna you
wanna
you want to let us out of here with your
your ferry it it hurts me every time you
say like I want comfort range yeah it is
pretty crunchy but if you that's what
you that's what you want like it's great
you know yeah guys you know what does it
react I agree disagree on this one baby
oh all right so it's like the toast to
health wealth and happiness that's
crunchy but it's good yes
where he doesn't know nothing code long
and prosper guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
