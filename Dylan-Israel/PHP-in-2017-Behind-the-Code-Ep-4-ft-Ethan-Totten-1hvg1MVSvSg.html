we talked with Eaton Totten who is a PHP
developer he's been a developer for
about six years he also used to work
together coincidentally so if we seem a
little casual with each other that might
be why and we talk about PHP in the past
PHP in the future PHP in the present how
to get started with PHP we cover a whole
mess of topics about PHP and lots of
other great stuff lots of lots of fun
stuff I always enjoy talking with people
I know for these interviews it's just
like yeah but I feel like it comes off
very well so I think you guys will enjoy
it quite a bit and if you want to get
some PHP tutorial so you want to follow
Ethan you can go to this website
self-taught ENCOM that's SEL f tott n
dot-com and check out his stuff there
enjoy everything I always say I always
stay up to amen
look at C so you see these these
programmer thinking this is a programmer
credential right here you got your
little mug of caffeine but your caffeine
with some weird decoration on it like
Emma might say be holidays it's not even
holidays its holidays you Jewish that 99
cent factor to it might um but alright
so I think we talked a little bit about
what I wanted to cover today which is
going to be PHP in 2017 or just PHP in
general what it's good for absolutely
nothing good yeah
which is something I'm like dot
struggling with to learn by the way okay
we use PHP at my work so everywhere like
I was like oh but you know um so I guess
let's go ahead and get started for you
ramble on here well all right so uh
could you would you mind introducing
yourself in a little bit of your
experience okay
my name is Ethan Totten I've been I have
been developing for about six years now
I kind of got into it because I was
looking for a job outside of college I
have a history and poli-sci degree and
you really can't do much with the
history and Poli Sci degree except I
look for other jobs so kind of got into
blogging
little bit and all like the blog
platforms just I didn't really like so I
was just kind of curious like what it
took to get in the blogging um started
with like static HTML when I started
doing it that it's like there's gotta be
something better than this starting kind
of got more into like WordPress and
Joomla and Drupal from there it kind of
just like snowballed into more like
heavy frameworks first I got is like
code matter and then went from co-writer
to heavier take need layer bail really
and kind of yeah I've been working in
this tree for about like five years
really and I currently work for a
ecommerce company out in Santa Monica
and it is fantastic
nice so you it sounds like and I don't
I'm I'm not sure but you've been working
with PHP for a while now right yeah
let's actually talk about PHP let's do
that all right
so uh you've been working in PHP for
about four or five years now from sounds
of it what what have you kind of seen is
the general use for PHP for people who
maybe like never touched it before well
use for it is blogs like I mean with
WordPress that framework or framework a
lot of people just use that for blogs
it's really pretty much like now in the
new 2016 architecture wise or 2016 mm is
a lot of microservices so much sub
services like that only do one thing
like so it'll be connecting to one
certain database like off or like your
my sequel store and just serve API is so
that's a lot of what PHP is used for
nowadays just a simple old microcircuits
you can throw up it's scalable in case
you need multiple at the same time like
in your cloud computing so that's pretty
much what it's used for nowadays and
that's and that's exactly what we use it
for my work we basically use it as a
peon to make end points for our api's
and retrieve data and send data
and that like I cuz I always found it
kind of curious who's I've never touched
pH for you before and I had no idea what
we're gonna be using on my work but that
is the only thing we use it for is that
comment and your your experience
currently yes where I currently work we
all use we have a couple micro services
that all use PHP where you and I have
previously worked no but that's just
because it's a different architecture
other places I I've worked have started
to get into a little bit more of the a
PHP employee architecture but there's
also a lot like of competing languages
or I don't want say competing language
there's a lot more more robust languages
they're starting to do in points as well
as speech vianora scalable as PHP like a
go and rest
nice what sort of changes have you kind
of seen in the last couple years in PHP
or you think are gonna happen come we
are moving forward with it is it still
gonna be kind of in demand it seems to
go quite Hanahan with JavaScript and and
my experience anyhow yeah I mean it's
it's open source so you can find
anything you need or want on the system
that's kind of the main like reason a
lot of people use it I think it's just
like oh I need a quick and easy language
they don't have to learn in 30 years
like c-sharp it takes a lot of learning
yeah that's now open source but it just
takes a lot of learning get used to it
changes more recently there's a lot more
of a strict type architecture or really
framework or language you can declare
now what you have coming in and out of
your methods and classes so when you say
like you have a method that's like
getting me eight orders for a certain
customer you want to make sure that
customer ID is always an integer so you
can typecast that customer ID and it'll
always be an integer or else the whole
thing fails that's something that PHP
hasn't really had it's always been this
anonymous class or anonymous variable
language where there's really no types
of variables you had to go through all
this validation
in order to get types and variables to
make sure like you don't crash a
database so that's something that like
in the last year since Peachtree seven
has really like pushed forward with that
system pretty much it's gone from a lot
of last five of years when I've been
doing it it's gone from a lot more
normal basis we're like you'll have like
and then now it's a lot more
object-oriented that will NBC
architecture that will in turn you know
views first is like having a PHP and
HTML and making queries in the middle of
a page yeah it's uh I I I don't fully is
so I've just recently been diving into
it and what I found is I learned by
making projects that's how I learned it
very hard to get started with a project
in PHP like is it it seems to be a
little bit of a steep learning curve for
people who maybe aren't familiar with it
it's that is that just me am I just like
bad or do you think there's a learning
curve with it
no I think the other day when you first
asked me thinking about it and the
hardest part of PHP is acting started it
is hard to make a simple page app with
nothing like especially if you're going
from front and stuff where you can just
do friend stuff on your local box and
then go to a web browser and see it
right there
you have to set up server for you have
to set up a pretty much server and like
make sure that the right version of PHP
is in there and you have to pretty much
know is like the Linux in order to
really set it up there are tools like
cloud 9 does a pretty good job cloud 9
dot IO where you can it's a simple easy
server you can see your output right
there even like Dreamweaver anything in
the last like three years has really
stepped up their game because it used to
be awful and now it's like oh you can
actually see what you're doing on PHP
and like if you want to just echo
variables dump variables it's all right
there and Dreamweaver it that's the
hardest part of PHP is the setup
yeah like I I remember having a set of
lamp and then zamp and all of a certain
nonsense trying to get it to work and it
did but uh you know when you're used to
just popping open note
it's a little bit different especially
for people on the junior level
yeah it's WAMP WAMP is a little bit
harder than like MAMP
just because it's two different systems
like the way that in TFS I believe is
what Windows is based off of and then
Mac is now a Linux kernel so it's Mac is
a lot easier to program on versus
Windows you have to do a lot more and
juggle and go through a couple hoops now
if people I could I always find it great
when someone's working and I they
learned and whatnot what would you kind
of your be advice be for someone who's
like working a full time job but you
know they find out late they it's not
for them and they're trying to get into
software or get into web design or
whatever it may be what would kind of be
your advice for to give them kind of an
edge of learning um I guess just kind of
like yeah you're stuck in at your door
for eight hours a day but like just find
time an interview evening like make sure
you have time to actually do something
and like you say like you do projects I
do projects still just something that I
can learn something that I can grow from
really whatever they want to do find it
like try it out if that's still what
they want to do like software why it's
great keep learning keep growing there's
always like the internet and it's like
especially like the PHP world there's a
big community stacks overflow is
overflowing with PHP like posts just
because the different versions people
always have trouble with something
there's always like a lot of frameworks
laravel for instance has a huge
community they have Larry cast which is
a tutorial driven I pod can't video cast
I guess you could say it just has a
bunch of tutorials on how to like use a
framework you can find anything you want
on there they also have their own forum
about like things that go on inside
Larry well like weird things that happen
so yeah I just keep learning don't stop
find time to learn if it's a weekend's
like great like one of the first
projects I ever did was a simple like
rock-paper-scissors lizard-spock thing
because I was just it's a randomizer you
have all the tools you need
HP just do it like and then you can
always go back and refactor and
reiterate on it and that also helps you
learn too because then like a month
later you're gonna learn a lot more than
what you originally knew so if you go
back and you redo it it always helps you
but he's where he works he's where you
are sees that there is progress so it's
not just like oh I did this little app
whatever you always have something to go
back and see like oh look I've done
progress or I made progress yeah it's
always and it some people get a little
weird about like should I post my stuff
on github when I'm just starting
learning I don't think there's anything
wrong with it cuz it will show your
progress and it's like as someone who
has been making coding videos for a year
and a half some of the videos I have up
like Jesus I can't believe I put this
 up on the Internet
what's great about github too and I
don't know if people who were like
recruiters I don't but I'm sure like
people who are are the hiring manager at
a software engineer place
they'll probably look and see like oh
this is like at your commit and see like
oh this is what it used to be and this
is what it was like github is great
I love github I love the features of it
and even like the little they have a
little speck chart that sees like so it
shows like April through December of
that whole project and shows like when
you committed the most and when you
really worked on it yeah so we're
talking about projects are you working
on anything interesting right now I just
finally I but I have a plethora of
domains I just haven't ever used or put
anything on them I just put up a blog no
posts on it yet but they'll vlog and
level just because I there's this a
package I wanted to use so I just played
around that package a little bit put it
up like I said no posts yet I also
started to do a secret santa application
mainly because I wanted to work a lot
more with api's and a few GS because the
view or react yes is hot and so I'm like
alright let's give this a shot
give this a shot and yeah that's pretty
much the main project I'm working on
right now works works pretty pretty
great so I actually couldn't spend about
like 12-hour days there sometimes nice
yeah you have that mentality especially
when people
when you're trying to get your foot in
the door and that as a well they're like
that's what makes a great senior
developer writer a junior developer
become a senior developers really
enjoying it cuz if you don't enjoy it
you're not gonna ever take the time to
learn he additional skills right if you
don't if you don't love it there's no
point in doing it yeah and I think that
that trumps money that trumps time that
trumps effort a lot of times I mean
obviously have bills to pay but if you
love doing it and love learning it's
software engineering is great the money
will come in soft nary a software
engineer yeah like I this this week
every learned elasticsearch and how to
connect elasticsearch clusters and it's
awesome something I thought never
thought I would know how to do but now
I'm like oh this is pretty easy um was
there any topics that you wanted to
cover I know we talked a little bit
about PHP and what to expect move me
forward but anything that was important
to you that you think we dive into um I
think we can dive a little bit more than
the api's like well two more thing I
guess we could talk a little bit more in
depth on like startup because I think
that's where a lot of people get like
hung up on startups but starting up with
PHP I mean there's really just there's a
light there's a logic toros out there to
find the right one find the one that
fits you you'll probably need to learn a
little bit about servers but you're
running on Windows box
Mac box just put up may up for a while
know where to point mam know how to do
it
cloud9 IO it has a PHP server built into
it I yeah so there's there's a lot of
things you can do or just even buy a
server by a digital ocean server for
five bucks find some kernel that already
has everything built for you and they
just put it out there nice and so with
API is because that seems to be one of
like the main thing is like the you know
to make a simple REST API with PHP and
there's this frameworks for it as well
now when it comes to frameworks like for
instance I use cake cake PHP I might
work because that's what my my boss says
it's doing what's kind of your take on
doing it just in pure PHP or using
frameworks or libraries um I love
frameworks I know that they get a better
rap a lot of times cuz oh it's look at
it everyone can see what your code is
pretty much but like really they don't
and good frameworks are written in a way
where you can't break into them like
they're CSRF protection there's you know
sequel injection protection already
built into them so they're really hard
to like otherwise you have to do that
yourself if you're talking to like a
database you can do it yourself I worked
at a place that has done it themselves
and it was it's a pain that but really
like from start to finish like the
hardest part of of it really is the
routing like you have slash users it
gets you all your users and you know the
user your slash PI D which should return
the user with the give an idea whatever
you put on the URI so it's it's really
just like ease of it and a lot of
frameworks like Symphony super easy to
use once you get it up in terms of like
frameworks and like just build an API is
for it nice what's uh what's the name of
your new up-and-coming hot blog that
will eventually be very hot yeah oh yeah
it's totally gonna be active self-taught
and calm self-taught messy yet tott and
never last name I know I love everything
about it
I wish I came up with that but I'm like
oh damn it's too clever that one I know
did you ever finish your your game that
you're working on oh the degrees of
separation one yeah no I mean like the
codes there and it works but it's just
like I can't figure out a good UI for it
and that's the that's a hard part about
being a back in person it's just like
you put everything in a bootstrap and uh
after that it's just all like yeah I
can't really think of anything else like
if it doesn't fit into like a bootstrap
you know call them twelve you can't
really I'm like ma'am done so I've been
learning I've been messing with layout
now and like getting away from the
bootstrap calm grid
and so you really have you been using
like flex at all you know yeah this one
using SPICE yeah there's one I looked
into it's actually on the self Totten
comm is called Bulma beat you LMA and
it's literally all flex there's no
JavaScript it's just straight CSS which
is very interesting this we're using I
believe because it goes hand in hand
with angular material which is what
we're building our part of our
application and so it's built into it
and it works great it's wonderful it's
just it to me I I couldn't tell you why
it's better than bootstraps calling
great or not but it does the same thing
so I think well which have been floors
moved to flex mmm versus right now it
was all percent wides so it's like you
get some issues if you ever want to
customize something versus flex is
pretty easy to customize any final
thoughts you want to give people about
PHP that'd be appreciated as well um
yeah if you have any like desire to
learn it learn it reach out to me reach
out or like I I have my github it's be
thin th et Haan
yeah that's right fine
I find it there find it you reach out
through Dylan he'll provide probably my
username is salvation put it all in
description yeah I'll put it in there
not use the video good so yeah I just
really don't be afraid to learn it like
yeah there's that big hump of starting
to learn it and like starting to get it
up but once you get it up it's pretty
simple my cell problems a lot of times
with like if I'm on a new new box or you
can like when we start PHP and it's a
there's a hundred tools Google's your
best friends in this instance like if
you're just trying to learn it like oh I
have a Windows how do I get start with
PHP 7i windows how don't you start with
peach be whatever how do I apply
WordPress it's just learned learn how to
Google that's almost your best tool a
lot of cases special thanks to our
sponsor dev Mountain if you're
interested in coding bootcamp why don't
you check them out where they include
housing alongside their tuition so you
can get up go and immerse your
in the environment if you want to
