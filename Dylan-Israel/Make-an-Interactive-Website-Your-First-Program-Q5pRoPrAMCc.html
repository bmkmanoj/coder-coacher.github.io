interactive website you're gonna need to
be familiar with JavaScript and jQuery
for this as well as HTML and CSS by the
sounds of it if you're starting with
this it's probably a bad idea even
though that is a technical level is
beginner but hey I could be wrong I
haven't even tried it yet so let's see
what's going on here so so we're unit
one your first program introduction web
page is made with HTML CSS can create
static content so static content refers
to the content that doesn't change it's
kind of why JavaScript and jQuery so
good it allows us to stuff to change on
our page so HTML here's what a channel
page looks like if you've taken any sort
of JavaScript stuff you'll note this
should all look familiar
you're just calling on the files here
the first script loads in jQuery is
second script loads in Apps J yes this
is where the code for the drop-down menu
program lives okay so when you click
flip board a drop-down menu doesn't
appear to fix this below the first trip
add a second script that's actually
alright so pretty simple here we're
going to add this script SRC and we're
gonna set it equal to I'm just going to
copy this and this is where their code
for the drop-down menu is
so now you can see we have a drop-down
menu alright so the code in the drop
down menu lives in JavaScript file apt
up J yes first we'll look at how the
code is organized so so this should all
look you know we have a main function
here and it does some stuff with our
event handler and document not already
made okay the code starts as a Java
function called main function is a set
of instructions tells computer what to
do and then we run it our main function
and the document dot not ready so the
main function made up three parts first
code selects a drop-down toggle so all
right dot dropping on - toggle this is a
parameter ID ID or class I forget what
the dot is next to code checks with next
you wanna click the line come inside the
curly braces will run Jeff Dunham I
alternate between showing and hiding
term toggle all right so toggle is
probably built into the JavaScript
library so what are we gonna do here
when you click on flip board the menu
shows up but doesn't go away so that's
the toggle thing we're talking about so
change the jQuery method drop-down menu
to show the job done toggle so show
means it won't go away unless we refresh
the page we don't want that so get the
app click it click away click it again
nice so print it pretty pretty simple so
far so the document dot ready waits for
the HTML document to load completely
before running the main function okay
alright so this is gonna trigger drop
down menu in the flip orys click however
the program has four mistakes that
prevent it from working fix these two
works of our function bar main drop down
toggle
so what's gone first thing first
I'll check the brackets that all looks
good document dot ready-made
so let's see here so when we click it
dot drop down menu should toggle so
let's go back a page and take a look all
right so the click is a fun needs a
function as well that's what it looks
like so when the click is saying look we
need it to do some stuff
you also need this function here
so one two three four so that looked
like that fixed it alright so javascript
is a programming language used to ensure
activity to webpage J query synthesize
Java syntax makes it easier to build
okay cool
so it uses events do em manipulation
which modifies HTML elements and adds
animations nice we just completed our
first program really
oh all right so it looks like we're
we're now finally into where we want to
be so click on the menu I click on the
menu icon the menu displays by pushing
the page body over to the right then
click on the X icon menu closes click
Save and submit to get started all right
so it looks like we're might be working
on this inside app dot J yes so we want
to move our main and we want to create a
function that does some stuff right
leave the functions codeblock empty
alright so it goes like that actually so
we're not actually doing anything with
that use jQuery to run the main function
once the webpage has fully loaded
yeah so that's correct and then we act
we also want to tell jQuery to load our
document already and then we want to
call main on it as well I'll do that so
find the main function there it is
use jQuery to select the class icon menu
all right so remember we want to find
icon ash menu and
oh yeah forgot the period so are we
doing anything with this or how how
would they want us to do it yeah so it
looks like we just need to have it like
that we're not actually having it do
anything there we go
so we need to put the event handler I
believe it's a technical name and we're
saying we want to add this click method
on it after
Icom - menu alright so if things aren't
working properly we're gonna go ahead
and see that so make sure you use the
single quotes double quotes do work but
in this environment it looks like they
want us to adhere to a standard alright
so click alright so now we need a
function here that it's going to do some
stuff as well
and in here what do we wanted to do
select the menu class alright so again
single quotes menu and dot menu and
animate it so how do we handle meat it
so is there a dot animate let's see here
yeah there's a dot animate so you can
see right here that we want to shift it
to the left by two hundred millisecond
in two hundred milliseconds of 0px
so animate in itself has some parameters
so we're going to call dot animate and
then here
I'm a little confused as to why the
brackets are like this but it probably
have to do because we're messing with
with cascading stylesheets I'm still
somewhat new to jQuery I kind of have
fallen in love with it recently I think
it's a great resource so let's see if we
can do the second one no so this
connects with this so that is our main
you animate so we moved it to 0px and
make this happen over 200 milliseconds
what else we now on to puts the rest of
the page to delicious
all right so in our click function if
you ever get lost about where this needs
to be just go ahead and see where you're
at because we don't want it to move no
matter what we want it to move on click
so it has to be in between here and so
we're gonna select the body and this
isn't a class it's just a default so we
don't need to use a dot in it what else
do we need modify the main function so
select the body issue animate and move
it to the left turn or 85 pixels all
right so we're you're gonna call doc
animate on this as well
and we want to do it over 200 and we
want it to move it to the left by 285
pixels now it may turn out that we need
to Oh this it looks correct I was gonna
say it may need to be turned negative
285 but so far it looks like it's
working and then when we click okay oh
so you see right now it's only moving
its left we haven't actually set
anything here to move it back so that's
what we're gonna probably do next year
so the menu appears to be pushing the
body over to the left cool
click the X try make them and you move
nothing happens save and submit
alright so use the jQuery to select icon
dot clothes element all right so we
don't want to be in there we want to
create a new font that a new thing here
so we are going to select dot icon -
close and we want to call animate on it
and at this point we're kind of familiar
with this so how fast we want to do it
we want to in the same time frame so
there's 200 and what do we want to do
here we want to move it to the left by
negative 2 85 pixels
so it's gonna save a cement see icon -
close
let's make sure our brackets are good
here so
that all looks correct to me okay so
here's our mistake we actually need it
because otherwise it's just gonna
animate all the time and it's probably
gonna cause an error so we need it to be
we can put this anywhere so we'll just
start it up at the top for now so we
actually need it to be within the click
event handler here so say us write this
oh so this is where our air was we're
right we just need to add the proper
closing
there we go so we added one-to-many
brackets so now issue should work oh
it's not working unexpected end of input
so let's actually go back because it
looks like it's accepting our code but
there you go No so let's track our code
here it seemed to work but our code no
longer is so work our way through
one two one
okay so this is what's going on here
they actually wanted us to have our own
duct click function here so you can see
right here is that when we click icon -
close they want it that's why it would
work but it's not going to so on just
save a little bit time because we found
our hair we're gonna go ahead and put
this in here but basically what what
happened was is that we needed to call
dot click again because we called it on
icon - menu and not on icon - close so
this click is only referring to the menu
and this one's only referring to the
clothes so that's where our air was
there I'm not sure why our code worked
but hey it did so there it is
and we're done and we've basically
created this Wow so this has our old
code so let's go ahead and fix that we
basically have created our own push menu
anyway it wasn't that bad so this might
be something that you can you know put
onto your website or anyone elses for
that matter it seems to be fairly
responsive and I think anybody could do
this so up next for the interactive
website I will see you then and it'll
probably just be a little more in-depth
a little bit more jQuery but so far it's
not too bad it's kind of giving us a
little preview of what's going on in
we'll see what's going on there next so
thanks for watching comments questions
concerns anything constructors always
appreciated and I'll see you guys in the
next video and don't forget to check out
my own jQuery labs which are from
applied jQuery and which is a book I got
and it's something I highly recommend
people follow along so that once you're
done with jay with code Kadim e cuz
we're getting to the end of it for my
channel duh if you want to do a little
more in jquery check that out and I'll
be doing some videos on java servlets
from some
college course courses as well so I'll
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
