back in the code fights calm through the
fog intro section absolute value some
innovation that is quite the name with
quite the description and it's a whole
lot of so let me break down
what you're actually being asked here
but thanks to the comments here so give
it a sorted array of integers a fund
manager X from a such as the value
absolute of a minus here minus X plus
after the a minus one minus X plus blah
blah blah is the smallest possible I to
know types of value if they're sum of
all this is asking you to do is find the
median value the median value I don't
honestly I don't I understand what's
going on here and understand the
question so I get that where minus X and
we're iterating either the values
together I got that's about it I
understand the question but I do
understand how to find the median to do
that what we need to do is and we could
do this all in a single line with a
return a.length modulo 2 is equal equal
to zero the reason we have to check this
is to make sure this is this is we're
going as a ternary or conditional
statement use a ternary operator here so
we're saying hey is this a true or false
statement if it's true what we want to
do is we just want to take the length
minus one a the length
/ - - one so here we go here and this
will actually be what we're returning
with which will be the median number the
the middle number if you will and then
if it's an odd number what we want to do
is we want to still divide but we don't
want a -1 we just want to take math dot
floor a million divided by 2 and we are
done the hardest part of this challenge
is to basically just figure out what the
hell are they actually asking this is
one of the things that I particularly
despise about computer science is the
unnecessary let's try to give as few
details or as complicated details as
possible that's what I really despise
about people who create stuff like this
because this is unnecessary and I think
this is probably somebody with a
master's degree in computer science and
says yeah that makes sense yeah so yeah
maybe a little bit my own bias off shot
through there but as always guys thank
you so much for watching the video don't
forget to comment like subscribe and
share it support me at patreon.com slash
coding tutorials 360 and if you have a
different opinion about it and you think
that maybe I'm just too dumb to
understand or I am misinformed and that
this is something crucial let me know in
the comments man this is a I'm looking
to get better but I do think that this
is kind of what it's suffering from it's
hey do this and the very little insight
as to what is going on here but uh I'll
see you guys next time thank you so much
for watching
hey guys thanks for watching the video
especially thanks to our sponsors dev
Mountain if you look for a coding boot
camp where tuition and housing is
included definitely check them out
appreciate it and I'll see you guys in
the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
