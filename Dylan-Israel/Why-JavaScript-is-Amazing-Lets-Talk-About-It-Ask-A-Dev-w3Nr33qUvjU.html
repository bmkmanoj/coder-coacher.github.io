little bit about Ruby and more so on
JavaScript and why I find it so
fascinating but a lot of boot camps
started with Ruby and the transition and
JavaScript we're gonna talk a little bit
about why and just a little JavaScript
eccentric talk today so as I mentioned
they're there when boot camp started
Ruby on Rails was the number one thing
taught back in like 2008 2010 and it was
the as this guy puts the king and it
really was the king for quite some time
right you take a look here this is a an
interest over time chart and you can see
Ruby in 2007 was at the peak of its
interest but still basically tenfold
how tenfold in terms of the Google
Trends of JavaScript and even Django at
that time and then this time has
progressed the increase of interest in
Ruby on Rails decreased while JavaScript
has continued sliding up now what why
might that be well in a practical
standpoint you'll see that Java scripts
much faster in terms of the benchmark
runtime in comparison to Ruby Ruby is
you know I mean you you see the chart
chart doesn't lie right in terms of job
trends you see that Ruby on Rails
although not as dramatic has been going
down since 2012
well JavaScript has just been climbing
and climbing and climbing and there's a
couple of reasons for that and that's
one of the things that we're gonna
talking about and this this this article
goes over the pros and the cons of Ruby
the pros and the cons of a specifically
note and you know companies that use
note every day almost everyone you seems
to use note for something nowadays even
if it's just the you know the package
manager in downloading applications but
one of the cool things about JavaScript
and why I think it's growing as a
language is that I don't think there's
anything because of how connected our
world is via the Internet
and the way that applications are being
built I don't think there is like a
final frontier for JavaScript i I moved
the belief that no matter what happens
with Java JavaScript and I'll talk a
little bit about what I'm basing this
off of that just augmented reality
virtual reality blockchain like I really
just think AI I just think that
JavaScript is going to if it hasn't
already jump into every single in those
directions so I and I'm paying off a few
things one interesting interest of
developers being interested there's a a
big if and if you're not familiar with
some of the higher language just like
Java C sharp maybe Scala stuff that's a
little bit more object oriented and has
things like classes you may you may not
even notice that if you're just a pure
web developer and you've been touching
JavaScript you haven't got on the type
script yet but some of these
functionalities just rip a hat have
really until recently her is kind of a
pain to do some things they didn't have
and some things were kind of paying to
do so with the with the advent of
typescript you now have not only the
ability to create classes and assign
types which makes your your code much
more strict which results in less bugs
it does kind of take away a little bit
of the cool factor of changing a string
to a to a int or a number and you know
I'm not gonna lie I said baby I said if
my girlfriend said look I'm gonna turn
this string into a number you're
impressed you're impressed not so but uh
it does take away some of that that's
sort of you know feeble wonky stuff that
you take that you think is fun but it
does it did all in all it has attracted
more of the traditional developers I
would say the people who maybe are
computer science crafts that that is
more of their thing has made that say
okay maybe javascript is not as bad and
it's attracted people that way it also
just seems to be implementing in every
direction and I think note is a perfect
example that for a long time javascript
was just this this language where you
made stuff on the Internet
stuff you know you wanted it made stuff
interactive that's really JavaScript at
the end of day is it made stuff
interactive it does make stuff
interactive and then note came along and
changed the game right note Kimmel I
said look JavaScript I ain't for the
front-end that's some we're
doing backend stuff and now you have a
you know JSON type databases like
MongoDB and CF JavaScript databases
basically if gentle secure back in you
have JavaScript front-end and now from
that as as people start kind of
expanding their mind it's a front are
applying javascript in every direction
you now have JavaScript applications for
your phone react native ionic you know
JavaScript desktop applications you can
virtual reality JavaScript and and I
don't know this feature but I bet John
script blockchains around the corner if
it doesn't exists already right so so my
point being is I don't think there's an
end to where JavaScript will go I think
it's going to be one of those languages
that due to its flexibility is allowed
it's it's core flexibility is going to
continue to and how connected our world
is right nowadays we live in a world in
which everything is connected to the
Internet and if all we need to do is
make an iframe or is like a little
insert and make an app that's actually a
web page look like an app everything is
all of sudden accessible via JavaScript
it's a very interesting world that we
live in because for a long time for last
three four years there's been rapid
rapid rapid change in the web
development world it's kind of slowing
down right it's kind of slowing down
you know if UJS is trying to change that
up you jus Tran changed over right so
you know for a long time jQuery was
believed you're not King and a lot of us
like to stock smack on jQuery jQuery for
its time you know it's time for you to
rest in peace but hey you did your job
you did it Valley angularjs another
great one now we're moving on to angular
4 although you just what's called
angular and react react native redux and
all the various modules
that are happening and we're kind of
changing the way that we think about
building web applications usually a more
component architecture you know
model-view-controller troller now we
have built tools now we have you know
all these great resources and assets
that are growing version control and I
guess the point I'm trying to make is
that I see JavaScript continuing this
trend now I don't necessarily think that
I think there's been a lot of innovation
that has happened and something's good
something's bad right even if you go to
Bauer's website now they say just use
webpack right so I think some things are
fine we've kind of had the first
iteration of like change and like some
things made it some things got cut out
and we've learned from that in terms of
the web development world that's always
going to happen maybe not in such a
frequent frequent amount but I think
it's a very interesting thing javascript
because I think honestly believe that
it's going to be one of those languages
that is not going to be limited to
anything anymore there's going to be a
framework and a library that is just
going to let you do whatever you want
with it and I don't even know what that
means to agree because it's hard to say
okay well you know I wouldn't even know
how how you'd make a JavaScript
blockchain does it do I think it can't
exist I don't think it can't exist I
don't know if it's a good idea but I
don't think it can't take this I guess I
don't know anything about blockchain on
a technical aspect but in terms of you
know we're doing VR in JavaScript right
I'm sure augmented reality as well game
development everything can be done with
it and it's hard to say see what's next
but I imagine that Java scripts ready to
do that too and so it's a great language
to learn for that reason because you
know 5-10 years ago if you said you
wanted to be you didn't know what you
wanted to go into you said you know what
I know I want to be some sort of
developer I don't know if I want to be a
web developer I don't know if I want to
be a mobile developer I don't know if
I'll be VR developer augmented reality
developer a back-end developer a
front-end developer database you now
have a language that can do it all
and for me at least I think is a one of
the because of the flexibility and how
basic it kind of starts out now it could
be very overwhelming because there is so
much flexibility and there are so many
tools and there are so many libraries
and frameworks and it may take you a
while to sort of ramp up to where you
feel comfortable to sort of jumping in
between right
you know you might start with JavaScript
then move to jQuery then move to
angularjs and move to angular then move
to react and redux they react native and
ionic right so I understand that can all
be very overwhelming but at the same
time is very powerful and very fun like
I got pretty excited by the state of
JavaScript and I'm very happy that you
have boot camps that are teaching that
over Ruby on Rails because I've heard
some horror stories from developers have
gone to boot camps I'm very Pro boot
camp I've been sponsored by boot camps
in the past and one of the things that
I've that my personal opinion for the
people that I've seen like why is it a
researching about people who'd had
negative experiences on YouTube almost
all of them were Ruby Jobson not they
can't get a Ruby on Rails job I think it
I think it's just one of those things
that there's already developers for
those jobs and so you're gonna have a
little bit harder time win and you have
a lot of a lot of these startups or
large companies that are building out
their software team a little bit more
that transitioning to note or JavaScript
and things like that but that's not okay
are there I'm just excited at the state
of JavaScript I think is very exciting
I'm wondering what your guys's favorite
framework or library is what you like
about it and I think that if we're to
look at the trends of what people
actually code in their free time and on
like github or something I think you
would see that there's a lot of web
development projects there's a lot of
JavaScript projects in general when when
putting that stuff out there and because
it is we are so connected to the web
nowadays right everything connected to
the Internet you have smart
refrigerators hell I might get oil
essential oil diffuser that's a smart
one pretty soon you never know right
like there there's a smart everything
connected to the web and that that goes
hand-in-hand with
javascript because that's where it gets
it that's its origin story right that's
if this was a superhero movie we would
start with the web you know that's what
I'm trying to say so hey guys I hope you
enjoyed the video thank you for watching
I'll clear the link to this as well I
think it's pretty good and well we're in
an article so I hope you enjoyed the

up share the video like the video sit
think are you said like the video
supporting my patreon enjoy the Facebook
group I'll see you guys next time bye
hey guys thanks for watching the video
if you happen to be looking for a boot
camp I couldn't recommend dev Mountain
any higher they also include housing
with their tuition so you can get up and
go and get started right away thanks
