about skills that can get you hiring in
2017 now this articles a little bit old
I think it's kind of relevant again and
I remember looking at it last year and
it's when it came out in October 20th so
according in LinkedIn data the most
likely time you're supposed to get
higher it is in October so we're coming
up on that and I imagine the months
before that are pretty good as well but
all these skills are in demand but we
want I want to show you and this is
going to be for the United States but
where you say the top skills because a
lot of times people they don't
understand what jobs are entailed in
those skills and what skills you need
for jobs so what we're going to talk
about is just a pure skills forget
relating into a job right forget
relating it to you know a front-end
developer a back-end developer UI UX
we're going to just be talking about the
general skills and if you're American
congratulations I am American and we're
doing the US version but if you're
interested in knowing your specific
country they have it for they have it
based off the LinkedIn in total this one
is the global which is pretty similar to
to what the United States is so we'll go
over the global first so from what you
can see here cloud and distributed
computing so a live you guys asked me
you know is AWS important is Linux
important it's so important that it was
the top skill of 2016 so then he six
statistical analytics and analysis and
data mining again another great area and
one of the reasons i wanted to talk
about this with somebody today
in my my bootcamp video said that they
wasted eight months learning web
development because they didn't know
other things like data analytics AI
machine learning all this for all these
great technologies existed and he wasn't
blaming me or anything he just didn't
know and obviously i'm going to preach
about web development that's what I know
that's what I do and that's that's what
I like and
you know I didn't dabble in other things
here there but uh one one thing agency
web architecture and development
framework that's that's why you're so
yeah it's the third most in-demand skill
in terms of just global categories but
what you what I want you to notice here
is that of the top ten skills that are
on here middleware user interface
Network and information security mobile
development data presentation SEO and
what you're seeing by the way this plus
and minus is where in the top ten these
ranks and if they if they got dropped
out if they if they moved up if they
maintain the same so between 2015-2016
web development jump by plus six slots
which is massive which is why I
encourage people to get into it you know
the previous talk twenty five jobs of
2017 based off of indeed full stack
development which is web development was
ranked number one and a lot of these
other things for ranked in the top 25 as
well but what you'll see a book all this
is that everything in here unless I'm
misunderstanding storage systems and
management but I might be I don't know
but I think that's probably just servers
if I had to guess and hardware
everything in here is a a technical
skill everything in here is in software
technology and if you're not sure about
what's for you
I can I can I could say that everything
in here is a good spot to to get into
because you may not be interested in web
development and that's okay but if you
did get started on web development like
the person who I'm talking about today
don't sweat it man because that will
help you get your your maybe your data
analytics job because you it shows that
you're interested in all this stuff
right so a lot of that can play to your
advantage so let's see how this differs
for for my country so if you're in
Australia data mining a little bit
higher up on the list and what develops
although all the way Nate's right so not
Brazil a data might up this statistical
analysis view if you guys are interested
in data science you it really is a great
time to get in you're talking about
a lot of job demand and it's a little
bit harder I want to say because
everyone I've met has had a math degree
or a stats degree or a degree that goes
into this space it's a little bit more
math heavy than it is being a developer
like being developer you traditionally
probably need just good algebra skills
that would probably be what 90% of
developers would tell you but especially
web development now but Ohr why is a
charge so big in Brazil this is a
Brazilians have like really good health
care and stuff like that that jump five
points playing out Brazil Canada mobile
developments up a lot in Canada but
again you see a lot of different
whatever this refers to software
revision like maintaining legacy code
China virtualization is what's that's
more data analytics social media
marketing right here baby
+8 jumping eight spots is pretty
impressive so obviously big push of
social media in China that's where
you're from uh everything looks kind of
standard here QA Frances do more QA than
this didn't even make it this is how
little America gives about a quality
shares didn't make on the list
bad things happens that things happen
channel marketing I wonder where that is
for Germany India and by the way if I
mentioned there will be a link to this
down below if you want to dive in a
little bit
Ireland the Netherlands Singapore South
Africa the United Arab Emirates United
Kingdom plus 18
what the hell happen in the United
Kingdom that the most intimate skill
jumped 18 spots for head United States
so again cloud computing and great great
thing to have on the resume mobile
development is number three storage this
is a management user interface design
Network and information security middle
our integration web architecture and
development framework so what
development even the US isn't as high up
as it is in the rest of the world now
keep in mind that some
areas with the state of web development
some of these areas overlap right like
this might overlap lo with web
development mobile development might
overlap user interface design but you
guys get the idea and you can see javis
jump and dropping down algorithm design
but what does Milan saw its way up which
is which is great for me but last year
they did a week of learning which they
gave you a list let you do a bunch of
courses for free at r ik advantage of of
one although I never finished it but
what I want the point of this video is
keep an eye out for articles like this
if you're not already signed up to
LinkedIn blogs where you get like a
weekly email or indeed this is them
sharing their analytics with you man
that's really what it is where the real
world weight is the number one job site
in the world and if you don't think this
has validity in the real world you're
sorely mistaken and I highly encourage
you to kind of follow the market but it
and also if you're not aware that
there's other there's other niches in
software other than web development you
have been informed all right there's
there's project management which is
great as well all these things you can
make a good living on the LF they all
have high high pay rates high benefits
they all are fun interesting works
you're not going to be bored with the
same old Monday tasks every day they all
have their unique spin but the thing
they all have in common is they're all
in tech and software guys and if if
you're on the fence about should you
become a developer or should you if you
don't want to become a developer that's
fine assignment for everybody right I
have a very pessimistic so that just
says I don't want to be a guy that's you
know nerd it out in the corner you don't
have to be that guy there's some of
these roles are a little bit more
creative go in a different direction but
the world is changing guys and and if
you want a good life and everyone's
definition is different my brother he's
traveling Asia he just got done
traveling in Asia and he's after he
comes visit me this weekend with my mom
he's going down to South America to
travel he doesn't
 about money man he's spending what
what he saved up for why he was in
school and now when he goes back he's
going to go and you know work some job
that probably pays nothing because he
doesn't have any technical skills but
that's not what its importance to it was
important to him it's seeing the world
and what's important to him is working
at nonprofits and you know getting paid
money that that's just for food and so I
understand that so I so but for me
what's important to me is being able to
take luxurious vacations and buy food
and and when my mom comes visit to be
able to pay for dinners and things like
this then and I'm getting to all that
and it's because of choosing in-demand
skills and choosing high paying skills
that I know that even if I were to get
fired today for whatever reason are laid
off I have a job lined up that I don't
even know about right so if you're
thinking that this may not be for you
just understand that what what whatever
you value if see if you can work this
into there because software and tech is
only growing there is no good there's
not going to be a tech boom guys there
air bubble it's only going to continue
to boom for a while and all the other
greatest innovations the last 10 15 20
years it's all software man and it's
just going to continue to grow but if
you're not a developer if you're like
hey I don't necessarily like that maybe
you're more of a hardware guy you can go
down that right design guy people-person
project manager there's a lot of
different things and niches you can go
into and I encourage you to do the
research and find out what those jobs
are and I hope that that this was one
way of informing you and if you were on
the fence or you wanted to give up just
and you saw maybe this and you're like
 man I got one of the top ten skills
I'm working towards keep moving forward
baby so I hope you guys keep moving
forward I'll see you guys in the next
video
and for the for the giveaway and I know
I'm behind I got to do some so don't
think I'm not going to give them out
guys I just have been lagging lots of
lots of stuff going on behind the scenes

a react course so I hope you guys keep
going
