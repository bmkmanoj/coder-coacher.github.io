very special presidential edition of
algorithm where we're going to add that
border we're going to build a wall today
little joke don't know and take it too
seriously and yeah so what we're what
the task is is we get an array of
strings that all have the same length
well what we're tasked with is to build
a border around it and so the end has to
go all the way across then it has to
have enough for pieces go along the
sides of the strings the way that I do
it is I first go ahead and I create that
wall and I then just concatenate and
pushing those values to the right so
let's go ahead and get started
I you don't need to create a variable
but I do just to kind of put the put the
put in context and we're going to call
this length overall we're just going to
set it equal to these the length of the
very first string again they're all the
same size so it doesn't matter and then
we're going to add 2 to it because we
have to have one for the end and one for
this for instance this is 3 right so we
need 5 spaces next thing we're going to
do is we're going to create a Walt
variable so really the only the only
point of this is you can cat the
asterisks on to Z wall to go ahead and
have the wall set up for the first value
and the last value the big wall with
both of the two longest walls and we're
going to just go ahead and hit array
through Mercer a bar I equal to 0 what
is less than the length of the wall I
plus plus and then we're going to take
wall stud equal to wall cat and all
we're counting is our asterisk while
we're at it let's go ahead and just
return it make sure everything is
working as anticipated right so we
should get in this first test a wall
that is the length of 5 asterisks
exactly cool now that we have that we
can go ahead and unshifted push it on
shift we'll go ahead and add that to our
picture and
let's go ahead and put picture here so
that we can see it and we'll go ahead
and put a picture on the shift that wall
and then picture dot push that wall and
we'll run our code and you'll see here
we have our first of all we have our
second wall but now we need our sight we
need our side walls of side-pieces
side-chick as i would say my girlfriend
was like to domestic her she doesn't
think it's funny I think it's very
alright so because we are iterating
because we're only our next for loop is
only on the the not the beginning in the
end wall we're going to start our for
loop off at one and not zero because we
don't need to add on to that first wall
and then we also are going to end it
early for the length of the array so
doing just picture dot length section
picture dot length minus one because we
don't need to do it on our colossal
she's going to hate it if she sees this
video on the anime and I made a side
chick cake she's going to absolutely
hate you for that so so all we're going
to do here is we're going to replace the
picture there and we're going to say hey
go ahead and cat our ask an asterisk so
we have our starting asterisk and then
we have our ending arc and cat which is
going to be the original value
and our closing astrick as well so the
value is in there ABC we're going to in
front of it put a stir and then behind
it for the abstract and then we run our
test
Smit we're good to go so that was add
border not too bad IX for some reason so
I had to refactor a bunch of my code I
had about twice the amount of code here
when I originally did this some of it
was I think I was doing this late night
when I was tired and you kind of get
loopy but it probably looking at it now
not too bad of a problem to get going
