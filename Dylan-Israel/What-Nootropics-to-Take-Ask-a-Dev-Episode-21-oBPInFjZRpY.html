pg-13 and above conversation I know it's
uh we're gonna talk about something that
may be a little controversial I don't
think it is but some people do we're
gonna talk about in the tropics or you
know smart pills brain pills for those
of you don't know I take a couple
different ones depending on the day so I
have kind of a high caffeine tolerance
and sometimes I need something to kind
of kick me into gear I'm gonna talk to
you about the three that I've take or
have taken so basically three you'll see
I have a bottle of each so I'm not like
right here so we'll talk about the first
one
focus factor this is kind of you can get
this at Costco this is kind of a vitamin
for your brain if you will find it
helpful though the reason that I don't
stick with taking it consistently is I
believe you have to take four or six so
I've been taking these a little while
but I've take them in the past and this
is kind of your daily brain supplement
it really helps a lot especially you're
trying to study man and you're just
trying to be alert this is a yeah it's
four or four of these pills it by the
way these are not small pills I'll show
you one of these pills I don't know for
those to come through but that's it
that's a fairly decent-sized pill that
you would take once or twice a day for
it four of them but you can pick that up
for like two bottles at Costco for about
thirty bucks
think of it as a brain vitamin that's
how I think of that one now the next two
are a little bit more in the moment you
have your study juice I did this I've
sponsored by them in a video and that's
how I came across City juice I have a
bottle at work and a bottle at home
working my way through it on those days
are a little bit rougher study juice is
great because it's kind of a steady
steady but slow increase in and sort of
look alertness this is one that kind of
like kind of creeps into your
bloodstream a little bit you take four
to six of these are three to six
depending on your tolerance if you're a
higher tolerance person like myself
takes a lot of caffeine and isn't
overwhelmed by like it's super jittery
or anything like that encourage you to
take the the six of them even though
it's a yes six bills lots swallow but it
this is kind of a steady
you'll be coding and you won't feel
super different right now the mack daddy
one or my personal favorite that I've
been taken for years for about two years
now
focus plus so focus plus is about $20 a
bottle or you can get two for 30 I have
one at home and one at work and you
stick him all the time in my little job
one a day and I would get in the zone
man I still do so recently I've been
kind of burnt out a little bit and did
feel like I was performing to my full
capability so I bought two bottles again
and they weren't great again even though
I haven't taken them - this last month
now focus plus is by far my favorite
this is the thing that when I needed to
code when I when I said when I was
saying when I decided this to devote
myself entirely to becoming a developer
and I wanted to code and I was coding
four to five hours a day after work and
I was coding 14 hours on the weekend
this is what I was taking this was the
thing that kicked me into gear got me
going to that next level and this is one
of the reasons you know granny you're
gonna have to have hard work and
determination but in terms of your brain
becoming mush after a few hours
something about focus plus just does it
for me um now with all that being said
you know I just talked about three in
the tropics in it that I currently take
on occasion I'll probably uh this one
thing about focus factor I also stopped
taking this kind of hard on my stomach
if I didn't have anything in it I also
don't like swallowing that many pills
the focus plus is just one and this is
kind of a I consider this more of like a
brain stimulant lasts about four to six
hours to pay on the individual but it
really does kick you into gear and then
study juices kind of four to six but
much more steady much more of a less you
don't feel a turn-on like I feel I could
tell you a hundred percent in about
thirty minutes you're gonna feel the
focus plus turn on you're gonna be like
Oh
my goodness I'm ready to put in some
work I feel different some people may
not like the feeling I personally do but
is you will notice a difference now one
one one major thing to say because I
don't encourage anybody who's not an
adult to take anything like this I
really it's it's an adult decision right
like there's not a lot of research on
the tropics there's not a lot of studies
on it who knows how it affects
developing minds or things like that but
these are some things that I take and
I've had co-workers in the past take
them and they say it's worked for them
specifically the focus plus but just my
two thoughts if you guys are looking for
like an extra little bump to kind of get
you through the day or you're trying to
learn development and you're like look
man how do you study past three hours
you know how do you get to that point
and you know you may want to try focus
plus or some of these others to kind of
keep you alert and keep you going but be
aware when you do take them drink lots
of water do all that sort of safety
but that's why that's my two cents on
the tropics I'm a big fan of them as you
can see and I've used some I think quite
well when I've been trying to study for
hours upon hours and it's really helped
with that again focus plus is my
favorite it's not a sponsored video or
anything I just really enjoy this stuff
engineer truth has taken them as well
he's kind of the one who got me started
on it back in the day but for him it was
too
this was actually too strong and so he
didn't he stop taking them but I liked
it a lot I kept taking them but that's
my two cents as always guys if you have
