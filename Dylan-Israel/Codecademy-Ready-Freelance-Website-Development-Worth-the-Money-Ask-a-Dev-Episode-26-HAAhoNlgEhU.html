about coke Adam II ready the freelance
website development which you're looking
at here in there I kind of reviewed the
syllabus and I explained my thoughts on
if this is worth your time your energy
and your money at the end of the day
because a lot of us are students a lot
of us are trying to get in a better
situation and $500 plus is a lot of
money to be paying for this now at that
time I was really critical about a
couple things one that didn't cover
JavaScript or jQuery at all there was
zero zero zero aspects of this in which
it covered anything jump anything that
involved Jas and I can tell you right
now when you use the word development
you must have JavaScript included and
the other thing I really had an issue
with was that this freelance worker it
in front of here because I kind of feel
like it's misleading it's it's kind of
leading people down this idea that yo
I'm gonna take this eight-week
$500 course and now I'm gonna be a
freelance web developer and you know I
can start working from home and being
remote and like with no emphasis on the
freelance aspect nothing on there to
explain how to get freelance clients how
to build a strong portfolio to attract
freelance clients and things like that
and the more so the jss effect was
wicked and you see here now they've
reworked their course slightly and it's
a slightly better course and I'll tell
you why in a second but you'll see now
they have this nice proudly displayed
javascript in jquery get CSS command
line HTML okay cool
let's go ahead and scoot down and and
look at what you're gonna have at the
end of here and what you're gonna be
working with now with HTML and CSS
perfect I love it spend a week on both
this course is designed to have about 10
hour weeks I think these are both
sections command line and get okay I'm
glad they combined in one week that
that's cool because I don't think you
need more than a week to get the basics
more CSS layout responsive design design
principles a lot of design going on here
and this was kind of one of the things I
talked about in the previous one was it
was all HTML CSS you start your project
and then week eight week eight on the
final week they just throw you in
JavaScript are you in jQuery but I think
the problem was they probably got a lot
of feedback saying look this isn't a
website DeVoe this has nothing to do
with development this is design maybe
you could definitely design some
websites from this but that's not where
the big money's at and will this be
enough to get you started and the fact
that they combined jQuery and JavaScript
in the last week is kind of scary
because if you're if you're taking this
course you are a beginner 100% beginner
now I I I reached out to Codecademy said
hey do you want to let me take this
course for free so that I can go through
it and evaluate it on my own
because all I can go off of is the
syllabus and a couple comments on the
previous video will will show that
before and Aaron in a second but the
gist of it is is you spend seven weeks
learning design cool you learn and also
how to deploy to get which could take
you a 10 to 30 minute video on YouTube
at most okay
so you spent seven weeks learning design
and then in the eighth week you're going
to learn JavaScript or jQuery not only
not only are you going to learn a
logical language which will more than
likely be your very first language
you're also going to learn a framework
to use for that which is pretty pretty
absurd in my opinion that they kind of
just jam this in here but they have to
because it otherwise is not website
develop now what are the projects cool
projects I don't think you're going to
be able to understand most of them if
this is your first course if I asked you
what API stood for
right now could you tell me probably not
if you're new right and that's fine
there's nothing wrong with that there's
nothing wrong with not knowing how to do
this or how to use these things or but
the fact is it's preying on people that
hey you can become a web developer in
eight weeks for five hundred bucks you
don't have to go to a boot camp or you
don't have to go and devote hours of
your time or anything like that
and it's even even what's going on here
this slash let's just go ahead and throw
this in here and hope for the best
so the idea isn't that great and you can
see like oh cool so some people made
some cool stuff all right now I say if
they have 80 hours of lessons projects
seminars and one-on-ones so you're
expecting to put 10 hours a week in
there and to put put it in perspective
the way that you know this doesn't sound
this 80 hours of okay how much time are
you actually spending with your mentor
30 minutes a week so for 500 dollars you
get 30 minutes a week with this with
this teacher one-on-one if hey you want
to hire me for eight weeks 30 minutes a
week for $500 let's go you got my email
you can message me and I'll do it
just fine but the point the point being
is yes you're not gonna get the amount
of help you're gonna need for this and
full refund in the first two weeks okay
so if you realize that it's a it's gonna
suck in the first two weeks but it
doesn't the first two weeks are actually
fairly decent right you got HTML and CSS
if it were up to me this would either be
longer and you'd have more time with the
mentor or you would cut out some of this
other stuff the design and get into
the real meat and potatoes of
development with his JavaScript
libraries front-end and front-end
technologies it said just the the the
bare-bones and you know they have a nice
success story of course they do with the
beautiful girl I'm not too surprised by
that but uh the one thing I wanted to
share was and I've asked in my previous
video that's
about three months old I evaluate their
syllabus and but and in all fairness
this new syllabus much better much
better than the previous one and one
thing I didn't like about this was I had
to search really hard but I remembered I
got an email saying that you can
actually do this one for 200 bucks for
$200 you can do you can do this but you
get no mentorship except they will
review three projects of yours that you
build along the way that's basically the
main difference I found the key let me
pull up the email right here so you guys
can see it
but the gist is for 500 dollars you get
that one-on-one mentorship where it's 30
minutes a week and then for two for 200
bucks
you'll get critiqued by their team of
experts during the program right so I
don't know how long those critiques are
but you don't get the mentoring and one
one other thing is that Joe Montana here
who's been I've seen him comment on a
couple of videos in the past but when I
might might as you can see I'm not very
positive of this but his take was as
someone who attended coke Adam II ready
and I asked to interview him by the way
so I'd like to interview him or anyone
else who has attended and can show proof
of it right of receipt or whatever so
people don't think we're bullshitting
because right now this guy could just
for whatever reason be making it up I
don't think he is but there's always
those people will say that as someone
who attended coke Adam II ready I fully
agree with this video it is a money grab
the mentors are a joke you get thirty
minutes with your mentor every week for
nine weeks when I had doubts at various
stages they don't seem well qualified to
answer my doubts my mentor even
suggested to Google my doubts
most of the mentors I think were
previous students at code Academy when I
came to flexbox and under lesson and
other lessons my mentor told me the
subjects are even tough and confusing
for software engineers so don't worry if
I don't understand it like that's going
to make me feel comfortable so this is
just one person's take on it and again
I'd like to interview him and I show
proof that he's done all this and I you
can see right here I asked him this just
20 minutes ago which is why
I wanted to do this video and people
have been asking me to follow up with it
but I just want will you get something
out of this course yes you will you'll
you will build yourself some projects
you'll get some videos you'll get 30
minutes of conversation with somebody
who may or may not be super qualified in
that I one thing I really don't like is
saying that you know not to worry that
you don't understand it that's that's
that's rough man because you're getting
the base you're supposed to be getting a
core foundation from this which is I
which is what I would expect from this
and you know I I don't know it's it's
this isn't a course that's you would
learn more more going to free code camp
calm and just building the project's out
that they have on there and doing their
tutorials and I've heard from other
students that basically the way that
they tell you to practice is by doing
they're free content so it it's do with
it what you will that's my take on it is
that you're probably gonna be wasting
$500 for 30 minutes of someone who
doesn't according to mr. Montana here it
wasn't super qualified but you never
know just my two cents I I don't want
you guys to be spending your hard-earned
money on something that isn't gonna make
you a freelancer and definitely isn't
gonna make you a developer you're gonna
learn web design at the end of this and
that's basically it you're gonna learn
how to build a web page with no logic
and to put in perspective web developers
make twice as much as web designers and
I to say you're gonna be a web designer
at this may be a bit of a stretch as
well but that those are the skill sets
you're learning this could be maybe web
design not freelance web development
it's a complete lie that preys on people
thinking that they're gonna beat work
remote and make money my two cents guys
as always if you want join our Facebook
group Co Tech and caffeine the link is
in the description below and if you want
to support me a can at patreon.com slash
coding tutorials 360 and if you've taken
the code Khadem e ready course I would
love to interview you and talk to you
about your experience and even if you
don't agree with me
to see your projects and I want to see
your portfolio let's see what you got
out of it I want to hear about your
experience because maybe maybe you did
get a good experience out of it from
what I see it it's a little bit of a
money grab as I say and you know we have

always guys just to continue your
learning and keep working hard it'll
work out for you one way or the other
