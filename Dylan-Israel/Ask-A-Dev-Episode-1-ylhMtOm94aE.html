first ever episode of ask a dev on a
weekly basis we're going to take some of
your comments and questions that I think
would relate to the coding community and
those looking to learn to code and
struggling and things like that or just
enlightenment and answer them for
developers we're gonna start off by
myself answering them and as the channel
continues the girl asked some of my
developer friends at work my friends who
are developers guests of the channel
whether it be simple programmer engineer
truths who's a developer now you also
have Quincy Larson who I'll be
interviewing and some of these other
conan channels and we're basically going
to answer five or six of your questions
that I think are relevant and let's go
ahead and jump right into it the very
first question is from I'm gonna pop
this up
Sean C laughs it says I have no
experience at all I need to learn from
scratch this video really helped me out
thanks should I worry if it feels
difficult and overwhelming at times as
someone who's been coding for I would
say roughly four years pretty solidly
you're always it's always gonna feel
difficult it will not always feel
overwhelming and what I mean by that is
that you're going to be struggling
because you're always going to be
getting better and you're always going
to be learning new things so when when
jQuery starts feeling easy you may learn
move on to angular and you make because
you you need to gain as many skills as
are out there so once you feel go to
front-end development game move on to
back-end development that's gonna be a
whole new challenge a whole new process
so don't don't feel bad when it's
overwhelming because it will pass you
just need to stick with it and continue
on and it'll pass it I always always
equate coding to math it's like before
you could multiply and divide you had to
add and subtract and once you had Adam
subtract down pretty well you moved on
to multiplication and division was he at
multiplication division down maybe you
moved on to you at geometry once you had
geometry down you moved on to maybe
the calculus or trigonometry and then
you moved on to advanced calculus anyone
theoretical mathematics all these sort
of things and that's really what I
equate coding with is like you may start
in web development at HTML and then CSS
these are having sass and JavaScript
jQuery so don't don't feel bad about
being overwhelmed just keep moving
forward and it will slowly slowly get
better all right so
Angus Duffy asked how did you first
learn to code I first really learned to
code when I was in college for computer
science I learned my first language was
Java it wasn't the first Croghan
programming course ever took but this
would be the first time I ever really
understood programming I so that was
where I first learned to code however I
haven't touched Java and about a year
and a half and I don't I wouldn't say I
know it by any means and I never really
truly felt comfortable with it it's kind
of why I really do enjoy web development
is it comes very naturally to me and
that's why I am basically a JavaScript
developer at work but that's how I first
learned the code was learn me Java in
coursework I would never recommend
anybody learned learn that way I think
online resources are significantly
better as well as doing making your own
portfolio doing your own side projects
or things like that
all right Roxie asks I'm still doing my
own thing on free code camp but so
difficulty understanding the full
spectrum a JavaScript lately I'm finding
myself at a standstill with coding
mostly because I don't have as much free
time to research and learn the languages
since I started school this semester any
advice for those of us who have a
passion to code but who lack ample time
need to learn the skills the my one
piece of advice is I quit this to
exercise we all have 30 minutes of our
day if we really force ourselves that we
could equate to exercising daily and
it's the same goes for coding you need
to code 30 minutes a day regardless of
how busy you are if you can do that you
will be a master that is my that is my
number one piece of advice code
daily if you can and you will just
continue to improve this is not so it's
it's very like muscle memory heavy in
your head once you kind of gain it you
and continue to build upon it you're
just going next level next level but
once you stop it's gonna slowly creep
back in where you may find yourself
things that may not be clicking as
quickly as possible as it you know maybe
when you were doing it 30 minutes a day
so my my advice for those of you who
have time or personal responsibilities
whether it be school or kids or work is
to spend about 30 minutes a day and just
you know what no matter what I don't
care if I have to lose sleep I don't
care if I have to leave work early I
don't care I don't care and I don't care
about your excuses 30 minutes a day I'm
gonna do it for 30 minutes a day so if
you can do 30 minutes a day and you'll
do more when you can you'll be all right
so just 30 minutes a day is my advice
for those of you who are a little bit on
the busier side alright Michael Eavis
says what programming language should I
learn for web development
I already got HTML CSS JavaScript
learned but I want to know what other
languages I should learn to complete all
of web development this is a very weird
question because I highly doubt that you
have mastered HTML CSS and JavaScript
because I don't even say I know those
and I get paid decent amount of money to
do it so there's always more to learn in
these languages we work in such a crazy
fast place environment but uh let's
assume that you have a pretty strong
handle on JavaScript it's time to move
on to frameworks libraries a good place
to start at a very good entry-level
framework although it's not the best one
to learn is jQuery jQuery is a great
entry to get comfortable with libraries
rather is a great entry-level one now
too if you want to work if you want to
work as a web developer you're going to
need to learn more advanced ones such as
such as angular or react angular one is
pretty intuitive as far you know I work
in I find it very intuitive not
everybody does I haven't touched angular
2 yet so either version of angular will
do just fine in current version of react
is great as well
if you don't want to move on to
libraries or frameworks databases you
can learn Mongo
on free code camp or you could also
learn SQL on on code CAD me and if those
courses are too basic for you or you
already familiar with that go ahead and
actually start a project with that and
you know incorporate it into your
website a lot a lot of these websites
like GoDaddy or hosting companies like
GoDaddy will allow you to connect to the
database through like PHP myadmin or
some sort of tool that makes it a little
bit easier for you that's my advice if
you feel like you have a basic knowledge
of HTML CSS and JavaScript I want to
just kind of branch out a little bit to
other technologies all right so the next
question is very interesting because
it's kind of similar to some of our
other questions but that's good because
it means a lot of you are kind of in the
same boat Biff is asking here which by
the way this fly icon actually got my
 dumb ass the first time I
thought but now I know it's our boy Biff
and you ain't gonna get me again but uh
you know it's it horrible that I watched
this video and code along and do you
understand why it works based on your
explanation but before watching your
video I'd have no idea where to even
begin like I had no idea - for loops
were needed or even one for that matter
I kind of feel like I'm Way behind for
how far along I in the program I am yes
and no yes if you spend 10 minutes on
he's talking about one of the algorithm
problems from free code camp yes if you
spent 10 minutes and you're like oh man
I don't know how to do this and then you
go and watch a video mmm and you know
you do it for one or two that's fine but
those videos are really to kind of guide
you into the technology basically guide
you and say look this is how I solve
this one problem maybe you weren't
completely sure how to use splice how to
use filter how to like think like a
program it's something I talked about a
lot in some of my earlier videos is you
need to learn how to think like a
program how to pry down a problem how to
solve a problem and that's why that's
one of the things I've always liked
about free code camp is it gives you
problems to solve and not just
instructions to follow and once you've
make that leap and bound you actually go
from someone studying code to writing
code and the
a big distinction about that where you
need to be able to break down a problem
now if you're struggling with that
that's perfectly normal perfectly
acceptable how you're how you're going
about to to solve that problem is very
important I've always tried and say
visualize the code you have your
whiteboards I'm ordering a brand new
whiteboard from gaining a whiteboard
from Costco because I'm going crazy not
having one trying to solve it I have a
little one off to the side where I'm
solving problems on it get yourself the
biggest whiteboard that you can afford
you know Costco going for 15 20 bucks
and throw it up on your wall and when
you're thinking what you have to do
start drawing you know visualize it
think and say okay I need to move this
letter to this over here if I need to
make this word look like this word what
has to happen for that to do sir arrow
circle things and then try doing a
little bit of research going through
documentation thinking what do I have
that can move things I have four loops I
have variables how can I use a variable
I start breaking it down and that if
you're doing that it will eventually all
click in and that's where the videos
will start to make sense because you
you've already got the juices flowing
and you watch the video and you're like
oh I was this close like I didn't
know what I needed to do but I needed
that I had the rough direction but if
you you know you're spending 10 minutes
and you're kind of like oh this I
don't know I'll do this and you don't
actually go and watch the video you know
go in do some research it's gonna be
very hard you're gonna watch a
three-minute video for something that
may have taken me 30 minutes and should
take maybe someone who's just starting
five hours and that's okay these these
algorithm problems are very realistic to
entry-level coding courses like entry
and intermediate coding courses in
college and they're gonna be hard for
people who are just starting out ice I'm
solved these in Java I've solved these
another language solve them Java Python
you know all these languages so it's
it's it's a little more familiar for me
but if you're new the first time it's
always gonna be rough because your brain
isn't quite at the point where you're
like how do I break a problem down quite
yet
so that that's really what you need to
start thing is how to do it and start
visualizing it that's really what helped
me out the most and that's why when
you're in any sort of developer location
any office anything like that you have
whiteboard walls you have entire rooms
that are whiteboards you got whiteboards
you got chalkboards there's a reason
they draw all that out cuz they're
solving complex things but they still
need to see it because you need to see
it to visualize it and once you can
visualize it you can solve the problem
so that's uh that's the end of this week
thank you to everybody who asks the
great questions in various videos if you
want your question answered by myself or
other devs in the future go ahead and
leave a comment below and if you have
anything contribute obviously I will do
my best to share it I try and find the
questions I think a lot of people will
relate to but as always guys special
thanks to you who are supporting me on
patreon I you know going the extra mile
don't forget to Like subscribe and share
and really ask your questions because I
want to be able to ask them in
interviews coming up with some
developers that are a lot more popular
than I am which I hope you guys enjoy
but that's always thanks and I'll see
you in the next video thanks for
watching the video special thanks to our
sponsor dev Mountain definitely check
them out at dev Mountain com if you're
looking for a boot camp that's in
front-end development iOS or UX go ahead
and give them a shot tuition includes
housing so you can get up and go and
fully immerse yourself in the program as
always thanks for watching I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
