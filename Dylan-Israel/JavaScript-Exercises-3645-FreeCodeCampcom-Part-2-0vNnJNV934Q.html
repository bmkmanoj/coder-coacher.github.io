apologize for the maybe different
demeanor it this break was actually a
full-day break instead of a 10-minute
break like anticipated so if I remember
correctly we were stuck on this is where
we're changing our code and we were
stuck on trying to generate two random
numbers that will work within our range
so in this case we use floor and we're
gonna generate a random and then times
it by whatever the max minus the min is
go that's how we're gonna get our range
plus 1 and then plus the min range so in
this case it would return null because
there's no max so we want to put in my
Max and my min and we want to change
this as well and we need to change this
so let's say our max is 10 our ministry
and our max is equal to 100 so we run
the test there we go so we generated 79
so we run again 22 to Shelby
all right let's see create a new if
statement and we also want to create an
else and my function sugar now heads or
tails so if I flip this equal equal to
oh wait no no my function should so yes
what's going on down here
result
so so if results is equal equal to so we
have our F and we have else should
return heads or tails
so if okay I'm sorry I'm returning tails
I'll return yes so my function sure turn
heads when flipped equal to zero or
tails when slip is equal to 1 so if flip
is equal to 1 I was like that was thrown
me off what do we put in our if
statement or change it turned heads cool
and that should be good to go
heads not defined and it's not a
variable that we're returning we're
returning a string so put quotation
marks that's right
cool so we flipped at zero and ever
heard turn heads
hey we flip the one that returned tails
sister texts with regular expressions
your egg Euler expression should find
two occurrences of the word and oh my
god I just did regular expressions
they're pretty awful to find the word in
test string so G is so bad with regular
expressions
so I believe at dot a and D this is
gonna look nice you so period it's gonna
look for the words of an so it's gonna
check words that are including the end
and to find the word in the test string
so I thought we were doing that
correctly use regular expressions to
find the word and in test stream
so the G means that we want to search an
entire string cool and the eye means
that doesn't matter we don't care it's
not case-sensitive and this says find
and siren test finds it twice so I'm
going to go to the Help section I think
we're doing everything correctly wasn't
help it was
and this was a sister text that's
regular expressions cool so let's copy
this oh wait I already pulled it up cool
let's see what this first guy says
and it looks like they want us to add a
plus on to here so what we're doing is
creating a string that we're Matt using
the match thing hey does it follow this
pattern and this drink the regular EDX
pattern but it looks like it looks like
there might
so too
hmm
it looks like we tried to fix this one
because the text is slightly different
hey guys after rereading the prompt this
dot that I thought I was supposed to
include in there I am not so when we run
it it's gonna look for an in this case
it returns two so sometimes he'll do
this I just I literally just did this
for a Java servlet last week where I had
to create a login form that went through
the one that checked all your used
regular expressions to check to make
sure that passwords were Inc put in
correctly that emails were in the
correct form and like you know they had
a at Ana calm so you know they these are
things you kinda will use what nine
times out of ten you'll just kind of
they're paying the ass you'll never
you'll just have to go online and see
how to do it well that's cool at least
if you understand how it works it's just
a matter of giving it to the next level
so in this case we want there are three
cats with four dogs do that we want to
four numbers how's this for us to patch
multiple multi digit numbers so in this
case it looks like we want to check four
numbers so we're gonna do
where's our forward slash forward slash
slash slash and in between here we're
going to put t + o and then we have one
too many
okay so /d what we're actually adding is
just slash D and we could take it and
leave the Plus on there plus filings to
match multi-digit numbers so the plus is
on there so we're not working with just
zero to nine team and I think is what
it's saying and then slash D numbers
select the number of numbers in the
stream line for the boss all right so D
is gonna select how many numbers are in
the string and if we look we have a
three and a four cool again regular
expressions are kind of like a pain but
there's there's entire sites where you
can go and they you know use a rage at
reg X builder and it's kind of kind of
cool stuff so in this case we're looking
for space so the way we do that is with
a slash s alright so we have a slash s
and that's a look for the empty spaces
and look look for all of them so she so
how many empty spaces over seven and you
can see that there's one two three four
five six seven so cool this is actually
a nice introduction to regular
expressions I don't think we did any and
code Academy but you're sad because it's
I mean granted it's a little more
complicated a little different this
should be everything should be included
and so say we want to count everything
that's not a empty space is just slash s
and so everything else it's going to be
49 in this case so there's probably if
we were to count the spaces and this
there's 56 characters
create a JavaScript slot machine all
right are we done I feel like that just
took a random jump
oh no we're still in it what's the last
one
someone should be a random number so
we're gonna set this equal to math dot
no its capital oh man thought are in
random and what do we want to put in
here uh for this we'll need four between
one and three represents of possible
values so
Jenny random numbers so in this case it
looks like they already had prepared our
math.floor so this will be between one
and three and then we'll do the same
thing for this as well and this as well
so in theory if it generates a 1 a 2 or
3 and there's three of them there should
be 27 combinations there's a - no it's 2
to the third power which is 8 there
should be eight combinations I think if
I remember that correctly
so what happens here so there's a lot
going on here obviously a lot of this is
all CSS they have some divs and we're
gonna be probably customizing this
already but uh you have a little bit
JavaScript running here and then this
looks like some sort of output and this
is making sure that they're not null and
then we generate something all we really
did here was generate numbers between a
1 a 2 and 3 so this generates a
percentage this we're gonna times it by
3 minus 1 because we want to go between
1 and 3 so our max is 3 or minus 1 plus
1 and then we add one more here I don't
there's probably a simpler way to do
this but this is what it needs to do so
it just looks a little redundant because
we have a minus 1 plus 1 when you could
just do 3 but it only it's only working
because we're only working with 3 inputs
so if all three of our random numbers
are the same we should return that
number otherwise we should turn at all
all right so we want to create an if
statement here so what's basically going
on is we want to return null if all the
slots are not equal to 1 2 or 3 so all
we have to do is compare the three
numbers so we'll say slot 1 if slot 1 is
not equal to slot 2 or slot 2 it's not
equal to slot slot 3 do some stuff so if
that's so if so slot 192 the slot to
check all right its slot 2 not equal to
slot 3 check so we're it's we're
checking both of them so we don't need
to make it any more complicated than
that we can just check the middle one to
see if the outsides are not equal so
only 2 and if either one of those are
not we want to return null so they're
all not equal to 1 return null so
oh and make sure we wanted to do not
equals there we go not a winner winner
winner chicken dinner
yeah so we're checking make sure they're
not equals I could make sure you do that
correctly as well all right you should
be displaying the result of the salaat
numbers in the corresponding slots cool
so you're writing in our code here and
so we want to reuse in jQuery okay cool
so we're gonna use jQuery and this is
already wrapped in a script so we should
be okay I believe where's our document
already all right so in this case this
is using the on click function so that
it went on click it does that's what's
going on here run slots in our case we
want to select a so what do we let's
find our elements so we have saw one saw
two three
let's go say I think we need to map it
to one of these can we see what the name
of this is
okay I guess it's just difÃ­cil answer
don't slots one okay that's how they do
it here okay so we want to select the
HTML variable and the way they give us
an example here we want to select the
dot slot class so you can see right here
these are all dots slot and we're
actually gonna select a certain one
we're gonna select the first one what
you'll do with that and then the dot
HTML we want to put HTML two and which
what do we want but then I'll put salt
one so now when we if we did that
correctly looks like we didn't do that
correctly dot slot
a little bit of research on the form I
realize what my mistake was and I am
kind of lost so I apologize I want
people to explain this as well so the
first thing we did wrong was we needed
to do quotations in here and a simple
mistake next we'd obviously need changes
but we knew that but for whatever reason
when we use dot text here even though it
doesn't mention anything like that it
will change that's what we need to get
the first value in there's it's always
understanding it from the gentleman's
description so this is the working code
that will work for this but to work over
it we're grabbing the first slot which
is this box right here and then we are
inserting our random number right here
which is a 1 a 2 or a 3 and then we're
doing it again for the where in it so
when we run it you see 2 3 3 all you
also see in the bottom a little bit
confusing because I'm not really quite
sure why we use needed to use text but
I'm just looking for a min and that was
the solution that I found so use the
provided code three times one for each
slot okay so let's do the first thing I
do and you should have dot slot at least
you should have use so what happens when
we run there's nothing currently alright
so let's try changing this to slot 2-1
and we'll do a slot 3-1
and right here we need to use slot
oh okay I see what's going on here
so we these are actually all generating
images to the same thing so let's go one
on one and then we'll do only time all
right
it took me a second I understand what
the code was doing but once you run it's
very intuitive so we're essentially
generating three random images except
now we're generating them all at the
same time it said not randomly although
they didn't ask us to do it randomly you
should have it use - there we go
I think it we just have too much going
on here so let's go ahead and control
that out
Oh your run it and it'll work so what's
happening here is now they're just
getting one of the random images we
didn't need to create as many as I did
there oh there's our cherry one cool
is that it I think we're done let me sit
here yeah we just finished basic
JavaScript so up next guys we are in the
last hour before we get into the basic
algorithms scripting and this stuff
right here this is going to be the stuff
that is going to be the beginning of the
challenging and full-on stuff like we
can you know if you wanted to sit down
I'll probably knock this out today so
anyhow that was JavaScript we stumbled a
little bit on last parts but that's okay
you know we're still learning and let's
learn together so you know thanks for
