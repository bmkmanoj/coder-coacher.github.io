and gentlemen it's always strange when
my phone notifies me that I am live
it's like Dillon you're coding Taurus
360 is live fun stuff though so give me
one second to get going here guys
look we'll do what it do babe
people say oh the chat oh alright so uh
how's everybody doing today
we got a lot of cool stuff going on in
my life but that's not what we're here
to talk about here we give it all right
Chazz up now I feel like we're
officially live cuz this is all about
you guys when I do these these every
1000 subscriber live streams so if
you're new to my channel welcome every
thousand subscribers I do a AMA where I
answer questions right so one of my
things was that I think is really
helpful as having a mentor having
somebody where you could bounce
questions off of them and you can you
know get responses for those things that
are are bothering you in life and that
are in the back your mind and you know
as in let's build that app hey homie
what's going on man is that build that
app mister build your app mister steal
yo girl no uh-uh
I'm a fan by the way but uh
so I like to every thousand subscribers
first off start off by saying thank you
for deciding to support the channel by
subscribing and watching whatever videos
I put out there and supporting me some
of you even go with the extra mile and
support me on patreon and that's that's
dope shout out to my patreon page and
the patrons the other some of you you
know subscribe and you watch one video
here that's also cool man I appreciate
it all you know my goal with YouTube
I've accomplished the first goal of
becoming a developer and it's helped me
get to where I am and now I want to to
give back in any way that I can so a lot
of times so for all these thousand
subscribers I do a livestream like this
where essentially ask me whatever you
want and I'll give you my opinion about
it and we can continue up and I leave
them up I tend to do a lot of live
streams for it's just me working and you
know maybe doing some github doing some
markdown so I was doing this week just
kind of doing that basic stuff equally
is important right good I have a nice
github for the portfolio and stuff like
that but I always struggled with having
somebody to bounce those questions off
of have having somebody where I could
say a what what am I doing wrong how can
I improve this is the route I'm taking
is this a current route kind of similar
to my most recent video in which the
videos called invest in yourself and a
good portion of that video is talking
about basically just pulling the trigger
as I put it and taking those doubts of
failure the doubts of all the stress
that goes along with trying in and
potentially failing and saying you know
what I would rather fail learn in the
process I go forward and I think I think
part of these every thousand life years
plays to that every thousand subscriber
live streams play to that fact so that I
can help anybody that wants to be helped
and you know I'm not the end-all be-all
but I would like to anything I feel like
and provide value for I do so with that
being said thank you for coming here
today
let's talk about a few things so what's
going on in my life lately with software
until we get some questions in here well
I'm working so that's good that's that's
good working on a lot of cool projects
on a smaller team it's always pretty
interesting because when you're not
working at like a massive sort of
multinational corporation you're working
on you know fairly decent-sized business
but a you know a 200 employee business
for instance you get to and you're on a
team of about three people you get to
have a lot more control in how things
are designed and developed then you
might in a 50 person development team
for instance so that's been a great
learning experience it's also think that
I've kind of really enjoyed it I talked
a little bit about this when I was
interviewed on engineered truths Channel
about the realities first expectations
of a full-stack developer and I talked a
lot I we we talk a lot about about three
or four things I thought were really
important and minor things that if
you're not aware of to be aware of so I
encourage you to check that out how am i
doing today Michael I'm doing good man
um you know we're almost at 23 I did
this a little bit earlier today because
I'm busy tomorrow and that would be
probably when we hit 23,000 so I'm great
man I'm I'm happy life is good I got my
three cats that decide that even though
we have three bedrooms that they're all
going to going to going to be in my
office most of the time all right so
like if you look over here you can see
see his little head he's on the cat
tower over there usually there's one
more on there and another on the futon
but I'm great man I I I'm a happy person
I'm just trying to grind it out like
everybody else and that's the thing
about about it is just keep crying a lot
of people unfortunately give up not
necessarily a software and we're so
talking about in life
of people they are afraid and they never
try and I think what I want to instill
on people more than anything else and
I'm not really one of those people that
think that you can necessarily find
motivation I think people have
motivation I think people just don't try
anymore so I encourage you to try and
whatever it is that you're doing stop
thinking about it
and just try the next day and try to get
better and try to move forward in you
know we're all much like coding just
much like YouTube and coding we all
start with zero knowledge and zero
subscribers and if you never start a
YouTube channel or you never start to
learn to code or you never start to try
and get better and learn that new
framework learn that that new hot
library learn that new language whatever
it is you'll never get to where you need
to be and a lot of people are scared man
would you recommend any books and guides
us as a companion to learning Goucher
this may surprise you but I have read
about two books ever on JavaScript I've
read a lot of like 50 the 100 page
papers that my current employer gave me
when I when I got there when I arrived
on day one my boss handed me a zip drive
with about 1500 150 page textbook slash
papers I would call them so I've read
I've read through a lot of those I am a
big believer of video education like
internship in terms of learning
JavaScript the only books that I've
officially read on that is you don't
know Jay s and it's very good serious
any programming related area what I like
to dabble in that's out of my comfort
area I'm always down to dabble out of my
comfort area especially if somebody is
willing to pay me to dabble out of my
comfort area that's the thing is at some
point you're always dabbling out of your
comfort area if you're a developer right
because you have you take what you're
basic
set of knowing how to be a developer and
then as web development is rap which is
rapidly changing you then have to pick
up other things all right so I'll give
you a perfect example something I
started at
okay let's just make a little bit
markdown now now I'm having videos being
embedded and things like that and and
that's that's mostly but if there was
something that I would like to dabble in
I'm actually kind of doing it I I I mean
I want to dabble and react and react
native specifically and I start the
react nanodegree course on Monday right
so I I talked about I think if the last
the last one of these lasts at the 22 K
subscriber AMA I talked about how I want
to learn react and I'm going to and so
I've I'm officially enrolled I paid for
the course it's they're on sale right
now if you're looking to get into a nano
degree programs $200 off the flat rate
of 500 and then the ones that are
month-to-month with job guarantees the
first two months are half off so but I
would so that's kind of what I'm
interested specifically react native the
idea of being able to write a web
application and compile it down into an
iOS or Android app seems pretty pretty
exciting so I start on Monday on that so
that's my that's my next sort of comfort
zone area the weekend before I started
studying angular 4 so I am always
dabbling in these things that are out of
my my my comfort area but that that
would be kind of what's on my mind right
now as well as just being a more mean
and merged stack of folk focused sort of
job
I'm studying Java come to September's
Java Dino Java is not dying there's just
a lot more competition in Java even
though there's a lot of jobs there's a
lot of high paying jobs in Java so you
just have to be a good developer code
News says if one of the coding base
reach out to you because of your video
and the thought you was cute what would
you and which one would you want it to
be uh I don't know I thought they were
all kind of cute but I am I am a taken
man so they're gonna have to fight the
girlfriend so the girlfriend of six
so I got me a ride-or-die ain't going
anywhere anytime soon sorry well they'll
have to get something that they're not
very familiar with which I would imagine
is rejection but uh have you given web
development when you live in a small non
tech city I can't move well you probably
start your own projects and you probably
start working for yourself if it's
freelancing although I mean again it's
always best if you can move because
three out of four developers are willing
to relocate for a job and so you're
putting yourself in a category that not
only are you competing locally like
you're staying in a region so there's
limited amount of jobs but you're also
competing but with people who are with
people who are applying in to your
location and so you're putting yourself
at a major disadvantage but I mean I
don't know what your personal situation
is but if you can figure out a way to to
maybe um maybe go from there you might
you know and sometimes you may just have
to take those those grinder out roles
like when I started I was getting $12 an
hour to do an internship that was two
hours away and that's two hours each way
and I had to get there at 6 a.m. so I
was getting up at 3 a.m. that was
driving getting there around 5:30 or 6
a.m. by the time I got started and then
I was getting off at like 5:00 p.m. and
getting home by 7:00 p.m. ish sometimes
later because of traffic right so you
may have to do something like that until
you get some some resume experience
you're learning for JavaScript don't
freak out camp can't understand the
basics but you have any tips on how to
get better understanding of it I think
it's a lot of trial and error I commit
myself to watching one tutorial on
YouTube a day so if you can start doing
something like that where you watch a 20
minute tutorial on something in tech and
then you are also you also doing you
know doing the simple stuff doing now
solving algorithms building projects
I think projects are really key for a
lot of people and getting started to
learn about web development and how to
get to that next level good buddy okay
oh yes he doesn't like being on camera
so strike at my buddy okay but you know
projects are a great way of going it
accomplishes a couple things you
actually get a real sense of what it is
that you're building something from
scratch
algorithms are kind of like hey solve
one use case most of the time was it
aiming a cat so the the black one you
just saw his name is Achilles the the
one I showed you is on the it's kind of
a tannish striped cat his name is Tito
and then we have an orange and white cat
whose name is Milo so or as I like to
call him HTML CSS and JavaScript know if
I get a job in web development be
wealthy enough to have a dope cat like
that amen
I hope so I hope you can so I've had my
cats even one if I super broke so I
would I would hold off so that's most of
us are right I'm not so mad so bad
anymore I'm probably I'm probably more
of a extrovert than the introvert I
guess at this point in my life
part of that is YouTube and talking and
and all that sort of stuff and just
having these
you know just just be more comfortable
in your own skin as you become older and
things like that and not really worried
about how people perceive you but uh
what I was I would if I I don't know how
I started talking about that well let's
try and say is if you can hold off on
getting a cat or a pet until you are a
professional
I would advise it because you know
they're expensive I'm I probably spend a
hundred to two hundred dollars a month
on my cats and it uh but also I don't
have any children either so like a lot
of people I have the same mentality for
sure for children as well so you
shouldn't have them until you can afford
to have them but uh same thing with cats
but with that being said okay I remember
where the correlation was i-i-i have
always been I've always had cats like as
a child I had my cat baby who lived to
be about 19 and it was it I was always a
much more shy and introverted kid at
time sitting how and like part of having
a cat I feel like I feel like a lot of
people are introverts have cats because
you talk to them that guy talk back but
spend time with you they're kind of you
can kind of like you I don't know like I
talked to my cat's all the time maybe
I'm crazy but uh you know it is Knut
says I have you on my features channel
yeah and traversée our go-to tutorial
guys highly recommend you Thank You Man
I'm hoping to put out some as I've
become a better developer I am hoping to
put out maybe more traversée media long
tutorials over time we will see though
I've been kind of sticking with what
I've been doing for a while and it's
kind of a time thing those those
hour-long tutorials are really really a
time commitment so we'll see what I'd
like to do I've been thinking more so
than that is I've been thinking about
starting a podcast
and having it on YouTube but I'm also
having it on like iTunes and wherever
everybody else does podcast so we'll see
if that happens but that would be great
that might be the next big thing for the
channel Michael did you get some sleep
have I read The Iliad or did you just
name the I ever de Leon back in college
in a Wednesday was a English literature
class that's been a while but uh no I I
just like the name of Keeley's you know
what man naming your animals and naming
your children I don't know about I can't
really speak to children but the closest
thing I have to children are mine my
cats right so in that case that's why I
associate them well it's whether that's
correct or incorrect but naming your
pets is kind of a strange thing because
they don't have any say in it and I
don't know it like what's a good name
for a cat at the end of the day right so
I don't know like like we Tito Tito we
tried to name him so when you go and we
get all our we've gotten all our pets
from the pound and stuff like that and
no kill shelter Gerson I and one of the
things that's you know what one thing
that happens when you get a cat from
found is they go and they have a name
for him typically on a piece of paper
and so his name was Tito and we tried to
come up with a better name we just
settled on Tito so to those his name huh
buddy huh remember remember when we got
you from that nasty pound okay
Oh see I oh let go
oh this is my buddy right hey um what
skill should have in order to get a
junior front-end developer role or
internship you got be hungry man you got
to be willing to learn you got to be
able to show that you're passionate I
think communication plays more of a deal
than skills I mean obviously you're
gonna have to have some skills but
you're gonna also have to show that
you're want to be that and that you're
say hi buddy say hi say hi
but uh yeah man I I think that's
probably more important than even the
skills but if I were to give you a front
if we're just talking about internships
at front-end roles you're probably gonna
have to have HTML CSS CSS JavaScript
maybe a little bit jQuery a little bit
of angular a little bit of react for a
front-end role get github maybe some
angular material or bootstrap as well
you know it just depends but that would
be kind of what I would say is the
basics five part portfolio series helped
I'm glad man
people have been yelling at me to go
back and make a responsive one make the
part six responsive I'll probably go
around doing that um all right I'll show
you guys all three cats now so
everyone's here currently oh okay so
this is our eldest this is this is mr.
Milo just Milo I'm all out of cats man I
can't pull any more cats out for you
guys but but uh this is Milo he's big
man I don't know I don't know if you can
really tell let me see if I step back
you can kind of see how big E is all
right you have officially seen all the
cats that's a secret to being a good
developer guys cats the more cats you
have obviously the more skilled you are
everybody knows this died fine
livestreams help your channel grow uh I
don't know
so ones like this not really I mean I
think they're appreciated and I think
they provide values that's why I do them
you don't make any money on live streams
less you get donations and you know with
15 20 30 people I think that the max
I've got enough to is 50 people watching
I rarely ever get any like fan funding
or anything like that so you don't make
money
in terms of being able to connect with
your audience I think it is a valuable
thing and I think you probably get more
long-term subscribers than not when you
do that because you do create these
personal connections and you do get to
talk with people who you know like your
content and they like you it
inadvertently so I think they do
probably help but not you're not gonna
like see it in terms of views and ad
revenue and things like that the more
practical standpoint if I finished reco
camp would that be enough for a start I
got my developer job for finished it so
I imagine it would be as long as you
again go back to good communication
skills learning additional skills on the
side and being able to to show that
you're eager man a lot of a lot of
employers when they take on they take on
this sort of they take on a person for a
role for an internship or Thank You
Ricky for the $1 yes appreciate it is
appreciated shout out to Ricky Garcia
which also has a YouTube channel check
them out but bought himself a $1 shout
out but but what I'm trying to say is is
you have to have skills but when that
when when they're looking to hire you
for a junior role a lot of times they
are saying they they're looking to do a
long term thing right and they're trying
to find out is this someone that we can
make part of the team and it's just
somebody we want to work with and so you
might get hired over someone who's a
little bit more qualified in reality
because they would rather work with you
it's kind of just basic communication
and basic human interaction things like
that and they want somebody who wants to
be there and who's eager man so that
would that would be my suggestion
I also think that's part of the reason
that I'm kind of a tractive candidate at
times for
for companies because I don't see how
you could make the argument that that's
not me right so not only do I have a a
coding channel devoted to software that
I'm a regular uploader on and I'm
learning all the time right and it can
be shown in a video format and like
github and all that but also but also I
have a Facebook group a coding group I
volunteered you know with code.org I've
I've volunteered other organizations as
well I like it's very easy to make the
argument because this is who I am that I
enjoy software I'm constantly learning
and I'm also you know going to
hackathons I'm going to meetups and
things like that so those are the types
of things that you can do for for no
money in just the time effort and energy
to invest in yourself and when the
employers see somebody bettering
themselves and bettering themselves as a
developer on top of that and interested
in software I'm passionate about those
are the type of people they want to
bring on for internships and they want
to bring them in to be a junior
developer and work them up so what are
some resources that are similar to
treehouse team treehouse but are free I
mean team treehouse MIDI owes I guess
you would have to do YouTube if you want
free in terms of free like coding
challenges there's code CAD amia free
code camp code noob donates $2 everybody
wants to shout out check out code noob
who zombies is uh is a coding channel
journey right now getting started from
from noob to boss ass bitch coder right
isn't that the goal to be a boss ass
bitch or coding god as we say here so
code new rather good for you man
you'll be on my level one they it's
always stranger people say that to me
because I don't know what that means you
know like I'm just a dude that's trying
to get better and like I don't even feel
all that great sometimes right so um I
just you know I'm just working hard man
let's step forward
well I'm in the Tampa area currently I'm
originally from Los Angeles but I've
gone to meet up some in both areas
excuse me yes I gotta clear my I
apologize guys I'm battling a little bit
of a little bit of a sinus and I'm
getting over a cold still so I apologize
for that I don't want say I undervalue
myself but it's it's software it's an
interesting thing because you really
never know how good you are compared to
other people because you can only
compare yourself with the developers you
know most of developers I know are
senior developers so it's like you look
at them and you're like yo man I can't I
don't know so well yeah meetups are a
great thing for you guys to do as well
if you aren't taking advantage of that
you're doing yourself a huge disservice
as well as hackathons
yeah I don't know if it's impostor
syndrome like I know I felt that in the
past but I think it's just uh like it we
could here's the thing man it's like
when you come from like like for me
right we've talked about this before
like we're three years ago I started I
got my first internship before that I
was a part-time student and I was
delivering pizzas at Domino's so you go
from something like that to being a paid
professional and valuing your job
valuing the the money because you've
been in the spot where you haven't had
that before and it's hard to it's hard
to mentally wrap yourself around where
they're gonna pay me how much like you
know really it's it's kind of a crazy
thing and you want to make sure you you
don't you have to kind of realize like
you know what I'm actually I'm actually
worth this and so I think that's where
it comes down it's just kind of
realizing that and I think as a junior
developer you kind of are as an
entry-level developer I should say it
takes you a second right so but I think
that's easily overcome overcame rather
if you are studying regularly and you
are learning everything you need to
learn I really do you might take down
those little three right there yes they
might be looking better if I took those
street lists out please reply to my
emails I don't have any emails man so if
you send me an email
I'll most likely reply to it our flight
of the comments on the weekends as well
but
yeah yeah so it's the massive echo yeah
you know what my whole office is kind of
kind of strange because this futons
messing up my green screen effect and
the wall now because I had to rearrange
the whole things because I got the the
HTC vive so uh Shoob ham baja why don't
you just send me a follow-up email man I
got my aunt Mel up right now I'll look
at it I'll respond visually or verbally
if if it's something that's appropriate
I think other people can take value
value from so I think it also the whole
imposter syndrome comes down to being
okay not being in your comfort zone as a
developer and just accepting the fact
that you shouldn't really have one
because I the greatest part about being
a developer in my part other than other
than you know the the practical stuff of
of being able to being able to provide
for yourself and your family and have
things like health insurance and PTO and
and you know be able to you know invest
and save for retirement and things like
that like the but in terms of being a
developer I really like the fact that
I'm always trying new stuff like I'm not
going into work and I'm not doing the
same tasks every day I'm building new
things I'm learning new languages I'm
getting more comfortable with frameworks
that's the stuff I like do you recommend
treehouse for the full stack path I have
not
I tried treehouse I didn't really like
it but I can't say that they got a lot
of content on there so I can't imagine
that it's too bad but I don't know
specifically about their full stack path
might you think about having to fight
with us just subscribers on code Feist
those code fights are so long
I don't know anything about video
compression Xiu Qi about Raja sorry man
but I don't know the co fights fights
are so long
maybe I'll maybe I'll put a tournament
together one day and I'll do like an
announcement video and we'll get we'll
get some stuff going on there I'm almost
up to the next level on code fight so
I'm kind of motivated to keep pushing
through but I I just recorded like 60
videos on it so I'm kind of burnt out on
code fights for a bit but all that
stuff's coming out I spent the last two
days doing markdown files for all of
them putting the instructions how long
our code fights so won't dependence the
doc keeps talking about Brandon are the
where you battle each other and it's
essentially you get like three mini
algorithms to solve against each other
how did I do in discrete mathematics I
hated discrete mathematics also our
teacher was garbage and I would I'd be
happy to tell him to his face such
things my but I got like us I passed it
I got a/c it was awful though it was
absolutely awful
now get back to work Annie have a good
one man thank you for this for it
Collins Collins wants to on me in
code fights that's what I can't do it
man Andy I look man I can't have all you
subs all the other plebs out here
talking after talking about they
 on on Dylan and code fights so
I'm just gonna pretend like I'm too good
for all y'all something I had to learn I
never expected to learn in my career oh
let's see
I suppose that I suppose a a PHP
framework would be a technical thing I
never expected to learn but uh I took my
job here not knowing what the backend
was because they were still being
developed and they were still hiring the
senior dev the senior developer actually
got hired a week before I did so I took
that knowing that that would be
something that would be up in the air
with that being said in terms of a in
terms of a a less technical thing I
suppose that not every software company
is going to be ran perfectly or
commenced Lee that's something I've
learned in the process over the years
some will be ran well some will be just
ran and some will be ran for Lee and
that it was surprising to me
am i active on Twitter Facebook what's
your main source make source of on subs
is just search you guys search for
things on YouTube and then they find the
videos that's my main source of subs I
do have a Twitter I tweet out whenever a
video goes out our
banda tweets if I don't actually tweet
anything my facebook I have the Facebook
group as well so that's that's one way
co tech and caffeine I use that as a way
to share resources maybe some things
that I don't have the maybe that don't
deserve a video or they can't be filled
into video I share that there as well as
I share my videos on there on occasion
that relate like not specific ones like
you know solve this algorithm but uh
maybe like how to invest in yourself you
know the most recent video I shared
what's your engagement level slash
percent on your channel I'm not quite
sure I'd have to look that up do I hate
Java I would say that if it was between
love and hate it might go to the hate
Java was what I did my coursework in and
I never was a fan of it I really liked
the web development language is much
better
it could just bend the way that it was
taught things like that but it's a it
has a lot of value I just I don't know I
like JavaScript um and I feel about
futures
I haven't dived into it yet but I know a
lot of very reputable people who really
love it program with Eric being one of
them and you know the guy loves it he's
writing a book on it it's got masters in
CS as well so if he says it's a good
thing I tend to believe him
but with that being said I haven't had a
chance to touch it on a practical
standpoint there's not jobs really in it
yet so if you're choosing between
angular reactor view you probably should
do angular interact angular or react or
all three or at least one angular one or
react and then UJS because there are
view jeaious things that are saying
preferred I don't necessarily see view
j/s jobs not yet but so from fractals
the standpoint that would be what I
would say about that
apart from JavaScript being your primary
language what is another language you
like or desire desire that's a strong
word
the only thing I desire is my baby uh uh
let's see um I don't know man I i
JavaScript so crazy JavaScript so crazy
because it's always changing right so
you just get counter with es5 now you're
getting comfortable with es6 you just
get comfortable with es6 now you're
getting comfortable typescript by the
time we do but by the time you're
comfortable with typescript who knows
what's gonna be out right so it it's
always interesting on that now
one language I would learn is probably
Python Python
I've played around in Python a bit I had
some coursework in Python I built a game
or two back in the day in the PI game
library
I liked it Python I thought it's
actually the I think one of my number
one watched videos on coke atom II that
that course so I think a lot of people
learning Python and pythons on its way
up so that would be one one area in
which I'd be interested in anything at
that problem you do this assets does
adsense revenue depend on youtubers
locations or viewer location adsense
revenue depends on watch time it depends
on views it depends on click-through
rate but it also depends on the type of
content right so I believe I fall into
an education content space which I have
a higher CPM which if you're not
familiar with YouTube what CPM is it's
basically how much money you get per
thousand views so I'll get something
around I I get around 110 225,000 views
a month and and I'll take home around
350 which is a lot if you compare about
it so if you say about for easy math
let's just say three hundred and a
hundred thousand I'm getting about three
dollars in my pocket for every thousand
ten thousand views so and mind you
Google's taken half of that so I'm
actually getting closer six some people
can get as lowest one some people get as
high as
right and it just varies depending on
the content and engagement close the ads
right how do you feel about PHP a lot of
people talk mad about it I work in
PHP at work it's interesting mainly
because I unfortunately had to be thrown
into an environment in which I didn't
necessarily I don't even say no PHP even
though I write PHP pretty frequently and
I work with M PHP the main problem with
it is when you start out with a
framework when you're learning a
language you tend to be more comfortable
on the language so there's a lot of
things of PHP that afraid that the
cakephp framework does for you that you
might have to pick up on your own but I
I don't know I've used things like node
and so if you were to compare PHP M is
equal to node Express and MongoDB and
Mongoose that second category the
traditional mean stack can be deployed
easier it's a lot easier to get started
I really like it a lot better that be
what I would say do you still build
games with Python or an engine like
unity no no no I did the PI game library
for some coursework and I started
another one but it's it's a long process
I decided not to go down the Python
route
so
I think there might just be a
traditional learning curve with PHP a
lot of a lot of projects to use tree
tree I'm gonna sit down as I let stand
on this whole time
looks like it
what youtubers i watch i watch quite a
few coding channels chris hawks is one
traversée media derrick honest when I
need this tutorial or two although a lot
of stuff I'm looking up now Derrick
doesn't do tutorials long that's my code
nice I going I've abandoned that project
for now Brandon he's taking away from
like me learning and bettering my skill
set and my careers kind of the main
focus of my life right now and so I
decided to kind of abandon that probably
something I'll do in the future I just
didn't want to push out something
half-assed and feel like I was just
trying to make a money grab um what do
you think about lecture I've had a
chance to work with it yet what was your
primary primary motive primal motive I
think you mean primary what was their
primary motive to upload videos on
YouTube well I've talked about this in
the past David when I first started it
was a combination of just trying to get
better as a developer and and maybe
create a video portfolio in the process
for for potential hiring companies that
was really it and now that here we are
two and a half two years three months
later it's become a lot more than that
and I have it's it's a little bit of a
different thing now Chris right now it's
a right now it's a a yes it's all about
all those things and it's a bit it's a
big portfolio item for me but I also am
enjoying it I'm making a little bit of
money not a lot very little and
hopefully that will grow over time maybe
one day I'll be doing this full-time
see a path to that anytime soon like in
the next five years at least but I don't
know man it's just such an integral part
of my life now that I don't know what I
would do with that I would have so much
free time I guess I would do the same
stuff I do now Cody and just would make
videos about it but part of making the
videos helps me learn helps me helps me
reinforce it's kind of like I don't know
if you guys know this but I talked to
myself in the mirror at times because I
want to when I when I am wavering when
I'm wavering I look at myself in the
mirror and I've had these moments where
it's on the negative end where I look at
myself in the mirror and I'm disgusted
with myself and I feel bad so I look at
myself in the mirror and I say what are
what is the goal for today was the goal
for tomorrow and then whatever I need to
do that day I say I am going to do this
today so sometimes I have to do that to
kind of get keep going on what I wanted
to but I know I brought that up it's
gonna make me sound crazy but I I
mentally I vertically say these things
so that I am prepared to do them and
YouTube's kind of the same thing where I
do them and then I make a video about
them and learn it twice or I reinforce
it rather so a simple program I like
simple programmers content I don't watch
every one of his videos because he puts
up two videos a day and it's hard to
hard to keep up with him but I would say
that in terms of content I think most of
the time he puts out a good content for
most people I would say some of his
videos are very detailed and some are
sort of general stuff but some people
need that general stuff and it's kind of
astounding at times when you think about
it right
should you extend your graduation day by
semester and resume - gekks or
internship probably not probably just
graduate and start working that would be
my advice big code what's going on man
all these cats are laid out man like
it's a it's about 10:30 and they've been
they've been fed and now they're just
all laid out little fat cats on the cat
they're all sleeping in here there's
three bedrooms a living room and a
dining room and they all just come to
hang out with me man I think it means
something their favorite and my bowling
one is coffee never ends I don't drink
coffee so that's why I said the only
time I get a coffee is April listen to
this you guys wanna hear some some bulk
April says a baby why don't I take you
out to breakfast this morning right so I
say yeah cool you know cuz she knows I'm
trying to save money and stuff like that
and she wants so you know we switch off
on occasion I said hell yeah let's go to
breakfast so we go we have this nice
breakfast and then she goes oh baby I
forgot my wallet I was like convenient
cut vignette how that happens but uh
yeah so this is my coffee for breakfast
from two hours ago I don't I only drink
coffee when we go out I rarely drink it
so that's why I'm sipping on it cuz
have I ever encountered discrimination
issues when looking for a job not that
I'm aware of
I do find it kind of weird that they ask
your age and the night your age your
ethnicity on a on a resume I don't think
that's who's April April is my
girlfriend and I'll be throwing around
that wife word nonchalantly man where I
come from us finding words when we start
saying something so but I would say that
for the most part when dealing with
larger companies they will actually take
off your name and delete your image if
you have one on your resume when going
through recruiters at least so that
there aren't any biases and you're there
just looking at your resume and the type
of candidate that they are at which i
think is probably a pretty fair way of
doing it I don't know I I tend to
believe people just want qualified
candidates and and I mean for the most
part I mean if we're gonna be very
honest about it as a as a Caucasian male
if anyone's not going to get
discriminated in as a group it's
probably going to be that that category
but I've never experienced any
discrimination about that although I
recently unsubscribed from a from a
coding YouTube channel I'm not gonna say
any names but I was so offended that he
had mentioned that when he goes and he's
looking for potential employees that he
will actually take the white applicants
and he will look at them last he will
order his he will order the applicants
and he will take the white male and
female applicants and he will put it on
the bottom of the stack and if you can't
find a candidate that he likes in the
top
stack that doesn't fit the white male or
white female and by the way then he puts
a white female on top of the white male
is you what might imagine if you're
doing this and then you will actually go
through that whenever he's looking for
Canada's first which to me is
discrimination just going in a very
unfamiliar direction but I I just
unsubscribe from that when I heard that
cuz that I think that's too much man um
I yeah I don't know I I heard something
like that and then I got me thinking
like I wonder man
I don't I don't know I think that guys
just caught up a little bit too much so
that was the only time that was uh that
was about a video that's supposed to
about a month ago and that was the one
time I started questioning because you
do have the option of you know they give
on your resume you do have it on the on
the application typically have an option
to decline to answer your ethnicity and
decline to answer if you're disabled I
never I felt the need to do that because
I I don't I don't think it should matter
and I think 99% of the time it doesn't
unless you run into a guy like that but
the reason why I haven't changed my
practices of answering that question is
if that is the case I don't think I
really would want to work with somebody
like that and so if he wants to
discriminate against me I don't want to
work with the guy in India right so that
would be that the closest comes
discrimination they actually seem like
wow people actually do that but uh I I
don't want to so I'm not I'm not trying
to start any drama guys I I can
appreciate that
you want to not be supportive of that
that guy but I don't want that is the
guy why yeah man he looks like you can
be my cousin
so it's yeah not the show so with that
being said guys I always shared that
story because there's some context of
things um 99.99% of employers I don't
think any of us have anything to worry
about
I think it's skill-based this experience
based and I think the hard part is just
getting a little bit of experience on
the resume and learning the skills in
your off time that's really it
but um yeah definitely I definitely
would say they probably I definitely
would say you probably does fall into
the social justice warrior group yeah
drama alert on the Kodi of a Cody tell
all these Kodi channels are our be fit
with each other combined they have 32
thousand subscribers yeah like people
are writing angry algorithms left or
right you were not accepted as a student
in the meetup because I was white and
straight and the reason was if they want
to prioritize underrepresented people uh
yeah I mean that was I mean that's the
thing I mean there's I mean here's
here's here's a perfect situation I
wanted to join the engineering Club at
Cal State Los Angeles but unfortunately
it's all there's something innately on
supporting and so so like let's take
let's take a a college group cuz it's a
pretty pretty standard situation so the
bulk of Cal State Los Angeles is
Hispanic I believe it was something like
fifty five percent of the population
like seventeen percent ization and
basically the rest is white so it's like
those Hispanic white Asian in terms of
percentage of students now there are
basically two engineering clubs and both
of them are the Hispanic
Engineering clubs or whatever so
technically you can you can go and be
members of the the the Hispanic and the
african-american clubs on campus but
there is something kind of uninviting
about it right so instead of just being
a engineering club or a computer science
club or something like that when you
start attaching races and adjectives for
that matter it kind of it made me feel
uncomfortable especially because I
didn't know anybody as part of the clubs
but that was that was the only time I
probably didn't feel welcome in in a
situation or I felt maybe I might be
getting discriminated against but for
the most part I don't think that's a me
that's not something I consider my daily
life I suppose
oh thank you for the congratulations
yeah a tldr racism of every kind
right there we go I like your channel
what do you used to record your screen
well right now we're using Google
Hangouts
I used to the Google hangout events
and and in terms of what I record my
videos it's just OBS open broadcast
software I'm almost done with this
coffee guys so my cats like to wake me
up if I'm not up by 6:00 I'm typically
up by 6:00 except on the weekends I
might sleep in til about 6:45 so if I'm
not out of bed by 6:15 to feed them
I have April and I have like three cats
like crawling over us so why we're
trying to sleep so when they sleep
during the day I wake them up I give
them like a little nudge wake up wake up
you wake up yeah you ain't go to sleep
what percent of my net income goes to
rent are we are you counting utilities
if you're counting just rent and I mind
you April and I split our rent a prom I
split our rent right so 5050 we flip we
split renting utilities and because I
make more money I'll typically pay for a
couple other things when we go out and
stuff like that
so and if we I'm gonna I'm gonna add
this I'm going to add YouTube money in
which is around 8,000 to 9,000 dollars a
year in total but I'm going to I'm gonna
just up it to about 1000 the calculator
uh actually I'll say I'll say $500 a
month that'll be easy
$500 a month plus my take-home I'm doing
take-home salary not not uh gross it was
going with this calculator
I spend about 10 percent of my income on
rent just right not counting utilities
and that's after I have my my taxable
income yeah I spend about 10 percent uh
but that's just me that that's not
counting what April spends um well I
mean we've we've been lucky to with
YouTube I make a little more than that
Davis uh after taxes any update on the
Freak ok back in projects there's a lot
of a lot of things I've been studied and
the freako camp back in projects it's
not that they're very hard they're just
very time-consuming what I may do is I
may actually just do one of them so
people can kinda see what width are
gonna need to do to get to where they
want to go amend your wall a green
screen did I or did you make your eyes
great think about that I just blow your
mind right now um so
when did I feel coughing enough to take
a job when I was working at a software
company and seeing the people they were
interviewing was it was a pretty crucial
part when I was seeing the people that
the applicants and I was seeing them
fail things like reversing a string or
seeing what they've worked on in there
they're mainly interviewing web
designers at the end of the day but
maybe had worked for a company like a
mate worked for a company that like
their parents jewelry store and things
like that also when I when I could
follow along what the developers were
doing
I felt I felt pretty comfortable some
new projects I think in the back end of
freako camp I don't think so not not at
least on the the public version maybe
I'm a beta do you think beginners
overestimate the skills of senior
programmers
I think beginners underestimate their
own skills I guess would probably be a
better way of answering that
myself included at times right so you
know one of the one that common
compliments people will say is a man I
can't wait to get on your level and like
to me I think like you're here I'm here
and like everybody else is here right so
it's like to me that's kind of a strange
they but I it's it's hard it's hard to
gauge man especially without you know a
traditional computer science background
um your degree you don't have like sort
of that that ego bump I think that goes
along with it that you have proved
yourself already I think I think that's
a lot of what that that that is a lot of
what you get when you do do it go and
get a CS degree how's the reactor nning
going on I start on I start on Monday
actually so Monday my react nanodegree
program opens up however I try to eat up
work or any similar sites know the only
freelance work I've got in the past I've
done Craigslist a lot of up it's hard to
really compete with a lot of those up
work guys because you have guys in you
know third world countries or not third
world countries but countries where the
cost of living is a lot cheaper and they
can charge one third of what you can so
for me if I was going to do freelance
work I would have to charge a premium on
what I make an hour alright I wouldn't
do it
so I work for home no it's just my
office I mean I could if I wanted to
that's one of the reasons that I'm going
back David is uh one day I could see
myself actually being a teacher of sorts
so if that's the case I if I ever go
down that path I'd be something that I
would have yeah where do you learn react
right now I'm I'm doing it to the the
udacity now degree program can i
freelance with HTML CSS basic officer
but you can try nothing wrong with
trying man you can definitely try I have
hired some freelancers in the past on up
work
but I've never actually done any work on
there myself as actually wear engineered
truth does a lot of of his give his uh
his for his his contractors that's where
you get so long from uh bit code I'm not
quite sure yet how that how it's set up
because all the call that all the all
the sections are locked up till Monday
what I can say is that some of the
benefits is you have people and chat
that you can talk to you about it and
you also can submit your projects you
can submit your projects and be reviewed
by developers which is a huge benefit
hashtag fix college have you encountered
I thought it's a requirement for a
back-end developer it I mean it's it
depends on it depends on what you're
doing you know there are backends that
uses Python yeah that the Udacity
written a degree program isn't cheap the
one that I I'm doing right now is three
hundred dollars plus normally even five
hundred
that's what the cool things about the so
the the react nano degree program has
what they call a extracurricular stuff
and as part as one of the parts on there
they help you with networking they help
you with your resume they help you with
applying and stuff like that
so they that is a part of the program
they help they help you actually get a
job which a lot of colleges for some
reason don't they'll care about getting
you jobs which a lot of people forget
there's this big emphasis on like
educating yourself like not even educate
yourself colleges it puts an emphasis on
paying good money to expand your mind
meanwhile the people are gonna pay you
money to pay off those loans don't want
you to expand their mind they want you
to gain skills so that's kind of where
traditional colleges failing in my
opinion
any sites like free cooking keep working
with challenges uh you could do coke
Adam II there's also uh if you're
looking for algorithm challenges there
is code fights which is what I'm doing
was like this man is cold what are your
thoughts about that mountain and iron
yarn shutting down is a sign of the boot
cap industry ending nope
I I think it's a sign of two poorly
grande boot camps that I think it's the
sign of two poorly grande boot camps
that either didn't change their
curriculum expanded too quickly had a
bad business model I think that's
probably more so what you're looking at
than anything else I think if anything
what you're gonna see is the continued
growth of boot camps you know you have
things like dev Mountain which is
expanding and doing great but you do
have businesses that are going to close
I don't know about I know that happened
with the dev bootcamp but uh where they
got bought out and then shut down but I
also think what's happening so what's
happening is there's a lot of
universities that are now that is now
that are now running their own coding
boot camps and which is jacked up on so
many levels but they're now offering
coding boot camps because coding boot
camps were taken away so much money and
I think that might play a factor into it
as well uh learning Android Gaillard
Java first Dajjal vias
you should always compliment learning
with multiple resources Andy
if a guy is a good developer at the
decent salary why would he be teaching
boot camps depending on the boot camp
you add a teaching I've seen some job
postings and be a teacher at the iron
yard they're offering one hundred and
fifty thousand dollars so you can make
good money teaching that boot camps just
depends
I eat spectrum place by size is number
one programming language what do you
think I think pythons growing i don't
know anything about i ee e spectrum
though and so it's probably one of the
fastest growing ones although I don't
think it's probably number one
yeah I don't know I so the thing about
the bootcamp shutting down is I by the
way I was stunned to hear the iron er
because I have meetings to go to that
I'm signed up on meetup.com at the iron
yard in downtown st. Pete in like a
weekend so when I heard that I was
really stunned but um I wasn't too
surprised by the iron yard the iron yard
was putting out some shitty
grabs okay to keep it real with you I
went to whether one of the grad grad
events and I was really under well I do
full sack dragon
alright guys I think it's about time to
wrap this up I have to actually study a
bunch of stuff this weekend do we have
any final questions before your boy
takes off here and go takes an allergy
pill or some dayquil or something do you
think a free cookout will dominate the
bootcamp industry and that's why we're
seeing shut announce I think it could
play a factor I don't think it's going
to dominate the bootcamp industry
unfortunately freako camp isn't putting
out enough new content in a quick amount
of time so like what's on there there's
no react tutorials on there yeah I mean
they have plans to don't get me wrong
but those are really in demand skills
there's no Bower tutorials there's no
there's no web pack tutorials so they
need to and I understand they're there
volunteer and they're doing it so that
it is a great resource and one of my
favorites but it will not replace a boot
camp because you a lot of people need
the hand-holding and I don't blame him
as hard getting started well I think
about the the Flex grid the Flex system
I'm not really too familiar with it to
be honest
it's a restroom of code Thank You Man
alright guys I have seen the coding
rainbow man that guy when I see channels
like that just explode
I uh I always think to myself what am I
doing wrong here and we're going to
write any amazon skills in there
developer IDE for Alexa I've thought
about it when I went to the angel hack
hack I thought somebody did but I
believe it was they had to write the
program and c-sharp or C++ which I'm not
really too familiar with so I'd have to
learn new language to do it B never
enough reactor angular I would say react
a lot more react jobs right now than
there were react developers it's what
I'm studying for that exact reason
so I think react there's a lot of money
in react but angular if you do an
angular angular Foreman get going hi
guys well thank you
this was our twenty three thousand
twenty three thousand subscriber AMA
special we do this for every new
thousand subscribers we get I appreciate
you so much if you're one of the
thousand and if you're one of the other
twenty two thank you so much for being a
part of my channel I am started this
YouTube journey about two years two
months ago according to my LinkedIn and
it has been a journey you have seen me
from somebody who knew no web
development to now being a full-stack
developer and giving you my opinion on
things and what I what I think is is
true and relevant and I have I've
learned so much in the process about
myself and about software and YouTube
started out as something that was just
going to be a video portfolio and it's
turned into something so much more and
I'm going to continue to grow it it has
essentially become a part of my life at
this point in time I don't see any
instance in which I stopped ever doing
YouTube and I appreciate everybody here
who has supported me some of you with
comments some of you by liking a video
somebody by watching a video some of you
by telling your friends about the
channel some of you go in that extra
mile on patreon and to the thousand new
view that are part of the coding
tutorials 360 family and friends and
group and you know we have things like
the Facebook group and all these other
resources I'm trying to put out there I
hope that we all keep each other on
track hope we keep everybody motivated
if you're trying to learn to code
if you've already know how to code me
trying to get internship if you're
trying to get an internship there
have an internship you're trying to get
that first junior level role if you're
the junior level we're all trying to get
that senior role to the senior all
trying to become an architect there's
always room for growth no matter where
you are as an individual and as a person
and I think the last two plus years
you've seen that in me and you'll
continue to see it well one day I will
be a senior developer and then from
there I will be an architect and then
I'll do be traveling the path of
software it probably until the day I die
and all of you hopefully will be along
with it and we can share our experiences
and and go I I wish everybody the best I
hope that you're all working hard man
I'm doing my best and that is what I've
learned in the in the long term that if
I do my best if I really a hundred
percent do my best I don't care what
happens with the resolving typically I
get there is all I want for me it's it's
just about working hard man and if I if
I know that I've done everything I can
do I feel pretty good about it
so I hope you guys are working hard you
may not be where you want to be but I
promise you that you will get there if
you work every day on it and you may not
get there when you want to get there but
a lot of times by the time that we want
to be somewhere we should have started
much sooner in life and you know it just
takes whatever it takes to get you there
