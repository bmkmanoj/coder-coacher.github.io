everything correctly
god bless we are almost there voice we
have our setup right everything is going
well we have our setup let's actually
dive into Z and this is going to be a
similar setup for the bulk of these
projects let's actually dive into
writing some code right now so what
we're trying to do is create a get
request now note J us and Express make
it very easy to actually create your own
get request so that when we pass in our
localhost 3,000 and then we do you know
whatever in this case it's timestamp and
these values that should return a
certain sub now what we want to do is
want to set up our get request and if
you're not familiar with it that's fine
it's really easy no it makes it an
Express mix it's really good so we have
our app and all these gears called get
we define the path that we want that to
be so let's say we call this date values
and then we pass in a callback function
that takes in always the same three
parameters rec breast and next so within
here when we hit what we're basically
saying right now is I will put some
comments in here get call to return JSON
that filters that format natural and
unix state this is basically where all
our logics going to go we're doing a get
call where when we go to localhost 3000
and slash date values maybe let me make
sure I put slash in there it's going to
go ahead and take in our parameters and
it's going to return it but let's make
sure that this is working first so
console dot log and right here we will
call to log
correct URL or URL works let's do that
something simple URL work and I and this
may be like oh man this should
definitely work I encourage everybody to
do it but notice that it didn't run
right now you're saying oh what does
this was going to work well that's where
the postman comes in so remember how we
had I was telling you to install postman
what we're going to do here is we're
going to go to localhost 3000 and then
within here we are going to pass in
slash timestamp because that's our URL
tap slash date value and now when we
send it we send it let's see where did I
mess up
we should have gone URL works well sorry
guys had a little bit of a brain fart so
what we want to get is our URL works
here so I actually messed up our I put
in the wrong file path what we're trying
to do here is saying localhost 3,000
then the URL that we're captaining here
we just slash state values so now when
we right now it's going to continue
sending indefinitely let's go ahead and
close this script everything timeout
eventually it'll launch our node Montt
and now when we go ahead and call our pH
a call our postman we send our request
you'll see the URL works now the reason
that this is continuing a sentence
because we don't have a return statement
or anything like that which normally
when you do a get call you want it to
return some JSON value or return some
value which is what we're going to do
but now that we can see that it's
working we're going to actually start
writing the logic now this is where you
transition from node to essentially just
JavaScript just pure JavaScript which at
this point you should probably already
be comfortable with but uh we'll go
ahead and do that right now as well so
let me bring up this cool now there's a
couple things that we're going to work
with here first thing let's go ahead and
like close this this stops running then
reopen it now the way that I did this
was I checked if it was a number and
what we're going to or what we're going
to do rather is uh going to add on an
optional parameter so if you're not
familiar with how prams work they're
pretty cool
it makes life pretty pretty great and
let me pull see if I can pull up my old
calls here
so you're saying how do we add prams so
this is how we're going to do it we're
going to add just half after our date
values have a slash that's going to get
some data and it's going to do something
with it now we're saying we don't know
what that is yet or how we're going to
do it but that's how it works
so you'll see right here I'm gonna put a
colon and then I'm gonna put some a
parameter in there in this case we're
just going to use something like let's
just use the word date date date Val
please date Val so the value that we're
going to pass in on our URL we're just
going to call it date Val and with date
Val what we want to do is we want to get
that request you want to get that
response how do we do that well we're
going to use prams so this is basically
a parameter that we're passing in here
for now let's go ahead and get rid of
this and we can return something in a
second and then we're gonna let's watch
our node server which normally we'll
keep this up with node month update
we're going to create a VAR date off a
date look out date valve so just get the
value right margate Val and this is
going to be equal to the wreck this is
anything that's being passed in usually
and the rest is there anything setting
out and next allows you to chain things
together but these two main ones are all
we're going to work with today
so the wreck tram and then the name of
the pram in this case is date Val
and what do we want to do we want to
return our date valve how do we want to
return it we typically want to return it
as a JSON so instead of return what
we're going to do is we're going to use
rest or response so this is a request
this is response so we're going to use
rest because this is essentially our
return statement it's going to return it
in JSON form or turn in JSON object and
just now we're passing in a simple JSON
object so here we'll just put eunuchs
for the time being and we're going to
fasten date belt just to see that
everything's working and saving so we
save that and now it's not putting
anything out because we haven't sent a
request yet so let's go ahead and do
that so we have our date values here
this is a URL and then we have our
parameter here which is the natural date
and we hit Send you'll see that we now
get a response our response here is our
JSON and work-work as my my boss would
say we are cooking with gas
alright so that allowed me time so we
are send a response this is our request
this is our rec right and we're studying
the print is our parameter that we're
now going to do something with that
parameter and then we set a response now
it's just a matter of taking that and
creating logic so the first thing that I
want to do is I like to set the G we're
going to be using what's to local date
string and I think the easiest way if
this is something you're not familiar
with is to look it up right let me show
you the documentation and we will just
look at it for about quick 30 seconds to
kind of give you an idea of how it works
so if you don't want to install an
external resource like moment J s which
I didn't you can use formatting in
called
to local date string to local time
string and pass
and some options as above to format your
string properly so and what language and
stuff like that so in the first example
we have just a date
then we pass in these options which are
going to format the date to what we want
and you can look at it here pretty
pretty intuitive right so you just pass
in JSON follow the example and go from
there
this is just to local date is all we're
worried about we don't care about the
time right now so the first thing we're
going to do is we're going to define an
object that's going to format our date
for later on so we have our date
formatting options is what I called it
and this is going to be equal to an
object and we're going to have a year
which takes in the parameter numeric and
then we're going to have a month that
takes in long which basically means it's
printed out the full word prints the
full word up that's long and then we're
going to have a day which we make it
numeric as well so we want the numeric
value for the day and this will be used
and we'll put some comments here and
we'll put comments here
get the request data okay and then this
also is options to be used options for
formatting date and natural state
natural state view I don't know you can
you can view for me better but you get
the idea now let's go ahead and set a
unix state Val what we want to do here
is we want to pass in another grammar
because all we're trying to return is a
JSON object and we're going to return a
variable called natural date that we're
going to define right now but the where
your real problem is going to come in in
this is that your natural date which is
me is always going it's going to because
we want a UNIX to come in and natural
date and how we format each one of those
is
lightly different so we have to add some
logic we have to add some if statement
so we're doing if and what we want to
check is if it is a number meaning if
it's a UNIX code right because December
15th blah blah blah is in a number but a
UNIX number is so the first thing we do
is is this not a number is nan
that's what it checks for and what are
we checking we are simply checking date
valve which is the value that we passed
in so if it is not a number is true we
want to do a certain thing we want to
change the natural date and we want to
change the UNIX date that we're going to
pass in here and which we haven't set
yet so here is our unix state and
natural date so let's go ahead and find
our first bit of logic so we'll define a
variable from natural date and we're
going to reset this value here just to
new date we want to turn it into a date
and we're going to pass in our date
valve object pretty cool pretty pretty
straightforward so far so if it is not a
number then it's our string value and we
want to go ahead and create a natural
date here now the next thing that we
want to do is format that date with the
options that we just defined above so
natural date is equal to natural date
dot to local date string
and then we want to pass in that we want
the at least I do the English us versa
and now all we do is pass in our date
formatting options and this it will have
formatted our date which so we have our
natural date it's going to format it in
the way that we want but now what we
have to do is we have to define the UNIX
date because we only have one option
right now this is so it's basically
going to be two we have our is and then
we're out of our else but let's finish
our if first so we're gonna have our
UNIX date is equal to a new date and
then we're going to pass in our date
valve so we're taking our UNIX date and
we're converting it to a new date format
and then we want to get the time and
divide five thousand you're saying Dylan
heck you are so smart how do you know
that I didn't know that I had to google
it just like everybody else will has it
does this before but basically my
understanding is we're taking this time
and we're getting it in in milliseconds
or seconds and then we're dividing it
we're basically just turning our UNIX
number are taking our date value our
string and we're converting it to UNIX
so this is the formula to do it so let's
go ahead and now that we have this going
on our server is updated let's make sure
that this is working so when we do our
send you'll see now we we already we're
already there so we're like alright cool
so we're taking in this string right
here and this is simple enough it's just
returning what we wanted to and then
we're it's converting this correctly so
all right exciting everything's working
and if we go ahead and check our
application here we should get a similar
number mine's going to be slightly
different because I'm doing two local
time string but more or less it's the
same thing don't don't really select
that too much it's and you'll see when
we actually output this that it's going
to work just fine now what we want to do
now is when we pass in this number
or this number brother so I can copy
that as our parameter we don't want it
to fail well right now we get nothing
we're getting absolutely nothing because
nothing goes into it all our values are
janky all our values do nothing so what
we need is instead to look because these
these Vallot variables aren't defined
they're only defined in if and else so
what we need is to instead go ahead and
to the UNIX version so if it's not a
string we're going to an else statement
here and we're just going to save our
unix state now the reason that we're
defining this twice is because this we
define it in our if statement it may not
ever exist it's just better this would
be better to call this let than anything
else with the new es6 standards so we
have our UNIX date will be equal to our
request we'll set this equal to date Val
so cool and we're saying we need to now
get our natural date and since we have
our UNIX date similar to how we divided
by a thousand if we wanted to do the
reverse of that we have to multiply by a
thousand right so we have our natural
date is equal to a new date
and we're going to pass it in our date
valve and we're going to times that by a
thousand and last but not least what we
need to do is we need that now convert
our natural date and we can go ahead and
just copy that here paste it in save it
and our error server has updated let's
jump over to postman and now when we hit
send you'll see that we have our UNIX
date and this is actually coming out a
day before I think this has to do with
my local date time string so that's
what's throwing it off not a big deal
but we're off by one day we could
probably fix that down the road to
change this to Zulu but this will get
you your local date time sir
along with your eunuchs number and
that's it we have completed the very
first note Jas API project
micro-services a lot of kind of set up
but at the end of the day once you know
how to do it it's kind of just like
regurgitating it but I hope you guys
