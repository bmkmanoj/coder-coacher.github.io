about algorithms if you've been
following my live streams I've been
doing algorithms for quite some time and
there's a reason for it I don't just
like pound me my head against the wall
and being frustrating and a lot of times
that's what people associate with
algorithms what what so why do outros
well one you'll become a better
developer you'll use functions that you
haven't used too often you'll learn more
about a language in the process it will
reformat your brain to really think like
a much better developer and I've been
doing that you can do it on free code
camp I've been doing it on code fights
for a variety of reasons one of them
being that they have a very organized
path to their hardman and they have
actual questions from you know Google
and Facebook and LinkedIn questions that
you can expect to have in one of these
algorithm set so that's why I've been
studying them but in terms of like this
one right here is an example from Google
this little one right here this is the
easy one of the easy ones but what so
why do companies why algorithm so and
what if you're not familiar with it what
makes algorithms so important well a lot
of times most of us as developers think
oh well if I'm good with angular
especially in web developer and good
with react then cool man I act the
framework I have the necessary
prerequisites are going to actually ask
on top of the portfolio they're going to
ask you to take a skill sets they're
going to ask you to be solving
algorithms and their heart all of them
it doesn't matter how small or how large
of a company in their heart and the
positive side to that is say you didn't
have the time to learn angular or react
what that basically does is you pass the
algorithms it validates you to a degree
as a developer and they know that you
have the skills required to move forward
to to prove to the world that hey what
this person solved these solutions they
can think like a programmer
they can break problems down they can do
very critical thinking that's really
necessary when thinking about how to be
a developer that's really what it comes
down to you have to think about very
complex things oftentimes very
abstractly and you are saying hey I'm
qualified I saw what you put in front of
me the puzzle essentially I'm the puzzle
master
let me move forward and that sounds kind
of crazy but at times because you're
like well what if you don't have a
portfolio he's like does a portfolio
help you along with algorithms of course
it does just like a CS degree helps you
just like a years of experience helps
you you're still probably gonna have to
take the algorithm test even for senior
developer spots but but if you can pass
and you've really thought like a program
it really can help you if you get your
foot in the door
it can help you get to that next level
get to where you need to go and I'm
telling you right now that if you
haven't had interviews yet and
especially you know some of your more
much else tends to go for the
entry-level developers the people trying
to break into the field if you're not
practicing algorithms when the moment
comes where someone's willing to give
you an opportunity and then you you drop
the ball on that opportunity you're
gonna feel really bad about yourself
because I've done that numerous times in
my life and I don't want to see you guys
doing that and so when you get the
opportunity to take some algorithms test
to pass those algorithms move forward I
hope you take it up and I hope you're
prepared right it's I always try to
relate coding back to life and in this
case you should study algorithms for a
couple of reasons one it's going to help
you get a job choose can make you better
developer it's just going to help you
make it good jump make money if you
already a developer become a better one
make money right so I don't know why you
make money I make money so that I can
live comfortably and so that I can do
the things I want to do essentially and
we live in a great world where the
better developer you are the better the
monies and algorithms can help you get
those better paying jobs right you know
if you want to work at Google you all
work at Facebook you want to work
some company that you know you're gonna
have to get good at algorithms that's
just the name of the game that goes for
all the games pretty much all the games
I would say nine out of ten companies
that I interviewed with I interviewed
about ten particular job there is an
algorithm test or a logic test of some
type and I it's pleasant actually going
back and seeing myself do these
algorithms now because when I first
started learning JavaScript I was very
poor at algorithm still and the first 40
or so took me a while on free code camp
a couple months if I remember correctly
I'd have to look out because I pretty
much put them out as I did them took me
a couple months I've done probably about
60 or 70 in the last four weeks while
moving so I feel like I've done progress
and these are a lot harder than the ones
I did before and why am i doing that
well why am I sitting I'm employed I
don't plan on going anywhere necessarily
but if an opportunity comes along I want
to be prepared if Microsoft
sends me anything says hey I'm
interested in in you for this role
you're kind of unique with the YouTube
and this is it are you developing at
solve this algorithm cool whatever the
case is the point is you never know when
opportunity to come be prepared for it
and the best way that you can prepare is
by solving algorithms building projects
and having and constantly working
towards something right there are people
and I know someone very closely who hat
doesn't have a computer science
background she's she studied algorithms
constantly although computer science
topics the traditional you know binary
tree sorts all that sort of stuff
and because that landed a six-figure
salary in Silicon Valley with very
little very little of a portfolio with a
very little portfolio because she put in
the work
she generated the portfolio script but
she when the time came and the
opportunity came she was ready and rose
to the occasion so if you guys are
struggling to get your get your your
position going start going to get that
jr. rolling
know what you don't know what to study
algorithms algorithms our site I'm
currently practicing is on his code
fights code fights is great because it
will allow you they'll actually once you
get higher up they kind of use your rank
in code fights to showcase to employers
so that they can eventually get you jobs
if you're at that level and it's hard
guys so if you're looking for easier
algorithm so I suggest you start with
free code camp knock all at all the
basic intermediate out and then move
forward and you'll find yourself
struggling on certain ones when what
what it's going to happen to sometimes
you're gonna you're going to rise to the
occasion and sometimes you're going to
need to look at additional resources
there's no shame in that
where the shame is and when you don't
compete when you don't go forward you
don't keep testing yourself there's
always going to be a better developer
out there guys that's just a fact now
what your job is not to worry about that
developer but to become the best
developer you can be and one way of
doing that is with algorithms do what
I'm going to do do the algorithms and
then putting your github if you lot of
people worry about not have anything in
their github upload it to github show
that you're making progress show that
you're working these are all little
things that you can do that will show an
active you know you've been doing a
commit a day do an algorithm a day and
move forward if you get stuck on one
jump to a different one you go there so
again the site that site i'm using is
code fights i hope you guys enjoy it
you'll see a lot of stuff from them in
the future but as always guys thank you
for watching the video don't forget to
join our facebook group code tech and
capping the link is in the description
if you want support me you can at
patreon.com slash coding tutorials 360

their guys I'll see you guys in the next
video thank you so much for watching all
right guys I actually forgot about the
giveaway so I haven't fully set up a
system just make sure that you liked the
video and subscribe and our comm and
comment the key word of the day for last
time it was angular thank you to angular
- University oh for giving away the
course the next course we're going to be
giving away is from the same site we're
going to be giving away different course
we'll say I think I said typescript this
one we'll give away it's going to be a
surprise but we'll be angular related
let's
who wins it it is 127 comments randomly
picked the winner and the winner is
Jamal Muhammad Amir one comment zero
likes psych move on baby no I'm just
kidding you like the video I've no doubt
so we will have a more official system
down the road but I'll be sending Jamal
the course code after this if you want
to participate in today's giveaway now
remember every Monday Wednesday and
Friday video we're giving away a course
all you gotta do is use the word
algorithm use it in sentence just put
algorithm algorithm is the key word
voice use algorithm you got tell to the
video till Thursday night see you guys
next time
hey guys thanks for watching the video
special thanks to our sponsors dev
Mountain if you look for a coding boot
camp where tuition and housing is
included definitely check them out
appreciate it and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
