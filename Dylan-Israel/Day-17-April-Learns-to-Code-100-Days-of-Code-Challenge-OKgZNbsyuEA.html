time
a curious that's what we got up to
that is what we got up to indeed all
right guys April will be in in just a
minute
she's a getting ready I just wanted to
get going here see if there's any
questions before we get started on our
tutoring session oh man I'm tired today
by the way we have a special edition for
April learns to code tomorrow um we are
going to be at a hackathon uh maybe
tomorrow maybe Saturday it's a three day
hackathon I don't know what day she's
going to come but one of those days we
will be doing the tutoring session from
the hackathon it's gonna be a great way
for me to network for April and network
and we'll go from there but I'm excited
about it and it's going to be she's
gonna get a little insight into the
hackathon life for better or for worse
baby you coming in here or what come on
it's only only day 17 baby stop pooping
out ready you ready to rumble David yang
is always the first one in here I show
about how we're gonna have a special
edition where it may be hackathon
edition yeah I was thinking oh we're
gonna do um yeah it's at man somehow I
don't care if I have to cry myself
through it out of exhaustion because I
can barely fun to work as is very new
there's a serious mood
yeah your lasses on to it I've been
starting out here all day my eyes are
starting to give out I'm staring at a
computer for like five years straight
now well you know you should get your
glasses tinted okay listen
let me see if that actually it helps
nicely
well they're not prescription so I just
alright guys so did you want to show off
where you're at in your portfolio sure
have
is it the same as what you sent me yeah
all right so let's uh let's get
everybody caught up with what April is
doing on her portfolio right now because
tomorrow's homework day d-day and
I just so she's pulling an all-nighter
tonight to finish it or else we shame
her sure yeah I got three interviews
tomorrow so you can just shove it shame
I'd uh let's see uh I'll show everybody
where you at right now uh so far April
has her portfolio section your projects
and her contact section uh photos photos
yeah I don't think there's a folio
section not hey extract
hey Jason nice to talk to you again okay
from the Philippines uh was it Salameh
fault he knows what that means
all right um so we're gonna continue on
going over things going over the HTML
library everything we've been covering
so far has been HTML 4 and before I
guess um so
okay ready yeah
yeah I haven't been around my co-workers
who were all Filipino when I was in
California so I'm kind of losing it but
for like a smidge bit I was pretty like
I could have a conversation in Tagalog
so yeah Matt takes check all the lessons
I know I wish we could speak so that I
could like keep it up cuz like all my
tagalog friends and not my time I'm
sorry all my Filipino friends all I want
to do is speak English because they want
to correct their English and I'm an
English major so they're like oh no
teach me teach me teach me on like so
they only want to talk to me in English
and I only want to talk them into garlic
but all right so let's let's uh continue
hi Jordan thanks for tuning in hi um so
the value-added annual the value
attribute that's the initial value for
the field I know we've been over that
okay read-only attribute means that
you're only going to be able to see the
value attribute you're not gonna be able
to change it read-only yeah we talked
about all that I know we're going
through all in one on your a second I'm
brushing you up this is where we stopped
okay
kinky you get shovel bug bug down can we
get joke jet come on Jovie
all right so we've talked about the
disabled attribute as well the size
attribute for how wide it should be
we've also talked about the max length
attribute for have we talked about
maxint okay so max length is how many
characters can go in here so first name
as max length of 10 students oh that's
interesting
yeah don't like that because what if
your last name is longer than 10 well
you yeah that sucks but I mean like
that's almost just character
all right now we're getting into html5
attributes how many hoodies I own and
what brand I own about 30 hundreds like
and there are a bunch of different
brands yeah yes the more clothes than I
do right now I'm a hoodie connoisseur
you guys want to get him anything
it's a hoodie all right um see
thank you so some of these things we're
going to talk about right now are the
html5 attributes baby attributes that
are only in html5 for the for the sake
of this you only need that you you can
consider this the same as HTML okay a
shelf I've been around long enough that
you don't have to worry about using
html5 like es6 is the newest version of
java so you're still pretty new so some
browsers may have issues with it
html5 not so much so autocomplete if if
we have something saved in this field
normally like you know I'll have my
section oh so no can actually initiate
autocomplete yes from a developer's
pointed yes Wow um all right Achilles I
was wondering why some of that was like
what does you know what these cats right
now Achilles our smallest youngest cat
is blocking our view daddy can't see one
of this green come on come on get on
bark he's good the humidifier yeah I
I love our kitties it's okay baby it's
like I don't like that all right
um the autofocus so see how when we load
our page
it got of jumps to it I thought that's
the autofocus see how we're already in
here yeah when you go straight to the
page it's already loaded in that yeah
you can only have one autofocus oh
because you can't have both of them
loaded at the same time make sense yeah
all right and everything we're talking
about these seems like oh well it
wouldn't you wouldn't have to put that
in there no but what it does do is one
it makes your a better product and two
it makes you look like a better
developer yeah all right uh we've
already talked about this I know this
monkey
hey Jason meowing so um in html5
remember how I told you everything had
to be nested in the form tag yeah not
the case in html5 so what you can do is
you'll still have the form tagging I'll
still need that but you can set form
equal to the ID of the form and this
will still be part of it dani clos chat
okay okay get my mother Haven
we already talked about the format
review form action - final frozen form
action actually specifies the URL file
it's processable with the input control
when the form is submitted
worried about this one later the Inc
code type this is more this little
behind but sometimes you have to put how
you're going to encode the form data
that you're submitting and no one's
vaping it's just the essential oil
diffuser closed steam room I already
talked about form method form valid a
form target all these are all right so
we've talked about hiding with
attributes list attribute we've talked
about that as well which is the how we
do dropdowns
we've talked about min and Max for you
use the min and Max in here for dates
and quantities right and then depending
on the type we'll see how it displays
the multiple attribute multiple is
you can say we select this one
oh this is a file image so type this
file see how we now was going to
showcase multiple oh but um I guess we
have to do like this see how's the three
files now so if you want to use the file
type we use type file and then you put
the multiple in there if you want it to
be more than one what if you just wanted
one then you wouldn't have multiple on
there it'd still be type file if you
wanted one or mope then you'd have
multiple you'd only select one
hi Jason
the pattern attribute takes in what's
called a regular expression what that
means is that there's a certain way that
you can put in this is a regular
expression right here it it basically is
says hey this pattern is the only way
that this is valid so like in an email
you might have Dylan's email three one
oh and then at gmail.com that be a valid
email okay so they say you're keeping
track of the and calm and the words in
front of it and stuff like that and so
you write a regular expression to do
that and this pattern attribute takes it
in so that's really cool yeah we're not
going to worry too much about regular
expressions that's part of JavaScript
but that's the placeholder attribute
this is if you want something to be in
there before anything's in there so you
see how first name is in there and we
type Dylan it's gone but this is back to
empty that's called a placeholder
I was lunette Day last night
required attribute is also pretty common
so what that means is if we select this
and we this is basically to me let's the
form know that this is required and
won't submit it without it
must be filled up that's what the
required word does so will you move that
out
yeah what is this two-step attribute I
guess if we wanted the number counter to
jump we could set the step attribute to
do that it doesn't mean that we want to
be able to go in and do this if we did
50 - hmm that's strange
I've never used that one before okay so
that was some of real quick attributes a
lot of the form ones
you're not really gonna have to worry
about too later on but we're going to
jump into html5 now
the way that you define an html5
document is with this doctype tag and
HTML in it and if you want to put in the
meta tag utf-8 as well it's just
basically just just busy stuff you got
to deal with sometimes all right so this
is where we added those elements
remember we're talking about header
footer article section those are
actually html5 things as well
html5 has a lot of API and one is you
can get geolocation
another thing is drag-and-drop local
storage cache web workers I'm not sure
what SSE or web workers is but stuff got
removed as well so acronym got removed
and so's use this and set applet base
font big Center so the center taxed
after these are all things I got removed
as of html5 that you don't want to use
anymore so everything here which I don't
think you're using No thank God
I was jumped let's continue for
webworkers are for usage offline yeah I
don't know I haven't used it at least I
don't think I have um so these are all
block elements header section footer a
side nav main article figure yeah okay I
new elements too you can also create
your own elements in html5 there's
really no reason for you to do it now
but it's good to note that because when
you work with JavaScript frameworks like
reactor with like angular you'll
actually do that James welcome welcome
sir alright we talked about being able
to do this comments don't worry about it
if you if I
I took if someone's programming for ie9
and Microsoft doesn't even
update for IE anymore I don't I don't
worry about updating it so alright we've
already talked about all these
okay so there's new input types color
date daytime daytime local email month
number range search tell time URL week
so some of these will be familiar is
they got bundled into the other stuff
you put attributes don't worry too much
about that
this alright so technically you can not
have quotes in here have quotes okay so
you have four different ways to do the
same thing the way that you should do it
is right here double quote does that
make sense
sure why wouldn't you use clothes why
wouldn't you because they you don't have
to UM play you should why because that's
the standard down mate right makes
cleaner code there's no standard here's
a standard I just read a sentence and
above there's no just use use quotes i
graphics so there's also graphics
there's canvases so you can draw and
then there's what's called scalable
vector graphics or SVG which we'll dive
into a little bit later there's also new
media elements the audio tag the embed
tag source tag with track tag and the
video tag seeing these semantics we
already discovered talked about that see
let's see let's see
footer element we've talked about a side
um and we've talked about figure
figcaption
talked about I've already discussed all
that migration so this is this are good
good example to show you so you're
talking about how do I name certain
things a lot of the where these names
came from are things that were common
already yeah I was trying to find those
out so you have like typical HTML for
for instance you would have an ID called
header so instead they say hey this is
becoming kind of a standard and how web
pages are built create a header tag menu
create a nav tag content create a
section tag article critical tag footer
credits lawyer tag so that's how how
these kind of came
all right well what's the correlation
with the div they're all containers
remember divs are containers so these
are just containers that you can like
you're only going to have one footer so
let's just make a footer tag it's still
kind of like a div and you can do it in
the HTML 4 way but you should
got anything we'd be spending three four
days on HTML
so when you create your elements that's
all lowercase you already know that for
now in html5 closed so it used to be
that you remember how some things have
to two tags and opening and closing some
don't used to be that you had to throw a
slash on there at the end of the fits a
self-closing tag or just the one tag now
you don't have to yeah you told me that
okay you snapped at me like ah you don't
need that in there but I gotta know
I told myself all right let's see if
there's any other good examples
you can omit the HTML on the body tag if
you want I typically put it in there but
teach that on
before talking about that stuff
extensions all right cool on to the next
section it's not too much they're just
kind of going over so small changes so
the canvas let's try it out ourselves
so you can draw things now see how this
box is drawing is a oh well just a divot
board it's not what we've done is we've
created a canvas which we're actually
drawing we're telling it we're we're
instructing the HTML to draw something
in this case it has a width of 200 and a
height of 100 and it's drawing it with a
border so let's go on to a more advanced
example draw a line so this stuff can
get pretty complicated pretty quick here
and you'll see now that we're using
reusing JavaScript you can use
JavaScript to do this as well but you
have a height and a width of the canvas
and then within it we are drawing so you
draw the canvas as this and within our
canvas we're drawing right here so uh so
as a web developer you can draw
with code yeah I I have yet to come
across a situation where you would need
to we imagine something like just
painting something it's just all coded
somehow banner ads are made with canvas
no banner ads are not made they're just
gifs that are put in there um yeah I'm
not go spend too much time with this
because you'll forget most of it there
but you can draw a circle so all these
things just know that you can draw
shapes and arrows and everything
else under the Sun and what if you want
to do that you have to Google that
would it can you make dots yeah we just
made a circle so we can make a small
circle in film yeah yeah oh my gosh can
you imagine someone could actually make
a portrait with that yeah well you can
also do linear gradients as well like
this
circular gradients yeah so I'm not gonna
spend a lot of time going over that just
know that there are ways to draw in
html5 so screen vector graphics it takes
that canvas idea and makes it a little
bit more crazy so now instead of just
drawing we're actually going to create
these graphics the wave screen vector
graphics work is based off math
essentially and so they they scale no
matter how close you get perfectly
evenly that's one of the benefits of
screen vector graphics and so circle you
have a CX the C Y and a radius so your x
coordinate your circle x coordinate your
circle y coordinate and radius for T and
then the stroke width and then stroke
being the outside and then fill of
yellow now SVG is important because
there are libraries like d3 which is
used to make bar charts and things like
that that are made off the premise of
SVG so you can make rectangles and every
rec here your rec tag now notice how the
SVG is kind of like your canvas and look
and then or your container and you said
how big it is and then you can draw
stuff with it or you can have it great
stuff within it I guess
rounded rectangle SVG star so this is a
polygon you can see how many points go
into here right so it starts being
really complicated really quickly that's
cool though yeah linear gradient SVG
logo lots of lots of crazy stuff
so you can also display maps on your web
pages is something I did today using
what is called open layers which is that
API but it's pretty straightforward so
you see here we have this map and we're
in London apparently
and then work
this is beyond you right now we're not
gonna worry about that
that's strange that I put the Google map
in here
yeah well wait till we get to JavaScript
before we talk start talking about this
html5 media all right ah we're gonna
continue blowing through this is we're
getting into the more advanced stuff
that I really want you to just know it
exists and when the time comes you need
to dive into the documentation on your
own because you're not going to remember
how to create a seven-point star you're
going to remember that you can't and
then you're going to look at the
documentation and do it that's the
realities of the situation so they have
much different file formats audio
formats all that sort of stuff no big
deal
html5 video so you can embed things like
this what is this that looks creepy
a super creepy yes that's cursive Big
Buck Bunny a pan Oh Big Buck Bunny Oh
but big fat bunny I okay so let me let
me explain to you how this works so you
have a video tag and you set a width of
the video you then add the controls tag
in here if you want controls on here and
you have these source tags notice how
there only one tag each and you put in
this mp4 it's probably the best one to
go and then you put type video slash if
it's mp4 and then if this one fails say
the browser can't load it before it will
then load this one right here okay
that's why there's chew on exactly um
you can also set up the autoplay as well
if you want something to play
automatically
let's see audio same concept with audio
there's an audio tag and you can have an
autoplay and you have controls as well
and you can have same thing this one
plays yes mpg Omaha mpg sciences remind
me a commercial
I think those lofty
I don't know thought I telling us so
slurring together you to know this is
different I know what objects are
knowledge is the other element defines
embedded objects within a channel
document okay so if you want to embed
things like a PDF reader a Flash Player
or Java applet like a third party
supported plug-in you can do that using
the object as well as in bed mean plugin
I thought plugins didn't have to be
embedded uh well so let's say I'm making
a Java applet which is something that
you'd probably do in a computer science
program you make a Java applet I've made
a couple I would compile that down to a
SWF file or a Java file rather and I
could embed it into my page to do
certain things
you know we like embedded with the
iframe another HTML page kind of like
that except with an application all
right HTML YouTube let's just go to
YouTube I'll show you
Milo off
everybody so if we go here and we want
to copy the embedded code and then let's
open up a text editor here real quick
maybe we can get in down please
and you want to open up a text editor
anytime in the future here just pull
this up
this it's always so offended when
you couldn't do
I salute so we just copied something to
allow this in bed now they ought to
generate this code but we create an
iframe we set a width and a height and
then allow full screen you may not want
to let users go full screen but here it
does and the source for where the video
is frameborder down with that distance
but maybe there's not borders no
remember we already crossed that okay so
this is how you would embed a YouTube
video that's all the only point I'm
trying to get across here there's other
ways as well but in this case that's
what they wanted to bring up geolocation
alright so this is a particularly
interesting one how many video formats
you have to put in your code to cover
the major browsers so the major browsers
you probably only need one man to be
honest with you the only one that's
going to give you any issues most of the
time is going to be ie I don't give a
 about ie Microsoft doesn't support
it I know support um now yeah who
doesn't so the next one that was it yet
the next one that will give you trouble
is is into in general by the way is
Firefox
uh what about Safari I'm I don't use
Safari have no idea but I sure it's a
bit I should safaris a piece of to
uh basically should just use cry as it
uh but I don't know man you just you'd
have to check for all them I've never
had an issue though all right so
geolocation so one thing so we can get
one thing that we can get is a user's
geolocation their latitude and longitude
now this changed in chrome 50 so you
must be coming from a
HTTP or a secure site instead of a HTTP
site and you do that with this function
navigator dot geo location and then you
do whatever you want with that in your
JavaScript code don't worry too much
about this it's a little little much
right now but just know that that exists
what does that say out there what hi in
handling handling area that rejections
this is don't work don't worry about
this stuff um
drag and drop just know that you're able
to get the geolocation you're not you're
not ready for that baby
you can also drag and drop stuff you
have to include a couple functions that
they have pre-built here and then you
have to turn some stuff on
so we have these functions on drag over
allow drop in this case and whether
you're dropping an event on drop drop
event on drag and so you can move this
and drop it into the rectangle and do
and you can set all these values you
just have to use these functions in
accordance with the front with the
attributes
that's very cool yeah Oh local sirs
we're not going to cover this all right
cool
so we covered all of html5 all of HTML
basically we sped through a lot of it
and there's still some left over uh
these I don't know these well enough to
go over them these are more advanced
anyhow and then there's examples here
quizzes and references if you want to
just go down to hearing and pull up more
references if you get confused this
would be good for you as well um who set
up what two naps three days um okay job
gang job hand job hang up all day all
day all day all right um every day all
day every day so we placed through in in
three hours basically we went through
just as fast as we could HTML we are
going to do the same with CSS and
JavaScript
I think before we would like yeah are
you thinking about like where we should
go
yeah I'm trying to think because I think
we should get me doing projects at that
point right cuz you can do front-end
projects with HTML CSS and JavaScript
can't you yeah you're not ready though
no I'm not ready but those are the three
you used to start right yeah sure this
will do a we'll do a practice run on an
algorithm dry you sass uh yes I do
oh you have sass who knew who
knew
all right let's see how you do here so
factorial eyes a number here we have a
function this will this will be what
your your homework is going to be after
you finish your portfolio is to start
trying to solve these with your skills
you have in JavaScript without watching
my videos on YouTube by the way No so
here we have a number and the went to
factorial eyes it takes it one number
and then you you basically start at one
until you hit that number you multiply
so in this case five is five times four
times three times two times one and then
you return that number based off what we
know with if statements for loops
returns variables we need to write a
function that will do that for us okay
it was like I have to go back through
all the that we've gone over just
you're going to try to attempt this
you're just cheering why would you ever
need a factorial I something um I mean
you may need to yeah but but I mean you
would need to be able to solve something
basic like this to solve this
whatever it is that you need to do in
the workplace this is the third one man
how much how much it's not like I jumped
into the play do you mean it's not like
I jumped in so what you need to do baby
is you need to um you have to need to
internalize JavaScript apparently to
solve that because I you saying that I'm
like okay I know I know what it is yeah
how do I know how to use those slowly
not really I have a solid understanding
or how to create one myself
no that's also to even try to solve an
algorithm with something I don't even
know how to create okay well let let me
work through this one with you and I'll
show you my my thought process it's not
that it's it's okay first off why how do
you know to start an if statement how do
you know when you need to get to in it
else if or if if how do you know total
from if if if - else--if or else let me
let me show you we're doing we're
breaking out the big whiteboard baby
would you mind grabbing it
so my tutoring session it is your t
reason I got the to turn on the TV it's
just some free tutoring so I don't know
bricks angels welcome all right so let
me get something wiped that off
we have a Microsystems
it's a song magnetic lasso cheap yeah
would you get subscribe claireaussi what
no yes but you just ruined the whole
finish of it it's not gonna be
whiteboard anymore alright just took
bleach to a whiteboard bleach way you
think clogs is our boys their girls are
$10 whiteboard okay so what we're going
to do right now is on our screen right
here we have the instructions to
factorial eyes this number and what we
need you know with a couple of use cases
what we should return so the way that I
would solve this is I would solve the
easiest one possible first okay so are
you going yeah okay so if we have a test
here and it says hey if what this is
saying is if our parameter is zero it
needs to return one so just with me
saying that if we're taking in zero if
we're taking in zero yeah but I see
that's them telling you is that right
well that well you have to know how what
fact what it means if zero is a number
it returns one that's what that that's
not them telling us that's how what we
know in factorial eyes but they're
giving us some test cases here to show
us that so how can we how can we and
remember we're going to use ruh
no not not that that's for objects as
for for loops right so if it goes if and
then the statement what's our statement
here we have a parameter and we're
trying to see if it is equal so if it's
equal to something so let me let me
remind you what a hitch statement is and
what a for loop is no one returned I'm
working on our notes I guess I'm trying
to get this project it's baby it's all
right this is where we're kicking you up
a notch right now I understand it's
gonna be a little overwhelming but it's
alright a little yeah every everybody in
here understands alright oh if they
don't I'll BAM
no way all right so if we're gonna we're
going to review these three things we
review for loops we're going to review
if statements and we're going to review
a return will return those okay legibly
we'll start with you if takes in a
statement like so so if it's true if our
statement is true an example of that
would be 1 is less than 2 or 1 is equal
to 1 which are true statements if that
if this statement here is true some code
runs within here okay if it's not true
it doesn't run so if it's false
none of that runs in here this is the
code that doesn't write
so we're saying hey compare our
statement one lassitude so that's an if
statement then there's a for loop that
does some stuff so the first thing that
we have a for loop is used to do
multiple iterations - yeah - repeat
things yeah no I know what they do I
know we're gonna get I'm an inch in you
there okay okay so the first thing that
we do is set on what iteration we plan
on starting on what the variable is
typically you're going to start your
start of RI is equal to zero and then
we're going to say while I and this is
our statement here saying when we end
our for loop while I is less than I
don't know three I plus plus what's I
plus plus two again adds one to I so if
I is 0 I plus plus is 1 if I is 1 I plus
plus is 2 until this statement here is
no longer true and it runs that code
within here we also have the return
statement and once it hits a return it
exits out the function and sends back
whatever the return is so if this is
true and we were to return return 3
it would never hit our for loop because
it hit our return statement
so if our statement is true it runs this
code if it's not if it check it check
sis says it's false it ignores this
moves on to the next line so we got line
one line two okay so knowing that
knowing that we have a tool for
iterations knowing that if if we ever
hit a return it exits the function and
doesn't run any code below it and
knowing that we have a way of checking
to see if something is true and doing
something let's erase this and let's
start going piece by piece and I'm going
to give you the marker on help you right
so here you go it also sizes me so the
easiest thing that we can do is say zero
should return one so how would we check
that our code in the function we have an
if statement we have a for loop and we
have our return statement
that's our tools that we're using we
have to figure out how to put that in
the correct order to get it there so
when we call the function with our
parameter zero what actually it's the
argument that is a primitive and when we
pass in a zero it should return one how
should we do that using those tools we
have so if that statement is true
how did we
um that's all right all you started if
and then you give it the parameters yeah
what is our statement you're right so we
start with an if now what what is our
statement in there uh-huh
what are we checking to see if it's true
how do you even start that statement
well you know how to do an if right so
you start if so start to fright so if
now what are we checking this is what
the statement is what are we checking to
see if it's true or false how do you
know what to use to check it well what
is there to check well we're checking to
see if it is zero so our test here let's
go off the test right if something is
zero if I say to you if I say to you if
this is zero give me a dollar return one
okay if it's not I'm going to go run so
why you just put zero equals zero
no no remember we have a parameter we
got to use our parameter that's what
we're checking the value I know what a
prowler is what is the parameter it's
five zero in this case it's zero so but
we don't care we don't care what the
parameters we are we are trying to we
are trying to code something we don't
care if it's true or false but we want
to code it so that if it is true
something happens if it's false we move
on to the next step of our function but
we're not worried about that part right
now we're trying to we're trying to
break it down piece by piece and the
first piece is so we're trying to see if
the parameter is true we're trying to
find out if it's zero so you're right
one part of this is zero right we have
to check to see if it's zero
alright let's review parameters or quick
so let's look here so look at our
function here in this case we're taking
in five
so if our parameter is equal to five and
we're checking to see if it's equal to
zero it would be false right so let's
just say because I think you might have
better time visualizing this that we set
we call this function with zero in it
okay and zero is our num right so if we
have this right now what's going to
happen what's it going to return if we
don't change any code nothing because
there's no there's nothing to run it
against no no it is ready it's going to
return zero so remember this zero is num
and we're returning that so we return
zero remember we're passing this value
into num kind of like a variable right
so what is what is this returning right
now they're zero cool so how are we what
num is zero right now when we call the
function now if we want to check if num
if our parameter remember that because
only where our function knows what
number it is is we're passing in a
parameter that we're calling numb if we
want to check if it's equal to zero what
do we do in our if statement we know one
side has to be zero what is it that
we're checking it against one no that's
what we're returning what is it that
we're checking against we know that
we're checking if it's zero but what are
we checking in here
zero one side is zero but what would
would it be we're not checking to see if
zero is equal to zero we're seeing
checking to see if zero is equal to the
the what the how do we get a number in
here right now we return zero because we
have a parameter because we're passing
in parameters okay so what we just give
the statement saying if is 0 then return
1 yeah if is if so if the parameter is
equal to equal to 0 return 1 that's the
statement so 0 is equal to 0 then return
1 yeah but is exactly but we're not
pointing 0 in there what we're doing is
we're checking to see if this number is
zero so if this number is 3 it would
fail and we wouldn't return 1 right so
how do we how do we write that based off
the function we have right now
it's alright it's alright baby it's
alright I know yeah I know you're doing
it okay right so it's a little
intimidating but all right so right what
what do we know what do you think
Haskell
does what a baby you're doing good job
so what what goes in our statement we're
trying to find out if this is true or
false now we have to have an equality
operator sets less than that's greater
than I was saying that's equal equally
that's what I was saying okay okay so so
when you're asking you what do we write
in there I was like what haizen I've
been saying it equal oh I misunderstood
then I'm sorry would you would you
please continue
I don't know is equal it is it's alright
dead okay so it so that's a science
remember if this is a variable we're
going to set it equal but we're actually
checking values not setting about ears
so checking would be this yeah and
so that's a good start right so it's
zero equal equal to zero
yes it is it has the same value and
remember triple equals is type and Val
type it okay but this isn't taking into
consideration our parameter because this
will always be true it will never change
but let's let's forget about the
parameter what would we we what we have
next on our if statement if we wanted 0
when 0 equals 0 return 1 how would we
how would we give us 1 how would we
finish up this issue
what do we return
okay I forgot about that you can just
put one yeah you could also if you had a
variable that had it in there
don't forget your semicolon because it's
the end of a statement all right so what
we've done right now we've hard-coded
this with this is always going to pass
because zero is always equal to zero how
do we make it dynamic so that it takes
into consideration our parameter because
our parameter may not be zero it may be
three it may be four and if it's that we
need to do other stuff now forget the
value of the parameter what you want to
do because that's always going to be
true zero is always less than or equal
to zero all right no no you're getting
there again so I don't slide it baby
all right so let's remember how to let
if what number are we returning here
when we call factorial eyes three with
the three parameter it's calling this
function factorial eyes and it is
returning the parameter no but what is
the value of num three so if we were
based off here going to try and do
something similar with our code here
what would we do know if we wanted to
use the parameter in our logic here
remember we know we know that if it's
equal to zero we always want to return
one so it's not going to be here so how
do we yeah and so what are we checking
we're checking a number to see if it is
here okay so
so we wanted to still return one if it
is equal to zero if not it's false and
we wanted to move on so what is off our
factorial is how do we incorporate our
parameter our num parameter
good
so what is this so so alright let's play
altura so if if num is equal to zero
what happens it returns 1 if it's equal
to 1 what happens may be valid it
evaluates our statement says zero is
equal equal to 1 is that true or false
so then it doesn't run our if statement
it doesn't run the code and it moves on
so now when we do this and we'll do
piece by piece I'll type up the code you
have here so if 0 is equal equal to num
we want to return one and you should
typically want to triple equals this
better convention but either either one
would pass so when we run this right now
you'll see that it returned one Manuel
you what you're welcome and I'm glad
that you're the portfolio videos don't
do it Wilfred all right so cool so now
it gets fun
so do you explain to me Thank You Manuel
thank you thank you so explain to me
what it means to factorial eyes the
number because you're going to need to
understand what that means
and okay so let's talk about that let's
look at an example here so if I say five
factorial
what that means is we want to take five
and then times it by each iteration of
itself so we have five if we we have
five factorials always going to be times
by five nope
it could be any number because remember
we're passing in a number okay so times
any number by any number is all attacked
or lies
no no factorial I say means a number
between one and ten five five so that
would mean from five all the way down to
one we would multiply 5 times 4 times 3
times 2 times 1 and what we return is
its value
there you go
yes
so I guess you'd be blocked down and um
so we have 5 times 4 times 3 times 2
times 1 and so if it was 3 it'd be 3
times 2 times 1 and it would it would be
the factorial of that number and so
so
so what if I say seven what is the
factorial operations sometimes six times
five is it seven times six seven times
five seven times four is it exactly it
doesn't because it's all multiplication
it doesn't matter if you go one times
two times three times four times five
times six times seven or 7 times 6 times
5 times 4 times 3 times 2 I know but
you're increasing your you're doing all
the numbers between 1 and that number so
just like this not 1 times 5 2 times 5
nobody just in that order like that okay
so knowing that we have to do multiple
operations what might we use to do
something like that and remember our
tools that we said we were going to use
for this is an if statement a for loop
and a return statement
it's the for-loops turn okay so why
don't we set up our for loop I don't
think we've ever said yeah I just said
so it starts with the four key word
you just kick it on the buddy he started
it re SWAT my foot earlier today so in
our for loop we are going to start at a
certain number which what is it what is
what do we always start at here when
we're talking about factorials
okay so we we always start factorials at
one because not zero is not negative one
that's not - so in a for loop with one
you sorry I want because I saw
factorials work if it's not zero which
returns one you start the factorial at
one so remember one times two times two
times four times five so I give you that
part we would start our var at one is it
bar for November four takes in three
things it takes same where you're
starting your loop at like this yep yes
and we usually you'll use I for iterator
and you'll set your and you're setting
your initial value right now in this
case it's going to initially start off
at one yes or anything else but
typically you would buy for it ur e
usually iteration iterative and it's
short you don't have to do a bunch of
writing it's only one character but
would you like would you like to call it
something else no I'm not quite sure how
I fit
so each each time we've run through the
for loop
it doesn't iteration okay so the first
thing we so is it I equal to yes because
we're assigning remember yeah
no we said that we're going to start at
one that was your give me part and then
I semicolon we're ending that now we
have our ending condition which is at
some point this side when this side it
when this value here when our statement
just like this is no longer true it's
going to stop the for loop what is that
case here
I'm not really sure
okay um
um so thanks Manuel
um so I I remember ignore the trolls um
okay come on pay attention this is this
is this is a attention stuff all right
well close it all down um so what are we
doing multiple times here time thing
okay so when we do something multiple we
have to break it down right so if we
want to do 1 times 2 that's one
iteration and then we want to take that
value and do it times 3 that's a second
and a third and a fourth so what you
just really until you hit well you you
don't know how many times you're going
to do it so if doing the formula so you
need something just now trying to think
of a way without giving this to you okay
so okay so we're still in this statement
yes okay I need yeah but you have to
kind understand how to solve this
problem did not I get that but I'm
trying to understand or the statement
it's still continuing the same guy said
well we're still saying up our for loop
yes so right now the next one the next
part is to set up a statement that is
true now but eventually will be false
after you reach a certain amount of
iterations it is what are we trying to
we're trying to return remember we're
trying to return the factorial the
number that we passed in don't don't
worry about don't worry about this
you're worrying too much about numbers
about what the hard-coded numbers are
you have to stop thinking like what are
we trying to return when it's a five and
you need to start trying to think how
can I return the correct number in every
situation because you can't hard-code
the answers for this for that I know
that's alright now we're trying to get
you there so
okay so where are we trying to go with
this let's so we need to set up how many
times you want to run our for loop and
the way that we do that is by having a
statement as this second part here and
so that would be like if we and then we
the third part is where we increase by a
certain amount usually by one with the I
plus plus so let's say we wanted to run
this three times so while I is less than
three we run our loop and every time you
look you run it increase I by one well
let me give you an example it's not
going to be anything correct but say say
we wanted to run this Intel I is less
than 5 so this while this is true it's
going to run the flow ok so it's going
to take I which is equal to 1
so this is the for loop set okay so what
it's doing is it's gonna take its
setting hi it's saying I don't why
that's one that's it it's initializing I
so don't one so it's going to take this
I and so in the first loop I is 1 so 1
is less than 5 are we going to run our
for loop yes okay and then we're gonna
run so for loop in the for loop it's
gonna we have we have code that does
stuff yeah but what is it doing well I
can tell you the answer it's doing what
we is it yeah is it is it is it is
called factoring oh yeah
it's doing his doing multiplication of
some sort have the numbers that we have
a yes and we're storing and we're
storing that number and restoring the
answer and we're running it because the
I turns into that answer no we don't
want the I so what happens here is we
never multiply so if we do 1 times 2 I
is it and we said I is equal to I times
2 I is equal to I times 3 Isaac before
you know it you never actually get to
your correct number because in this case
this gets the one I would be 120 and
high 120 is definitely less than 5 right
is not less than 5 so we never would get
to the correct for loop
now how do we store data with variables
um
okay so we're going to stop here and I'm
going to let you finish up your
portfolio tonight and you're going to
review your JavaScript remember all the
tools you have to solve problems like
these
okay sorry
oh all right so okay I'll reach out for
you
[Laughter]
I'll see what we missed here I'm so tall
on Twitch yeah
godless monkey donated $20 so that we
could order April smarter way to learn
JavaScript where's that smoke is
essential oil diffuser it's all about
the parameters and variables and it's
gonna take you a while baby like I know
I was kind of trying my best to baby
stuffy there and you you I think you got
the little part a little bit but this is
this is programming at the other day you
solve problems yeah but it has nothing
to do with the numbers and everything to
do with the sentencing like the
structure
so that you can plug in any number and
it works but I don't have that type of
like not process all I need you to give
me like an outcome and then I can give
you okay here it's a really different I
give you twenty program this up it's
something in the trillions
I'm gonna do that right now yeah I know
see baby everyone gets a mood the reason
that you can't do it is because you
don't know what numbers can come out but
if it helps you
similar with how we solve one test at a
time go ahead and do that
and then all will help you refractor
have I considered doing ask a deputy on
a on video over why dentists ought to
use visuals to you or similar ide i've
not i think everyone should use what
they want I actually use Visual Studio
code at home and at work I use phpstorm
because that's what my boss uses and I'm
not that particular about it alright
guys thank you for watching as always
look for to tomorrow which I think will
be at a hackathon um and we will be
doing a you might just see a livestream
of a hackathon for a bit and I'll do my
best to explain some advanced topics as
I'm trying to win monies and fame and
glory and bitches no no bitches yeah but
uh yeah so that might be a special video
I'm gonna have April come with me and
kind of dive in a little bit umm dive in
I'm just gonna soak in the environment
and be focusing on my apparently Java
skills that I don't have sorry
JavaScript this is by the way this is
much harder than you see how HTML CSS
you got much much easier JavaScript is
where a lot of the issues are for people
and part of the reason for that is
because you have to relearn how to think
properly because now you have to be more
logical you have to say hey um how do we
go to that how do I go that place where
I'm not thinking how to solve for five
I'm just thinking of how to structure
this so that it'll always solve for any
number yes that's how that's how program
works
yeah I know it's awful
ah all right well you did good job baby
I know I know it's intimidating
especially because I know I stare things
and I feel stupid and I just like why
don't I understand this or I don't
you're telling me all after you as
multiplying numbers I don't see how so I
know how to multiply it's all right babe
everyone's there myself included you've
seen me through classes being very
stressed not understanding things and
having to go to tutoring sessions and
having to get help from classmates and
studying outside of work and all that
sort of stuff and it's taken me a while
to get to where I am I don't expect you
to get it in one-hour tutoring session
right now so but this is this is what's
in the near future so all those skills
all those all those tools that you need
to know and that's why I'm going to
start you off when we when we start
struggling through here if you want me
to I'll say hey these are the skills
that you should use in here or hey and
then you can go and review okay what the
hell does a return statement do again
what is it if state how does it a
statement work how does how does a
for-loop work again and maybe you can go
review it and we'll give you a little
hint that way and sometimes free code
camp does as well that sort of stuff not
so much maybe about this harder once
where you're used you where you probably
have to use special libraries and stuff
they will are they do with that being
said guys a special whiteboard edition
tonight at the end that guys I think I I
think I pushed her to her limit today
she look a little stressed and tired oh
ah you feel like a god when do you feel
like I got a coating God as one might
say around here uh around the house yeah
vacation um sorry boom baby
with that being said guys I appreciate
you watching and being here for day 17
of April learns to code we're in the
we're wrapping up the day 20 we're
I think I think kind of time to kick it
up a notch or time to time jump into
JavaScript and so it's gonna be rough
it's gonna be sparked but um I'm gonna
do my best to help paper out with it and
keep her sane
sorry Mijares can be frustrating
yeah if it was hard at least I could do
hard picking on those frustration
uh with with that being said thank you
for watching guys don't forget to join
the facebook facebook group code Tech
and caffeine the link is in the
description below and if you want to
support me a can at patreon.com slash
coding Torres 360 helped us get to that
4k video that 4k webcam some lighting
and upgrade the content of the quality
and get discounts on future courses that
may be coming in the near future little
hint hint hint hint
um anyhow guys I appreciate you all ah
see you see you I guess tomorrow at the
hackathon or something similar uh you
wanna you wanna lay this out baby say
log and pasa
