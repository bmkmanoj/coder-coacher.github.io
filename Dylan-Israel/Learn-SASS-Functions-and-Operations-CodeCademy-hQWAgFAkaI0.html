time what we did was the mix-ins and the
selector for SAS now we're back game
Codecademy we're going to be doing
functions and operations so with
functions we can operate on color values
iterate on lists and maps apply styles
based on conditions sign values that
result from math operations cool some
stuff that we haven't necessarily been
able to do with basics styling so let's
kind of jump in and see what's going on
here is I've never actually done this
aspect of it before so in our main.css
fade out the lagoon blue by their lagoon
blue okay so we're gonna set the
background color or say look in the
glute lagoon blue we want to use this
color scheme hash x 62 SD CA
and we then want to Oh today we're still
students in the variable so we're
setting this here and we're going to
call the fade-out function here so we're
setting the variable equal to this
function and this takes in two
parameters one the color and to what I
assume to be the speed of the fade out
so it's going to run that all right see
how the blue is now a lighter shade
let's go ahead and bring this down even
more to see if we can see how it's a
little bit darker let's go all the way
up to point nine and it might be work
see it's almost completely gone again
you just want to make sure that you're
doing it right even though its own us
are doing okay I really find it most
helpful to kind of test around with it
myself I encourage everyone else do
operation is performed on red green blue
compile to this try it add red and blue
to make the font color math purple so we
have color its kind cool so what we can
do here is instead of trying to figure
out what red and blue would make we
could just go ahead and put it in there
and we'll style it accordingly that's
kind of cool apparently red and blue
comes out to a nice purple looking color
let's try green and blue and see what if
that comes out to that comes out to like
a bluish color um try green in red come
out to an orangish color so I I really
think that's pretty cool not something
you can do in standard and standard CSS
you have to actually figure out what it
is apparently it makes magenta so you're
seeing the output right here essentially
of what this creates so we do that red
and blue creates magenta we also do math
operations in here so if we want to
divide the height by six we can do that
as well and we're going to do it right
now so in our math ID we're going to say
look let's actually do this in order
usually the width and height need to be
right there sorry say for the high
parameter take this with
that we're passing in up here our width
variable and then divide it by six so go
ahead and run that forgot the line
height excuse me we're going to save
thank the line height with Clyde that by
six going to run that very cool I don't
know why it's nothing since playing here
but more about that later so I main
compute the border radius property of
the class of 130th of its width so we
have a border we're going to add the
border radius and what we want to do
here is it looks like we want to take
our width take the width and we can do
let's see let's see if we can do it like
this actually with x 1 over 30 let's see
if that will work and it looks like it
did it just fine so you can use math
operators and figure out how that's
going to work best for you when you need
so we have our math ID here we want to
set the font size font size equal to our
width our width variable / 6 / to all
right since the first / is preceded by a
variable the symbol is interpreted as a
Division sign the second / is preceded
by an operation so it's also interpreted
as division sign so it's just saying
that we're dividing twice there um if
you know basic algebraic math it should
be an issue are up operators you know
basically how math is supposed to work
it should be pretty pretty pretty easily
understood so now we're going to add at
each loop so a beach is essentially it
sounds like a for loop so we're going to
iterate through each item in the list
and we're going to do some stuff on that
so let's go ahead and write it at each
so we'll do at each and will say the
item in list so our list is the variable
and this item is each item in the list
so it'd be orange purple and teal so for
each one in the in our list we are going
to dot hashtag target that item remember
this this dot is there this hashtag is
precedes the item that we're putting in
here which is our list receiving the
item the item from the list and then
we're just going to say look set the
background equal to that item set the
background parameter in this case equal
to the item which is a color
it's going to do that run that and now
we should each get a background color
that's different so orange purple red
very nice okay now we're doing the for
loop so we did it each item in the array
and now we're doing a for loop pretty
cool um so insert the following for loop
all right we really want to insert it I
believe we can just do at the top here
so at four so maybe you don't want to
all the items in the array in this case
it looks like we do so for each item
starting at one through the total we
want to say look da tray on the ents
child
and the child on the item we're
iterating through when you go ahead and
change those as well set the background
of blue all right let's see if we got
that right and no typing mistakes so
fraught i from 1 through the total
daughter a confession background blue
so there's our blue background it looks
like is getting here because we're
having issues backing up so what we want
to do here is inside the body of the for
loop you want to change dance through
the color grill by using the color
function we saw before modifying the
background all right so instead of
background being just blew what we want
to do is run a just dash shoe function
that's going to start it blue and then
it's going to change using the map
operator and step so what is step step
is the variable above here that's 360
degrees divided by total so let's go
ahead and run and see what this does but
it sounds like it's going to create a
little bit of a spectrum so cool so each
iteration goes a little bit more a
little bit each line so total is 10 so
we have 10 lines pretty cool so you can
definitely see how you would be able to
create a very unique and interactive
page that running very fast and requires
a lot less code once you get comfortable
with this so next we have the if
statement so there the at if we can do
an F where we put in a condition and
then value if it's true and value if
it's also what is what is it that we're
checking and what is it that happens
when it's true and what is it that
happens when it's false you see a couple
examples here let's go ahead and jump
right in so we're going to go ahead and
set the width using an if statement so
if
uh let's try simple if i change it there
oh that's right based on weather on the
phone song even or odd number so if i
think we might have to do this in here
yeah let's show this let's do it in here
i'ma leave this or we need if set the
width and if the current a the current
count is not even or it is even so we're
checking to basically see when we do
module two we're checking to see if it's
divisible by two evenly if it is we want
to go ahead and set the pixels the three
the wit to 300 else we want to go ahead
if it's an odd number such as one and as
a remainder we want to set the pixels to
350 now let's going to run that make
sure we do that in the Craig Craig spot
so see right here is it starts on 121212
and don't forget to do your margin dash
left if statement as well so we'll say
if same logic if the current count or
the current num that we're iterating on
is equal to 0 I actually want to check
triple equals real quick although you
know what this isn't JavaScript so i
don't i don't think it'll work so if
it's not we're gonna skip over it if it
and this is almost like a if else it's
really how to think of it because if an
alice is what's being provided just
going to run that
very nice so you're seeing everything is
kind of getting shifted left right left
right left right so that's pretty cool
so kind of the things to take away is
that you can create functions you create
for loops you can create each loops and
you have if statements so or if if sort
of else statements now you may not at
first understand how you're going to use
this but you can definitely see the
importance of it and how it can help you
in your styling down the road and
creating much more complex dialing than
maybe you have in the past I'm excited
about SAS I'm going to be using it going
forward but as always guys thank you for
watching I appreciate everyone who's
been supporting me on patreon thank you
for the likes and shares they helped a
ton and i'll see you guys in the next
and final SAS video from codecademy have
a good one hey guys thanks for watching
the video my good friend Matt at
engineered truth has a three-part
interview with Quincy Larson the founder
of free code camp go ahead and check
that out and so you'll get a lot of
really cool stuff thanks for watching
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
