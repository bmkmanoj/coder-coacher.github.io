back in solo learn today doing CSS
that's what we're doing CSS we're gonna
text so let's go ahead and jump right in
this one's a little bit of a long one
there's a lot of styling you do for text
and we'll go ahead and go through that
right now font family is assigning a
different font type such as Times New
Roman or Arial just going to continue on
fill in the blanks to make the font of
the paragraph font of the paragraph
Arial all right so we have our font
family and we want to assign the font
and then we have our P tag as the
selector font family property in the
browser if the browser doesn't support
the default font then right here Arial
we have backup fonts separated by commas
going in order of one two three four so
on and so forth so why is the name of
one of the fonts putting in quotes I
believe it
oops no what did I say last time
let's go back real quick oops keep on
doing the same thing oh whoops
okay so the name use the quotes if it's
more than one word didn't know that I
did not know that
cool so learn things already so font
size so they have some classes
font-size:small blah blah blah large
extra large so you can see it continues
long rearrange the code to style our
also we have our selector our opening
tire closing tag amend the CSS in
between there calculate the amp size so
you can use M which is the pixels
divided by 16 I didn't know that either
so this is I'd like to say I really like
this course I knew my I had CSS lack of
knowledge I'm glad I'm doing this right
now
so it's font size of the paragraph to
15px simple I'm gonna go ahead and set
15 pixels and our font size like so cool
font - style is usually specified for
italic text cool so you can set the
style of a text such as italic so we
want to make it italic we use the font -
style parameter and value you have
normally of italic and oblique I'm not
sure what oblique means
let's actually look that up right so
let's see what oblique looks like let's
jump into w3schools real quick so normal
italic oblique kind of seems to be bold
slash italic I don't know I have to look
into that a little bit more let's go
ahead and continue on for now font -
wait so you'll see how bold it is
basically lighter is less than normal
then you have bold which is bolder than
normal then bolder which is the boldest
so that's font - weight font weight
property lighter you can also put it in
how much of the font weight the strong
tag also does that although I believe
strong you're not supposed to use that
anymore if I remember correctly in html5
on it will still work for most browsers
so the numeric value and I could be
wrong about that it's been a while but I
believe my IDE told me not to use that
anymore the numeric values are used for
the font weight property so we can you
know a hundred to nine hundred cool font
variant whoo I like this the font
variant will actually capitalize all the
letters or lowercase all the letters or
just leave it alone as normal one thing
to note right here is not every font
supports this but luckily if you're
working in a web application such as
angular 2 there's probably a filter that
does that so it was normal small - caps
is how to do the small caps will make
everything lowercase color color is how
you change the color of the text and CSS
colored class green fill the blanks
makes the text is a colored class so we
have colored so a paragraph with the
colored class and
want the color of it to be green there
we go and let's see the color property
you can also notice how you can do RGB
or you can do the hex values as well a
couple different ways so um you use
color names hexadecimal I don't remember
octal being anything so we'll ignore
that aligning text or zonally so you can
align your text text - align - left
right center and justify I'm not quite
sure what justify is when text is set to
justify each line is stretched so that
every line has equal width and the left
and right margins are straight as in
magazines or newspapers I'll probably
see that in action to fully grasp that
keep that in the back burner kinda
remember which is I'll use not
applicable to x-ray Center lift even I
don't believe there was an even aligning
text vertically cool
you can also align so sometimes when
you're working on I had this happen at
work recently where I needed the the
text to align with the with the radio
button and it wasn't who's on the bottom
it's kind of offset look kind of ugly to
fix that we would use vertical line so
that aligns Center and properly as you
see right here so you have top you have
middle you have bottom fill the blinks
to have the class test so dot test and
we have our vertical align and we want
it to be to the bottom cool vertical
align property you have baseline sub
super and -10 so you can kind of see
slightly different so this will pop it
up this will pop it down you can also
put in text values maybe you want a
certain word to pop out a little bit
more or when you hover over it
apply that effect yeah
negative values can be used
vertical-align property is true if you
want to move the word down see here
Texas loon display:inline table and
display:table-cell styling rules are
applied to make vertical align property
work with divs okay so we just found it
it does not work the same for all
elements text decoration now this is
something you might want to do if you're
me you know depending on what you want
to use so like the typical thing for the
cross out is like a to-do list if you're
starting at learning a programming
language that's pretty common inherit
text decoration over line underlined so
you can underline things you know over
line things I'm not quite sure why you'd
use over line but hey if it works it
works what value is text restoration
property substitutes that HTML s tag so
strong would not be over line line
through blink it might
I guess blink actually let's go back
real quick cuz I guess
line three draw the horizontal line
through all right so substitute CS tag
right here so that's what's let's check
does so I thinking they were meaning the
strong tag that's my my my fault
another Gallic tech decoration is blink
which makes the text blink so blink no
longer works in most browsers so you
should probably just ignore that fill in
the blanks to make the text underlined
all right cool now this is text
- decoration then we have our closing
tag as well
oops make sure you put the right
brackets in there there we go indenting
the text so this is another cool thing
is I didn't realize that this even
existed texts - indent so if you want
your paragraphs to be indented you can
go ahead and assign a text indent
property to it that's pretty cool
positional it's just Festival a text
indent probably the first line of text
blocks there we go and then text a
shadow you can kind of add a background
style effect to it like so you're gonna
have to add the x coordinate the y
coordinate the radius of it and then the
color of the shadow as well
and then my phone's going off mid video
sorry brother this ain't always the form
you have the value of the text shadow
property it goes the X which is
horizontal vertical blur color so you
can see there's text shadow where you
can also assign the RGB and you can
bring it outwards as well so that's
what's going on here a little bit more
note that ie 9 and earlier doesn't
support this so create a text shadow
with horizontal and vertical distance of
5 pixels and blur radius of 2 so this
was text shadow and is 5 pixels and just
this vertical distance of 5px okay and a
blur radius of 2 px do that right
Kotex - transform another way of light
it looks like capitalizing our stuff
here
you can see make sure this go only
capitalizing the first the first letter
of each word so Texas we have a couple
eyes right so you capitalize all the
first letters there's to uppercase into
lowercase O to uppercase will do all the
letters to lowercase will do all the
letters down to lowercase which options
not supported by text or small caps yeah
so small caps is not supported you may
think so because they're similar to what
we were talking about earlier letter
spacing so sometimes you want to put a
little bit more spacing in between your
letters for whatever reason you can do
that so you see right here there's 4
pixels is facing between each letter so
we have letter - spacing and 4 pixels
good to go on that you can even bring it
together more if you want a little more
grouped so I'll fill in the blank that'd
be - 1 centimeter that it so friendly
you can use centimeters in here as well
I guess is that I'm not sure if that was
centimeters or not word spacing so
similar to how you can do letter spacing
you can make the distance between each
words which is nice I didn't know that
existed pretty cool so we have our word
spacing and we want it to be 15 pixels
apart for each word
you can use pxp tpc centimeters
millimeters inches m and e^x for the
values that work with this chances are
you're probably going to use pixels most
of the time if anything so there are no
Flitz and there are no yards when
talking about word spacing so white
spacing so white space is basically how
your words act within here so you see
right here it reaches the end of space
normally it would drop down and wrap
down below and then just by line one two
three four five until it's done
however when you set it to no wrap its
gonna continue on indefinitely from left
to right horizontally until you put a
break in it or it ends so whatever the
function is a no rep option it puts the
whole text online thing is it no
let's go
there we go whitespace values so pretext
will only wrap on line breaks in
whitespace free line text will text will
wrap where there is a break in the code
but extra white space is still ignored
text will wrap with necessary M line
breaks
so you'll see right here it kind of
makes it more pre-wrap for the
whitespace in pre line just messes with
the code a little bit to make it neater
or not neat depending it double defense
what you gonna do was it free in free
line pre exception line breaks and Y
space free line ignores the whitespace
all right um giggling tickle boys face
is still ignored
there you go module 2 quiz what is the
correct syntax to make all LP elements
bold so we have P style font-weight:bold
there should be it cool fill the blanks
makes paragraph red and bold so we're
gonna set the color property to red and
then we were gonna set the font - weight
property to bold that should be it and
finally fill in the blanks to make the
text of all h1 elements our selector is
h1 our font size is 14 our font - weight
is bold in the color it's ray and by the
way of everything we use this is about
90% of what you need to know from this
section font size maybe not font weight
color there's a lot in here but you
probably won't use most of it but just
to be aware that it exists and coke so
that was working with text a lot of cool
stuff just with text that I learned a
few things and I'm gonna put it in the
back of my mind for when I find a way to
use it in my at my work or in my side
