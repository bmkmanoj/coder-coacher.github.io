and make a website building with
bootstrap I'm excited that they're gonna
be having us use bootstrap it's a great
free responsive design CSS styling that
it's really used quite a bit so there's
only eight slides of bootstrap but
there's a ton of stuff you can do in
here so if you have the projects like I
encourage you to go ahead and check
those out so the first thing we're doing
here in navbar and I'm just do not
change position click on the arrows the
toggle so I wants to say refresh all
right now we'll connect the bootstrap
see how this changes back to our site so
this is pre bootstrap lots of let's see
what's going on here so this is pretty
bootstrap now we want to see what's
gonna happen when we add the bootstrap
stylesheet so we're just going to copy
this over and we can put that like so
now let's run it
and you'll see that the buttons are
there now they have an active over him
the this is to the right this is down
below and it's kind of organized so it
did a little bit of stuff to it so the
wait bootstrap works when talking about
the grid system is they have columns and
rows so this top part is a row and it
has two columns with saying if the small
pixels and it's sticking basically it's
a a set of twelve so you can always
break it up into twelve you don't have
to but that's kind of how it works so
while these two six sets work it'll be
in one row but once the pixels don't
work or whatever the case may be it's
going to drop down under it and kind of
just keep on working itself around into
the best most responsive design which is
really needed just because of all the
devices people are on nowadays it's not
just desktops most people spend most of
their time on their phones now so let's
see here first thing we're gonna do is
create this header within the body now
this is gonna create a class container
so trying to remember the differences
here containers kind of like your
default bootstrap div
so the I mean that's really how to think
of it anyhow that's kind of does have
some it does have some some class
attributes I think it's been a while
since I've looked at documentation but
just think of it as a general div so all
right I talked about the rows so you're
gonna create a row so essentially what
you're doing is creating a class in the
assigning it to row which is a
predetermined div class oops and I do
that all the time so we go ahead with
that so we've created our row and now we
want to create our column so so this is
h1 and we're calling it skill fair close
the h1 oh cool we're going to run this
but it's not done yet so but you'll see
it's an h1 display but now what do we
want to do with this h1 we want to give
it a class equal to and you can do this
for almost any sort of HTML element
beside the class no we're just going
around there cool so it just don't look
like too much has changed because we
haven't assigned any there's it's only
the one item so the next thing I want to
do is create a nav class I'm just going
to copy and paste this in your safe time
you'll notice that where you're doing
this in the same row here so it's gonna
create a nav class it's not actually
anything in it and then we're gonna
create three P tags which are going to
be kind of like our menu so notice that
we're throwing it within the nav because
we want it to inherit that
it so it's looking pretty nice so far so
far so good
so let's see if we go on about a new
sectional in I called Jumbotron so go
ahead and read this in this case we're
just gonna use what they call a section
class I don't remember what the
difference between a section and a div
is but definitely check out this
documentation if you if that's something
you're interested in
I'm sure there's got to be some sort of
difference I just have never even seen
section like this so you know the little
header tag all right so we're gonna
create another group here just go ahead
and run that and in our Jumbotron it
looks like there is a default image so
you see our drum boat trunk last year
already has a background image in URL so
you'll notice that it has some some
background size - cover so you'll see
the image expanding things of that
nature so we're gonna go ahead and throw
a div class container within our
Jumbotron because it's a class and not
an ID we can reuse it without any issues
all right so in this case we're just
gonna create a row so
you'll see that we're combining two
classes so not only are we creating a
row we're also calling upon the class
text center so this is gonna Center
things you're not gonna really notice it
because there's nothing in here yet it's
just the one image but we'll probably
get a good look at it right now
so in our row Tech Center we're gonna
have h2 and it's just gonna be homemade
goods slash h2 and then we're having h3
and that's gonna be this year's best
sausage and we're even going to add a
button oh no excuse me a anchor tag
that's going to be styled like a button
so notice we're gonna give it the BTN
class and the BTN primary so there's
like various button classes primary I
believe is blue by default then we're
gonna sign the URL or the H ref and
we're just gonna make it a hash tag here
it's not gonna actually go to anything
and then we're just gonna give it a roll
equal to button and then of course we
want to put the text in so we're gonna
see see y'all on the /j let's go ahead
and run this you'll know everything your
Center are our anchor tag is styled like
a button well it's not actually a button
it's just that it's a URL yeah it's just
a URL that's been kind of styled to look
that way but for all intensive purposes
that's pretty much the same thing so
we're slowly moving on here
let's see where do they want to sell is
this alright create a new section here
go ahead and get rid of these dots from
in our code very nice so in the interest
of time we're gonna go ahead and just
copy this over so we're just creating
two rows here again remember rows go
left to right or right to left I have
you looking at columns going up and down
so I find this as crazy as it sounds to
be kind of a non-intuitive thing one
thinking about how images resize so
columns fill up the rows like this and
take up certain amount of space of the
row so just necessarily matter how tall
it is but matter how wide the column is
within that row just something to think
about
alright just go ahead and run that very
nice so a figure this figure
I was a jealously figure classes I have
not heard that I have to look this up
after this is very interesting
okay so in the interest of time we're
just gonna go ahead and copy pasta that
in looks like I may have made a mistake
so we're gonna have to copy pasta one
add time figure class hmm this is why I
love doing these things man you like
something it every single time
finally each figure add to it elements P
River kitchen for example okay so in
this case I just want to set a P tag and
then they want us to add an image so if
you forgot how to add an image is just
IMG SRC equals put the URL in there now
we can go ahead and run that and see
what's going on here
so you'll see our little kitchen we're
not done yet though so then we'll do
would work oops excuse me so we're
incredibly tak would work /p and then
our second image here IMG SRC equals
all right we don't run this just to see
make sure everything seems to be working
and then we'll get this other one and
this one was supposed to be gifts gifts
like a gift with the teehee and not a
jiff
I don't know I had elaborate on that
that /pe
and then we'll do image' SRC 8 goals so
you're seeing really relatively quickly
how you can create and have all this
great content just with a few images a
couple rows and a couple columns that's
kind of why I personally like bootstrap
as much as I do
so here we go Antiques if you're like me
forgot to put the P tag completely /p
and then you also forgot that yeah just
type the image tag it's been a long day
guys I apologize if I'm kind of making a
little little tiny mistakes like that
alright so now let's look at what we got
here you'll see that everything's kind
of nicely organized so why is that well
it has to do with our rows so in our row
we'll always have two images unless
things get too small like they are now
so at some point these images resize now
as we continue going out you'll see
right there so at this point it's gonna
be okay with the small slash six I said
alright cool this is this we need a
certain amount of room before we resize
these and you'll notice that they're
never actually gonna go on top because
they're always going to take six each of
the twelve rows alright so let's move on
so last but not least we are gonna
create a footer class so as you can
probably imagine our footer class here
is gonna be the footer of our page at
the bottom we're gonna put another div
class row in there so there's tunt i
really suggest checking out the CSS and
javascript that a bootstrap has to offer
and this time we're gonna create yeah
they don't have to be even so so far
we've done a lot of oh everything's been
even that's not the case so you can have
you know one with four columns and one
with eight and that will work just fine
because I've up to 12 and then so we
want to add this so this is I forget
it's a character code thank you free
code camp excuse me um code Academy you
know all these places make stuff alright
so we're gonna put this in here we're
gonna go ahead and run it
then we're gonna expand it out and so
you'll notice that this is all the way
to lift lined up perfectly with this
taking up just the four columns and I
redoing something to the right alright
it looks like we're gonna be creating a
ton of a list item so in here I imagine
that we are going to these are gonna be
just just like about me contact that's
how I imagine it anyhow we'll find out
in a second so we gotta run that
all right so okay our social media that
makes sense too so we'll go ahead and
put this in here so in this case we're
just gonna put our little social media
icon very nice and then you'll notice
how there's no backslash I believe in
HTML for you to put the backslash on the
imageshack I don't think after doing
html5 so you also notice that these are
SVG files so why is that important so I
Sergey file type unlike PNG or JPEG
expands that's what's the word I'm
looking for it is vector art so vector
art has the ability to expand because
it's based off mathematics so just
something to think about
definitely a cool thing that you can't
make every image vector art but uh you
know logos and things that are very
simplified such as like 1/2 Facebook
logo logo or something like that
you know taking the time to do it not
too shabby so you'll notice right here
there they are and then you'll notice
they're actually to the right as well so
it's not too bad pretty nice logo cool
and I think that's pretty much it that's
kind of a quick rundown a bootstrap so I
highly suggest learning bootstrap very
well because even if you don't use
bootstrap you're gonna need to
understand the principles behind
responsive design so time to check it
out it's free you just have to make sure
that you link to it and your HTML and
hopefully I'll be doing the project
sometime soon guys as always thanks for
watching don't forget to Like and
subscribe and I hope to see you next
time
