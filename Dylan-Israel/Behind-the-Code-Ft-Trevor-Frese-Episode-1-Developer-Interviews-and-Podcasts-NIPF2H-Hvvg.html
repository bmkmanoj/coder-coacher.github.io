Trevor frase our Friis sorry if I
butchered your name Matt he's a
full-stack developer that works for
Ernie which is a web application an
Android iOS application that saves you
money on your purchases at the end of
the video I show you kind of walk you
through the app and we talked about it
quite a bit during the interview we
talked about a lot of cool things react
versus angular 2 they built their online
platform and angular 2 asks his opinion
about about that and we dive into all
the great all the good stuff very very
cool guy very passionate about software
it's always a pleasure when you meet
people are passionate about the industry
and about the kind of that's just
software in general not just hey I do
this for a job it pays the bills and I
really like that about like about him
but I think you guys will enjoy this one
thanks for watching I'll see you guys in
the next video
would you mind kind of introducing
yourself and your experience to
everybody yeah sure hey everyone my name
is Trevor freeze I'm a software engineer
at Ernie which is a small start-up in
Santa Monica um my background in
computer science and programming started
when I was around 12 I uh
I played a lot of video games in middle
school and I was like I wanna MacPhail
video games so I made my video games for
a while when I did robotics in high
school I went and I studied at UCSB I
did computer science there and I did
some research I did some internships and
then I really fell in love with the
startup world and wanted to get into
building products that are very early
stage and at that point I actually
started my own startup with a friend of
mine and then it was like a social media
fun app that we tried to get off the
ground but it was very difficult getting
the traction and trying to find
something that had the right product
market fit and then after that I came to
Ernie I've been working it for months
now what uh what do you specific
specifically do a turn are you doing
full stack development or yeah I'm a
full stack they're nice and so um for
those of you who don't
what Ernie is it's a I believe it's a
web application and Android and iOS app
does that correct
exactly yeah so we have a web app an iOS
and Android nice so I I like the web app
idea because I'm so sick of having to
maintain apps on my phone all the time
like I'd rather just set it up once and
be done with it yeah um so what what
Ernie does guys and correct me if I'm
mistaken cuz I've only kind of I've been
waiting to actually set it up I had it
on my phone a while back because I like
the idea like three months ago when I
got a Facebook ad but Ernie essentially
wherever you sign up your accounts on
several sites where you buy stuff Amazon
or other other retailers if the price
drops based off of what the the the
store's price guarantee is within you
know 30 days 15 days
Ernie actually automatically will
capture that and get you a refund based
on you know the amount of money is it
that's pretty accurate
yeah that's pretty accurate so it's it's
pretty simple we actually had a
commercial that went out recently and uh
one of the things about it was like the
guy in the crush goes people shop prices
drop so basically it's just we captured
a post purchase refund for you so if you
buy something from Amazon or Best Buy or
any of your favorite retailers either
online or in-store if you get that
receipt sent to your email address all
we do is we get a we track that we get
we see if that purchase ever went down
in price and then we get you that refund
for that difference in the price so it's
all automatic and you don't ever have to
do anything and you just get free money
so very nice for all users I just did
that in my personal life where I bought
a brand new mattress and always like
$700 and it dropped for Black Friday at
Costco and I got my I got $140 back so
wow wow you actually went to Costco and
you're like hey can I get I was I was
shopping for like some toilet paper or
something and I was just like
 140 dollars cheaper but
and then I was like I was like yo I
wonder if they got a price protection
thing and they did and so I just walked
up to the the you know the returns
countering they took care of it ten
minutes later
that's all so yeah so we could have
saved you that 10 minutes that's good
there you go
that money I mean instantly so and it's
it's nice it's automated right so like
obviously you're not always gonna be
walking through the same store you
always shop in and you're not gonna
after you buy something here or there be
like oh man let me check if it's within
the 15 days they're all busy exactly and
you know and it's all it's also like
these prices fluctuate so often and
these retailers they set the prices all
the time that'll have it like you buy
something 50 bucks then I'll go down to
30 bucks then they'll jump up to 80 and
there's huge price drops for Black
Friday like Black Friday like we saw all
these prices start fluctuating like we
have some really interesting data where
we saw a bunch of purchases go down in
price then they go up in price it was
very interesting like right now is the
shopping season so if you're buying
stuff right now you could also get
refunds for anything you bought in the
last 15 days which everybody's buying
stuff for Christmas and Hanukkah and
everything so yeah it's it's definitely
a nice that it's automated too because
like people don't want to have to track
all the things that they buy and like
yeah when you buy something you're doing
the price comparisons to make sure
you're buying for the best products but
usually people don't go back and look up
something that they bought in the past
and try and see if it like change in
price because they're like I already
bought it like what's the point in that
so the fact that we do that all
automatically definitely is it's a
benefit to the you to all the consumers
that use it nice yeah so I'm I'm a big
are you guys track analytics on all of
this I would imagine like amount of
money you saved and like firfer go users
anything anywhere with that that's
public data oh it's not public data it's
all private zenit so yeah most of those
metrics are they're very interesting
trends that we figured out but we can't
release that naughty
III I thought I would ask cuz I was like
that's all the stuff people like that
stuff I find interests you know if
everybody else does but it's also very
crucial to the business model so I
wouldn't always be surprised at that
yeah man this is this is what we do and
this is it elissa like all these private
dude no yeah there's certain things that
we can publish in like
uh we have it on the blog on Ernie's
Ernie actually as a blog in it there's
just like interesting things we figured
out where like which companies drop
prices on which days and things like
that so if you want to see some of the
public communications that we've done
like we actually go into the data of you
say like okay you should probably buy on
this day or this day you want to try and
get the price drops now what is the so
you worked on the web application
portion so that's correct yes all right
can you go into what sort of stack you
guys used to to build that out with so
we that was a angular2 application in
the front end and it standard HTML and
CSS JavaScript and we have a node server
in the backend nice now did you so
angular 2 for those guys who don't know
I believe officially got released out of
beta in October or like late October so
risk yeah yeah so was there any
persisting issues you guys came across
where like cuz that's one things like
it's it's not a beta but is it really
right so was there any issues that came
up along the way yeah there's plenty is
I don't think that it's really out of
beta yet it's definitely got a lot of
strange things that it everything's
different from Avon if you're an angular
1 developer and you liked angular 1 and
you really got used to that it's
completely different it's like it's a
whole new world there um the components
that they introduced in angular 1.5 were
really like one of the big shifts that
they had between angular 1 and 2 but
because the components were already back
introduced in 1.5 the I think one of the
major benefits was the components so if
you're trying to migrate between them
you have to also balance out all the
other things that it does now so in the
- one of the big issues that we ran into
is that like there's just not a lot of
community support for it right now not a
lot of people are developing in it not a
lot of people have shifted over yet so
if you have some kind of issue with
something you're gonna have to go deep
into the documentation because there's
not a lot of stack overflow
articles there's there's a lot of github
issues that haven't been answered yet so
yeah if you're gonna make the migration
definitely try it out first and test it
out they also have if you're going from
angle one to two which is I know a lot
of people are doing this um they
actually have this angular one upgrade
module that lets you upgrade between and
one and two but even that has some onion
that sounds like that ain't gonna
work at all sounds like a bad idea yeah
it's the way they designed it sounded
really interesting where you could run
your angular 1 app and annuus you after
the same time and like basically you
could slowly port over different modules
of your code into Inglot - but uh in
practice that I think it's the law
harder than that I mean there's there's
been things like that between languages
even and like it's just like this well
it's kind of equate to this and never
that should has never ever worked
properly a hundred percent of the time
yeah if there's always like nuanced
cases and like those nuanced cases end
up being like the big things that do it
so I say I'm glad to hear you elaborate
on it because I get asked that question
all the time like should I learn angular
one or should I learn angular 2 and my
response has always been like there's
prot the problem with learning angular 2
right now especially a lot of people are
junior devs are trying to be is like
you're diving into a world in which
there's problems as in every language
but the solutions aren't necessarily
readily available yeah and you really
want to learn something and there's
plenty of companies using angular one
now like my work we develop an angular
one and so you might as well learn
something that there's kind of hold your
hand a little bit more than diving deep
into deep water like that exactly and I
mean if there isn't the community
support it just has to be really well
documented like that's the other side of
it like you don't need community support
if the documentation is amazing and like
if you have a question you can instantly
just like look it up in the docs and I
know but the energy documentation I
don't think is very good right now if
you go to their website and like just
kind of look through their tutorials
like or you just look at angular 2
router that's like a great example just
the router itself the page that they
have like
for the documentation for it it's like a
mile long and you have to like really
read through all of it to actually
understand what's going with and like a
router something super simple you know
like any other one you use UI router you
my router has good documentation it's
very simple I'll use or whichever router
you use but if you're using it you can
instantly find an answer to something
where you're like oh I want to do like
optional parameters for this URL or
something but in you know twos it's it's
not so simple you gotta like really dig
through go digging deep so yeah so it's
an interesting choice to make I uh I I
have a feeling I'll be learning angular2
about a year from now so I'm like I'm
waiting I'm waiting for everyone else to
start pulling their hair out first
example I see on here that you you are a
mentor at hacker fund you kind of
explain what that is I'd love to dive
into that a bit oh cool yeah so a friend
of mine Justin Brezhnev you started this
company called hacker fun and it's a
charity that does mentorship for high
school students and people that are on
under privileged and minorities people
that aren't usually in software
engineering and basically it's
mentorship and would you like events
that help out and like workshops to help
people are kind of code and get into
coding nice is this it's just a like a
local thing or like is there an area of
where this actually takes place or the
online how does over it's all over um
it's it's in based in cities and it's
usually through hackathons or workshops
that we throw in different cities but I
think it's in like a lot of different
cities right now um I know in Los
Angeles they have a big community for a
Cure fun but there's like local chapters
all over nice I'd love to reach out to
him sometime maybe talking about I'm a
big advocate for hackathons I think
they're great especially for people
trying to get into a junior level role
and learn what sort of things and have
portfolio items and so like anything to
reach out and like contribute I love all
that stuff that's awesome that's gonna
here man yeah I can definitely put you
in touch with them too
I actually I was one of the founders of
SP hacks at UCSB
so I love hackathons soon I love it and
just I I've never won one but one day I
will win one and then I'll stop I'll be
like yo man I got
I got my W I'm out of here guys okay
Joey is living though right go it just
it's like that's a win you get it build
something that's always fun
yeah it really teaches you a lot about
how to work on a team what for it forces
you to see like what can I actually do
in 36 hours if I know with enough Red
Bull right enough coffee and Red Bull it
just translates to code yeah then you
need to meet people you get to network
you get to you know it's is there's so
much going on every hackathon I've ever
gone to there's been two or three
companies that show up before everyone
it says look we're looking to hire
people if you have a job you know come
talk to us with it these are the stacks
for working with and people people think
that's like not a real thing no people
come to hire at hackathons absolutely
hiring an individual that's interested
in learning if you have someone to the
skill you can probably pick up an easy
job or internship with very least
definitely I know a lot of friends I've
actually gotten jobs and interviews from
these hackathons because the companies
to and the start of the hackathon they
can say like okay we're opening up our
API we have this challenge that we're
working with and this is our stack you
know feel free to use it and then at the
36 hours that go on they like these
teams come up to them they ask for help
and like it basically feels like they're
on the job there so it's like it's a
good way for the company to do
interviewing and recruiting nice oh how
many developers does Ernie have now um
Ella purrs we have the CTO Elan and then
there's me yuan and Chen Donna so
there's about four of us right now and
then we have contractors down the side
nice and uh any any designers on stuff I
interviewed a designer yesterday and so
I'm just curious if you have any
designers that are full-time uh not
full-time but we I think we're looking
for one full-time we def we have someone
for part-time right now okay you guys
heard it here man start applying no yeah
fun three uh interviewing a designer
yesterday I'm sorry why a it we're
interviewing so I I'm trying to do
interviews what's like software
professionals and tech professionals
quite often and so I do the interviews
ahead of time and we interviewed with a
freelancers
who worked on a course designed all
about getting a job and yeah in the
market in the tech marketplace it's
really what it is which was an
interesting take because it's like
there's so many things about what you
need to learn and none about how to
actually present yourself as a
functioning person to an employer right
no that was a great experience because I
I'm one of those developers that has
always been like yo man just give a web
designer that like I'm not I'm not
a designer by trade I need to improve
upon that in my skill set good design
and good UX that's very difficult
actually
yeah and III you know I at the same time
having disrespect for it I I respect it
entirely because I know I'm bad at it
and I've tried to get good and it's like
I I really am like man I'm gonna focus
more on the logical aspect and let these
guys who are have that part of their
brain function properly so yeah you got
you gotta respect it right it goes hand
in hand being a good designer and a good
developer really makes you a very
attractive candidate all right yeah you
can do anything with that
you get that's like what a lot of
freelance designers and web developers
if they can do good design on the side
that's that's definitely a plus
so um I see that you a research intern
once it's a research I you have to two
things here in the past
going back to 2014 and 2012 what does a
research intern actually do um so they
help out with research in research labs
so I did research at a few labs at UCSB
um one of them was the security lab so I
did some computer security projects
there that looks really fun and then I
also interned in the computer
architecture lab so that was more
low-level kind of between the very low
logic level and also higher level in
terms of programming nice do you so I
see here in your LinkedIn that you say
you prefer working 12 to 16 hours day
now is that something that's actually
true is that just like so the recruiters
reach out to you now that's how that's
how I get obsessed with projects like I
when I was starting my own company
like I was just like living wake up
start coding and just like started doing
bugs in future requests and just like go
the entire day all I like um like it
comes from like the hackathon
backgrounds ooh or like when you're in a
hackathon you're like immersed in it and
you're just like kind of doing it for a
long time and I really got like addicted
to that and like I'm still like a
hundred percent all like it's a lot of
project and I got 100% on it so with
Ernie like I'm definitely like I don't
just like come home and I'm like alright
I'm done for the day like it's over like
I'm still thinking about all the
projects we're doing I'm still like I'll
come back and I'll start coding on
something that I was like I'm almost
done with it like so yeah I think I can
appreciate that man cuz it's like that's
the mentality you have to have when
you're in software because things are
always changing new libraries always
coming out and I like that like I always
tell people work more than your your
co-workers in your off hours like you
need to be pushing yourself in that I
always like that when I see someone but
I like that you put it in your Linkedin
specifically it is a very attractive
thing to put in a man that's got a
workaholic we gotta get to stat most
employers I think we want that they
definitely want someone who's like
invested in it all the time got some
clouds going in there let's go this is a
you know I get a question about this all
the time right so this is - no oils
right so I have this I have some oils
that I put into this diffuser and like
it's just like a soothing thing or like
depending on what all you put anything
you could put spearmint and supposed to
like wake you up to me it's just like
makes it right yeah I said it's good for
the allergies good for the good for the
the Zen man you got it
my roommate had that in college that was
they were really nice that like we just
have that honor like makes everything
smell really nice it's very calming yeah
III mean I personally am like pro
anything that gets me to code longer so
like the longer I work you know and like
anything that make you code longer my
girlfriend got me started on it and like
I just remember talking all this mad

like you know man about this hippie
lifestyle because that dirty hippie 'no
sat here in it and then before I know it
I'm like buying essential oils but in
packs of three
no they're really they're really nice
III wanted the mister that like do you
like the mister one that like it oh yeah
yeah so we'll give everyone the full
treatment here real quick you can see
like I got the mack daddy over here you
know if oh yeah yeah you got it you got
to go big I mean you got the different
lights coming on over there Wow alright
so uh let's dive in a little bit to to
the app portion of it now so I want
someone asked me this and I I don't know
the answer if this is true or not -
traditionally when getting apps built it
whether it be an Ernie case or your
personal experience they someone Sony
typically those are just hired out a lot
of times and then forgotten about like
the developers is that a pretty standard
thing um it is becoming more common in a
lot of companies because of the nature
of iOS and Android development those
skill sets they're very useful for
building the apps and a long time like
after the apps don't like they'll kind
of just be okay now it's out there like
we'll only need it for maintenance so
I've seen it yeah I've seen a lot of
companies just kind of hiring out for
that now do you do you think that in
terms of people who are looking to go
down paths of software that kind of
makes it a more at risk employment
because it's more of a one-time hire
instead of like an employment like for
instance you're hired as a full-time
employee doing the web application
portion do you think it's a better
choice going in the web development or a
better choice going the app development
because of that it's a good question um
I think that those skill sets it really
depends on the company because if the
company is doing an app as their you
know their bread and butter then like
they are gonna you to be safe there as
an iOS or Android developer if like
you're making an app yes you will always
be necessary to build out new features
so you're a lot safer there
if you're at a company where the app is
kind of an ancillary function to the
products then yeah I mean it would be a
lot more flexible and you might be let
go or something but I think the majority
of the time if you have those skills
it's not gonna be hard to get a job like
there are hundreds and hundreds of
companies that need Iowa's and LLS
Android and web developers so if you're
in web development I think you have a
little bit more flexibility since web
dev is you know like every company needs
a website every company like I literally
every company needs a website so you'll
be solid with just that I think honestly
it could be it could be go it's depends
on the company again like there's some
where the app is just the entire focus
of it and the website is just more of a
landing page to get people to download
the app so it really depends on the
company they're nice so I had a question
about your your startup that you and
your buddy tried to start it was it echo
is that is that the name of it
Mario yeah so someone asked me this and
I I've never started started to startup
or even like a real side project other
than if you want to count my youtube
channel a side project become a startup
when I guess there's point time where
you're like look man we're taking this
 seriously now like is there any is
there a moment that like kind of
transitions that from one to the other
definitely yeah there's a moment where
it was like we were getting an out there
and we were publishing it and we were
like okay actually this this is
something I should be doing full-time
like there's a big need in this market
so um yeah it's definitely a good
feeling to you to like kind of be like
oh wow like this is something big and
yeah it's exciting nice are you guys so
for we're gonna take about questions for
about five minutes I'm gonna type in
real quick is there any a thing that you
wanted us to cover um anything I you
thought was important that her uh let me
think her second I didn't went over a
lot of the interesting side of it you
know one thing that I don't think we
mentioned yet about her you know
um or any like although it is an app and
its iOS app it's an Android app and a
web app it's it's pretty different
because it's a set it and forget it kind
of app where like once you sign up and
you just you give us the email accounts
then Amazon and then the car
card information like it's just that
three-step process you're gone you're
like you're completely done that's one
of the beautiful things on the side
we're like once you're in like you just
get money and you get refunds every now
and then you're like oh wow get it money
right now like you don't have to like
constantly like go on it so it's not
designing an app where a lot of the
other apps they're trying to get like
daily active users or daily monthly
users and stuff and like that's not as
representative as what we're doing cuz
we're more of an outlet like you can
just set turn it on and you just make
cash from it like you don't have to like
you can even delete it after that like
you just you're still in the system so
nice does the now does that though the
refunds essentially does that go
directly into a bank counter just go
into like you're earning account at
which point you've got like immediately
you just get the cash back back into the
bank account yeah back in the big ego
you know everyone get on this right now
man cuz blown money out out for no
reason at all like people like it was
insane for Black Friday like oh my god
like there was a person that bought a TV
and it was right before Black Friday and
this person just installed the app and
the price drop for that TV five hundred
dollars and then we got them a $500
refund from Best Buy and we were all to
sit around were like well we should
imagine like as I like a person like
you're like oh maybe I'll download like
put in my information and then like two
minutes later you get five hundred
dollars like we were like wow this just
got really real like it was a really
good feeling like yeah nice alright uh
so it's let's unless unless there's
anything else that you wanted us to
cover I'm gonna start doing the question
I think we're good for questions I cool
um so all right what steps when you were
looking for an internship did you take
and what tips would you give students or
other young individuals looking for
internships it's a good question um I
definitely reached out to my friends
first and asked around for which
companies are kind of good places to
work at all like software engineer
friends people that were older that had
gone into industry and I also went to
all of the career fairs at UCSB they had
career first
every single quarter so I I kind of just
got like a feel for what this face was
like a bet and uh yeah I think that's
like my two big ways to do it
yes what is the interview process like
for a startup in in your experience at
least um for startups and they've
actually been the same for both startups
and for large companies where kind of
like a standard flow first it's a phone
call just to kind of screen the person
then the technical screen the phone call
then you have the on-site interview that
goes over just like an introduce an
introduction between the person and the
company and then there's like the long
technical interview that could be like
three hours so it's like do this
whiteboard problem so yeah I think
that's been like the standard flow so
far it's it's uh so the whiteboard is
always something I see on my Facebook
feed about how it's broken and awful
idea is that like I tend to agree
because I I I just so many algorithms I
don't know that I could do them on a
whiteboard and also like how often are
you using like bubble sort or heap sort
during your daily coding like never
that's not what coding is that companies
that's like software engineering is it
like trying to solve some weird
algorithmic problem in oh and time like
that's not like what it is I think more
representative are interviews where like
you just like kind of give a person a
project or assignment and like you can
let them use the entire Internet at
their disposal like you see how they go
through the coding process you work with
them like I think that's a that's a good
way to do it like if you're sitting down
next to the person and like coding out
with them so I think those interviews is
definitely like correlate higher with
like what a person's skill set is yeah
oh yeah I saw a great article the other
day about like so like the one of the
one the high ups at Google left the
company and then someone interviewed him
and gave them the interview question
that is done in the Google interview and
he couldn't answer it right yes like it
doesn't really correlate not really what
was doing alright let's see the last
question is
a common question but everyone has a
different response for it how does one
improve their web dev skills online
through free resources or low-cost
resources great question um Stack
Overflow that's the first just like
Stack Overflow and questions that you
have all the time that's like the
standard primary resource for gaining
information in terms of like schools and
like code courses and everything I've
used a few of them um whenever I'm
learning a new one I kind of just kind
of go like okay learn angular 2
tutorials or learn react tutorials
there's plenty out there most of them
most of them are free to I I don't know
like one specific website that I go to
for this though I used one sending that
one that we're giving the name right now
it's the like coding Academy or
something I use coding a long time ago
that one's pretty good if you're a
beginner and if you're trying to get
into junior development that one's very
good it has nice step-by-step courses
but um yeah other than that I I'm mostly
just Google whatever I'm trying to learn
like learn angular tutorial Oh try to
think of a think um thoughts on react
versus angular 2 because I I have no I
get this also all the time and
unfortunately I have no experience with
both really that is that is like a huge
hot debate to react versus a u.s. you'd
like I am kind of leaning towards react
right now um just in terms of how clean
and easy and it's very simple and
straightforward to get into it and you
go to the learning curve is like very
large like it's very very esoteric
specific knowledge that is just
applicable to angular 2 whereas react is
JavaScript and I mean yet like react
also gives you compile time checks and
it has good linting tools and um you
know it's it's definitely I think
a bigger community right now so yeah I
lean a little bit more to react but you
know angular 2 is getting better every
every month they introduce new features
for it and like some of the features
that they introduced are crazy cool and
there are things that react just can't
do um one example that is angular
universal so with English to the
universal like you can basically you can
have the web app load and you know the
entire downside one of the big downsides
with a neo 2 is that it loads the entire
web app which could be you know a pretty
large file and it takes some time alone
but what they've introduced is something
where you can have a your home page or
your landing page that people would come
to first you can have that one load
statically basically so it'll load
really really quickly and then while
that page is loading and loads all the
other files from the web app so that by
itself honestly gets a huge leg up to
things like react really you can have
the entire web app load and like it's
lightning fast scale between pages so
yeah it's always a trade opportunity and
like I think it really depends on the
project you going with - so something
that it I was literally last week
struggling with trying to do basically
lazy loading an angular 11.5 or whatever
the last version is so it's like people
who maybe aren't angular developers or
just getting started it's a pain in the
ass so that's a pretty big deal oh it is
a big deal yeah okay well thank you for
taking the time do you have any social
media or anything like that you would
like to for people who might be
interested in following following you
I'm on Facebook hit me on Facebook
Trevor freeze FRES see you can email me
Trevor a fat Ernie oh yeah I mean just
hit me up also on LinkedIn like I'm on
there hey guys I just want to show you
how quick and easy it is to sign into
Ernie your go ahead and use my link in

to send your referral link which I just
exited out of whoops done and you'll see
how much you can earn from friends and
it's as simple as clicking the dashboard
and then your personal link right here
this Ernie app link and then your code
like I have mine in my description you
can then send out to your friends and
stuff like that and you'll earn 5% of
your friends refre fun so if your
friends earn a hundred dollars back
you'll have earned five dollars in the
