back in kids guard dungeon we're finish
up a few things it looks like this one
became a very available as well
basic syntax let's coding equipped our
sword back
fine Cedric and Omar on protect them
with the light stone I'll see what's
going on here so this is just basic
syntax challenge just what uh
I said some reason wasn't available
before I think this might've been one of
the ones they added so what are we
trying to do here is I I think we're
just trying to move to both of them your
goal is to get to the right side of the
map life you don't need to fight though
over he's just moving all right so move
up move down move up right right command
line three all right let's try it
so move right right and then we want to
right and then we want to we want to
bring the right move down
move right down and then once we move
down we want to move right and we want
to move right and then we want to move
down I think he'll probably join us from
here and then we want to move right you
know right all the way I got to try this
one more time
and here o dot move right let's go ahead
and see it run our code and see if we
made any mistakes so far pause that cuz
we messed up right here all right
trike one more time so move right move
right
huh let's try this one more time put in
one too many statements there to move
right think all we need to do is to
protect them right here there you go
just a bunch of moving statements and
heal up our guys with ours stone I now
that we've gotten this completed we're
gonna go into the advance alright guys
so we're gonna start without the while
loop so you can kind of understand the
logic so we want to move up move right
move right move up move down move right
save the password that's our first goal
right now so we know the faster it's
estimate because bird creatures telling
us we're gonna say hero dot move move up
and then we want to move right
twice then we want to move right again
then we want to move up and get this gem
so move up move right move right move up
then we want to move down and then we
want to move right and at this point we
then want our hero to say and our
message is sesame so let's go ahead and
run that and see if that works
are there ghosts a little bit of a lag
there so move right right oh it looks
like we need one more command and right
so we're gonna move right let's do it
again and I'm actually gonna turn off
the sound does this fireballs for
driving me nuts earlier right move right
all right move up move down move right
save the password gate opens all right
now here we can say hero we want to move
right let's run that a little bit faster
so after every hero I say I'm gonna hero
to the dot right I think we have to move
right twice right now let's run our code
here
again my gaming downloads are slowing us
down so I will close that
sorry esteem we trying to program
alright cool so we move right twice and
now we're at the step where we need to
do something with these fireballs so
reaching the maze using move clear let's
count how many gems you pick up and say
the current count when you're fireball
trap to disable a so we need to move up
and then we need to disable a trap so
we're gonna say hero say and I believe
it's just one I think that's all we need
to do so let's go ahead and run this
so let's see so we say it disables and
then what we want to do from here is
arrow not move up I think this is gonna
be two moves up so I'll say here
actually we create will create an enemy
here if our enemy and then we'll just
arrow dot attack enemy and cuz we need
to do that twice enemy and at that point
so we've moved up we'll have to move up
one more or can we do a while loop at
that point let's let's run this to see
how it works and then I think
let's see it's our gym it opens the door
it goes up we we need to move up once
more so let's do this
because I think what happens is we don't
actually get in the line of sight until
we move so let's move up to here first
get our guy break down the key we get
here and then we attack this guy and
then I believe we can just do a while
loop around this and that should it cuz
it looks like in terms of commands we're
already there so let's go ahead and just
throw a while loop around this and see
if this will get us to what we need to
get to so so at that point ooh this
isn't gonna work at all so we need to
move left move left yeah okay so we
can't move right so we're not at our
while loop yet because we are moving the
wrong way so we kill this guy and then
let's try here ODOT little left move
left and then move left so we should be
right here
and then we have to move up move up hero
up and then move up and when we start
with one more move up I believe now our
while loop should work so now we're
actually at the end of our loop got a
little eager there alright so let's see
run it oh it's not looking good this is
this right here is not what we want to
be doing
so it's around a little bit slow it's
larger map than you show a lot more
stuff going on here oh I think we might
have done it
just put looks like the fireball stop
so let's see here is it doing what it
needs to do sewing
interesting so it looks like we need to
move left one more time left left left
so arrow dot move left granted we could
clean this up a little bit
no we're trying not to use if statements
cuz I haven't been introduced yet so our
if statements would clean up a lot of
this code I think we got it
it's about thirty-one statements but uh
we're using only what kiss guard dungeon
sesame and then we're gonna disable the
trap
interesting so it looks like maybe we
needed to move up one more time before
saying that let's go ahead and run that
see if this fixes our code so it looks
like up here it didn't disable it come
on you can do it
browser Oh
don't crash on me there we go
sorry logic working I think it's having
trouble my CPU might be having trouble
going with this wall all right so we're
gonna my browser seems to be freezing
don't freeze on me bro
oh snap is right all right don't don't
do this to me please tell me please
alright alright so I think this is the
only thing we need to do here
I so let's pray to pray to rngesus that
our code doesn't crash so I did right
here so we didn't we didn't do something
correct we added the wrong move up
command so oh we already did this okay
so cool
so I think I think we're good on say the
command this is the problem there does
this hurt
let's check out one of these move ups so
you wanna say it let's see what actually
happened last time because I didn't
register free right here right right
right right we move up we say the
password oh I see what happened
we actually how do we get our gem count
without doing a wallet I see I see it's
gonna help to see if they tell us how to
say that no so that's that's actually
our code was right but our wall loop
right here all right I'm okay doing this
to janky way Oh count on me gems you fan
let's say the current count near the
fireball in disabling so at this point
we would then say we could reiterate
through our stuff but I don't think we
have a command to get our
coins
so James how many gyms see what happens
when I say hero it I say
I would be very surprised missing quotes
tried jam
alright let's actually do this cuz it
looked when it's so something like that
it makes me think that uh sorry to find
so we're gonna say right here cuz by
then we would have have gathered one gem
so my theory is that this does not exist
yet because we haven't got a gem yet
at some point it's going to say
it says nothing all right
easy enough so we reuse variables so
let's go back to our while loop setup
while true loop outside our while loop
we're gonna create a variable called gym
and instead of one we're gonna actually
say gym and right here we're create a
variable outside so it doesn't get reset
we're save our gym is equal to zero just
hard set to zero and then we're gonna
say when what command does do we hit it
so we move up move right move right move
up so one two three four so we move up
move up move right move right right move
up and then we're gonna say gym plus
equals one so basically iterate add on
to gym and say gym and it's gonna run I
see what happens right now
so we got our gym should say one right
here if it does all right very nice I
think we just finished some reason I was
thinking they were gonna give us a
command to say that well we could just
do it ourselves
let's see what happens here
all right so right here say it very nice
move up move up attack homeboy twice I
cool um a little bit troubleshooting
again I do these lives so I haven't done
them before so sometimes you hit that
little bit but uh oh snaps oh we really
have all these items you got ton of
experience in gems oh so I definitely
suggest doing this this allow you to
skip this section as well and move on to
the next section
I get syntax and variables maybe pretty
basic if you have a little bit of
programming background now
we're only gonna be doing the ones that
are free defensive plane lands all the
red ones so the next video will get
started with backwoods forest hope to
