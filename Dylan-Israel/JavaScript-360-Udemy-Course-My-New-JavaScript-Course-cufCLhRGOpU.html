course javascript 360 it's my second
course I've ever made and it's I think
it's pretty good one actually I think
they're all pretty good though by kind
of bias right so with like every course
I want you to learn I also want you have
something for your portfolio right
learning is only so good as how well you
can show off what you have learned and
so there's going to be a cool way for
you to showcase that as well as work on
your skills to make sure that sticks
we're go ahead and talk about a little
bit more right now all right so let's
talk a little bit about the course just
so you know what you're getting into
of course normally on the way you
damaged so much comes by it it's gonna
be $49.99 but because your boy loves you
like family and family doesn't get you
it for free but they do get it discount
so if you use coupon code coding guys
it's gonna be $14.99 I think it's pretty
reasonable I so there is a hundred and
seventy two videos seven hours plus of
content a little bit about it what what
you're gonna be going over where we
going to JavaScript syntax JavaScript
language I'm also going to give a very
brief run down and get github and
markdown so that you can start pushing
to your gate because a lot of people
really don't take advantage of this and
then you're also gonna have twenty
algorithms so I'm gonna go through this
a little bit more twenty algorithms that
you're going to find solutions to so
that you can use some of this language
what are the requirements you just gotta
have some hard work in you you got a
Guinness to learn JavaScript right the
way that I structured the course is a
basic introduction all that good stuff
what what I'm using and then the way
that it goes you don't necessarily have
to do it in order this is one of those
things where I want to introduce you to
all of the logic sort of operators all
of the methods of strings for instance
so when we talk about what extremes the
some other properties and then we go
through all the methods that are used
you can almost use it as a little bit of
a video dictionary later
was kind of the idea here and you see
most of these are one to two minute
videos
same thing with numbers go through here
same thing with array methods and some
of these are a little bit longer you
know the math 440 sort of thing
that's also because in certain cases I'm
providing additional context we're going
through each one of these and giving
examples and there's previews in here so
of course you can go and see which ones
are yours you know going through
operators you know going through boolean
methods control flow events so this is
something the course doesn't focus a ton
on javascript is obviously you know
based off user events how the users are
interacting but I didn't I personally am
NOT super qualified to talk about
vanilla JavaScript Dom manipulation as
long as I have been a developer I've
always used frameworks for most of it
you know it's occasional like oh well
the framework doesn't do this how can I
just do in a vanilla JavaScript you go
and do it but it's it's sort of before
my time in all honesty and besides the
practice I did when I was learning
development but I did want to touch on
some some some of the vanilla JavaScript
things to introduce you to it and it's
something I plan on covering in
JavaScript 360 part two where I'm going
to deep dive more so into the vanilla
JavaScript Dom manipulation sort of
stuff and in there I'll have like two
three projects unfortunately I just
don't have enough time right now with
college and everything so but I did want
to introduce you to some of the events
because these are the things that you're
probably going to be most accustomed to
and also when you're using a framework
there's usually going to be a way of
doing this also we talked a little bit
about clean code importance the
importance of clean code some examples
of how you might write cleaner code
because this is what's gonna make you
stand out a little bit when someone's
looking at your code it's really easy to
tell when somebody is a bit of an
amateur and you want your code to
essentially reflect your skill level and
so we talked a little bit about that and
I do give you some examples of vanilla
John like
talking a little bit about the style
property having classes removing classes
intertext innerhtml set a screw the
stuff that I would use nine and ten
times sort of thing but this course
really is in about vanilla Joshua a
little bit about JSON a section about
es6 a little bit about functions math
object data object quick rundown to get
and markdown and we're going to talk a
little bit more and this is section I'm
really excited about the so once you've
gone through all this the biggest issue
I have always had with tutorials as a
lot of times they don't give you some
practice they don't give you like some
some it's too guided of I hey we're
gonna build a project now but you you
don't give them anything else to build
on their own right and so one of the
things I did with my angular 360 course
was we built out a project and then I
built wireframes and I I did a video
explaining what features you were gonna
build now and I gave you some hints of
how you might get going on on that
because you need to be able to use this
on your own and so this is what this
section is here this algorithm practice
and the way that it the way that it
works is you have an objective and
that's going to be your markdown file
and this is also going to be how you're
going to build your get your github is
this going to show that hey I'm
practicing I'm learning I'm studying
algorithms and how to use all that you
know the string methods the array
methods all that sort of stuff so that
you can see that I can't put this
together so let's go and actually jump
into my text layer here you'll see here
you have this markdown file which we're
gonna be going over markdown as well in
that ten minute video it's a very brief
introduction of just a shorthand HTML
right how to create some heading objects
how to create some bullet points stuff
like that but essentially what it's
going to be is you're gonna the first
video is going to be an objective me
walking you through this markdown file
saying hey write a function that takes
in this is one of the earlier ones
pretty pretty straightforward but you
need the basic basic when you are at
basic basic and they get harder as they
go on right so write a function takes in
a string of your first name a string of
your last name and returns them
format an example below so that's our
objective some cases for you to check
out hey if still in Israel comes in if
Dylan Israel comes in I will turn hi my
name is Dylan Israel and then I'll give
you some hints and this one is pretty
straightforward
how I solved the hints I use two
parameters concat was a method that I
use and so now if your damn Dylan what
the hell this can cat it was four weeks
ago Institute you know two hours ago
sitting around I'm gonna in information
overload you can jump back in there and
say what iske cat do oh well it looks
like it adds strings together how might
I use that and some of them have
multiple solutions right so this one's a
you can actually write this into three
different ways and this also will go
back to explaining clean code as we do
it and I talked a little bit about a
extension I use Kuo cuss so that you can
see the the output here as well and this
is going to be one of the ways that you
can go and then you solve this first one
BAM push it up to your github and move
forward now obviously that's an easy one
but there are currently 21 of these and
they get progressively harder and I do
have multiple solutions and I encourage
you to share if you solve something in a
very unique way or a better way I
encourage you to share it in the
comments below and I'm happy to actually
make another video about it because I
think one of the reasons I show how to
solve some of these in multiple ways
it's not necessarily just to show a
different way but there are better ways
there are different ways and it gets you
to see and be accustomed to how other
people think and do logic and it makes
you a better developer in the process so
I'm gonna continue to add a few more
algorithms to this as I as I have some
time and if there's something that you
think hey done I think this should
really be part of this course I
encourage you to share with me I um
unlike my angular 360 course which was
everything I wanted in that course I
actually plan on adding additional
content to this but I'm happy with where
it's at right now just say that I think
you get a good value and it's a good
place to start for
someone who's trying to pick up
JavaScript or just once maybe a video
reference for some of the methods that
they're using every almost every day and
in JavaScript are trying to learn
JavaScript to have something there so as
always guys I appreciate you watching
this video it is uh is a pleasure of
mine to be able to make this course it
took a long while for me I know it's
seven hours of content Mike slurred a
rule of thumb if you want to know how
long the course actually took just
multiply it by five right so it probably
took me 40 hours almost to make this
course over about five six weeks on the
weekends and it is is oh it's always fun
doing it and it's always nice to know
that I have somebody who well at least a
few of you will look at it and check it
out and give me feedback so please do
give me feedback on all my courses this
is only my second course I'm gonna be
doing this javascript thing for a while
I think so I need to keep getting better
myself
and make sure my courses are getting
better and better and better and try to
have whatever impact I can to help
everybody in the process because there's
new people have helped me so if you're
interested in the course there's a link
in the description below where you can
get it for $14.99 I appreciate it guys
I'll see you next time don't forget to
comment like share subscribe all that
good stuff in the videos which a lot of
you have and have been helping the
channel out a ton I've seen like 30%
growth this month and my shares have
been up about 50% so I appreciate that
very much I'll see you next time bye hey
baby I think my next course is going to
be how to be doctor love your family huh
hey guys if you're interested in nice
JavaScript course I just released my
second course and in here we're actually
going to be breaking down JavaScript as
a language as well as give you some
opportunities to solve some algorithms
and build some build up your github as
well as introduce you a little bit to
markdown there's a link in the
description to get the course for just
$15 if you're interested as always
thanks for watching I'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
