Stefan or Stefan how to be fun f on yeah
wait thank you for meeting with me man i
know it's pretty late it is if i
understood the time change its freely
for you right now isn't it guys like to
look in the morning oh my goodness what
a trooper hey yeah i got to sleep with
you soar as high as try and say we could
we get a hold it off for a few days i'm
in no rush by that thank you for making
the time yeah so i actually just put up
a video today for novo resume because uh
starting a new series where I kind of
just sure site said I'm a fan of and
that I like and I decided since you were
gonna take time to meet with me and for
my do a little quick interview that
start with your site so thank you for
taking the time round especially 2 a.m.
Jesus oh I haven't told someone to
off at two I am a little bit that's just
me ah alright I guess we should get
started I do you mind just kind of
introducing yourself I think you'd do a
better introduction than I would be able
to run care for the question yeah well I
can repeat the question because I leggy
oh yeah um ok now can you just kind of
introduce yourself oh that will home
system I'm the developer before the
words me and actually my main task are
actually coding and find all the
requirements for our platform uh what
was kind of the so I had you on LinkedIn
kinda to learn more about you and just
kind of see your work experience this
kind of the the first real software
project that you've been a part of or
have you been have you worked on other
sort of projects as well I also have my
previously internship with the world Lil
doc where I believe not a big Hospital
form vertically manage all their
projects
was basically web development agency
it's also actually my second big project
cool um what was a how did kind of Nova
resume get started what was kind of the
thought process was there kind of a
clear goal or did it started something
else and develop into what it is now or
how do they how did it get kind of from
the ground up yeah well actually
saravanan christian or designer to pipe
the international company from
copenhagen and the problem was they had
the work experience like the relevant
one so he quitted like more unique
resume don't worry affect his
personality and he skills and actually
he got the job and the power of Thor
said it's Tico like yeah a bit he
already had chances to get Lee not just
because of there is a man a few months
of the words we have a competition me
together gap between our school and
Microsoft or we basically had to build
an app and we just made demo and yeah
worse became the same place for
Microsoft and solar teachers and yeah
the last we actually behaving it for
such a tool only that you should be like
the website isn't mobile app so yeah mis
globos the beginning oh nice so you guys
actually were thinking about maybe going
a mobile app a way instead you decided
to stick with the web application like
it is now actually I think will be like
a bad idea to do it on mobile it does
affect very hard to write the Terrorism
it on the mobile I I definitely
definitely I think the right choice
hello but actually there are many like
users asking us if you can also go move
out yeah to me it seems like you would
complement it well like you go you do
all the the one time text entry of
things and then you have it on your
phone ready there maybe you just need to
change your address as he moved and you
want to just download it real quick
your phone I could totally see that ve
now is that something you guys are
looking to implement in the future oh
yeah what is like very low priority but
nice um how would it uh have you have
you been involved and software for a
while how did you kind of get started
actually I started like in the high
school I was going the National Olympics
but for me Romania all right but that
was more like competitive programming
and then I just randomly choose them all
to study computer science and then I was
like doing some yeah pretty internship
to some startups it was actually quite
interesting because i have to like learn
different things any any advice for some
young and inspiring programmers when
they're just getting started I mean yeah
that Mindy advice is that you give but
the main one x don't believe in the one
programming language because I sighs
like a very common mistake like a lot
jess does the best one or no Golan is
the best on room be the best one know
they actually may arrange for a specific
tasks hmm so depending on the project
and of course on what you're comfortable
yeah I'm depending on at least 20 at
programming language that's good man to
me the best one is who's ever gonna pay
you the most money so they vary depends
on what you want to do you know oh yeah
def or something is gonna work very fast
or a sucky let's go yeah wrong chip I
really depends what you need all right
are you still based in Romania I I think
I saw that you you moved in you you you
know when you try you try to go back
home and see family and stuff somewhere
in your description yeah well actually
are on the process of moving the company
in their mark because like if time has
to some paperwork is gonna suck it to go
back home romania and we
actually just started the master and
mala that other co-founder and Ray he
also started a new master and the
designer again he still has the
University going on nice someone was
asked someone in chat asked if it was
hard to get out of Romania I'm not quite
sure uh its inner in Union come on any
uh I see that you guys are releasing on
some senior level resume templates in
September yeah what any what kind of
what is that going to focus on because
the kind of my breakdown at least my
opinion is you have kind of the entry
level or focuses more on like the
education and skills and then the
intermediate where you focus on kind of
maybe a little more the work experience
and skills is there they're kind of
what's like the main difference going to
be for that senior level 5 plus your
experience a long big difference is
going to be more than one page and
actually spoke community for rear visors
and this which we said if you do not
have more than five years of relevant
work experience you have no excuse to go
north of on page plain there we can
actually add more sections like
publications but for achievements
because like my new york and the
graduate phase or intermediate please
actually they have that much more
experience or certificates so it's like
very brief description who you are
although on the similar level you
actually have to write more and also
another for you're gonna bring for the
senior templates will be some tutorials
and how they can write the content
better nice um one thing that i found
because i actually used it all the time
as someone who's applying for work and
maybe contract remote whatever it may be
um i found myself wanting there to be a
like covered like a
a nova cover letter like if that makes
sense is that every something that's
kind of come up in conversation actually
that's in the bed log and we hope and by
the end of system mer party because as
we connected those start is most of the
yeah HR departments don't read the cover
letters maybe she's like a very tight
competition between two or three
candidates yeah I tend to agree the only
reason that it like it came to my mind
is I only send cover letters in um when
they're asked for and like I absolutely
hate it so much that I don't even apply
the job like it's a la it is just such a
hassle at some point so it doesn't feel
like Bernard print to get the job they
are like different tips no yeah this
year's amazed like okay very quickly Who
I am and then on the cover letter
actually get into starving yourself even
more but sometimes actually the cover
letters are red after you go to the
interview let's get into I guess more
its software specific stuff does this
yeah what people are gonna hear did you
when you when you guys started a nova
resume did you end up like switching
stacks or did you kind of stay with one
yeah in the beginning were losing like
angular logisti MongoDB because number
of any I'm going to be the new pic
trends which was quite alright for
building an AVP but as we wanted to do
it even more customized yeah fishing
anger was starting to be a hassle so
then we actually moved to backbone.js
afterwards which was more minimalistic
leather point actually a parrot our own
library so i can write a code more
efficiently nice that's uh I just
ask as I I work out a software come out
really writing code per se but but um my
company in the beginning before I was
there they they seem to jumble stuff all
the time like oh this this isn't great
I'd it wasn't perfect in this sinks
right and it seems to be kind of a
common thing especially when just
getting started they brought with them
were also actually but maybe you know
little said the net think I'm gonna
handle the mitigation firm virgin went
from a long point yeah something 22 yeah
yeah give me problems and backbone.js is
like slowly dying so ya livin the good
idea to keep them in the future nice I
know I uh I'm currently learning one
point oh but I here like two point O is
kind of completely different so I've
actually been look talking to some
friends about it and trying to find out
like yeah where's some good resource and
I my god really not just struggle
through it all right thanks man I mean
we really look on the company's what do
you want but actually from what I had
never use it but wrecked it's like the
new trend and people say is pretty good
yeah I'm uh that that seems to be quite
popular right now it's react and
actually I'm doing a course on it this
thursday for the next month from I don't
know if you familiar with the code
mentor I oh but they're basically like a
one-on-one like internet kind of coating
like you need help you can hire a mentor
and they're launching classes and like
oh it'd take your class I was like sure
right there like free learning man let's
go I'm ready I could actually I think
the best tools including is a la doors
if you do it oh I've heard a code words
yeah I've been giving some requests and
do some videos on it I'd just like one
day there's so much to cover guys I'll
get there is that something you use
quite often got worse do you use code
words kind on a regular basis or you're
so busy now they just look but not
actually the last
here because I like the time is very
tight mmm but they all deeply into it
look nice so I I guess one of the
questions I i I'm curious about personal
level is a cuz I see next to the
templates that you have like free so I'm
imagining and at some point kind of the
I guess I'm saying what's the
monetization strategy because to me it
seems like Oh we'll make premium
templates that you can buy or maybe
add-ons or something it's a kind of a
monetization plan down the road yeah
well actually we want to launch the
premium features in autumn should be
around middle Stenberg and the actions
initial idea was to ya way more
templates and they saw them but actually
then have a different approach we're
gonna give tutorials and then for each
template we're going to allow users to
do you more customization like for
example different affair graphics for
the skills or difference way of showing
the photo nice yeah that that's
something that I was like kind of
thinking about like I wonder what path
they're gonna go down and it seems is it
it seems so great um because I I know
when I've had to reapply for jobs i'm
always looking for a template i'm
inserting my information i'm ready to
pull out a gun and kill myself because
of it and it's just it like now it's so
much easier really is like the second um
i think it came across it on lifehacker
i don't really fully remember but I've
been telling people about forever but
such a huge like oh man this is special
why wasn't this around sorry thing yeah
actually like the new photos like when
they were like people were good but
hoping to make a bet to be like 50 30
templates because people just see like
for one hour to okay which one should I
choose which one should I choose
surprise to have wrecked around 10 and
then each 10 then you can customize it
to what you actually need nice
let's see you um I wish I I mean I'm not
one of those type of guys that comes to
prepared in like oh man I have to have
all these questions I go off the cuff so
there's any awkward silence man I
apologize but I um let's see here um
anything uh how do you do it so I see
that there's essentially three
co-founders huh three of you is it that
all started in the beginning when you
guys all all met up and started this
project okay and I see you have some
advisors what a like what in what sense
are they advisors what's what's sort of
them do you have about six advisors on
here one of them is a bonsai tree but uh
but uh just out of curiosity what what's
what sort of things do they advise you
on as a kind of a young company in the
beginning suturing actually is different
from advisor to the visor left for
example we have one off which dress is
already like in The Courier an HR park
and then we have question which is a
young entrepreneur and the mentors from
are you bitter that helps us with a
business plan and then we have like that
by RR the helps us with the marketing
okay yeah advisors from different areas
and that's also a very good thing a lot
of our team uh because yeah I like the
developing skills which has the design
skills I really marketing skills able to
study marketing or two people the story
solid computer science and then they
start the store up the thing is we need
people with different skills yes yeah
it's a it's a good strategy go about it
can you kind of elaborate on what it was
like spending a year in an incubator
it's like for me the closest I've ever
gotten to an incubator is the TV show
Silicon Valley like I said it's closer
and it seems like it would be such a
wonderful experience
I'm just curious like how that started
and what it's actually like actually
this from computer to computer that we
have those incubators your companies are
just fixed on their project and then you
have a loose incubators where people
just shared knowledge or a startup two
startup and you'll learn how to build
incubator on something within the middle
all the time with other startups will
not do anything but again if air like
isolated the third does then you're not
going to learn that much like Cooper
power incubator we have a closed Tuesday
meetings where all the companies were
coming and they were she like their big
successes or fails during that week and
all other people's will give violence
under issues when it when I came to your
incubator like again cuz i have
absolutely no knowledge about it um like
how did it work did because it's in it
in the TV show right this is this sound
knowledgeable i am about incubators is
that I go here's a portion stay for
however long until I kick you out and
I'm like how did have it go for your
incubator and the good part was Thorin
readers actually portable school so
slave up in your that the student all
night at once a month or twice we get
the vice from a lawyer and uh also for
like that this is miniature so it was
part of kind of your college where at
the was after you graduate they give you
a year because I since I'm here a year
at the incubators that kind of out went
actually without the place one year
before we finished oh man I so cool that
is so cool well yeah that's the good
part like yeah starting the new company
Copenhagen he's almost free resources
that just seems like such a
dream come true like hey here's a year
just create something and have all this
time to do it oh man that seems like a
great experience this away is like a
win-win it because if the company
succeeds then people say okay this time
to the school so yep younger people go
to the University or Academy it's it's a
it's a great example of investing in
your students and getting a return on it
and I feel like some people and some
some places aren't as like for
forward-thinking is that I'm fortunate
um do you have any side projects of your
own I know you're probably super busy
but uh sometimes everyone kind of holds
one in their back pocket that they're
working on yeah well actually
unfortunately not and actually I missing
that they're working on different
projects but i think is like yeah it's
not the same work on this project and i
also have like a different tasks not
related but they are developing so you
guys gonna text em 20 hour so we got it
d philip and so yeah it doesn't really
give it time for anything else nice i'm
looking on your home page here and you
guys have some you've gotten some
attention from some very like prominent
um you know media companies Forbes
Business Insider Yahoo Finance
lifehacker is there that kind of just
naturally happen or was is it do you
guys kind of have somewhat a social
media guy is kind of going out there and
I'm just curious if that that kind of
attention because I mean that people
would love to get into Forbes and the
lifehacker and those sort of things that
just naturally happened or how did that
come about I mean is this work for us
for instance was like the trial and
error process like somewhere in the
December we've created the dark video
resume and actually got the Mick Keith
on 9gag and uh
Germany biting opposite on mrs. Sadler
and one day we just thought okay let's
try to make Gilliam asks where's the man
we just need to visit cellar they
elected and you just went well I think
lifehacker took it from there but yeah
it's beef to trying to play it like some
new content that people like to see nice
oh alright i guess i'll see you um just
kind of looking at everything here um
any any sort of partnerships coming up
for note the law resume cuz like to me I
there's a couple sites that I'm
affiliated with that I was like oh man
this would be a great addition anything
like that that you guys are kind of
looking at actually yeah this year we
fight just to keep you like news project
that I'm up yeah companies takes time to
do like for me off and the only people
still have revenue and till we're gonna
hire more people let's murder to keep it
this way all right very nice um well I
guess anything anything you want to say
you answered I appreciate your time man
I know it's like what are you waiting do
I am oh my god you I'm sure I'm sure you
run on caffeine working eighteen-hour 20
our goods but also exercise on yoga
hello manic I got I a back into the yoga
game i miss it myself but actually they
have done many fishes regarding the
building happen here Oh with you know
what I just realized this right now so
I'm on your homepage and I've seen this
at the Elon Musk resume on the one page
I didn't realize that that was actually
or your guys's template till right now
I've probably seen this two or three
times where I kind of saw it as like
yeah this is really great this is
probably how i came across it
originally thanks yeah oh man um is
everything you like you really have to
have a ton of experience and
everything to be more than one resume
and especially we're always hiring for
like QA at my work and sometimes people
sit in four or five page resumes and
it's like they laugh they're like I'm
never gonna read all this like it's just
like I'm in a oh really bands but like
for example when you have been working
like 20-30 years and you really have the
rhythm approach sometimes you actually
recorded how to see formation oh yeah
not enough after these positions yeah
living you like when you're playing like
a junior developer birthday you're gonna
be the one with you people whole vision
and like the project management is it
going to be like nothing is gonna be
more like digital in 100 octagons so we
have more time to actually spend mongan
how do you know so Sokka chuckle over a
software it when researching for kind of
how to design the templates what kind of
went into that because I I know that you
guys probably just say like yeah let's
just make something I'm sure you did
some research for it in the beginning we
use like this red to make something nice
okay afterwards we study the good
practices what you should have in
tourism and I should present it uh then
with Alec our guy HR department in our
school we went there to ask for advices
and also spoke with your companies like
what you like to see no resume a nice I
see that you guys are still in the beta
any any chance to kind of fully launched
that like people tend to like to have
betas forever now it's kind of feel like
it's almost like a safety net of some
server in the beta Manson like oh well
we relive it and they both in the
februari okay right a the things like we
get like what's the feedback which is
really nice and we may like there are
lots of changes hey nice well hopefully
hopefully we'll be able to talk again
come februari after you guys fully
launched and we can kind of check up
yeah hopeful there's not going to be
good luck in the morning for me okay
yeah well so we'll find a better time
next time but um thank you and everyone
watches this video later on make sure
you go novo resume calm it's also you
check out the video really er I do a
quick walkthrough for it as well

stripper yeah thank you and good luck I
appreciate it dude have a good night all
right hi guys well that was fun ah nice
to kind of talk to people who are have
an idea and are really kind of driving
at home at the same time like I was very
intrigued personally to know that they
do the the incubator that's like oh man
Silicon Valley my touches my heart um it
just seems like such a dream a dream
come true for me anyhow I would have
loved an opportunity like that um um
what trooper man much too am just um hey
guys thanks for watching um really check
out novo resume calm I use it personal

you know how to start up and kind of
just I mean I mean look at he he i I'm
not a super-large channel he's been
there the company's been mentioned in
Forbes for God's sake and they still
taking the time at 2am to spend a half
an hour 45 minutes answering questions
