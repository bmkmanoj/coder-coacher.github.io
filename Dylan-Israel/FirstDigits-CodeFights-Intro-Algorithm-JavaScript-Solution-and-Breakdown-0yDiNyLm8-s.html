fights the intro section diving deeper
doing first digit now the task that we
are asked to do is we need to find the
first digit in a string so the leftmost
digit so in var underscore one that
would be one and we need to return it as
a string Q - Q - Q etc etc you guys get
the idea just return the first issue the
way that I did this was I created a
digital race so let's go ahead and do
that and this went from zero to one
excuse me not like that these are
individual characters one two three four
five six six seven eight and finally
nine so we want to find that very first
digit so this is enough to do what we
need from there I took our input string
which our input string here is just a
simple string and I broke it up into an
away array of strings right
then we're going to iterate through that
array for the entire string or until we
have a truth value in our risk statement
and we are going to say hey if that
digits array dot includes includes is a
a array function that will get return a
true or false value to check if a number
or a value is in that array and we can
do that with our our input here so if
the current item that we're iterating on
in our array is included in our digits
array the first time that hits we just
have to return it and there's not like a
true or false to this so all that
there's a in the way this is set up
there's at least one that string today
at least one digit so we don't have to
do return an empty case or anything like
that for that and that's it let's go to
run our test and submit it probably a
bunch of different ways you can do this
one this is so how I I did it and I
thought it was a you know pretty pretty
straightforward to create a create
essentially a database to search there
turn the string into an array of
characters and then iterate through the
characters and find out the first one
that hits your digits array using the
includes alright function but as always
fathom I'm interested in how you solve
these problems I hope you leave your
solutions in the comments so some
context to be solved in a different way
or even a different language right I do
all these in JavaScript a lot of people
be interested to see your solutions as
well so I appreciate you guys watching
the video don't forget to comment like
subscribe and share and if you'd like to
support me on patreon and join the
Facebook group discord channel all that
stuff is in the description I appreciate
you watching I'll see you guys next time
hey guys thanks for watching the video
special thanks to our sponsors dev
Mountain if you're look for a coding
boot camp or tuition and housing is
included definitely check them out
appreciate it now see you guys in the
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
