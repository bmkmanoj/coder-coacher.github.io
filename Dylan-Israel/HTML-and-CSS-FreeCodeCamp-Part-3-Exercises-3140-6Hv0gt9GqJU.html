we are doing HTML and CSS exercises 31
to 40 so add a submit button to a form
very important stuff forms pretty cool
stuff
apparently we already did that one so
let's go check along so that was sorry
guys I want to make sure I'm on the
right ones here so all right 32 go p--
so one
I'm only trying to do them in one sets a
tenth so yeah so your text input element
should have the required attribute so
where do we want to put that so we have
input type and then we want to put
required here and that should I should
make it so that you have to have that in
there all right so that's to your
patient have to radio button elements
how do we create rating
radio button so you have input type is
equal to radio evil so do you want a
label there yes so I guess we'll put it
at the bottom of the form so we want to
have input type is equal to radio just
slash the input sorry if it's all the
way at the bottom here guys okay so
Oh actually there's no slash for this
excuse me what am i doing so every input
type radio' if we run that if we do this
twice we should get this isn't gonna do
anything right now but look we should
knock that cool the name attribute is
indoor/outdoor so how do we do that we
just set the name equal to endure - out
door so now when we refer to it as a
parameter type we can get it there so
let's go ahead and run that
indoor/outdoor
new equals
you just should be nested in its own
label element okay maybe we need to do a
label so let's see if our label element
is messing up why it's not saying that I
radio buttons are name property properly
so let's make these labels and slash
label make sure each label element has
closing tags on the radio those should
have a label indoor oh so we'll save
this on this indoor and this one is
outdoor you can see right here indoor
outdoor just good it's saving submit and
bam there we go so we got our indoor and
we got our outdoor Coolio alright so
your page should have three checkbox
elements so if we wanted to just kind of
copy and paste just do like those sort
of things
let's do it above the radio button so
page 2 to 3 checkbox elements alright so
here's one as a label it's called loving
each of the check bottom box own it
should be nested in its own label
element make sure each of the label
element has a closing tag give your
check boxes the name attribute of
personality so let's see here let's see
if we can just put three of these in
here so here's our label loving it's an
input type of check box and named
personality so see here cool
so you can see right here they're all
the same right now but they're getting
the input their knit their name
personality the data if you want to look
at it that way and the label is only is
the word here so you know your first
radio button on your form should be
checked by default how do we do that and
we just put checked so radio button is
one of these and we'll say indoor right
here and all we have to do is put the
checked in there and you can see right
there check box so that was energetic
and we just put check there as well
hmm
well it is checked well let's go sick
argument create a couple more of these
take out that take out that we don't
want those three check so apparently
we're getting running into an issue here
first check box on your phone should be
checked it is so let's remove this and
see if it fixes the other one it doesn't
so I'll create an input time just don't
see if this changes anything oh those
aren't are for my first I see what's
going on I made a mistake so you see
right here these are this is the first
checkbox checked and I think that's five
let me check real quick
so you can click here a channel CSS yep
so we're on 36 not too bad so many nest
many elements within a single div
element so nest your PLM inside your div
element so here's our P and we're gonna
test this right away cuz I want to see
if that's all they wanted so that's your
P element sided so all the piece
let's see
there we go so we just wanted to we
could have created a bunch of divs and
we probably should be honest but what we
also could do is just group this in a
div and leave this one alone so that's
what we did here all right 37 so give
your div element the class gray
background so you can see where's our
div so we want to give this the class is
equal to gray - background so but we
didn't set anything here so what do we
have to do in our style we have to say
gray - background and what do we want we
want to set the background - color
to gray that's it great sorry there you
go you see right there that's working
cool I'm really fine 38 give your form
element the IDF cat photo form so it
looks like we want to give it an ID and
it's gonna be equal to cat - photo -
form we're go so we have an ID not sure
if we did it so sorry million we're in
our last two so your form elements
should have the background color of
green so we gave an ID of cat photo form
well well let's let's try this let's
will say form stay for the element form
back around - color green Vega our form
is on green we're good to go
and our last one right now for our first
10 we're doing pretty okay we're at 10
minutes right now so we're doing about 1
a minute so your green box cloth should
give elements 20 times padding so we
just want to change the padding on here
padding is the space you give an element
so like right here you'll see it went up
so let's just change this to 100 you can
see it's massive now or that's a
thousand 110 20 go so that was exercises
31 to 40 I believe and in the next video
we will continue on the HTML and CSS
it's about a three hour course according
to this and it looks like we're gonna be
messing with elements and we're already
halfway there so I'll see you guys in
the next video
just one say thanks for the likes and
the comments let me know if I'm doing
good I'm learning
hopefully you're learning
this is a field we all need to be
learning in and if I'm ever miss for if
I ever misrepresent something because
I'm so like I said I'm learning let me
know and if the videos you find them
helpful let me know that that really
goes a long way so I'll see you guys as
always in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
