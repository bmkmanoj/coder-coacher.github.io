that's a little bit different and what I
mean by that is I want to talk to you
about investing so recently we talked
about investing in yourself that's
talking about investing your time your
energy and your money and learning and
becoming a better person better
developer and one of the things I want
to talk to you is actually investing
your money one way that I do it I'm
going to show you two different ways
that I do it and I tend to when I give
my advice and things like that is really
instead of advising you just telling you
what I'm doing you do with it what you
will
so two two ways that I look before I
talk about what I'm doing why you should
you invest well a lot of people when
they first start out they're going to
get a bigger paycheck than their
previous job as a developer that that's
probably going to be the case 90% of the
time and I don't want you guys be you
made the smart enough choice to learn
software and not make a smart enough
choice to figure out what to do with
your money
don't ball out don't do a bunch of
craziness you know for those who don't
know I invest about 50 percent of my
check when I can and on the on the month
where something came up like I had to
get MRI for this hand and I had to I
bought a course I invested 25 percent so
it fluctuates between that amount now
that April is working of course and we
have two incomes again but when we when
it was and I was investing somewhere
between 10 and 20 percent and then and
the reason for that is it's just as
important to have your money make money
as it is to have you become a better you
as essentially we have your money
becoming better money and then that that
gives you a lot of security because now
you know that hey I have this nest egg I
have these investments and the money may
fluctuate up and down depending on what
type of investments you're doing and it
doesn't necessarily mean that you have
to have thousands of dollars to get
started invested when I first started
investing it was with $25 and it was
about a year and a half ago and it was
with the second item we're going to talk
about
just peer-to-peer lending the first
thing I want to talk to you about is
Robin Hood Robin Hood is a traditional
stock investing where you're buying
stocks and I'll throw out my sum some of
mine up here just so you can see that
I'm not bullshitting and I've only been
doing this about six weeks in terms of
the app it's very easy to get started
you basically search for the stock that
you want to buy you buy it and you sit
on it right you sit on it and you hope
that against value stock market
fluctuates so when you are buying when
you're doing something like stock
investing plan to be a long term
investor when you're getting started
right long term is safe you know stock
market goes up it goes down Robin Hood
is great because it's on here it's a
phone app there's no fees to buy things
traditionally start when you buy stocks
you'd have to pay like a $10 fee and
when you're getting started that's a lot
because unless you're buying a thousand
dollars of stock where or something like
that you're you're you're going to lose
a good percentage now
you don't lose that percentage and I use
Robin Hood for that and I've been doing
that for about five six weeks and do it
quite well I think I was as high as up
to 22% and now I think I'm at fifteen or
sixteen percent which is still amazing
for about six weeks but I wanted to
share Robin Hood and if you're
interested in joining Robin Hood there
is I'll put my link in the chat and if
you do that not only will I get a free
share of stock that's somewhere between
a five dollar and two hundred dollar
stock my coworker shared it with his
friend and he got an apple stock which
is $150 but you'll get a free stock I'll
get a free stock and you'll still
download the app all the same it's
completely free app just buy and you're
good but again when you do do stocks
just plan I would say when you're
getting started to have money that you
don't that you don't need to pull out
and that you can sit on and use it as a
opportunity to educate yourself for when
you are maybe a senior developer and
you're ready to you know invest $5,000
at a time or something like that you'll
see for my socks that the bulk of my
stocks are in tech stocks AMD
Tesla Facebook Apple a lot of all the
stuff that I as a as a millennial and as
a targeted demographic I would say that
I think are going to do well netflix
things like that just companies I think
are going to be around a while that's
more that's more my gut I'm learning
more as I do this reading articles
following the market and becoming more
educated and intrigued by as well the
other thing I want to show you which you
can start with us as low as $25 but in
reality they recommend that you get
yourself up to about 2500 is
peer-to-peer lending now with
peer-to-peer lending what's great about
that is the way that it works is
essentially you're lending money out and
you're getting an interest rate back so
you're letting this is a long-term thing
as well but you can get started for eff
low as $25 but again you want to have
more essentially you're buying shares of
a loan so if there's a ten thousand
dollar loan it's broken up into or will
say a twenty five hundred dollar loan is
broken up into a hundred shares of
twenty five dollars so you buy a twenty
five dollar share and then you get
interest based on that twenty five
dollars and that's a loan so it's three
to five years you can't pull it out
early because you lent that money you
didn't like invest it there into stock
market and you can sell it back even at
a discount if it's a bad market time and
you need the money so this is definitely
long-term but you can earn a decent
percent I believe I'm earning about
eight to ten percent on these on average
and right now I'm debating if I want to
I have my auto invest turned off because
I'm debating if I want to leave it in
there but one of the or have it just
continually invest but so right now I'm
basically getting in like a hundred and
fifty dollar check every month if I were
to leave it out from what I have
invested but this is how I started
investing because it was a low risk in
my opinion and a low a low effort a low
barrier of entry where I could buy a
hundred dollars or four shares at a time
ten percent of my paycheck at a time
where I could go invest it and then
forget
about in the next paycheck and set up
you can set up auto invest in things
like that I don't have a affiliate link
if you're interested for doing this but
I encourage you to check this out as
well this is more long-term so I would
say unless you're already very
financially stable you might want to
hold off on this because I'm finding
that I have about you know several
thousand dollars in this site I would
like to transition to the stock market
now that I'm in a financially better
place and I don't have that luxury
because I committed to three-year loans
for all of these so keep that in mind if
you are going to do peer-to-peer lending
but I like that as well but now that
we've talked about two ways that I
invest and why I like it and things like
that
I just want to make sure that people are
making good decisions that's really all
it is man and you can invest other ways
I want to remind people that if you keep
your money in a savings account for a
year and you're getting you know 1/10 of
1% a lot of the times you're actually
losing money the value of that money is
going down so I keep less than about
$1000 in my in my savings account most
of the time with the ability that if I
need to I can pull more money out and
the reason for that is statistically
speaking if your money is not making
money actually losing its value because
of inflation and inflation varies two to
three percent a year on average but by
you leaving that money in your savings
account you're really not you're losing
money in terms of what your money can
actually buy and instead what you should
do is take your RT you're already hard
work because that's all money is money
is energy it's it's time it's it's work
so all those things and use it to go and
get some more time energy and work that
you don't have to invest your time
energy and work it and so one of the
things that I've always been doing very
well is living below my means partly
because I was so broke right and so
being so broken you know not being able
to treat myself very often and not being
able to you know buy groceries all the
time and do all these things you you
learn to live without and because I've
been able to keep my expenses low I have
a I
I have very little debt and because of
that I can invest more in and I can save
more and I can I can not have to worry
about having such a big stock pile of
cash on hand for my massive amount of
bill so I want to remind you just please
try and live below your means and if you
can invest man if you can save that
little bit of money save save 10% save
20% and when you get those raises
increase the amount that you can I'm not
saying going up don't go out a tree or
so you see right here I have my my HTC
vive I was able to get that while still
investing between 25 to 50 percent of my
income and that's a lot right but if you
need to start at 5% start at 5% you mean
start at 10% start at 10% but much like
when you want to get your foot going
when you want to get started in life by
the time you're in that mindset for most
people it's always it's already a little
bit discouraging because you're not
where you want to be and you're going to
feel probably the same when it comes to
investing and things like that where you
said you're going to look and say damn
and I could have the 20 there's $20,000
I spent on a brand new Honda Civic
instead of getting a you know a $10,000
new car I got a $30,000 new car and that
that extra five six thousand dollars I
could have saved every year I could
actually have invested it and five years
later it'd be worth fifteen thousand you
know in a good situation or something
like that so I just want you guys to
know that I hope that you're not only
investing in your in yourself but also
investing in your future financially
because it's as important especially
when you're going from some a lot of
people don't like talking about money a
lot of people think oh that's it that's
a dirty dangerous talk right stuff like
that I don't think so I think there's a
lot of people I think that's that I
think that's a very bad mentality to
have because we don't talk about these
things you don't learn you don't know
how to get better you don't know how to
save you don't know how to plan for your
future so if you're planning for your
future because I am and I want I want us
all to succeed we're all in this
together and a lot there's a lot of
pessimism in the
world that's okay we can't do anything
about that we can only control ourselves
and those around us and I consider the
people watch my videos some people that
I can help and at least I can deliver a
message if you're gonna if you're gonna
if you're going to listen that's on you
I wish you all the best of luck I hope I
hope you guys are saving and investing
and if you're investing other things
that I don't know about I know some
people are doing crypto currencies I'm a
little skeptical on that that's a gamble
as far as I'm sorry but if you're
investing let me know what you're
investing in I'm agar and excited to see
