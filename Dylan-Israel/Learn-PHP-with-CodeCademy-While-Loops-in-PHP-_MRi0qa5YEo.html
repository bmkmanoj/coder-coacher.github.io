loops so while loops in PHP here's a
quick look at some example I live so if
a second go ahead and pause the video
and take a look at that will go on let's
hear so online night it asks us to add a
condition inside the parentheses will
say while while loop so the same while
true blood loop run it's true
is that going to print out the loop is
running so echo is oh also wants us to
use some HTML there and as with HTML we
need to do the closing bracket and click
and save save instantly once we get
expected p first child text to be equal
to the loop is roni
alright
period set our issue isaura control c
and our freshest page and a sudden there
should be
so you're still getting an issue here so
let's kind of space this out or fresh
here all right there we go I think maybe
we need to space out the exercise write
your own while loop below the comment
right so we'll say wow that's great a
great a variable in this case well I is
equal to one where you closed 0 we'll
just call I here
good we just have it print out I then
just that I equal to so cool doesn't
actually print out in this case we
wanted to print and we have to use the
paragraph HTML tag all right so convert
your wallet from the last exercise in to
attend while
you
okay so this is just a little bit
different it's kind of the same thing
from earlier and just as a different
syntax so there we go I should work just
fine I personally would you the other
way but uh it doesn't really matter
respect the code that I see if you
understand how it work if you don't no
worries click save us but so let's see
here we are printing out of some text
this is just standard HTML we are then
creating a flip count variable we're
gonna do it a couple times and then if
else now I'll flip it's going to print
out how many flips there was and then
it's going to print out the variables
all right let's see what we got here so
fill in the missing information make
sure you do well look work so the
do-while loop you need our brackets and
always serve as a lot of people office
that any bracket always comes before the
loop condition so let's see we have
linked conditions false well good
condition and good luck with that so
while false do this Oh some early it's
going to run at least one time since
it's false all right filling us and I
think we should be good here
Oh miss that so there we go the loop
brand even a condition false now Lucas
M&amp;amp;E because this is false it normally
wouldn't run but because it's a do-while
it will always run at least once and it
do i'll create a do-while loop below the
comment within the page be married so do
and well we'll just put false save
yourself some time let go actually we
don't actually just put anything in here
so that was while loops in PHP pretty
intuitive you've already done the while
loops beforehand the only thing that may
be a little bit interesting is to sleep
tight but that should just be something
from a HTML CSS course and the next
function there next thing for PHP is
functions so we'll start describing
methods and functions it looks like so
i'll see you guys next up for that
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
