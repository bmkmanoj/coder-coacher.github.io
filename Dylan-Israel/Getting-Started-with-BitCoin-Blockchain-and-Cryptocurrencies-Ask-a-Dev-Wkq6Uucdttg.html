talking about Bitcoin blockchain and
crypto currencies I'm also gonna
introduced you to about five different
resources so that you can learn about it
follow the market just become better
educated about this stuff I think this
is a great area to invest some of your
time and energy to really dive into
something that it's growing and
expanding and maybe here to stay in
terms of blockchain technology there are
jobs that are paying crazy amounts of
money if you can code blockchain we're
going to talk about some of those
resources as well as if you're
interested in investing at the other day
I'm gonna just kind of present you some
resources that I use on a daily basis to
stay up to date on all three of those
things so you may not have realized this
but there are actually a ton of books on
Bitcoin and right now Humble Bundle has
one going on for about the next two
weeks where you can pay what you want
and for a dollar you get six books on
Bitcoin breaking it down piece by piece
I I'm coming in on the $15 tier because
I need the Bitcoin for dumb dummies but
so so you can dive into various aspects
of this Python Bitcoin programming is a
interesting one you can get for a dollar
as well as just building blockchain
products a lot of this is just being
introduced to the technology what
they're about and getting started you
can even start coding your own
blockchain which is pretty cool if you
ask me and as always guys you can donate
your money or rather when you buy you
can choose to give it all to charity and
you choose to give it all to me but if
you're interested in learning more about
Bitcoin and blockchain and crypto
currencies I think this is a pretty good
bundle to get started with so let's
start with coin base if you're not
familiar with coin based coin basis
what's referred to as a wallet which is
exactly what it sounds like it's
basically something that holds your
money kind of like a bank and corn base
has three specific types of crypto
currencies Bitcoin aetherium and
litecoin now there's a ton and we're
going to look at a list of a very large
list in a second about what those what
those coins are and as they're growing
in the market cap and everything and my
cat's about to knock over
my monitors but uh so um usually have a
little bit of money not a little bit I
have a lot of bit of money I invested in
into all of this and I'm I'm really
really just kind of sitting on it I
don't know what I'm gonna do with it
when I buy a house I'll probably cash
out
but coin base is a place for you to buy
and sell crypto currencies it's probably
the largest wallet online that people
use and most trusted I couldn't
recommend it morning if you're
interested to it including my affiliate
link down below when you you invest $100
you'll get ten dollars in Bitcoin and so
will I now let's talk about some YouTube
channels that are really really nice to
to learn Bitcoin there's two main ones
that I watch almost every day and avid
this last week because I've been I've
been kind of grinding it out but there
is box mining whoo
I don't know what this guy does but he's
like traveling to comp I don't know if
he's independently wealthy from coins
he's always traveling to conferences and
checking things out so box mining is
really good he kind of breaks it down he
always gives the caveat that hey this is
just advice because you know he's not
like an investment
genius or anything like that but he know
he knows about the market very detailed
post videos you can see daily almost and
is always talking about what's going I
very very intelligent guy very
passionate about it I couldn't recommend
box money more as well as Ivan on tech
I'm around tech is another great one and
he he's very he's very both these guys
do a very good job of explaining the
market and explaining these very complex
concepts and in it in a a very detailed
manner but really kind of a lot so I've
been picking up acronyms front from here
so uh occasionally they want they will
explain their acronyms there's probably
nothing I hate more than going into a
new sort of hobby and new interests and
then hearing them throw around all these
acronyms and then not be able to follow
along with what that is but so that
there are some acronyms that are thrown
around between here but you'll pick up a
lot of stuff you'll learn a lot of stuff
and this guy's also going to a ton of
conventions and everything so if you're
interested in learning about crypto
currencies on kind of a
basis I'll include their channel links
in the description below now let's look
at how many some of you may have only
been expected then exposed to Bitcoin
right so bitcoins like the big papa
right the og if you will they they
control a ton of the market cap you'll
see right here this market cap they're
number one out of all the coins going
they are the one that are is worth the
most
they control about 50 percent on the
market and what it basically means is
that when it comes to when it when it
comes to cryptocurrency so you can see
there's over a thousand there's really
about a hundred top a top hundred crypto
currencies Bitcoin in Syria are the the
two sort of on top but bitcoin is much
larger than etherium and then you'll see
light going on here as well which coin
base does those three ripple has started
taking taking over as well so the way
that bitcoin has been kind of climbing
has I don't know it I'm still learning
about the technology behind blockchain
it's very interesting because I still
have no idea what's going on with it
which makes it very intriguing because I
consider myself someone who understands
technology to a degree you know being a
developer you have you have a little bit
of an understanding and I'm continuing
to try and educate myself oh here it is
fifty two point three percent of all the
cryptocurrency that basically just means
that of the the market value the money
that is in to this that's how much
Bitcoin is which looks like oh my
goodness almost was it two billion what
am I reading that the trading volume
that has been traded it's two billion
dollars that's helmet that's how much
Bitcoin is floating around it's buying
and selling so people are using this
quite a bit and then over here in the
market cap is that seventy nine billion
dollars is how much money floating
around in Bitcoin which is pretty crazy
you see right now so I actually checked
this out on occasion just because I find
it so interesting because you'll see
trends and you'll see sometimes some
points will go up some coins will go
down it's an interesting way to try and
make money now I say tribe
I'm not trying to give anyone the
investment advice I just kind of think
that hey you should have some money and
everything and try to diversify and this
is something that can grow 25% in the
day and can drop 25% in the day and it
just it's kind of a strange thing as to
what you can get into I get but that's
why I'm trying to present you with the
books and the YouTube channels as well
as this very alluring you know this kind
of reminds me of if you guys ever seen
the debt clock let me see if I can bring
this up there is a debt clock site that
shows you all the all the u.s. debt and
real time and it's intoxicatingly
disgusting so you'll see right here this
is so what this is basically the
national debt going up every every
second and you can see this student net
student loan debt right here the
personal debt per citizen in the United
States of America and this includes
personal debt which can be home you're
your own debt your home your home
mortgage that loan debt credit card debt
so in this country it's supposed to do
the greatest country on Earth the
average person has 56 thousand dollars a
debt which is scary scary scary scary if
you ask me this the average family in
America makes fifty five thousand think
about that for a second then it goes
into tax day I'm working off topic I'll
include a link to this as well because I
think you guys can learn a lot about
what not to do and maybe make educated
decisions about about what you should be
paying in tax or how much you pay in
taxes and what you shouldn't you know
what that works out and who's I am
that's a separate video but some of that
I thought that's something that reminds
me of this although not as detailed
right this is just a table going through
here in bootstrap but you can follow the
market and see how crazy a lot of these
these coins are right a lot of how the
growth on some of these coins and where
they're going and what they're doing and
you know maybe try and follow the
transit
just sort of see oh well this one jumped
10 this one jumped 20 what's going on
here maybe I should get interested like
I don't know what's going on with this
one but this one jump 150 percent in a
week that's kind of insane why is that
right but that's the crazy world of
blockchain and crypto currencies and and
I think we're just sort of getting into
the the beginning stage of blockchain I
know I interviewed I'm forgetting his
his product but basically it one of the
guys I interviewed on my channel he's
building a YouTube that's based off
block chains it has nothing to do with
servers and I remember interviewing him
and he has about 10 employees or ten ten
developers at that time and he couldn't
really clearly communicate the idea of
blockchain and what it was what it's
supposed to be and how it's supposed to
to help
like I guess clearly communicate how it
works at least to me with my limited
knowledge my even more so than then now
but it's something that I I am people
ask me all the time
Dylan are you gonna get into AI are you
gonna get into data analytics are you
gonna get into machine learning if I'm
if I'm going to sort of dive into any
direction it's probably gonna be
blockchain ID now I haven't started
studying blockchain but I can tell you
that I probably will this is something
that I want to have to do research from
a technical aspect of how to get started
but just like anything else as you can
dive in you can educate yourself and you
can learn and you can you get you can
get reward rewarded rather for that time
you spent learning and educating
yourself as I plan to do with blockchain
one day any I guess I just want to do a
little video about crypto currencies
sheriff's someone asked me to share like
a top five cryptocurrency channels and I
don't really watch five I watched about
two to three I watched those two are the
main ones I have two others that
occasionally I'll watch but they don't
put out very good videos be honest with
you Sonny share them and then of course
there's the Humble Bundle as well and
coinbase is another great resource for
people looking at stars so if you're
interested in that I'll include links
down below you can help me out so thank
you so much for watching don't forget to
comment like subscribe and share support
me on patreon and join the Facebook
group I'll uh I'll see you guys next
time let me know what you guys think
about crypto currencies I felt kind of
iffy putting this video out because he
did Scott it is a very risky sort of
investment it uh you know it's worked
out well for other people but I don't I
don't necessarily mine reminding people
to invest but I will say that if you are
getting in if you are getting interested
in the cryptocurrency market and you are
this is undisclosed s is undiscovered
territory guys this is something that
has never happened before and it's new
and I uh you don't know what's gonna
happen right and so if you do decide to
invest your money like I have you know
whatever it is right I started with
three hundred dollars and you know I
steadily grew it but if you do decide to
do that just be aware that you may lose
your money you very well may and so kind
of like gambling only Baja only only
gamble what you can afford to lose so
that's my little my little caveat on
cryptocurrency so thank you guys so much
for watching I'll see you next time bye
quick shoutout to device plus comm if
you're interested in the latest IO tease
hacks do-it-yourself projects revolving
around Arduino and Raspberry Pi there's
some great how-to guides I highly
encourage you to check them out and
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
