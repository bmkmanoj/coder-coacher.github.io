time what we did was we logged out all
the users that didn't exists in our get
JSON duck done function here so this
time what we're gonna do are all the
streams that are currently online so
what we're gonna need to do for that is
a similar for loop and then another get
JSON call because this one's only gonna
work for the ones that succeed on the
second chance so we'll just go ahead and
let's make sure we have our for loop
correctly done alright so there this is
that and then we'll do a for loop here
so let's say for VAR i is equal to 0 Y
is less than following length i plus
plus and currently right now there's one
stream live so well know that this is
working
see
there we go all right so we set up our
for loop this time we're going to do a
get JSON and we're going to pass in
another URL and then we're going to run
a function and we'll call this data for
now let's go ahead and name this will
save our online URL equals
so if this equals to what do we wanna
send it equals to we want to set it
equals to
we want to set it equals to this plus
the following nine
let's
quotation marks are the bane of my
existence all right so we're gonna pass
in our online URL
and what we want to do is just do an if
statement that says if if data for dot
status it's not equal to null
and data for air
it is not equal to true so I'll make
sure that we're not gonna hear
so basically if it's not equal to no
they're currently online so what we want
to do is go ahead and set logo we can go
ahead and do this one more time we'll
probably clean up our variables later on
but because the simplicity we'll go
ahead and just recreate them here reset
them and we'll sit var logo is equal to
data
actually what we can do right now let's
go ahead and pull up real quick and look
at what an online person would look like
so here is the a gentleman who's ESL C
ESL underscore Starcraft 2 is currently
streaming so do we need we need the
status so how do we get to their recall
dot stream or excuse me yeah dot stream
channel dot status dot display name and
dot so let's go logo first will say data
for dot stream dot
where is our logo dot channel dot logo
so before we move forward this
console.log out our logo make sure that
we're getting that save that yeah let's
go to console
and we are not so let's see if this oh
we need to put this false
let's go ahead and get rid of this as
well there that
all right let's do let's get rid of this
channel logo
all right so we're getting an air here
in this comment this out comment this up
save okay so it's getting our logo right
there alright so we can do it without
this if statement cool I was trying to
follow a similar pattern my mistake
there but because we're doing a get JSON
and we're getting we're not having any
issues at all we can do it like this so
this is gonna return all the online
stuff so here's our logo for the ESL
start craft 2 so all we have to do set
status here we'll set that to data for
dot stream dot channel dot status and
let's go ahead and console dot log
status here as well
it's always good to check your code as
you go along really perfect
alright so everything's going according
to plan
so we have our name is equal to data for
dot stream channel dot display I believe
this underscore name
yep alright so we have our name now all
we have to do here is just prepend
exactly how we did before so we're gonna
be copying quite a bit of code maybe it
would have been better do functions and
go through that definitely something to
think about if you're going and cleaning
this up so all we have to do here is
take our follower info and prepend it in
here
and then here we go and then there is
our ESL Sarkar 2 so now we have the one
person that's currently online up next
in the next video we'll do is we'll do
our final our final thing here and we
will get all the guys that are offline
because it does a little bit of a
redirect and we have to actually do a
different get json call because the info
that we're doing we're looking for isn't
located in this specific section but as
always guys thank you for watching and I
will see you guys in the next video
oh and thank you very much - I have two
people that are on patreon the subs now
and that's really cool so thank you a
ton guys I appreciate it hey guys thanks
for watching the video my good friend
Matt an engineer truth has a three-part
interview with Quincy Larson the founder
of free code camp go ahead and check
that out and so you'll get a lot of
really cool stuff thanks for watching
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
