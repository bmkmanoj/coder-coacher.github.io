projectile motion program that I wrote
we're just going to go over the code
real quick this is written in in like
lips with the Python language
specifically we import the PI game
library which allows us to use Python to
make a game basically and that's kind of
why I imported this is my first quarter
ever even using Python so you may not
look perfect but uh I thought it was
kind of cool so I decided to use it
anyhow instead of Java all right so this
is kind of same thing but we're only
important part of our math library which
arctan pi cosine radians sine square
root of power functions so that might be
a little more self explanatory here we
have our screen width and screen height
and this is basically what's going to
define how big our background window is
and the reason this is important is the
units for the projectile are in pixels
per second so the kind of you'll be able
just to tell we're kind of lands how
many pixels it traveled so people over
this stuff so here's our velocity which
is hard code again we could change this
to whatever and then the initial
location no we have some red and blue
these are RGB color and then we have our
degrees which are these are just
placeholders basically our expert is our
initial velocity and our cosine degree
without the t parameter and y parameter
we have the height which I just have it
set to zero but if we wanted to change
the height of it it would change it in
the formula so that would still work you
have constant for gravity which could be
changed if we needed to change the
gravity for instance as requiring your
projectile on Mars or the moon distance
how far traveled the impact speed so in
our main method where it basically calls
our code you have to call in it the
start pygame or else it doesn't work we
initialize an explosion sound for every
time you click the wild tree
this is where all the the bulk of things
are called and here our location we get
our x and y coordinate because when we
click the program that's actually again
does not decide how what angle it is so
we're gonna actually choose our own
angle and it's going to call these
functions that I'm about to go over so
the hardest part of this program was to
convert the angle proportionally based
off how backgrounds and graphs work in
the top left corner it starts at 0 0 and
moves outward and downward which is kind
of counterintuitive at least for me so
we got our rise over run we converted
our angle took the arctan of it we
convert it into radians only convert it
into degrees and then we got the angle
in return so this is how we get an angle
in this case lines and I got some of
this code from invent with Python I just
want to give a don't credit in this case
we're drawing a line so this is what
you'll be able to see exactly where the
angle is and this is where our X and our
wire right here and died here this is
the art lecture show the art it's a
little bit off like I said it's my first
time using it but it still creates a
realistic art based off how it would fly
and the height and everything from the
process so in speed here this is kind of
all our Texas keeps track of all our
parameters that we're going to be
printing in its goods you'll see it
constantly update every time we take a
new click and then in calculations this
is where the bulk of the calculations
get done for our projectile motion you
see here we're setting our calling the
radiant functions to convert the degrees
that we have into radians we're then
taking our speed limit times it by
cosine and then in here just to make it
more simple we create a BA and see in
the quadratic formula for the then we
the same thing with the Y parameter here
that we did with the first sign that we
do with cosine we get our cheap
parameter from the cosine we then get
our distance here and then our impact
speed so and then this just calls it
also when we run this you have a nice
little window nothing too fancy you can
see our cannon at the end here at the
top we have our velocity our angles at
0r heights at 0 T is old so if we go
here here a little cannon sound let's
see how this is our this kind of i
actually just changing the angle and it
just crashed there because i went in the
negative doesn't handle that input but
uh it's a nice little program it could
be fun cleaner you can see in the the
grass background so it's about 700 x 700
and you can see that it's 216 pixels
which looks back so that should be about
four hundred and you can see just by
going across of it is my projectile
