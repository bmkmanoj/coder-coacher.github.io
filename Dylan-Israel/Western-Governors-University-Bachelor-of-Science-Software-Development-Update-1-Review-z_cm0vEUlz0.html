program is going my college program I'm
in a online bachelors program at Western
Governors University and software
development and I thought I'd give you a
little update I've been asked frequently
enough I think I can do a video about it
kind of share a little bit of my thought
process again about why I decided to go
back to school also how it's going in if
I like it if I would recommend it and
what I think I'll get out of it and
while you're thinking about potentially
continuing your own education might I
recommend dev mountain coding bootcamp
dev Mountain comm for more information
where you can learn about full-stack
JavaScript development you can learn
about Quality Assurance Salesforce UX UI
mobile development they have a bunch of
great things and I'm a big proponent of
continuing your education and one way or
other way self-education are through an
additional third-party so check them out
at dev mountain comm okay so as I
mentioned I'm in a software development
program through Western Governors
University and if you're interested in
why I went back to school even though
it's working as a developer I have an
entire video talking about it for about
10-15 minutes just sort of setting my
thought process but and I'll include
that in the description below but right
now it's been about seven weeks in seven
weeks the way that Western Governors
University works is that you pay a flat
rate for tuition about $3500 every six
months and you can take as many units as
you can complete so my goal is a course
every two weeks so I've been pretty
close to that I've done a course two
weeks two weeks in three weeks the three
week one was because my work has a once
a year event that it goes on is the
biggest and busiest week of the year and
they wanted me on site to help out and
your boys a team player so he shows up
right when game day comes you rise to
the occasion when game day happens right
so I was ok with that and so in seven
weeks I have completed
13 units a six unit course a four unit
course in a three unit course and I'm on
track to continue that by finishing up
my next course next week which will be
two weeks from from so in about nine
weeks I live I've completed 17 units and
it's one of the reasons that I enrolled
in the program and it's nice to see that
if you put in a little bit of work and
I'm not like overly killing myself I
still have a full-time job working you
know 40 to 45 hours a week I still have
the YouTube channel which I've been
posting a little less so but I've been
posting one to two videos a week and a
live stream typically it was like around
three videos a week an alive stream so
I've been handling that as well as all
the stuff that goes on in the background
my studying my learning process outside
of school right so in terms of what I
wanted to get out of it which was a
effective way of being able to complete
credits as fast as possible to get that
degree for as cheap and as fast as
possible it's been very effective it was
uh the reason I chose the school to
begin with was the low cost as well as
the the structure of it being that you
can essentially test out of everything
and now I personally I there's some
courses where I think I could just go
take the final and see if I pass I
personally don't do that because I I
don't necessarily like that so what I do
the way that I study for my tests and
they have labs and things like that but
I essentially just do the reading
material and I break it up over ten days
Monday through Friday that's how I look
at it is a ten ten days between two
weeks Monday through Friday every
morning I wake up I spend about an hour
doing my reading if I didn't get my my
ten percent you know the ten days worth
my ten percent of reading and quizzes
sometimes there's online quizzes and
things like that and there's exercises
and some of them as well I don't do the
exercises that no one's got time for
that I'm trying faster classes
right I'm not trying to total my thumb's
doing homework
if I don't need to and so far I haven't
needed to so I do the quizzes helps me
prep and everything and I do my reading
and I have it essentially structured out
for those ten days Monday through Friday
and on the weekends to help me catch up
now I give myself about an hour to an
hour and 15 minutes in the morning if I
get it done really cool I work on a
little bit of YouTube I work on some
courses I'm putting together I've worked
on whatever it is but I'm constantly
working on something to to progress the
career I might read a chapter in one of
the books I'm reading which I'll be
sharing some videos about that down the
road I have four books in the pipeline
right now something I'm trying to
incorporate differently and I'll talk a
little bit about that in a separate
video but um if I get done early great
I'll just go work on something that's
that's not in the same arena as college
if I don't when I get home from work and
this happens because the courses are
some are larger than others right the
course I'm working through right now has
videos it has quizzes that has text and
a lot of that you know sometimes when
you're watching the videos it'll take
longer than an hour maybe maybe it's
actually gonna be a two-hour section
that day I come home and I do the
section then I continue it and typically
I get home around 6:00 I'm in bed by
eight to nine and so I go bed pretty
early I usually will work till about
9:00 on the laptop in bed you know I
have dinner all that stuff so I usually
have about an hour plus after work and
that's usually enough time know in a in
some situations it may not be enough and
that's when I work on the weekends right
so I I will do some studying on the
weekends so far I found this to be very
effective and very accomplishable is
that accomplishable
yeah I have been very successful with
doing about an hour in the morning an
hour after if needed and then continued
continuing on this and it's all about
just taking a look at the section and
breaking it down and this has allowed me
to stay on to my track which is to do a
course about every two weeks now
to give you an idea if I'm able to do
that I should be graduating if I'm able
to continue with the trend of a course
every two weeks I should be able to
graduate before the end of this year
which is fantastic and I could probably
even pick it up pace if I if I wanted to
I've had this idea of using my PTO I
have for those who you don't know I I
have a okay PTO when sick day package of
let's say I didn't take any days for the
year and I use all my sick days my
floating holidays and my my PTO I could
take off approximately an entire month
it's nineteen working days and so I had
this idea where you know what I'm about
seven months in I have about two weeks
off of PTO and sick time not right now
and it's gonna continue to grow maybe
it's for your boy starts thinking maybe
he just takes three and a half weeks off
and just puts in work on these courses
and like is knocking one out every 3-4
days Suzy doesn't have to go to work not
really I want to spend my PTO I decided
but it still is still lingering in there
I might I might get a little aloha get a
little high fee and things might get a
little spicy I might try to knock out
some courses with some PTO for work just
something to something to think about
but yeah so I've been in terms of what I
wanted to get out of it very fact now
let's talk about am i learning anything
and this may be different this may be
because I am I'm working as a software
developer it could be that I am pretty
active in my studies outside of work so
for those you don't know it's only been
about three and a half years since I
really started diving into development
I've been working as a developer maybe
three years I've been working as a
developer for a little less than two
years now and I before that I had a role
for about nine months working at a
software company but not in development
as a as a technical writer essentially
and so I've been I've been exposed to
quite a bit and I've also have been
studying every
day for about three years and that could
be blogs that could be meetups that
could be just coding so III have been
putting in the work that I think has has
paid off amazingly and so in terms of am
i I'm actually learning anything no did
I expect or did I want to learn anything
when I enrolled in the program that
wasn't my objective so I'm okay with
that now would you learn something if
you're just getting started probably
would it stick based off of just doing
reading and quizzes this is where I have
my doubts and this has always been one
of my things with college is that
college in general is not so much about
learning as it is passing tests to say
that you were able to memorize some
content and it hasn't changed in an
online format sadly and sadly to say and
really at the end of the day I'm paying
thirty five hundred dollars to get a
15-minute phone call on Friday from my
course guide
it's very nice does excellent job I have
nothing but respect for him so if you're
watching this man nothing nothing
nothing nothing against you we just as
regice says keeping it 100 but uh
between that you know phone call and a
couple emails here they're getting
started and you're basically doing udemy
courses that you get quit that there's
quizzes and they're not actually udemy
courses but some of them are on like
Linda for instance dot-com
and you're essentially just studying
texts you know a couple chapters and
texts and video courses and it really
makes you wonder why you're paying
thirty five hundred dollars for this and
that and the truth of the matter is
exactly what I said when I told you I
was going back to school is a piece of
paper something that shows the HR
department something that shows you know
upper management at times like hey this
guy's investing in his traditional
education and something to Pat up and
beef the weaker parts of the resume
which is why I'm doing it now could it
change where I do go and learn
something of course it could there's a
I'm only in the fourth course of about
17 or so and maybe it's 16 I forget the
exact amount of courses I need but it
could definitely change but it in terms
of will any of it really stick as a
developer I don't really think so I
think most of the stuff that's gonna
stick is stuff that you actually are
gonna be working with outside of the
workplace and but I I will say I will
say that if you're new to software
development and you just want to be
exposed to a lot of things this course
will do a very or this program will do a
very good thing just between these four
courses I've done two on web dev and
I've done one on sort of introduction to
IT that's like networking server setups
just sort of all the various different
hardware roles that are out there and
the current role its current course I'm
doing is and quality assurance which is
going to introduce you to between you've
been introduced to three sort of supper
topics just in those first four courses
and it's going to continue on with
object-oriented programming UI UX
courses what's some other stuff project
management so you will get exposed to a
lot of things that are pretty relevant
to the field can compare to maybe a more
traditional computer science program
which is going to be a lot of theory
which depending on what you prefer I
prefer more relevant but uh it's any of
it really relevant who knows no but uh
that's not why that's not why I'm here
in the program yeah so that's sort of my
update on on the program I'm very happy
with it just because I have a negative
view point on on college doesn't mean
that I'm not happy with my program I
would actually give the program for what
I wanted out of it and that's really
what you have to ask yourself when you
go and enroll in a bootcamp you go and
take a udemy course you go and you're
going you know go to college go back to
college and online program what was it
that you were hoping to get out of it
for me I was hoping to be able to
cheaply and effectively get my degree as
fast as possible
in that aspect I would give it a a - a
nine out of ten boys that's what I would
give it that's what I want to accomplish
because at the end of the day I'm
already working as a developer I'm
self-taught and even if you go and get a
bachelor's degree and spend four or five
years you're still gonna need to be
self-taught in this industry there's a
reason why on those Stack Overflow
surveys they something like 91% of devs
because themselves taught even if they
have you know 90 even but most of them
have CS degrees like half the people in
there have a CS degree but they still
consider themselves taught because
that's the way the industry you're not
gonna really learn the your inline
Theory mic learning data structures and
algorithms in a CS program which would
be helpful for your technical interviews
but you're not really going to not need
to learn outside of work and that goes
the same for the program so for me in
terms of what I wanted to get out of it
the graduating fastly and cheaply I
would give it a nine at ten and in terms
of the content for the course terms of
learning stuff I would say that I would
give it like a six out of ten maybe and
but that's not why I'm there but if
that's why you're there I you might want
to I don't think you're gonna get better
stuff at any college so I think a six
out of ten is probably think it in
general so those are my thoughts guys I
appreciate you watching this video I'm
very happy with my my current program
and I can't wait to post a video here of
being like I got this never go back
to school
 sucked whatever I will say thank
you so much for watching don't forget to
comment like subscribe share support me
on patreon all that good stuff it has
been a pleasure I will maybe do another
update right around the time I'm done
I'll see you guys next time bye hey baby
what do you think I think about me going
back to school
hey guys if you're interested in nice
JavaScript course I just released my
second course and in here we're actually
going to be breaking down JavaScript as
a language as well as give you some
opportunities to solve some algorithms
and build some build up your github as
well as introduce you a little bit to
markdown there's a link in the
description to get the course for just
$15 if you're interested as always
thanks for watching I'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
