code combat we're gonna be doing doing
logical paths as you can see I already
started it
so I refreshed it we'll do it over again
I struggled a little bit with it a lot
of words to read through so let's go
ahead and run this first see what's
going on here so he moves things here
says here this is 26 24 so if either
secret or an A or B is true tip - so we
do if secret is equally close true or
secret B is equally equal to true
there's a couple different ways you
could do this we'll do it like this we
want to move to 32 33
so move X Y 32
33 so let's go ahead and run that and
see what happens
and then we do a secret B is not true
takes a high five I think we have to
move back down
XY we want to move back down
3725
let's see and then we'll say
see if that's what they wanna see
and then we'll say if secretly it's not
true to type out and we'll say if secret
be
is is exactly equal to false or not true
we'll go ahead and do it like this we'll
do not
not equals true since unlit phrase it
this is also false we've all go ahead
and moved
44:33 alright 44-33 let's go to run it
38:24
oh maybe they wants to do else so else
else move XY 244 15
and around that
and then finally we want to move to 49
24
we're gonna run that one more time
they see 24
there we go
very nice so got a little bit coin I up
next we'll get a logical circle why not
boolean logic variables and basic syntax
trying to open another treasure chest
trying to make that money
sometimes the struggle goes a little
hard alright uh Lou Cox who's led you to
another grill with enough treasure you
just use you answer a few more riddles
using hands and horrors so move the here
I get look if all three values are true
take the high path otherwise takes a
little path
so if secret D so if all these are true
move there else alright so we'll do a
little create next we'll set secret D is
equal to secret a or secret B or secret
C
and I'll say if secret D
else so if one of those is true run that
else so secret a B or C is true take the
left path
it's gonna run the zoo
it's just the left path
but we're back to here if all five
values are true take the high path or
the right stick though
let's go alright I guess this is left so
2025 that's why 2025 else
40:24
I just gotta run that
all right so if all five values
five
around the summer time see what's
discussed it the secrets are true or
true and true is they're all true to my
path
any other secrets there take the left
path if all the values are true takes a
high I think this is supposed to be
three so I say if all five values are
tragic
we still get their secret
all right we'll say if
secret D which is where needed this so
all right we'll try the we'll just put
this secret e all right I see what's
going on down so secretly so what we
need to do is compare secret a B C D and
E so if secret F and they'll say our
secret F is equal to
if we're secret up is equal to secret D
an order a and secret be
and secret see
and secret
d and secret
II so if all these are true
take thy path otherwise to cool okay
so if all are true so I passed it is
back to here
30:33
already
three L's 31:15
3015
hi guys the Semitic see
so I didn't work
secretly is not defined
security
Oh try that one more time
all sorts of false
I know what's going on there
it looks like
our : haywire
it's 40 35
take
so
take the left path otherwise go right
so we moved to 2025
so if secrety is true moved to 2025 it's
false
low-pass
let's go right so let's say 40 25 I
think that's what I wanted
I know sir
oh there we go just messed up a little
bit on the
alright guys we're back in free code
camp backwoods forest we're doing
JavaScript for this one and we are on
logical conclusion let's go ahead and
jump right in
I got the music turned off but I think I
may turn it back on so we need to rescue
Lukas of the class let's see barely hear
that
yes Michael so what we need to do is
from this plot just move here here and
then here based off of the if statements
so say true so we're gonna create a
variable called this is au feet that's
gonna be equal to the result that is if
a or B is true so secret a more secret B
and C is true also be false so we'll do
a man as they seek it secret see think
close that in like so and then on this
guy right here in 2636 we one of them go
ahead
the XY beam
27:37 37 and then we want our hero to
say our variable which is gonna suppose
to be true if we did this correctly so
let's go ahead and we run this and make
sure everything's working this one so
you should go here here so cool next
we're supposed to move the hero to 37 34
so let's go ahead and copy over two
lines of code this'll be easy enough so
we're gonna copy over the move because
he's gonna move no matter what and this
time he's just gonna move to 37 34 and
then we're gonna credit variable and
this one will call Estevan this it's van
and then this a true if it's event a or
she is true so we're gonna
it's a secret a secret see and be your
sister
and secret Easter so our that is one of
dart is one of a or C true or as and is
one of the your sister
that's always
see so there's our variable winning this
it's gonna run it nervous t quite a team
there's that and then finally we need to
do it one more time so we'll just go
ahead and copy over all this this guy's
name is Susilo so let's do that and it's
saying if if a and B are true
all right cool so secret a and then the
secret B or noir or secret be
superbee am being sued for secret B's
truancy
little true and
it's not equal to true
let's bracket all right now let's run
this oh no we gotta move our hero
apparently it wants to see a strictmode
so that's why we have to use the triple
equals we're checking the value and the
type not just right and then finally
where is this
is that 3922 modesty 22 what obtain
change the name here to what guys gonna
say let's go ahead and run it looks like
we did it boys we did it go on to the
kingdom here
shabih submit it finally majesty
for watching the video don't forget to
check out my collaboration with
ericsurf6 going over how to get started
coding and if you're looking for some
coding help go to code mentor using the
annotation or card and if you're looking
for internships or part-time jobs or
full-time jobs as a student or recent
grad check out way up com see you guys
