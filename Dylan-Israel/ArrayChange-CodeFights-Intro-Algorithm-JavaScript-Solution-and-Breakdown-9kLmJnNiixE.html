in code fights exploring the waters of
the intro section array change the
objective here is to the objective here
is to increase we get an array of
integers and we want to know is what is
the minimum number of steps to increase
by one exactly so in this case it'd be
it'd be three in this case it would be
five to fix what's going on here and the
reason for that is we need to increase
the value and we have to increase which
keep track every time we increase it and
so like for instance the reason this
this one is is is five is because we go
zero zero goes zero negative two so we
don't worry about increases here but it
decreases here so negative two has to go
up to one so that's negative 1 0 1 and
then 0 1 2 you guys get the idea so we
have to increase the count basically the
way I did it well while we already use
the word count so if just we have to
keep track of how many times we're
changing it we also need to Suzu we also
need to just iterate for the entire
length of the array minus 1 because the
last number we don't necessarily need to
increase and so let's save our is equal
to or I is equal to 0 while I is less
than input array dot length
this one time plus plus all right here's
the logic if our current value is
greater than our previous value that's
the reason we like to the negative one
because we're going to take care of it
good luck oh excuse me
a little bit sick here so if our current
value you're not going to put a rank is
greater than or equal to remember equal
to it's just as bad so it's still
increased by one the value in front of
it plus one because we have that I plus
one that's where the minus one comes
into place so we don't get any undefined
errors we need to calculate the
difference so we'll have this difference
and that's going to be the imp the
current item plus one minus the in
tinnitus the pre the upcoming index
array so this is our difference which is
the input array I plus one and then
we're going to from here minus the index
in front of it
so that's our difference and then we're
going to set we're going to set the
infant or a I plus one equal to the
current value of I plus one meaning and
then we're going to set count plus equal
to difference so let's talk about this
because all we have left to do right now
is return count and we'll set that up
but let's kind of run through the logic
real quick so if our current item is
greater than our item in front of it we
need to do something right because it
needs to be increasing so to do that we
calculate the difference where we say
hey we need it to be one item bigger
than our previous item so that's where
this plus one comes from and we need to
know what that difference is so that we
can add it to count as well as set the
value down the road so we're going to
say look the value of our current are
the item in front of it is actually the
item behind it plus one that's what
we're saying and we have to do that so
that it's kind of backwards compatible
so it compares with the item in front to
in front of it of the item one in front
of it and we set that difference here
let's go to run our test make sure I
have any yes
we have right here I just listened and
hopefully that's it submit but that's
the idea when I originally tried to do
this I kept on trying to splice all
these numbers into an array and I got
time there's a bunch other stuff it was
a silly way of going about it it's much
this is a much better way of doing it
I'm sure there's other ways as well I
hope you share them in the comments for
everybody as always thank you for
watching the video don't forget to
comment like subscribe and share and
even though I'm sick I'm trying to power
through and work and all that sort of
stuff some of you guys are working hard
as well join our Facebook group join our
discord channel if you
the money and we'd like to support me at
patreon.com slash going towards 360 I'll
see you guys next time hey guys thanks
for watching the video special thanks to
our sponsors dev Mountain if you look
for a coding bootcamp or tuition and
housing is included definitely check
them out
appreciate it I'll see you guys in the
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
