little menu now we're going to tackle
this first page we're not going to make
it exact we're going to try and just
power through the bulk of it and come
back and style it and much much more
detail later but we're definitely going
to do some styling and then next video
will do that so we're going to redo this
first page you can see I pulled up some
images for a background so the one I'm
going to use for my homepage is right
here also if you want to get any good
high-resolution you know pixel images
this one for instance these are all free
copyright free images from the community
at unsplash.com great resource for
websites and web design be able to have
such nice images for almost anything so
here we go so the way I did this
originally was I created a page one
class and so I did dot page one this is
just each one of these pages just going
to have a class it's just the easiest
way to do it and then we'll say
background
art background : URL the semicolon to
end the statement and in here we are
going to put on around if I did this yet
boom all right so it's not just playing
codes we're not using anywhere so cool
down below here what are we going to do
we want to put in a div with the class
equal to page one
we want to close our div so our
background is not working why is it not
working so looking in my case I've
already kind of done this with a
different image I'm changing it up so
background spelt correctly page one is
spelt correctly let's see here first
page background URL maybe it's because
this is a short link that'd be it let me
try a different back out
you know it probably cuz there's nothing
in here hey hey hello since this
happened to me earlier hello world so
let me try this this background from my
different site from the same site but it
works it's working over here okay so
somehow that image is not displaying so
let's go ahead and see why not okay so
this is the URL that we need right here
cool so I think it was just such the
short URL that might have been throwing
it off okay so that one's displaying so
the issue we want display for a certain
height so okay so we're not supposed to
really want to do these sort of height
things but for the for the background -
sighs we're just going to use cover here
so we're going to say background - size
cover and then we'll take a look and see
where we're at so you can see right now
it's not as distorted with still really
short so why don't we give it a height
of let's see if this does we'll do it I
don't I think it's gonna stay the same
size because this is how big it is so we
have to hard-code some pixels so we'll
say 800 pixels cool so now when we look
at our code here you can see that it's
quite it's got 800 pixels stuff and it
looks very very nice so I'm looking at
the menu now and I'm not liking it it
looked good before but I think what we
need to do is make it so that this black
bar is no longer black and we kind of we
want to make it a little bit transparent
so when we look over at my code here
because I did this yesterday there's the
opposite opposite see the
I hate being saying things wrong on on
channel but all right so nav pills so we
want to give it just op CF 27 the only
thing is that wasn't that doesn't look
good so
and worry about that another time like I
said we want to kind of breeze by here
and do this so the way I did it if you
remember correctly now we have like a
name here I just did my name you can use
like maybe you have a maybe I can do a
coding tutorials 360 site but I'm just
gonna use my name for now so we want to
add a big h1 element and so instead of
this hello world let's add a h1 + 8 + H
sauce h1 and we're just going to say and
also for the font - family we can kind
of control exes out just say look man
everything in the body is going to be in
here unless stated otherwise so
what happened here
all right so it looks like this is
getting off a little bit there's
probably a million ways we could handle
this better than what I'm going to do
right now but this is how I'm still not
the best at CSS so we're going to do
minus 10
let's see if this work - 10 % there you
go so oh that actually looks not too bad
once we do it like that we got rid of
the black background and we overdid it
with that I could I can get down with
that
that looks nice all right let's boogie
I'm game so I might change the color of
it a little bit later so cool so what do
we want to do for our and Dylan C Israel
so we're or is it - 10 % might have been
too much so R Us
actually let's try this so we'll say
let's say well we want to do is check
the h1 to say that we don't need any
padding so h1 padding:0
all right ash top:0px
all right there we go so we still have
our black thing so I think bootstrap
automatically sets it h1 to give you
some padding we don't want that so
that's why we set it like that what next
so here's our heading but we want it
kind of in the center here so how do we
do that and also let's put this font
family back in to now that we know where
what was breaking our thing back into
body because we want everything font
family body and we want to say on
default we want everything on do color
on default is white so there we go so
let me look back at my notes here but I
think what I did was I created a little
bit here this pulled up right here so in
this one I created just a little bit of
box with some CS and made it a little
bit see-through and then we're going to
put our links below and I didn't I
didn't really put a line but if they
make me down the road going to submit
this I will so let's go back to it so we
have Dylan C Israel and I guess before
we do anything we might as well just to
create our buttons real quick so like
bootstrap also has a class for buttons
so it's still going to be in the same
page one so we're going to set up a div
here excuse me a div class equal to
button list so this is how they this is
one way to do it if you're used in
bootstrap close the div and then how
many buttons do we want so we want a the
way they do is they're not actually
buttons they are 8a tags so you have it
a class is equal to but BTN and BTN
default - default so they're going to
look like buttons but technically
they're not buttons they are URLs that
have been styled so that's that's what's
going on here that's why it's kind of a
everything so href
equal to and then we have so I think the
first one is Twitter slasher you see
right here there's Twitter it's going to
take us somewhere let's go ahead and
copy this a few more times so we have
and you know what we're not going to be
mess with JavaScript too much so let's
give ourselves a little bit more room
here all right so we're just going to
copy and paste about three or four times
and change the value here and then we're
going to style it to the way we want so
first one was Twitter next one is github
next one is LinkedIn and next one for me
is you to calm you to slash coding
tutorials 360 am I look a little big but
hey and then finally was the last one we
have we do a Facebook I use Facebook and
we could do a that's good uh looks like
Google+ but I don't really use it unless
it's for you too and it's all the same
okay so cool let's we created our
buttons here it is alright that looks
really bad
let's take out the YouTube take out
YouTube cool um so for me I wanted these
to have a black background because I was
going to for the buttons I wanted it to
be very visible so let's go ahead and
change here
250% is pretty good so I want to change
this to a black background so I'm just
going to target the same thing so I'm
going to say for any BTN default so
we'll say dot V TN - default and we want
to say background - color and we just
want to set it to black cool it's up to
you whether or not you want to keep the
border color I do not so I'll say border
we do border
I think it's board - color black or you
could also probably the better way to do
it is none oh no that doesn't want all
right then just black all right um I
also want to change it to this blue so
all the buttons we're going to be blue
anything you can click I wanted to be
blue like that let me see what the to
get that color it's need this so we also
want to say when that - font and then we
want to say do we already have an a tag
anywhere I don't believe we do but any
link by default on our page I wanted it
to look blue so that's what you can do
here is we're going to add the a tag and
say color blue not what I wanted to do
so maybe we have to do it in the BTN
default so let's try this color all
right there goes these are a little bit
too small for my liking so we will do
size 1.7 m we'll see how that looks I
think that might be too big
font - sighs that's all of us so your
font - sighs that's not too bad
okay cool so we've kind of got this
together um this is a little bit too
small for what I want so let's make a
little bigger so h1 we will say font -
sighs - about Oh 2.0 m I want this to be
pretty big
oh it's already maybe it's just not big
enough for my taste
5 m turn em pow mmm levels over 9,000
all right uh let's do 7.0 M I wanted to
be lit and then a 5 minutes enough okay
cool so below this I wanted a Seine
so let's go back over here and under
under over here I wanted to put an H -
or we can just move nh-2 / H - and this
I just wanted to put something I sounded
slick always learning always always
evolving
so this will I put make this H I want
this to be slightly smaller there we go
cool so probably a good point to save
here so last thing I want to do is put a
box around this so how do we do this we
are going to put a div that's what's
pretty much it put a div and we are
going to give it a class I give it the
class what did I give it what did I name
my original div road rage maybe I just
called it block so block so div class is
equal to block and now we have to go
over here and define block so block
so first thing I want to do is we want
to say background - color is black so
you can see right here it takes all of
it but we don't want the whole thing so
next thing we want to do is make it a
little bit see-through
Oh point seven so when I meant so it's a
little bit see-through nice that's kind
of what we want we probably want to give
it some padding uh also we can we want
Center it so boot shop comes with a
class over here for block of a class
called Tech Center
so this will now Center the text to
where it needs to be so that's kind of
cool
so we'll actually give this to our BTN
list so we'll say a text Master Center
as well and now that should Center all
our stuff ok cool but uh not exactly
what we want still what else do we want
we want um we want the corners to be
curled but we also want we don't want it
to go across the entire page how do we
go about that all right guys so our page
is slowly coming together what we want
to do next at least in my case is I want
to break up this background a little bit
I just want to I want to cut off the
edges so how do we do that so there's a
couple different ways um again there's
probably better ways of doing this so
the first thing I want to do is I want
to give it a little bit of padding so
you can see right here there's not much
padding on it one so let's go ahead and
that was our block class so we're gonna
give us some padding around all edges of
about 25 px so now when we look at it so
oh it's a little that's a lot let's try
15 Justine's a lot too so let's do 10 so
now that looks good so what else do you
want to do we can limit the width of it
we can say or actually what we should do
is look up the display properties just
visit div display HTML is that it let's
see here
play inline splice block okay let's see
if we can do that so we'll start display
block
not let it work in line oh so that got
rid of our thing there I wonder why
display flex inline-block slicin Eliza
hmmm what I'm trying to do is get a so
that it fits in here
okay so we'll do it the bad way I was
hoping to show a better way but for me I
just set the width to a percent so we
say width of 50%
now for some reason that has
shifted it so what we want to do here is
we want to set in block margin - right -
Auto and one set margin - left - Auto
and that will recenter it right there
cool
so we have it it's a little bit bigger
than we would want but the corners
aren't curved and I want it a little bit
less see-through so let's bring that up
to 0.8 even maybe 0.9 not by nice too
much all right so how do we curve the
corners all right so this is what border
- or radius is 4 and we're going to put
maybe 5 pixels you can see it curved
right there let's see if you want to see
a way curved and we can do like you can
do it in percent - like 25% you can see
right there the curve so in our case we
we just need like maybe 2% or 5% that's
way too much 5 pixels is perfect for 10
pixels is even more perfect okay cool so
we have the curved corners that we like
and everything and we are going to a lot
of padding we're next we need to Center
it in this page so how do we do that
then that's kind of the end to the first
page so we can do that like this margin
- top auto
origin pot bottom although and I didn't
work sad face
so why did that work when we go to diff
class page one
hmm
let me look back at what I had here I
think I just shot it down from the top a
little bit okay
so I thought I did Auto I didn't so what
I did here was I actually just said look
man send this negative 100px
oh why isn't that working what am i
doing right here
oh I did work alright we need to do plus
100 that moves the block hmm
okay so we're struggling here for a
second
