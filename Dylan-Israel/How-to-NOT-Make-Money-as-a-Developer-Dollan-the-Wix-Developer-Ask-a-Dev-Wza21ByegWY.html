how not to make money as a developer and
it's kind of crazy right so I have to
actually call in my boy doe lon to to
tell us a little bit about how to heem
it he doesn't make any money now he's
gonna tell you about how to get that
money but really he ain't making no
money he sleeps on my couch right so
maybe you're the type of person who
doesn't you know a little bit of a money
hipster who enjoys being broke maybe a
type of guy who like who likes to grind
pretends like he likes her because if
you're grinding you eventually get out
of the grind
but maybe the type of guy who who likes
Top Ramen
the only likes Top Ramen maybe the type
of guy who likes being in debt maybe
some guy likes sleep on my couch maybe
type guy that likes barn money from
friends and family and all the
awkwardness that comes along with it
maybe type guy that finds it exciting
when your car breaks down so we're gonna
talk about all the ways that you can
make sure that that in your life
continues based off learning but but
maybe you're also based off learning the
wrong skill but the problem is is that
when you're learning the right skills
you're learning the skills that are in
demand that the job market wants people
want to pay you for that people want to
pay you a good salary a lot of times
because it's what that's in demand it's
what they need is what the shortage of
developers are and so what we're gonna
talk about today is how you can still
learn and a specific topic that you can
learn while still making no money
because I want you to get educated and I
also want you to make money but if you
just want to get educated
we got dole on to hook you up with that
next
so Dylan asked me to tell you a little
bit about how you can make that money as

bread as a week's develop I'm gonna tell
you so first off some of you may have
been wondering don't long where you been

life some of you may have heard of the
unlimited PTO so Dolan's been unemployed
unemployed and has been enjoying his
time with someone limited PTO so but

you the way
question number two you might ask Dolan
Dolan if you learned something why not

wants to make that money we ought to
talk about the money we got the other
thing don't long what what where's the
job security job look when there's only
four developers we're all in a group
chat it's just us four there's only four
of us Wix developers you could be the
fifth one you change the game you'd be
developer number five no more job
security
when they're it's only for you all right
single digits you can count the amount
of people that do this stuff on one hand
talk about the amount of jobs for those
five people for soon to be five you'd be
number five and in an industry that
could at any moment explode
don't loans getting a little hot so it's

quick so all right so don't one's gonna
tell you is number one number one tip to
make that money
the Chetta the bread cut the checks well
Dolan doesn't really get checks usually
don't like gets paid in cash sometimes
five sometimes tens usually once so
number one way to make money as a waste

right Dolan doesn't even do wicks don't
do so how would you use this works
this what Dolan does Dolan says hey I
got you right so Dolan sends over a
quote for a thousand dollars they say
why so much before that Dolan goes on
goes on to the internet buys the
template for fifty dollars and then when
they say why so much don't let says

takes time to make this all right
after that Dolan just gets that one
