everything in between
welcome to the weekend livestream it is
approximately 8:00 a.m. I am tired it
has been a long one say stressful
my job isn't really stressful but it's
been a long week and I'm happy that the
weekend is here yeah why everyone's kind
of funneling in a little bit of what
I'll be doing this weekend I have two
sponsored videos I have to work on so
thank you to the sponsors they haven't
paid me yet so that's why we're not
saying the sponsors name but there are
only two sponsored videos coming out I
also have an audition video I have to do
for Pluralsight I'm trying to become a
crater on plural sight and so I've made
it to the second stage which you submit
it basically attended me the audition
tape to kind of showcase your skill
showcase your teaching style I also have
to study for those of you know don't
know I'm back in school I'll be taking
my very first test which is a
introduction to web dev course that is
very very basic but I am studying this
weekend to take my test on Monday and I
will finish - I will finish my very
first units which is three unit course
in for my web dev class which is a
software development Bachelors of
Science so that's what I'll be doing
this weekend as well as this livestream
how is everybody what is on your mind
what shall we talk about
there was one topic that I wanted to
talk about and I think it's a good one
and I do mean this excuse me why I allow
myself one monster on a Saturday and one
monster on a Sunday to reward myself for
working hard most of the time so the
topic today that we're going to start
off the video with is what I would learn
if I wanted to break into the industry
the industry being web dev software
technology software is mainly whatever
- here let me go ahead and close my
blinds real quick there we go so the
reason I would what I would learn is at
this time anyhow and this is a very very
rapidly growing space but I am I would
be learning solidity I would be learning
cryptocurrency I went to a a talk and I
did a little bit more research on my own
and on average the growth in the
cryptocurrency space for its develop at
standpoint is very good and on top of it
on average or getting paid so arby's
between 10 to 20 percent along with
better benefits now that means you have
to pick up some stuff that's a little
bit new solidity is one of them that's
used to write etherium contracts besides
that I really couldn't tell you too much
but that would be the direction I go in
because you're gonna one have a little
bit a little bit of an easier time
because there's gonna be less applets
you have people like me are still
relatively new to the industry who maybe
are getting comfortable or maybe who
just don't feel like going into
cryptocurrencies maybe they're happy
with their job but maybe you that and
and and on an on a side note I went to a
meet-up if you guys still know sometimes
I post to my community page I want you
to meet up last night and there's three
software companies three very reputable
interesting software companies looking
to hire junior developers and developers
so if you're not going to meetups and
you're not doing that and you're really
looking for work I mean there's nothing
they were taking resumes the people
you'd be working with we're taking
resumes you basically have an inn so I
hope you take advantage of that but on
that tangent but if I was going to dive
into into this space kind of my game
playing anyhow is I my current next
years is devoted to getting my
bachelor's after that I actually planned
to jump into the cryptocurrency space
I've been talking about this for a while
but it
if you're looking for something so not
only can you front-end for these
companies that are crypto base you could
probably do a little bit of the etherium
contracts and everything else in between
so I just wanted to kind of bring that
up because I think a lot of people you
know we all hear all these buzz words
when regarding the crypto currency but
in terms of and by the way I encourage
you do all your own research about this
but in terms of the pay in terms of the
benefit the opportunity it's a great
space to jump into so let's see we got
some questions coming in here so react
yes and angular well it depends on what
you're trying to do I personally like
angular and people who do react will
tell you will react is so much lighter
than angular it's like it may be at like
inception but when I have to go form out
twenty third party plugins I'm not
really stoked about that I'd rather have
my 30 plugins that are made by the same
developing team and have to worry about
it so that's just my personal opinion
having been on your channel for a while
good work bro how are you doing in the
work first I'm doing excellent I've I
have a relatively high salary for my
income from my years of experience I am
I recently changed jobs about four
months and when I accepted that my
current job I ain't total had three
different offers on the table at the
same time life is good
I have no I have no complains jauntily
counter strike no I don't really have
too much time for gaming I occasionally
hear there might play a little bit of
Civ if I get kind of burnt out but now
that I'm back in school I won't have
much time how much learning is enough to
get a job you will know that answer when
you know that answer so it really
depends on what you're trying to do what
you're trying to get into and I know
that's not an answer you want you want
to say you need to study for six hours
for three months four days a week and
then magically a job will show up at
your doorstep with a nice salary good
benefits and an excellent employer it
doesn't work like that I mean you have
to constantly be learning for the rest
of your career and that goes that goes
very well with when you're starting out
in the industry when you're starting out
when you're trying to get that first
role
just keep learning just keep progressing
eventually you'll get a job react first
angular versus you for beginners reactor
angular don't even worry about view
there's no jobs in view in comparison so
that would be it how many app how much
how many hours do you code at work like
in a 40-hour workweek I'm probably doing
about 25 hours of coding realistically
maybe 30 and a good week hey man love
your content I started programming
channel I would love to collaborate if
you're up for that do you have a cut-off
for subs before you might consider
coming up with 600 cool well john g
fischer can I just say congratulations
for you actually started an channel so
many people say they're going to do it
it has been one of the biggest biggest
success stories in my personal life just
being able to have a platform where I'm
constantly learning and it has been an
excellent portfolio piece for me so
congratulations to you John for starting
a channel in terms of collaborating I
you should just if you have 10 percent
of my subscribers and or higher I'm
happy to collapse oh but if you know
just shoot me a message I usually I used
to say 1000 subscribers just because I
wanted to make sure the person was
dedicated so hit me up around a thousand
and if I if I have time we'll do it if
not just just keep harassing me John
we'll get something together you know
maybe I can do an interview or I go in
your channel you can go on mine we'll
figure it out
oh yeah works on that John where could I
get the courses after tutorial what do
you mean PHP in 2018
I mean PHP isn't going anywhere right
now unfortunately how learn bootstrap or
just copy/paste from there right well
you have to understand is bootstrap is
nothing more than a CSS library it's pre
defined CSS classes most of the time
there's some components but for the most
part and what you really need to do is
learn it's okay to use it that's
but it's you just have to learn what you
want to use out of it a lot of times
like I use a lot of the buttons I use
the containers I use the cards but I
wouldn't spend a ton of time learning
bits show typically how I learned
bootstrap is I go to get bootstrap calm
and then I go and I was like do they
have a button that looks like how I you
know do they have a dark button or do
that what are their buttons look like
how do i how do I make a block little
button I'll just go and I search through
the documentation and see what it is I'm
looking for what projects would I
recommend building
I'd recommend building unique projects
if you're if you're doing front-end web
dev you definitely enough to incorporate
some Web API a unique project is
something like a I was saying I did a
pulled the other day about projects that
I thought were unique I did a pokémon
pokédex project that's gonna be
something that I'm going to work on I
also have a crypto currency chart
project something gonna work on those
both use API and then I have a developer
tools project or something I'm working
on all of which are unique you're not
really gonna find a tutorial for most
that kind of cool things but really
really what I would suggest if in a
perfect case is start a long term side
project for me hey Tito for me that is
that's YouTube that's why it's been so
great is it's been a project that I have
consistently worked on for over two and
a half years now and I mean continue
grow we doing buddy daddy was in the
zone
you're messing him up now all right yeah
come here Emily on my left but but that
would be what I would use if I would try
to define a project that would start
lunker and let's say that you're
interested in cryptocurrencies build it
a cryptocurrency related site that has
charts and analytics and then as you get
better maybe it's just a front-end
application right maybe it's just
something that shows at a table of data
and then you're like okay you know I
want to build charts now you're
integrating Google charts just say you
know what now I want to integrate
authentication now you're learning node
Express passport je s and now and oh oh
off and you're you're allowing users to
log into
your website your web application so how
do you get to get offers uh I don't know
I think it is really just there to store
your code show that you code but they do
have job apps on there any any website
for practice exercise to advance your
knowledge yeah so the if you're just
looking to practice algorithms the site
I have done in the past is code fights
if you're looking to get exposed to some
concepts and projects and and algorithms
and you know tutorials free code camp
org is my go-to choice you're my
inspiration sir well thank you very much
I appreciate that
it's so strange to hear people say that
cuz it's like I'm just a guy who got
sick of sleeping on the couch yeah
that's a guy who was like look man I'm
gonna drop out of college and I'm gonna
go be a developer because I ain't
learning in school and I'm gonna go
and I'm sick of being broke sick of
delivering pizza so it's very
interesting when people say that because
I'm just like look man I just didn't
want it to live for pizzas anymore
I just didn't want to be in school it
after I learn HTML CSS JavaScript PHP
what can I do next sir well I would say
pick up a JavaScript framework which
would be should be angular or react and
then I would say pick up the layer valve
for PHP that would be my suggestion
based off that what you've said they're
having a hard time learning JavaScript
in any such able able learn it yet John
so the thing with your very first
programming language is you're gonna
need to really hack away at it for every
day every day until it clicks and a lot
of times people will click all kind of a
lot of times people will kind of say
they're studying but really they're
taking days off or they're doing 20
minutes every two days or something like
that that's not enough you got to put a
couple hours in every day for a couple
months usually and then I'll click and
that's just the truth of the matter so
it's a you're reprogramming your brain
how to thing
my boy psycho tronic is the only one on
Twitter yes that is it in fact I just
seem good
if I had to guess what's happening with
your your issue here s ji ki duniya is
it probably just shows you the last
console log just console run that in the
JavaScript console in the console in the
browser and you'll see that it should go
based off of you have here I'm assuming
it's a console log statement within the
for loop 1 to 9 there yeah like that's
very uh I want to know in your opinion
how many hours per day should you be a
minimum of coding to make good progress
and how long well really I'm guessing
that the first step is to really get a
job as a developer and I would say on
average 4 hours a day until you get a
job that would be my honest-to-god
answer and you know maybe because you're
if you were like me
I was working when I I was working a
40-hour full-time job basically a
nine-to-five got to put in about 3 hours
a day I would say on the weekdays so if
you do three hours on the weekdays after
work and usually like 6:00 to 9:00 so
that I was chilling and then you could
on the weekends put in like 12-hour days
which you know or eight for people who
aren't like does it degenerate coders
like me who just dive in deep
for hours upon hours that would be good
try to put three to four hours a day
until you get a job until then you can't
stop that's how I look at it and
oftentimes the people who I've mentored
for those who don't know I do like one
hour mentorships were I do these left
part of the reason I do these live
streams because I charge ninety dollars
an hour for them and so not everyone can
do them so I try to answer questions
here but sometimes people want to sit
down and at just you know will shoot the
 for ninety minutes they'll get to
pick my brain about anything they want
and often times it's about getting a job
and what I've noticed
having done about 30 of these
is that the people who have been
successful are the people who have
actually followed through on my advice
and not made excuses so when I say yeah
you're gonna need to put in three to
four hours a day until you get a job the
people that do that they have no problem
in a job they're constantly progressing
had an exponential rate because they're
not stopping it's kind of like going
back and learning math and it's like you
need to learn certain parts and progress
but if you keep forgetting in the
previous part it slows down your
progress now what I've noticed is I
follow up on occasion with some of these
people who you know most like hey you
know how's it going because I want to
make sure that they're they're doing
well and whatnot and every single time
the people who are not coding me whether
I get the excuses come out the the oh
you know well I have really stressed out
so I had to go camping for the weekend
and blah blah or you know then this
happened and you know my you know I'm
working all the time I'm tired so I'm
you know just studying on the weekends
only and those are the people who don't
get hired or they start making excuses
well I know this one girl and she got
hired with just this how come I have to
work so hard and she got curious about
that like first thing we're talking
about you if you're looking about if you
if you're going through life and you're
like hey who got the easier route if you
think you're getting the easy right if
you're expecting the easy route you're
in for a very hard time what system do
you recommend iOS or Windows those are
two completely different things
I I so I personally prefer Windows was
not going to matter is the answer
so if your so the advice for change
delay searching for things psychotronic
I would first go and educate yourself a
little bit better about what functions
exist go through the JavaScript
documentation for instance just be like
okay what what are the what are the
major array methods or the major string
methods what are the major number
methods I mean there's really three or
four data types in JavaScript
I would definitely familiarize yourself
with what those are just existing you
don't have to know back-and-forth just
know like hey wisss is there a way for
me to reduce an array of numbers to a
single number and just like oh yeah
there's reduced let me go check out the
documentation real quick is there a way
for me to create a new array that I just
add one to all the value so yeah let me
go take a look at map is there a way to
filter out all the odd numbers from an
array oh yeah let me go look I remember
the array there's a rate filter that
does something like that that would be
my advice just go and become more
familiar with that and I think you'll
you'll spend less time searching for
those sorts of things
first check documentation to start
coding I I mean honestly you can do both
but a lot of times people never actually
go through the documentation by the way
I'm guilty of this as well
Oh when I was starting what I you know I
recently went through all of the
documentation I've six hours of
JavaScript videos and I'm all it is it's
part of my hundred algorithm course that
I'm working on I originally was thinking
about doing a standalone JavaScript
course I don't think I'm gonna do that
what I think I'm going to do like a
learn everything about JavaScript course
what I think I'm going to do is instead
a hundred algorithm course for the first
six hours of course would break down all
the functions and the language let you
know that they exist and then we'll go
through a hundred algorithms or 50-hour
those like this is how I solved it here
are the things see if you can solve it
if not you know here's my solution video
but how many languages do you code I
really just code in JavaScript if you
count typescript as a language
typescript but that's really really
where I'm I mean I could I used to do
PHP at my last job but I mean I'm a
front-end developer 99% of the time
we're gonna be doing now
you're playing changing from windows
iOS's most developers and structures I
see are using iOS that's one of those
things that you guys a lot of times
people are worried about too much is Oh
what tools are they using what what
operating systems are they using and
they're so worried that they're using
windows instead IO so using ohio's
instead of Windows they never get around
active learning into code
it honestly doesn't matter I mean people
at my work used I would say the majority
of people in my work use Windows but the
majority of the front-end devs excluding
myself use Mac so I was assured c-sharp
no I did do some C++ back in the day
school is doing very well by the way I'm
supposed to be taking my first test on
Monday I've been I set up my first
semester if you will basically I'm
enrolled in three classes but I'm hoping
to get about nine done my goal is to
have a course a week of course every two
week but right now I will have a course
I will finish my first course after a
week and I continue on do my freelance
sort of often times I mean I'm open to
it but very rarely is there a project I
want to work on and very rarely when
people asked me in YouTube chat if I
free if I can freelance for them are
they willing to pay my hair really great
my hourly rates ninety dollars an hour
so if that's something that you can pay
and that's something that that sounds
like ok yeah you know let's get Dylan on
the case hit me up I guess but yeah so I
like when I've done freelance I've done
contract work it's 90 dollars an hour
and I recently did some not too long ago
for my old work they needed me to they
had a deadline they were trying to
impress a client and they needed me to
do something with one of the systems
that I worked in
when I was employed for them so I'm good
I'm excellent man I am a I this has been
a strange week at work so it's been the
great I've been loving my job as this
last week or two has been strange I
think it's because I'm back at school
what's the answer is the question in the
title crypto currencies that's that
that's the answer that's the industry
that you I would focus on and the the
sex the things I would study such as
solidia m-- or solidity excuse me my
college a C++ this semester but I won't
start web ever you do C++ in web dev
dotnet so it's mainly the backend but
yeah free code camp for projects for
practice projects but when you're
actually going and building your own
there's not gonna be a guide for that so
my college is going great I'll be
finishing up my first course I'm taking
my first test on Monday and if I pass
which I expect I will I've been studying
for a week
in web dev got if I don't pass I'm just
gonna go hand in my two-weeks okay look
man I failed I failed my web dev Const
hey hey God no I got it I can't take I
can't take your money
I guess shaker but I failed that the
introduction to web dev course here's a
refund in about two weeks
um but yeah I out so I'll pass it it is
it is something that I've been studying
just to make sure cuz a lot of times
it's not that I don't I'm worried that
oh man this test is gonna be so hard
it's just that even go so I went through
the reading and I've done some cards
which are like study aids and I'm doing
the quizzes and a lot of it is just like
poorly worded questions that you're like
well it could be three of these four
answers that's like well which one is
the best one well that's kind of a
matter of opinion
in my opinion is this or just like you
know in which and what what of these
elements like
which one of these are likely not to
render and it's like tables because
tables apparently in HTML 4 was an issue
it's like they're rotating HTML
4 so it's just a little bit of like
outdated knowledge that if you weren't
in the industry you wouldn't know how do
you manage time management I don't watch
TV and I'm always progressing that is
really it you don't really need to
manage your time so much if you are
constantly just working on things like
you know I'm just like okay well I and
when I to put caveat when I do feel like
I'm getting sick of something like let's
say I've been solving algorithms for
like six weeks I'll switch to project so
I get stuck on a project I'll halt the
project
I'll goes back to algorithms there's
something else I'm always trying to keep
it fun I went to a meet-up on Thursday
you know it's always progressing is kind
of the goal how do you transfer to
tutorial coding to your own coding
without needing to watch tutorials you
just start breaking down the projects
piece by piece and no you know drop draw
so why are friends try to understand
what it is that you're building and what
are all the pieces that need to connect
right think of it as a lego project
right usually when you start Legos you
start at the foundation or you start you
start building out little pieces piece
by piece until they're they're done then
you slowly start building out those
sections and connecting them have you
tried any ler yes I currently work in
angular every single day and that is uh
what I do
am i intentionally ignoring your
questions I've really answered literally
every question on here yeah and also it
dude this is not your stack it's not
Stack Overflow your for loop is breaking
from what I can tell because you don't
have any brackets and you just have a
semicolon after your for loop which
makes no sense which legging is have
worth it in 2018 I mean a lot solidity
which is a cryptocurrency contracting
company for aetherium there's JavaScript
slash typescript
those are some some I would have to do
more research so I haven't followed up
but honestly C++ C sharp I already look
first office is a far I've already
answered your question C++ is used in
web dev with dotnet
how'd it get project for skill
enhancements is any website they even
tell just start building things
it's just decide on something start
building um I mean honestly yeah so the
first project I ever did web developer
by the way I'm surprised don't you were
the you were able to get that that name
the first project I was I was ever able
to do was the weather API project on
free code camp and there's about ten
front-end projects on there which is why
you do those projects that kind of prep
you for being able to go and build your
own and so that's really what you have
to do is just kind of slowly ease
yourself in in you know that first
project that you're kind of doing that
you know the weather API portfolio it's
gonna be a little bit intimidating
you're gonna have that blank text editor
and you're gonna like your pants to
be like oh my god I don't know what the
hell I'm doing I don't know where to get
started that's okay don't don't don't
panic right just take a deep breath and
I start breaking down everything piece
by piece and that's where I would start
and then when you get it done with those
first ten projects you should be able to
piece things together on your own a
little bit easier and then that's when
you can build out real projects real
portfolio projects what are the
opportunities in crypto in the future a
ton one you could start writing
contracts to you do the front end and
the back end project management these
are companies that are exploding from a
technical standpoint you can take
front-end you usually will pick up
against lid solidity or another that's
that's the main one from what I've know
and by the way I'm very I'm not super
educated in this I just went to a
meet-up and then did a little bit of
research on some blogs and stuff like
that but there's tons of jobs these
companies are exploding recently and
you're talking about you're talking
about like a lot of languages that have
been around for like years
singular years and not a lot of people
have learned it it's a exploding space
and so if you have a little bit fronting
experience will take you you have a
little bit back experience they'll take
you you just have to do one maybe two
little tiny projects a show that you
know what you're doing what gets you
triggered entitled subscribers I'm not
familiar with the QT framework so yeah
entitled subscribers to get me triggered
because it's like here you are spending
your time your energy your money most of
the time working on something that
you're essentially giving away for free
with the hopes that people are going to
watch it and maybe you'll promote
yourself and get a little ad revenue but
uh yeah so the people who think they're
entitled to your time and energy those
are the people that trigger money do you
recommend the level of design skill when
seeking a job a friend and development I
would say it would help is definitely
would help I could tell you that there's
a lot of front end developers myself
included who are bad at design just very
very bad it's a definitely a different
skill set now if you have design and you
have a great UI UX it's definitely gonna
set you apart from other candidates what
type of company you're going to work for
right so if you're going to if you have
if you're going to work for a web design
company it definitely is going to work
for maybe a corporate company like I do
where you're building a lot of crud apps
and in-house tools and design usually
goes by the wayside most the time
do you have some tips to how I can grow
my YouTube channel currently I
seventy-five hundred subscribers not a
little c-sharp some well I'd have to
check out your channel we we could do
one of the mentoring sessions I said and
we could sort of dive into what I think
you could improve upon but uh I don't
know it's for me it's always just been
consistency just continually grinding it
out and I mind you I I mean I don't know
how you might be doing better than I am
in in reality because I've been working
on my channel for two years seven months
where we've been we've been grinding it
out for quite a bit I'm growing by about
two thousand subscribers right now for
all I know you started a channel like
three weeks ago in our seventy five
hundred subs killing it but it really
just depends man it's it's it's hard to
grow a coding channel in general because
it is such a niche now there are people
who are exploding for various reasons I
don't understand but uh but for me it's
always just been a consistency thing
it's been something that I has always
been fun I haven't tried to really think
too much about how to grow the channel
you know I think about it cuz I'm
passionate about it but I mean I haven't
let it be something that discourages me
it did what it was supposed to do which
was help me get a job and now everything
else has been gravy so when you're
talking about the free code camp project
so we're talking about this tutorial
part they have front-end projects
they've intermedia they have basic
front-end projects and they also have
intermediate front-end projects will
they give you about ten different
projects that you can build out in the
front-end section of the current
curriculum I wonder if there's a new
stuff went up so they were supposed to
update their content pretty soon I don't
know that it went out though oh look at
that
something went out all your CSS is done
it's gonna clear the cache okay on here
but yes so they have projects on they
ran a quote machine weather app stuff
like that
nope they have an update of the content
yet god I want to do it so bad and my
experience of th Street my last role I
did PHP and CakePHP yes advice for
getting internship is it too late to
find one for this summer well LinkedIn
github portfolio projects good resume
and the start just filling out apps like
you couldn't believe probably around 500
before you'll get one that's that's it
fill out 500 our fill adapts every day
and see what you do after Java sir what
should I learn depends what you want I
would say definitely if you're looking
for front-end you need pickup reactor
you need to pick up angular freelancing
jobs I don't know you yeah feel free to
ask you some any questions as you want
and about my early childhood life I mean
what do you want to know man as your
typical dorky high that watched anime
watch cartoons played video games and as
basically yeah I wasn't like programming
if that's what you're asking
say something about game development
JavaScript you don't know do you still
hold position in crypto yes I have taken
out all my money all my invest in ischl
investment and I am letting the
remainder of my profits sit as what I
currently am doing
I'm a junior rails dev and kind of
intermediate in Ruby and I know
javascript is similar so is that enough
to be employable
well are you when you say your junior
rails developer are you aspiring to be a
junior developer or are you a junior
rails developer how much time for it
should a beginner code for export what
you mean export what all coins gee own
if any I own iota I own salt
I like coin and I own the theorem
Bitcoin cash and then Bitcoin
that's what I own and then two random
ones I just picked up because they
dropped 50% and one day I just had to
cash out a little bit of money
your boys trying to buy a house in two
months so
I thought it's pretty good with the free
cocaine projects then I realized that my
pins look horrendous when viewed on
mobile what I learned how to scale and
adapt your tutorials don't cover that
yeah I probably should have done it and
that I mainly enjoyed the JavaScript
aspect of it so sometimes I kind of get
a little janky with that well if you're
using bootstrap they have a Concord
system it's pretty straightforward if
you think you've mastered Rails you
should be applying for roles I don't
know what you're asking for no one's
gonna come up knock on your door like
sir you aren't ready you're all ready to
join the workforce please come we need
you you just got to start doing it yeah
man I mean it doesn't hurt to spend some
time applying for jobs every week as
part of your learning process for one
you'll see what the market wants to
you'll get feedback on your resume from
recruiters and everything else and
you'll you'll kind of tail tail tail
tailor your learning to what the job
market demands
thanks for the time what I don't get is
if 32,000 subscribers only 29 people are
watching why on earth I don't know this
way it goes man I don't know what egg I
could tell you that engineer truth he
has like almost 200,000 subscribers and
on a good livestream for him he has 200
people so I mean YouTube isn't necessary
the livestream platform but it seems to
be that about 1/10 of 1% if your
audience watches when you last came on
YouTube right so a lot of times people
are busy people don't you know I'm doing
other things so I don't I don't really
think about too much when when you're
when you're on YouTube and you're a
smaller channel if you focus too much on
numbers it's really easy to get
discouraged
it is right so I remember when I was
starting and would just say no views
you'd upload a video and it would say no
views because you have like 4 people who
are subscribed right just zero views not
not a zero views no views is what it
says and so like you see you've seen
single-digit subscriber growth and then
some days is just flat because you
didn't gain any subscribers or you
actually went in the negative because
you had people unsubscribe and usually
have enough to cover it so when it comes
to YouTube Meg I keep a fresh guy keep
it fun and not really worry about too
much do you have some tips to get your
get the coding drive back well I would
first reevaluate what your time
management is I would say if you're
coding drive is being decreased because
you're spending time playing call of
duty or you're watching a ton of TV
I would say put handle that before
anything else in terms of getting your
coding drive back just try to remember
what it is that you want it I find that
be a very immature question a lot of
times that's something that somebody
who's like 16 to like a very
impressionable 29 year old would say is
it's it's a very child thing to say
and I'm not saying this pick on Ichiro
but it's something that I don't
necessarily have a lot of understanding
or sympathy for it's like hey you know I
want to be a developer but I've really
hard time not watching TV not playing
games and instead I just like to go out
half a beer smoke a joint with the
buddies and by the way that I'm probably
any of that but what I'm saying is if
your goal is to actually learn to code
because you want to better your
financial situation you want to get your
career started then apparently those
other things are more important and
that's oftentimes just 95 percent of
time what it is and so I I mean honestly
you just have to make a mental note of
like hey this is important to me so you
know what I'm not gonna hang around with
those people who are gonna go out on the
weekends because I'm guessing most your
friends aren't developers and if you
can't find people who surround yourself
who are developers do that so that's
that's really my comment on that my like
I stay in Florida in the short term yeah
do you have a recommendation for a text
editor yes I personally love visual
studio code they have been doing an
excellent job updating it all their
updates actually read the release notes
uh just a visual studio coats fine for
everybody it's good dressing necessary
for job interview yes should you should
definitely dress business professional
or business casual could you explain the
use of angular and react in a practical
sense find myself starting to learn them
but don't really understand the primary
purpose well the purpose of any
framework essentially is to make it an
easier task to use the language and and
in JavaScript so a unique case because
you are you have kind of three things
that you're interacting with in what in
front-end web development you're
interacting with HTML you're interacting
with CSS and you're interacting with the
actual JavaScript which if you really
want to say you're interacting with the
database you're kind of touching four
things and so angular and react allows
us a better way of writing dynamic code
for static code it also allows us to
write it in a component structure that
allows it to easily be reuse reproduced
and allows manipulating those four sort
of things in a much easier fashion
that's really what the point is
how should we cope with people who brag
about their coding um well I've so I've
talked about a previous situation where
I went to a coding Meetup and there's
like a super senior dev there who it's
just the first time I met a subscriber
and they're like yeah you know I'm
talking to him he's like I'm like oh
yeah man thanks for watching the video
so glad they helped well blah blah and
then the guy said something along the
lines of I didn't know Domino's delivery
driver could be have coding videos like
something like that and so for me I
usually just smile and nod and I don't
worry about it too much what I would say
to you is just use it as motivation
that's how I do it and just be very
happy when you surpass those people
because they're usually for very unhappy
people this is why it's so important to
have a very good workplace as well nice
to see you too Jonathan Diego de fée
right this quintero nailed it baby wanna
thing let me try this
Juanes imma try this as wanna 'then
diego dif they free ate us Quintero
there we go
I have a good one Michael can you give
any advice how to keep calm for a job
interview how to be less nervous at /a
anxious doing a lot of them helps
practicing white board interviews I
actually find that it's a very good
practice to tell them that you're
extremely nervous and anxious and that
that makes everybody in the room relax
and just say in a funny way
how much begin time should a beginner's
code in the day three or four hours
everyday to the good job the course
you're doing for a degree can it be done
with the same u-verse see if you live in
the UK I don't know you could definitely
reach out to the Western Governors
University Admissions and they would
tell you is web development for me me
I'm not good with zilean I'm not good
with design either and I'm getting paid
very well well my chances of getting a
job as a friend and developer would be
higher after three months of an
internship is it a paid internship is an
unpaid internship it depends it depends
on the quality of the internship you've
changed a lot man can't believe that you
have 32k you think I've changed well
coming up I'm stepping on the little man
now I so each year I would say that I
would say that if you really have lost
the motivation try and focus about what
it is that you don't want to become
alright so there's two types of
motivations for me right now
one is there's positive motivation and
then there's negative motivation and in
my case I often times find that focusing
on what I don't want to become it's much
more motivating than what I want to
become and a good example of that is I
see a I see like a 80 year-old cashier
or back bagger
and I assume that this person has no
savings I assume that this person made
bad financial decisions and I in return
and making good financial
it's really easy to see somebody who
like who's well-off and you're like yeah
man I want that that's good you know I
don't know how but then you say you know
that that that is motivating without a
doubt but for me it's much more
motivating knowing that like I don't
want to be working when I'm 80 at a
 grocery store I don't want to I
don't want to be and that's not to talk
 or anything like that it's just
what I want all right and so I would say
try and find what your motivation is why
is it that you want to learn to code
it's because you want a good job in
career that's great
now go look at people who have bad jobs
and bad critters if maybe that motivates
you and you're like I got a study
hey go do this
honestly it's an internal struggle and
it's hard it's about setting goals plans
and executing those and working towards
those every day how do you think an idea
for making our first projects just find
something that you want to do long-term
that you think would be fun that's
really it your first project probably
not gonna succeed second project
probably not gonna succeed but you're
gonna learn a lot in the process after
finishing the free code Gantt front and
sir am I ready theoretically should I
jump into angular um there's not really
any platform that I would say that you
can learn angular I have an angular
course that's an introduction to it
they'll get you going a little project
portfolio project but I mean I have I I
do suggest that you pick up kit I do
suggest that you pick up angular or
react and go from there I saw a video
where reactors for startups and angular
Serbia corporation so I have a hard time
if I learn to react this year no a lot
of times companies just want to know
that you've worked with a MVC template
eeen
our framework I mean will you have an
easier time getting a rack job if you
have react experience yes will you have
an easier time getting an angular job if
you have angular experience yes but
that's it's not the end-all be-all
do you advise for getting information
about IT coding and similar tech stuff I
happen to have a great piece of advice I
have a Facebook group a little under
5000 members called code tech and
caffeine that I run along with program
with Eric and in there we talk about
code tech and we don't really talk about
caffeine but you guys get the idea but
uh there should be a link in the
description if you search on Facebook
code tech caffeine I think it's a great
resource you have people on there who
are sharing sharing projects they're
people on there sharing news just you
know I'm sharing my videos on there and
stuff like that
unpaid internship you should not take a
 unpaid internship I've done a
whole video about this it's the worst
piece of advice anybody could ever tell
you just take an unpaid internship do
full-stack does focus more on back in
our front end or equal effort in both
really depends on what it is that the
company wants a full stack to have to do
and my last job I was full stack
developer I did equally both I would say
that the front end oftentimes took more
time at least for me because uh the back
end you're really just doing the same
old same old
the the back end is there's less moving
parts in my opinion
where's that Facebook group Co tech and
caffeine let me go ahead and I'll uh
I'll throw it up in here in just a
second let me go get that link
so if you want to join the group small
cartoon so the Facebook group I just
stir it up in the chat
it's called Co tech and caffeine if for
some reason you can't click it I've only
studied it seven times
Co Tech and caffeine eight would you
recommend someone who does who's
finishing high school at the moment the
university to software to complete
online your very select your selfie
stick to regularly for university with
shakes three years that's a very hard
question asked because I could tell you
that at 18 I took some online courses
and I failed them all not because I they
were hard or anything like that I just
didn't have the discipline to sit down
and do all of that so it I I mean if you
have the discipline if you have the
discipline to go and do that to go to
WGU and sit down and I have it now but I
didn't when I was graduating high school
anywhere near it then yes I think it
would be an excellent opportunity and
then you just continue on on your own I
think you I think honestly just study
yourself and get an internship and go
and then I have to take out debt in the
meantime that's my personal opinion I if
I was if I was to go straight from high
school and I wanted to get it break into
the industry as fast as possible I would
do a coding bootcamp a good one and then
I would I would just start trying to get
jobs that's what I would do
oh there's not a best website there's
tons of different websites to learn
there's free code camp source code CAD
me there's udemy there's plural site
that you see there's Udacity there's
YouTube really just don't try and look
for one resource to learn how much
learning how much room for learning do
companies leave for potential employees
that demonstrate communication teamwork
skills more so than programming that's a
very interesting question and it's a
very company by company basis I work at
a very good company in that aspect that
they they they they do they have a very
extensive interview process to get
candidates that have communication and
teamwork skills specifically but some
companies aren't I would rather have you
program Morris it's it's a company by
company thing honestly it's gonna be up
to you to find a good company a lot of
companies are really bad question for
you about my son shitty at ten rent no
lasar for thirteen guys I Rutgers for
Olimpica I couldn't tell you man
I'm not too familiar with that with
either of those
where do I start you're probably asked
us sometimes you start if it's front end
you want to start with HTML CSS
JavaScript we've spent a very little
time on jQuery if any at all you
definitely want to pick up kit you want
to pick up a front-end frameworks such
as react or angular I got that I got
that down now I had my first interviews
for a software development position they
were ask yourself do you know what
docker is and what is the difference
between abstract class and interface
they are and they asked to add a new
method to already created class on the
paper and the Select data from the
database sounds like a pretty pretty
intense object-oriented question
what is your view on companies what is
your view on companies that ah that have
a ton of unpaid interns I think it's a
bad thing for you to do it as an
individual and I think it's up
for a company to do it for one thing and
I did a whole video about should you
take an unpaid internship and I showed
you some stats from colleges that track
internship stats and what it has shown
is that you're less likely to get a job
from an unpaid internship then you are
from a paid internship and you're also
you're also when you do get an offer
it's gonna be about 33% less than what a
paid internship in the same role
would've got so it's really not worth
your time
is it enough nowadays to know basic
things to get a job I need to find basic
things when do you plan to release
another not to video so here's the thing
guys my computer although I'm using it
to stream it's been breaking I ordered a
new one and I am waiting for it to
arrive so once it I have a great I have
a great video with the character so the
rope videos those are going to be dole
on the wicks developer videos it's gonna
be it that that's uh it's gonna be my
alter-ego you look like a gamer - I I
mean I used to game a lot not not so
much anymore diabetic manatee man the
diabetes didn't get you I thought that I
haven't seen you know I thought the
diabetes kochia
how important do you believe a digital
footprint was you're talking about
branding I think it's I think it's
super-important portfolio is great but
if you're just talking about digital
footprint you're you definitely have to
have a portfolio you definitely have to
have a github you definitely have to
have a LinkedIn at the very least and
then if you're trying to go the extra
mile with some branding social media is
an awesome way to help you out yeah
that's fine I I mean there's a couple
youtubers out there that will tell you
to take an unpaid internship yeah and
it's just awful advice would it be too
personal ask what college you got your
sister you're from Miami I don't have
cs3
I am a I was a CS student and then I
dropped out of school about two years
ago and I started working as a developer
I currently about on the first restarted
a online program through Western
Governors University in software
development
it's a Bachelor of Science degree so
that's it your boys getting his
edumacation
they stink
energy drinks are coffee I've always
enjoyed energy drinks although I am
drinking one right now on the weekends I
allow myself want a single energy to
drink on Saturday single energy drink on
Sunday and then I I at work I don't have
any for the week all right guys
last few minutes for questions and
everything can I check your LinkedIn to
see if there's a good start as I really
have much more cell not right now man if
you want me to go over your LinkedIn and
stuff like that you set up a mentoring
thing you're trying to catch me at
another another time another YouTube
another livestream rather but yeah I'll
take questions for about five more
minutes so we're gonna wrap it up and
call it a day any tips for getting hired
a company focuses on their own web
application when most your experiences
website development design I mean web
dev is I'm not quite sure what you mean
by that I mean are you talking about
like diving into legacy code what is the
next video
about I did it how was it
I have a video up it's like 16 or 17
minutes I can tell you it's a good one
they're all good what I think we'll give
you that will give you that hot fire let
me see how was my first week at WG
wasn't she bad man
I've been studying in the morning see
here it is about can you guys hear this
19 minutes yeah what do you actually do
you know we get that you write code your
friend developer that's what it's about
so I did a video by popular demand about
what I do on a day to day basis at my
current job so I break down what I'm
actually doing this a front-end
developer so I think I think it'll be a
good topic for you guys so guys I
appreciate you all it's been it has been
a pleasure I I do these every Saturday
if you want to support me you can join
the Facebook group it's completely free
code tech and caffeine and you buy my
course on udemy there's a link in the
description to give you a basic
introduction project you can you can
support me on patreon and of course as
always you can like subscribe share the
videos these are my weekly live streams
I appreciate it
I appreciate all the support we've been
growing great and it's been nice so
thank you so much I'll see you next time
