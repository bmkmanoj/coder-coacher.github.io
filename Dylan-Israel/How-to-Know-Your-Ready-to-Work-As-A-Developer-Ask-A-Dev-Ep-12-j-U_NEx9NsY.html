to be talking about how to know when
you're ready to go from practicing web
development or developing in general or
development in general and move on to
the next stage of being an employed
developer how do you know if you're at
the stage where you're ready to be hired
as a junior developer for me the one of
the things I accept quite frequently is
I think a good case for web development
specifically is when you can open up a
text editor and build something like you
know it doesn't matter what it is it
doesn't matter if it's a full web
application it doesn't matter if it's a
single page application like building a
JavaScript calculator for free code camp
for instance when you can say hey I've
never built a JavaScript calculator if I
know how to get started I can break it
up into the pieces and eventually I will
get it done that doesn't mean that
you're not going to need help that
doesn't mean that you're not going to
have to look up resources online as a
developer now I look at Stack Overflow
you know w3 schools and a bunch of other
resources on a daily basis this is a
common practice it's never going to
change right you're going to get better
but you're always going to run into bugs
and you're going to look for people
because maybe solve those bugs or can
give insight to get better so once you
can kind of build a project from the
ground up right and what do know it's a
good example because you can build a ton
of cool little things in relative short
amount of time you know 10 20 hours
whatever it may be but once you're
comfortable that so what you're you you
feel that if a boss said eh I need you
to build X and you have a rough
understanding of what to build it in and
you're confident you feel confident
because that's that's what it's about
it's being confident enough that hey I'm
ready to be a developer I'm ready to
take from just studying and practicing
to being paid well hopefully you know
hopefully well right or at least just
being paid and getting the experience on
the resume and I think being able to
start out where you have a text editor
you can build a project and you build a
couple projects build up a little
portfolio
you feel confident that many leavin'
feel confident but you should feel
confident I think it's the point I'm
trying to get across that you can go
from melting and have something to show
at the end you're there and for me I got
just a couple things but my situation is
a little unique because I worked at a
software company but I didn't actually
write software right I closed whatever
guy was wireframing so working at
software company I was able to observe
the developers and observe from some of
these interviews they would do with
developers so like for the front-end
developers I would see what they were
doing and the QA developers and things
like that and I felt pretty confident
just kind of looking over the shoulders
seeing what they're doing talking with
them you know on a regular basis and
that I could actually do most if not all
the things that were doing
grant would be a learning curve and that
gave me kind of a confidence boost as
well and I think the final straw other
than just wanting to work as a developer
was that I they started interviewing
developers and for me I I told my boss I
want to be a developer but they were
interviewing developers and I would see
them do whiteboard interviews through
the glass and we'd be drawing it out and
every time once I realized what they
were doing I felt like it solved the
problem I felt like yo that's what it
takes to be interviewed I'm ready to go
and it's really not a problem if you
don't feel confident like I'm not really
sure start applying for internships
start applying for developer jobs and
just every time you get so you get one
interview a week you'll know what to
expect you'll know what what where
you're at in return in regards to what
the positions available are looking for
and it depends by company but you'll
learn a lot in the process as well so
it's never a bad idea to look very early
on and you also meet a lot of cool
people in the process you never know
where you could reach out you could go
you could bomb the interview but as we
as many senior deaths have said on this
channel before communication is key so
maybe you communicated really well I
said look man we don't have something
for you now
you're not quite there reach out to us
in a little bit and I encourage you to
reach out to people and you know do that
down the road but you'll learn a lot
even if you you're a little bit gun shy
and that's okay because a lot of us are
introverted and we're not the super
social kind but you can still have good
communication skills and not be super
social right but those that's how I knew
that I was ready to be developer that I
could start a project from scratch to
finish and I didn't need you know a
video tutorials doing it I had the
skills that I could break down the
problem on my own
and start debugging it and get and go
just solo and also in my unique case I
was able to see the developers they were
interviewing and I felt confident I
could solve the interview questions and
seeing the stuff they were working on I
feel I had a decent understanding so
those are my tips of kind of
understanding if you're ready or not
and again even if you don't think you
are you can learn so much by just
applying and going and working and like
through the interview process and it'll
be a great learning experience and I
think you'll gain a lot of confidence in
the process so as always guys thank you
