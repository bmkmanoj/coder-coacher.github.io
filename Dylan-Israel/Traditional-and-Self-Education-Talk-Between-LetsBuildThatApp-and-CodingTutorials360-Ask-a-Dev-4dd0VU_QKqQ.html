our interview with Brian from let's
build that out now what we discussed in
this video was a bit about education him
from a traditional education my kind of
gripes with it and being a self-taught
developer we also caught talked about
the technical interview process for a
lot of developers and I give kind of my
viewpoint on it he gives his as a senior
developer who who would be interviewing
these people and going along with the
process and so it's a pretty pretty good
interview it's a little bit longer than
the other two but I really enjoyed this
one and I hope you guys like it like
thank you for watching enjoy it's it's
so the cool thing about YouTube and what
I really like about it is I really do
think that given it's very strange
because I'm kind of thing I've been
going back and forth about going back
and finish out my degree but I really do
think given like 15 20 years that the
sort of you not YouTube itself
essentially video platform and and and
you know courses made by you know
everyday sort of people will probably be
the primary way people educate
themselves it's kind of it's it's not
the only way but in terms of what people
have resources to do and YouTube is very
interesting that because if there's
anything you want to do there is a video
on YouTube to teach you how to do it
yeah yeah and I feel like that's the old
traditional school system is super
outdated if you think about how advanced
technology is now it is I mean the
biggest problem with schools for me is
that when you're there sitting in that
very uncomfortable seat in the classroom
you really don't want to be there that's
the biggest problem for me at least like
why don't I just go home sit at my big
comfy chair and just load up a browser
and have a cup of coffee and learn that
way for me it's it's more of the format
I've never enjoyed the ellipse I always
felt like college was a memorization
test more than a learning process and
that that for me was it I have a lot of
issues with how much it costs and stuff
like that but in terms of being a
student the reason I didn't necessarily
like it and thrive was I felt like a lot
of times I was just beans it was a task
of how much can I actually remember
verbatim and rather than actually
understand it and I hated that yeah I
kind of hated school myself I hated I
hated college is very interesting
because you went to a very prestigious
school so I find that kind of like I
just assume that if you go to a very
prestigious school that that you and
Nate Lee probably liked your school
experience yeah yeah it's it's uh like I
found myself just not liking my
professors like 95 percent of my
professors I just did not like and I had
the same problem where the things that I
I I was learning in each one of these
classes it didn't really like apply to
me
that well I might be a different I might
be an outliar or an exception because I
had already known that I wanted to be a
programmer ever since like I was 16 or
17 I don't know I kind of felt like why
am I going to school it's kind of a
waste of time I just let me get out
there and code already instead of
learning this stuff so it's it's
interesting though because I kinda have
the same sentiment about 95% of
professors kind of like I don't like you
shouldn't be at 95% of professors
probably should it be professors like
you have a 5% of really good professors
and then you're like you know those are
the ones that stand out but of 12 to 20
or 30 or 40 professors you're have
there's probably five in the best case
scenario where you're like those are
people I would like to follow and
connect with the other ones you're just
like look man I get your phone in and in
you're collecting a paycheck at least
that was my experience or like maybe
you're a little too out of touch with
what how to teach I don't know
I had a very negative experience but uh
that's just my two cents I guess no
that's that's kinda out it is if you gay
or if you if the requirement to teach at
a college was to start a YouTube channel
and teach for two years on YouTube and
then see wrong then that would make the
entire like school system up this so
much better a little weed out the people
that can find out that they're not good
teachers it's also very interesting the
concept of tenure of essentially not
being able to be fired if you're shitty
at your job after a few years what does
that exist any other job if I start
being shit at my job I should be able to
get fired I don't get it so that that in
it that in itself inspires a sense of a
sense of content that you know what I'm
untouchable and I can be here and and I
mean I I don't know about your exchange
but I definitely have those teachers who
really just let's fail 90% of the class
because there's nothing I'm doing wrong
so it's kind of a strange thing where
like you could have this epi that would
be great though use the YouTube
filtering process or some sort of vote
filtering process we'd have no teachers
that'd be the problem which is well but
I don't know that's a huge problem I
mean the school system is kind of yeah I
guess I'll leave this school topic alone
yeah this is something I could talk
about for hours and I'll just I'll just
come I'll just come I try not to because
I think a naturally being somebody
dropped out people are just gonna think
you're bitter and I'm really not but I
try to look at it objective and talk
about my experience but it I definitely
understand that it will come off as a
bitter yeah no I mean I took a year off
from school myself because of how much I
hated it
so taking that when you're off helped me
kind of reevaluate things that I had
already known for a long time that was
okay I gotta go back and get my degree
otherwise it
would have been just a waste of
everything all my time but yet there's
one thing about UC Berkeley is that
those professors that are there they
aren't actually not there to teach
they're there for like their own
interests which is the research that
they're going to do at that University
and so they're more in it for research
than teaching at all that's why maybe
I'm throwing all those professors under
the bus but to another party no that's
fair I mean even at the the cal state
level all the teachers I had were there
as a as a part-time job because they
were just trying to collect a check on
the you know that's why we had so many
crazy weird hours classes on Saturdays
and Sundays and and you know class
starts at 7 p.m. and shit like that and
so you have all these weird hours
because they're all part-timers we're
just trying to get a check and literally
just yeah this is the assignment that
the teacher before me gave me and then
the other ones that were they were
sometimes good were previous students
that they just wanted to get them to pay
for their masters and so that was like
90% of the thing you have 10% of
professors who are caked in and about
half of those are just really bitter and
just upset and we don't care and then
you got 5% of the good ones yeah yeah 5%
is probably higher than I would out
estimate I think for me and my
experience are that the TA is the
teacher assistants were the only people
that kind of give a shit about the
students at all yes it's so unfortunate
and part of the reason that I'm I went
to school is not necessarily again
education was good job and so like
sometimes people have a different like
people think they're one in the same and
they're not really and I always thought
like I had to go and you'll get a degree
and it makes things easier but for me it
didn't end up being the case and I ended
up being much more successful once I
dropped out of school and so it's a
strange thing
it's watching your video about it like
you're you're
process and going back to school and I I
found it to be a little a little maybe
it might be I don't I don't really want
to influence your decision but no no
IIIi encouraged you to it almost feels
as if you've already found your way in
but for some reason it feels like you
want to go back a few steps but I
understand that because sometimes you
just don't feel like you know everything
that you should know that's why you
don't wanna go back
well no no so this is this is the thing
is I don't think I'm gonna learn shit
when I go back I really don't and so i
it's really for the piece of paper that
is it and kind of to to I guess I don't
even think it's a prove it to myself but
I started something and I it would take
me about eighteen months to finish at
this point from from I've done the
research I've reached out to schools and
figure out okay I do it online it's take
me 18 months but I there's something
about it's more something to fall back
onto because as we've talked all this
all this about teachers is this is
something I actually have thought about
doing maybe 10 years down the road of
actually going and trying to be a good
teacher and not necessarily change the
system based on something I've learned
about YouTube as I like teaching I like
to encode and you know helping the
younger developers that I work with so
that that is one of the influence
decisions but for me in terms of going
back and actually learning I don't think
I'm gonna learn anything
I really don't well yeah I mean so I I
didn't graduate with a computer science
degree I graduated with a an applied
mathematics degree and it took a lot of
computer science courses while I was at
at university and sometimes I do want to
go back to school to take some of those
computer science courses is feel like
you know I'm not being paid to go back
to school and I'm paying them for my
tuition it's it doesn't make any sense
for me financially anymore that's that's
also something I've thought about is it
cost me about $15,000 and I'm like
thinking to myself maybe I can get
somebody else to pay for this it's not
something that you can do necessarily
when you're trying to get your first job
but you know you're establishing
yourself at a company maybe they will
pay for it so it's it's it's it's
interesting and if I wasn't necessarily
having interviews and having recruiters
reaching out to me and having in-person
interviews and technical interviews and
be able to have conversations with
people who will give me a jobs and
seeing that it really isn't an issue to
them I would probably be more heart set
on going back but I am still very torn
because it's almost like it's ingrained
in me of since I was a child I was
always told this is the path you must
take you must study hard in high school
when you get done with high school you
must go to college and you must graduate
the degree and if you don't you'll be
homeless and a crackhead and so this is
like it there's something very like
ingrained into me that's still very
worried about something like that even
though it's probably an unrealistic fear
at this time mmm I feel like you've
already seen through that facade I have
but I feel there's still something that
it's just it's almost like I'm just so
worried about going back that I'm
worried about falling back I'm just
gonna go back so I could see like if we
were really to look into it like maybe I
might do it by choice and life
circumstances but it's it's a it's
definitely a part of my life I didn't
enjoy so the apprehension is not so
potentially going back to that place
it's not something I look forward to and
probably the biggest thing as to why I'm
I haven't yet fully committed to it
where the other mmm yeah
hmm so so on this topic of education now
that we're diving into it what are you
what are your thoughts about all these
like nano degree programs or certificate
programs popping up so I really do
encourage non-traditional schools like
if you can find a way to get into
software development get into the
industry through some kind of like
bootcamp nanodegree thing I recommend it
I've been approached by Udacity to do
one of their to do the I don't know what
I guess their nanodegree helped them out
with their iOS curriculum and I think
it's good idea I think what they're
doing is good might be a little bit more
expensive but I you should be able to
get some useful knowledge out of it and
it's probably relatively cheap compared
to the traditional university fees yeah
it's definitely gonna be a cheaper
alternative I feel like maybe one of the
things that a lot of people get at
traditional is you kind of get that
you've bought your not buy your way in
but you've worked your way in to you
know your resume sort of standing out
compared to the people who haven't and
so you kind of have to weigh the pros
and cons like I can spend four years and
X amount of dollars we can also do a lot
on your own in four years with X amount
of dollars and kind of stand out as well
and I feel like the the non-traditional
route as long as you understand that you
can vet you can succeed with it at the
the biggest advantage to going to
traditional school traditional
university is the way that they teach
you how to tackle algorithms that
presents kind of like non-existent in
boot camps and down our degrees i would
assume and that's a major problem
because when you're being interviewed
for jobs as a junior developer those
guys they went through that whole
gauntlet of the university system so the
way that they're going to test you is
that same way
you don't have that background that
preparation you're kind of at a
disadvantage which is unfortunate yeah
it's the the algorithm stuff and like uh
you know let's sort this okay well I did
this well I actually wanted you to sort
it in this way yeah let me google that
real quick and like what is its
efficiency of this algorithm big big
data is log whatever like who cares
nothing ever does this anymore
hey it's it's very interesting thing
because um I I've had those
let me just solve and I I i talked
recently about how i i knew i was going
to be looking for a new job and i'll
probably put this interview out after i
get this job but um i about two months
ago i spent six weeks doing algorithms
on a site called code fights and did
about 98 of them and just every single
day for every day for about six weeks
and then i they actually interviewed me
on code face for potentially recruiting
me and they they have great connections
with a major major company so i was very
excited about it and then i tanked the
algorithm interview after working on it
three six weeks so it's a it's a very
it's something i feel like even if you
are prepared for sometimes you crack
under the pressure but there is the more
technical algorithms where you have to
know the terminology like i found myself
really even being up to the you know the
end of my junior year going on their
site having to review all the very
computer science terminology that goes
along with okay well we want you to
solve this and end notations and i don't
like what all right let me see what
they're talking about here yeah
the computer science side of things is
it says it's it's something that you
cannot escape unfortunately and they're
always gonna grill you on that because
there's nothing else these people
can I ask you really well of the time
it's like oh do this problem
give me the efficiency of it and if you
get this right then you should be able
to the job so I had a very good Nam
yesterday I had a very good technical
interview so they basically I went in
they had me solved just whiteboard a
simple outer and they said basically it
was like a fizzbuzz sort of thing you
know is this module 3 modulo 5 or both
return it and then they just to make
sure that ok you know we talk to this
guy
we want to work with them and they basic
algorithm on the whiteboard people get
stressed out I know I do I crack under
that and I just start sweating real bad
but they then set me I said okay here
you're going to be doing front-end
development we're gonna give you one day
to build a basic application this is the
basic app this is the API we want you to
use and I found that to be probably even
though it was in terms of time it took
me about three four hours in terms of
time it was the longer commitment but in
terms of a nice interview process that
would actually prove that I could do the
tasks they're very good and I don't know
if maybe that was maybe because there's
a front-end development and there's more
of a UI but how are the technical
interviews when it comes to to i iose is
it is it just that algorithm prat um so
for me I would typically give that
simple version of the exercise where
okay let's do a four loop of some kind
just to make sure you understand what a
for loop is and then after you passed
that it gets into the build build me an
app that has a list of things and it has
to go out to the internet read some JSON
partes it and then do things like
asynchronously so the UI doesn't lag and
doesn't hang and then just based on that
you can inspect their coding style and
see the things that they're doing it
wrong the things that they can improve
upon and you can really tell just by
looking at their code where they're
where they're at in there I was career
so that's typically what I will give for
like
you know somewhat junior to mid-level
candidate now was there too now III
don't know this but I assume that it
varies at every company but in terms of
you've been a senior developer for a
while and did you ask senior developer
when sort of going company as company
do they still test senior developers in
detail most of the time in your
experience like when what is this shit
gonna stop for me I guess this is a
question I'm really trying to answer is
it never I hope it's not never I might
just have to be doing YouTube got sick
of this shit I don't know it's not it's
not that horrible I find it's kinda like
the initiation process right you get
into the frat and then you like when
you're up in the top you you kind of
enjoyed grilling other people about it
and although it's it's a painful process
while you're going through it it's kind
of like one of those necessary evils
yeah I mean I've heard I've heard
statistics that I've seen about like
something like 70% of developers senior
developers can't do the fizzbuzz problem
it's something like that is unacceptable
so if that's actually true I those are
the people who are fucking it up for the
rest of us didn't take these deaths oh
yeah everyone that's writing code should
at least be able to solve the fizzbuzz
question and that should be at least one
of those gating gating in everyone's and
as you kind of climb the ranks as a
developer you don't get those questions
as much anymore get more like
architectural questions like if you have
this factory that's pumping out cars and
you want to make your classes so that
you can pump out different types of cars
what kind of pattern to use like what
types of interfaces would you write and
we should have an abstract class of some
kind you would have those types of
questions because that's more of a
senior how would you architect this
problem
and then you would maybe get some
questions like how would you design your
database so that you can access it from
multiple services and the cloud just
like that not so much you know in the
weeds how would you write out this
algorithm nice no I it's it's funny that
you bring up like the architecture stuff
because I found myself I found when I
just even being on the junior level just
because contract roles they were asking
these architecture questions because
you're a contract employee they're not
necessarily going to groom you as much
as they would a junior developer that
they're trying to essentially you know
cuz companies are really trying to hold
on to the developer Pharos because
everyone's jumping around and when I was
being tested a lot I did get more
architecture questions exactly like
scenarios your customer how would you
you know what would the database look
like what would you know how would you
break out these models and things like
that yeah we typically ask those
questions because we want to know if
you've been exposed to these concepts
before even as junior developers it's
it's a tough first couple of months that
you've never been exposed to NBC like as
a senior developer I would hate to wrap
up again it has never never seen those
those concepts before so having two
candidates one that knows it and when
that doesn't I would probably hire the
guy that knows it it's it's a it's a I
wish I had a better solution for how to
hire developers and the sad thing is is
like I don't think even the ones that
people are using are great I don't have
a better option I can't really complain
too much but it's uh it's it's woes
things right I I mean I don't know how
your process was but I had about four
in-person interviews if I remember
correctly before I I landed my my
current role but I've talked to a few
subscribers and like they make like I
feel like that's pretty bad in person
because they want to hire you there's
not good enough a lot of times let's you
give it and then I've had subscribers
tell me they're going ten or twelve deep
and they try and make me feel better
they could be lying
yeah I think my my success rate is about
one in yeah one for one and five and
once I get in the door it's like okay
I'll get skip this question right most
of the time they don't ask me like
algorithm questions it's like what are
the interviews that I've been on have
been somewhat easy I would say
look they're just personality fit
questions and having a strong portfolio
is more what they want to see yeah
that's yeah that's how I fought that
battle yeah it's been my experience on
the junior level that portfolio is
important but even more so just being
somebody who codes and literally is you
want to be somebody who coats and it's
passionate about it and that is like
something that I I know that they're
very they like about specifically me and
I try to emphasize this too to people
who are trying to be junior developers
if you really don't like this stuff you
really should find something else to do
but if you do like it it's okay to show
that you like it and show that you're
eager and obviously you have to have the
skills but that's really what a lot of
companies that are looking to take on
Perm junior developers they want that
person who is going to enjoy it and
enjoy their job yeah yeah it's funny
that you mentioned that because I didn't
understand that until like three to five
years into my software development
career like you really have to show
you're willing to code things that are
totally random and not related to your
job at all because that goes a long way
in impressing people like what does this
guy know and
what is he willing to learn on its own
yeah and it's I I mean I know I know for
me personally it's been all the world on
the difference and it's YouTube has been
a big III relate YouTube beginning
basically my last two jobs like granted
a lot of hard work went into it in other
areas but is a big portion and part of
it is just showing that is this guy like
is this guy just coming in for a check
or is this guy is this somebody who we
can say hey we're gonna switch you from
this to this and we want you to learn it
and you're like hell yeah and now is
that for from a senior developer
standpoint how important is that when
you're interviewing candidates and
they're when you were interviewing
candidates I guess in terms of their
eagerness to learn new technology is
it's very it's always very easy to spot
someone that's like super into it and
gung-ho but let's use angler four or
five or whatever right you can always
tell someone I'm super excited about
typescript wait who's ever excited about
typescript I am oh right and then you
stumble upon these these these little
diamonds in the rough you know like oh
yeah totally use this guy he's he's into
these obscure technologies typescript
might not be too obscurities days but
yeah the more someone is able to show
that they're capable of learning a new
technology which it's always there's
always this extreme steep learning curve
with new technologies right you know you
know your you know your your your stuff
with c-sharp or JavaScript you know it
already and it's always hard to like
even convince yourself that you need to
learn something new and for someone that
is able to show that off I think it's a
it's definitely bonus points all right
all right man well I appreciate your
time and thank you so much and can you
tell everyone one more time where they
they can find you yeah well thanks for
having me if you want to look for my
channel it's on youtube.com slash let's
build that app and then on Twitter it's
at build that app that's my handle if
you want to follow me on LinkedIn you
can search for a name search already
Brian boon I'm pretty sure we'll have a
link notes yeah I perfect thank you
again man have a have a nice night days
I guess like three hours before we have
a good day
got to pump out these videos man I know
I'm with you on that that's about it
what I'm about to do myself so thank you
again bye
hey guys thanks for watching the video
if you happen to be looking for a boot
camp I couldn't recommend dev Mountain
any higher they also include housing
with their tuition so you can get up and
go and get started right away thanks
again for watching and I'll see you guys
in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
