the importance of taking breaks a lot of
times you know we're also so gung-ho to
get to where we want to go and our
career our money our relationship
whatever it may be we want to work very
hard to get to where we are and
sometimes I can lead to some negative
negative things not so that you
shouldn't work hard but we're going to
talk today about some of the things I do
when I know I need to take a break why I
take breaks and also what do you guys
think the longest amount of time I've
gone without writing a single line of
code it was recent and I'm going to talk
to you about in this video so one of the
things that I do when I need to take a
break is I play video games I don't play
a lot like I used to but I thought I
would mention that because right now
Humble Bundle has a Capcom Sega Atlas
bundle so if you're a PC gamer like me
and you want to get some low-cost games
for a dollar you can get all five of
these games I don't really care about
many of these maybe Bionic Commando
would be fun I'm more so interested in
Dead Rising Resident Evil 4 I'm probably
not gonna play the Sega game or Devil
May Cry 4 get $12 get them all just
something I wanted to bring up so ok so
why why do we take breaks and why did
why is it important take breaks well for
one burnout right we've talked about
burnout in the past and it's important
to know when you burn out and how you
burn out for me it's not necessarily a
time thing it's more of a stress of life
thing how why am i stressed and and how
can I go about solving it and usually
I'm lucky enough that April can detect
that that something is I'm irritable or
something in my life is I've been
working too hard right and I'm not
talking about I just work a job you know
I'm doing YouTube I'm talking to
affiliate so I'm talking to sponsors I
have a Facebook group I'm working on a
podcast I'm building a course you know
recently I did and the reason I bring
you this is recently I got very burnt
out and I needed to take a break and
coincidentally I ended up taking one
because of the hurricane
if you for those you don't know I live
in Florida and what that basically has
caused is a six day break which is the
longest time I've not I've have yet to
write a line of code technically it
doesn't really count because it's really
a three day break I didn't write a line
of code because I worked other days and
I also worked on the Facebook group and
I handled YouTube stuff but we'll say
six days for the sake argument in my
life in my personal life writing code
typically the longest I've gone is about
two and a half days and it's usually
because we're on vacation but one of the
reasons I got I got burnt out in I
needed to take a break was I was
studying non-stop for the last basically
four months while I was taking
interviews from potential people for
potential companies so I was
interviewing also those are filling out
they're filling out those applications
answering phone calls from recruiters
answering emails from recruiters which
are good problems have by the way so not
to say that that I'm ungrateful that I
I'm I got a new job and not that there's
anything wrong with my old job but I a
good opportunity but you're answering
emails you're doing technical interviews
you're interviewing in person so that
that was one of the biggest stressors of
my of my recent last two months or so
and that's gone also you know YouTube
work relationship money issues recently
so money issues because I'm saving too
much and not spending enough on us it's
so good money issues but things that can
be handled so what are some of the
things that you can do when you need to
take a break well I like to play video
games I can only really sit down for at
most an hour I used to as a child and a
young adult I could sit down all day it
could be a day of League of Legends a
day a call of duty a day of final
fantasy whatever whatever game I was
playing at the moment and do that now I
can kind of sit down and I have more of
a library some games I don't even touch
but they're there if I ever want to
that's why I try to get them cheap like
through the samba one I'll link in the
description all that good stuff
so you guys can help me out but
that's why should I get them cheap on on
PC PC school that way cuz you can get
you spend 60 bucks on one PlayStation
game and then you'll get it for four
dollars in a humble bundle I got six
months later something right I'm not
always the case but one of the cooler
things about the Steam sale and Humble
Bundle stuff like that you know
occasionally I tried to read a books but
there are so few books that interest me
and it's hard to start a new series for
me I'm a big sci-fi fantasy guy
the last big series I read was the exam
series X anth so if you guys are
interested in that if you like fantasy
that's kind of you know magic the
Dragons they you know the elves and all
that sort of stuff and it's pretty
interesting series the first book they
have I want to say over a hundred and
I've I've read all of them except the
ones that have come out in the last five
years that's when I stopped breathing
that series but Piers Anthony is the
author of that and this first book is
called a spell for a chameleon it's very
good read I encourage you it's all of a
super hard read or anything like that
but very fun read another great series
that I like from the same author is the
incarnations of immortality so the again
sci-fi fantasy I don't really read too
many books anymore
i I they're so time-consuming I enjoy it
but they're very time consuming and once
I kind of get into a book I like to sit
down and finish it and so I might read a
300-page book in three days which isn't
you know super long or super fast but
for me I think it's pretty pretty good
read last book I read was a ready player
one as well so if you're interested in
books I couldn't I couldn't recommend
reading as a way to kind of relax and
the reason for it is it's a different
medium than a lot of other ways that we
that I relaxed you know when I'm
basically going from a computer monitor
to a TV monitor there is something
that's very similar at times and
sometimes when you need that break you
need a different you need a different
device you need you know you get some
fresh air you need to walk around you
maybe need to just close your eyes rest
sit down
treat yourself in whatever way works for
you
but that's really how I take a break and
it's super important right now
unfortunately I I can fully understand
somebody who has pretty much worked
every day for about three years and has
been reaping some success from it
whether it's YouTube financial or or in
the working world it's hard to not work
it really is because you you go from
being unsuccessful to successful just a
little bit and you see what hard work
can get you and it's hard to actually
step back for a second and say you know
what I
I need to take a break for my own mental
health and my own my own brain energy
right and take step back and I'll
actually be more productive because I'm
overworking myself which is a strange
thing that happened right most people
are and I hope you're more so on this
end than under working yourself right
April is one of those people who tell me
I need to work less and enjoy life a
little bit more and I'm one of those
people say I'll enjoy life in five years
right I'm so uh it's it's okay to take
breaks that's what I'm trying to say
just so take too long of breaks you know
two days at the most
is what I think is what most people
should be doing but that's just my
that's my own thing everyone's got to
live their own life I I very rarely will
ever take a day off I'm always working
on YouTube I'm always working on on
coding learning something new you know
practicing algorithms whatever it is
just having fun right to me it's fun
it's it's it's kind of an interesting
world because not only is a challenging
which makes it fun it's very stimulating
and it can help me out in a career sense
which is why I try and tell people that
if you want to be in this field
definitely find what makes it fun for
you and that that leads me to a video
that I'm going to be doing I've recently
talked about five things that you need
to do to get a job in web development
you're starting out and one of the big
things I hammering on with side project
side project side project right get
yourself a nice personal project and
well one things I'll be talking about in
a future video where I have 50 50 I'm at
25 I'm coming up with
25 more side-project ideas and these are
these are very broad so you'll be
surprised by few of them but the point
of the side projects projects they're
not only to to have a good portfolio
item that makes you unique candy but
also it's a different way to stimulate
yourself sigh project doesn't
necessarily mean you have to be typing
code now some are but that doesn't
necessarily mean that it's the only way
to have a good side project and so the
reason I bring that up is when you are
feeling like you need a break which is
different than burning out because I
think when you burn out you're already
past the point where you should have
taken a break right when you when you
when you burn out you're kind of like
I'd went too far we need to take a break
it is the mental fortitude of saying hey
this is going from maybe it used to be
fun it's no longer fun and it feels like
a chore task and I don't enjoy this
that's what you need to get break right
when something you do enjoy and that you
always have enjoyed or for a very long
time I've enjoyed like I enjoy all this
YouTube stuff I enjoy coatings on my own
at work I love all of this I really do
and when it's when it starts when you
when that feeling is gone or being
diminished that's what you know you need
to take a break and so side projects are
a good thing where where you can do
something different do something fun and
in the process you can also still be
productive right because a lot of us
myself included I want to be farther
ahead in life than I am and so it's hard
for me to sit down right it's I'm always
going going going going it's also
probably all the caffeine I drink but
that's neither here nor there
but encourage you guys woulda needed be
very aware of when you need to take
breaks and feel okay about it don't
don't take too long of a break sometimes
you only need to a two three hour break
whatever it is everyone's different but
it's much better than getting it to the
point where you're burnt out so figure
out what it is that helps you change
change gears and sort of step away for a
second and go do something else and it
could still be productive maybe it's
a different manner right but go ahead
and do that that could be anything from
being productive and different match
sometimes I remember I take break I
would just update my LinkedIn I'd go
through my emails answer my email I
would respond to comments on YouTube all
that sort of stuff still be productive
with what it is you're trying to
accomplish in life but still take a
break in the process so this is more so
a reminder if you guys to you and myself
the importance of taking breaks because
I just had one basically through
hurricane Irvine granted I was driving
30 hours in the last three days to go to
New Orleans and back and it was very
stressful we had the cats in the car but
there's a different type of stress right
it was a different type of mental it's
more of a physical actually anything
else and trying to get to where we
needed to go as we needed to evacuate
but it did it did let me take a break
for my my my standard you to become a
better developer work oh it was a nice
break that made me come back energized
even though I was so physically tired
from the drive and come back and really
just tackle video after video you know
study study study and just sort of put a
nice smile on my face so I think maybe I
might even subconsciously bent a little
burnt out without realizing it I know I
was from these interviews and stuff like
that it's very tiring and time-consuming
but it's a good problem to have
so as always guys thank you for watching
the video don't forget to check the link
for the humble if you're interested in
any of these games I couldn't recommend
Resident Evil 4 or Dead Rising or a
Devil May Cry 4 those are the three I'm
gonna play but at the very least you try
some random games for a dollar so thank
you for I guess thanks for watching the
video if you happen to be looking for a
boot camp I couldn't recommend dev
Mountain any higher they also include
housing with their tuition so you can
get up and go and get started right away
