talk about refactoring what it is and
why it's important refactoring is
essentially taking code and making it
better a simple example would be lets
say we have a for loop that's supposed
to count to 10 go iterates up and count
to 10 and there's an if statement in
there that says if this is 5 and all
you're looking for is that one value 5
11 way and then you set a variable or
something one way that you could
refactor that to be better so it doesn't
continue counting up to 10 from 5 to 10
is you could put a break statement in
there so what you basically have done is
you've made your code compiled quicker
because you cut the loop iteration by
half that's a simple example of
refactoring you know and there's various
other ways it's but refactoring is
basically taking old code that is
working and making it into better code
that's still going to work amelie right
and so why is it important and why do i
why do I actually enjoy refactoring um a
lot of people don't like the idea of
refactoring they they either don't like
it or they don't like messing with co
that's that's already working right and
but I personally love refactoring
because oftentimes working as a
developer you will be interacting with
your devs on a more face-to-face level
but not on a code level you'll never
really get interesting ever but rarely
you'll get the chance to actually go
line by line in their code and examine
what they wrote and why they wrote it
the way that they did and the reason for
you get a good insight so that's one
positive of it another positive is you
become a better developer by doing it
and you get to see mistakes a maybe you
have made that they're actually making
and you know if you're looking for it
you can fix those you can see if they
wrote something better than you're
capable of you get the understanding of
how they wrote it and why they wrote it
if they wrote something worse you get a
chance to make the code better
as well as explained to the junior damp
or even the senior dev hey this is wrong
and let me explain to you why which is
very important here so let's have open
communication and a team and you're
supposed to be a group that supports
each other there's nothing wrong with
saying hey your code is subpar let me
tell you why my way is better and you
may find out that you're wrong also so
I've had some stuff out with that where
I've misunderstood the developers code
and oh that one line I thought we didn't
need we actually need cuz here here and
here okay cool but that's refactoring
it's it's one of my favorite things just
because you'll have a better
understanding of code in general and you
get to see how other people type things
some people may type things in the
newest you know versions of JavaScript
and you may just pick and like I I
traditionally very bad with es6 so I may
pick up es6 syntax and learn something
that way as well as have a better
understanding of the specific module
that they were working on wives working
on this module and then I have a better
understand the whole application and
it's a great communication process as
well so you may learn a lot but it's
essentially at the end of day besides
all those benefits and along the cons is
you may break something in the process
so you have to be very careful with
refactoring where you're thinking like
oh cool I'm going to make things faster
I'm going to make things cleaner and
clearer but if you're not careful you
may actually break everything in the
process which happens as well but
refactoring is the ability of taking
current code making it better usually
smaller more concise and eliminating
codes that you don't need and just
simplifying it and so it's a very common
practice as a developer in my experience
you typically will refactor your code
when you're at a milestone milestone
kind of refers to a an objective a large
objective that you've completed you'll
go back and in that milestone or the
previous mile so say ok let's see where
we can make improvements and take you
know
X amount of time to do so but every
every company is different every team is
different but that's just been my
personal experiences you kind of get to
a point where I don't want to call it
the calm point but kind of the column
before the next storm and that storms
the next milestone to the next feature
requests or whatever it is but you go
back and see how can we how can we make
it better we got it to work that's step
one now step two is how can we make it
better and so that's the refactoring
process anyhow that's my two cents about
what what is refactoring and why it's
important if you like me you can support
