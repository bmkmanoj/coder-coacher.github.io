on the intro section going through the
fog for circle of numbers
what are we tasked with doing here well
imagine that you have a amount of
numbers in this case 10 right from 0 to
9 and we say hey the first number you're
castin is 2 and we want the number
that's directly across from it 7 that's
what we want to return and vice versa if
we were to have an 8 we wanted to return
a 3 that's what we're tasked with doing
now the way that I solved it was I
basically found the halfway point and
then I added that to the current number
if the number was on the first half we
add if the number is the second half we
subtract and do some magic right not
some magical reduce of logic so let's go
ahead and get started
first thing we want to do is want to
create our number array our number array
will be our values that are in here we
only get that we have 10 values we don't
actually get the 1 through those 0
through 9 that's going to be the first
thing that we're going to do so let's go
ahead and create that so say for in our
for loop we'll start off at 0 and then
we'll increase for the entire length of
the array so which is this area up to
the number and increase by 1 all we're
going to do here is take number right
and we're going to push I to it so
that's going to be 0 1 3 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 9
is in our first example here alright so
now we have our values here the next
thing we want to do is we want to find
out what is our halfway point I
typically like to keep my variables up
top like so and because you don't need
to worry about it being odd or anything
like that we're only having even number
so there was this sort of work
we can go ahead and have a halfway point
equal to M divided by two so that's
going to find the halfway point so if
it's ten the halfway point is five right
now all we have to do at this point is
find out the first number that would be
the number that we're checking here if
it's less than the halfway point all we
have to do is plus the halfway point to
the index value and that will allow us
to find what we're trying to go so in
this case we have if first number is
less than our halfway point meaning it's
on the first half we can go ahead and
return the number array plus the first
number plus the halfway point that's
going to actually go and give us the
seven so if our number is two
and we're adding five to it BAM we're at
seven right so that's out that's how
it's working now we then have another
our else statement but there's no else
because we're using a return in our if
so in this case if the first number is
greater than the halfway point all we
want to do is return the number eight of
the first number minus the halfway point
because it's it's greater than it and we
are now officially done so that would be
in this case the number seven so index
seven minus five right there and we are
good to go not not too complicated once
you kind of figure out what needs to be
done again there's probably a way of
doing this without having to recreate
the wheel if you will just didn't come
to me at first so this is what I did I
think it's pretty pretty simple and
intuitive solution as well so thank you
for watching the video as always guys
don't forget to support me on patreon

channel share like comment all that
great that you guys can do to help
me out and the channel I'll see you guys
next time
thanks
so much for watching hey guys thanks for
