jQuery functions and selectors let me
take a sip of my monster tea energy
drink please sponsor me but uh know me
how jQuery functions the selectors list
it going all right
so practice makes perfect setup your
jQuery code script J establish out
little one with the document dot writing
and passed a function so we are scripts
yes and set it up we need say our
document dot already and in already is a
function oh my god cat I wonder if any
other coders have this problem with
their cats document dot ready and we
call a function we're saying ready this
ready all functions and then BAM
semicolon and then it'll be hide the
orange div so we're gonna say
div dot hide I think that's what they
want and there it hid so it looks like
it's working properly we're good to go
so now we're learning a new jQuery
action called dot click don't learn more
about soon
all right see how the see how it passes
to dot ready and the dot click got to
see the town fade-out
all right so it's just saying look at
how that works check out the preview
window all looks well except for number
four create a variable called target in
script yes and use the equal sign to
sign jQuery selector
all right so you create a variable so we
were going to say the VAR and don't
forget the that target is equal to I
guess maybe this whole thing
we still need to do it like so and I'll
do target dot
let's put this above it and might make a
difference here
hmm
I feel like this should work
let's try say there's some it no I
didn't think that was gonna be it
hmm I always look at the Q&amp;amp;A forum
because maybe I'm misunderstanding what
they're asking and that is number three
or thirteen
let's see this
okay so it looks like we're almost there
so there's a couple with different ways
to do this
the way this did it was it created an ID
and set it equal to chumps and then
chumps just got selected I think it's ID
script yes and then they just set a
variable oops
equal to that instead of a string
pounds shows
just still not working let's go back and
look at that example one more time
so I D it goes chomps okay and we have
to put it the cash symbol in front of it
and a semicolon it's a little bit of an
air on my end and because we're using
jQuery that goes in front and now it's
gone cool so let's just go over real
quick what we did we added an ID to this
for Justice list object and then we said
on that ID that's our now we're now set
this char --get to it and then the
target is fades out so remember we told
you to ignore the paragraph equals in
the last lesson well now you know that
what it does you should also know that
it should have been the next dollar sign
P credit variable dollar sign div and
side it in Debussy Chinese do not use
talking already or any additional code
create a variable and I'll say div
equals
okay is that it do we do anything with
it no okay so we're just setting a div
variable here gived already a function
as an input inside your functions call
fading slow on the currently invisible
div - to bring it into view there's a
fade in as well
nice - document dot ready and then in
that we're gonna call a function and we
want the div right they want
give don't fade in slow with the capital
I see how it faded in you see it again
right there so let's get some practice
with the dot click action so finish
jQuery code so he'll make all four divs
clap divs of class vanish fade-out slow
and when a button is clicked
so we have our dot click function and we
want to make sure the divs are all the
name the same okay so we'll say vanish
dot
fade out
and let's just copy this first part oops
and fade-out we want to set that to slow
and then here we want to do oh is that
it
so save and submit do you call dot click
on button
okay so we need to assign the click
function to something and this is just
for button so what's so we're saying
when you click the button do this inside
here on these objects so when you click
this button fade out any of the vanish
divs which are right here so save and
submit let me click that and it didn't
fade out so something's wrong
you know this might be a dot I always
get this confused say my cement there
you go so a little bit of a syntax for
second Wyatt we uh
when we're calling the class it's a dot
when you're calling an ID it's a pound
so now we want to update our jQuery code
so it only fades out the div with ID
pound blue so simple enough so this is
pound blue and the blue goes out so
let's use a compound selector to apply a
fade to to both the dot pink and dot red
select use a compound selector
all right so here we want to do two
things we want a dot pink comma dot red
so this is a compound selector when
there's more than one it sounds like and
we want to dot fade too and then we'll
do slow and then comma zero
JJ you put it the document inside
okay and then we have to call this it
was document document
already function
and we could also probably messed up
here by Framing forgive me a semicolon
I should a bunch of Python so I
apologize if my my semicolons are off
that they just do it by indentation but
you can see right there that it worked
see you again all right so check out
this code in script J s instead of using
fade out on all the divs we're just
using them on this div where this refers
to the div you're clicking on so let's
see here
so this that's pretty cool
you know the jail turn document into
jQuery option object rather and call the
ready action
no need all right so we have the
document we need it to be ready we need
a function and
someone's going on in there all right
inside the dot ready parentheses add
your function all right so so add the
dot click event handler on the pool nice
so we're just gonna say pull dot because
it's a class dot pull me dot click
so when you click
I'm not taking so much
so we're just setting up we haven't
actually told it to do anything when it
clicks we're just saying when you click
this object create the dot panel object
yeah so inside the clique we want to
create another function that makes sense
so function and here is where we tell it
what to do and we're gonna say we want
it to call
sir dot panel close the others so
instead we want it right here
we want our dot panel and what do we
want to do with it dot slide toggle
and we want the input to be slow so
let's see if it works and bam you can
see right there now you see me now you
see me and one more time BAM now you see
me not too bad some very cool responsive
sort of jQuery stuff and it looks like
we're at the well done screen so that
was the end of our jQuery functions and
selectors not too bad just getting into
the getting into it and up next we're
gonna be creating HTML elements probably
doing a lot more in-depth stuff with
jQuery but I'm really liking it so far
and I'll probably use it on my site just
to kind of demonstrate some skills and
stuff like that but um as always guys
comments suggestions someone just
suggest sent me a message yesterday
asking for me to do videos on iOS so
expect that pretty soon I'm gonna be
using the iOS section on team treehouse
I've haven't used team treehouse before
but I've heard good things so I'm gonna
try it there and hopefully the videos
come out very nice but uh everything's
appreciated guys I appreciate the
comments and don't forget to subscribe
see you next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
