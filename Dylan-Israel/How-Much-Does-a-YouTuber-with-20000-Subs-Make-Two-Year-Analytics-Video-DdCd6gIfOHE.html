one-year anniversary on YouTube
I did a analytics video I applied to do
this for every year I think it's kind of
cool I think people get to see an inside
look at maybe a smaller channel see you
know what can you do with it what cut
type of money
what type of views and who's your
audience so I'm happy to showcase all
that so what we're looking at right now
are the analytics for the last 365 days
for a youtuber that's me
with 20,000 plus subscribers I think I'm
around 22 right now or 21 5 or something
like that so what so what how many views
are we getting well we're getting in
terms of views a little less than a
million and this year has been very kind
to us we've grown by 220 percent
compared to the previous year hopefully
that keeps going that's the case I'll be
very happy in terms of watch time we've
grown by 300% in terms of average view
time we've grown by 25 percent and if
you're if you're new to YouTube the
watch time and is probably the most
important one and you kind of see the
upward trend which is good same thing
with views and then the estimated
revenue is up by 350 percent which would
be amazing if that increased deck here
at 350 percent and so I'm making about
$300 a month an ad revenue currently and
that's just pure ad revenue anybody who
smart with business and things like that
will tell you that you need to monetize
your application and I would say that
between sponsorships and between
sponsorships and services I provide like
I do some mentoring and things like that
where I charge an hourly rate and then
we could talk about whatever you want to
talk about hey you know can you tell me
you know what skills on my resume that
are good what I can improve on those
certain things add up you know high
hourly rate
I charge 75 probably going to go up to
pretty soon for that but I usually do
about two of those a month and then of
course you have the monthly sponsorship
so in terms of estimated revenue from
Adsense yeah it's about $300 or so a
month but then I probably make another
four to five hundred a month from
sponsorships and mentoring and the
occasional sponsored video I've taken
the $300 a month I've made as much as
fifteen hundred dollars in a month with
minimal work so take take that with a
grain of salt and then of course you
have a platform that you can go in and
mentor and not mentor but market to you
know people people want to see what
you're working on and go for my so I've
gained this year by my subscriber growth
is up 250 percent which is about sixteen
thousand subs for the year it's pretty
good for a small initial channel like my
own home comments are kind of so every
every comment in a live stream is up is
counted as a comment which is life so
that thirty thousand and a twenty two
hundred percent growth I wish they would
kind of separate this out likes it's
kind of crazy to think that you get I'm
almost a fifteen thousand likes on
videos that seems like a lot to me
dislikes five hundred so there's five
hundred and fifty six people that need
to unsubscribe now I'm just kidding guys
I encourage the dislikes because I don't
encourage the dislikes but I encourage
the feedback so it's what's my most
popular video so in this case it's my
free code camp videos build a personal
portfolio all my free I said this I
believe in my last analytics video and
if you're interested in that I'll put in
in the description in the comments below
so you can really see year one diversity
or two but a lot of my free cocaine
videos which I predicted we're going to
be the case because of how great it was
a basic JavaScript a docker video that I
didn't even do actually I have an idea
of where I could hire somebody to do
some tutorials I had just released it on
my platform and I paid like 20 bucks and
I've made 56 so it's a good
I guess but it's kind of a trip because
uh I don't know nothing about docker I
should so but all of it is free code
camp which really shows you for the most
part even the intern interview is with
Quincy LexA which is free code camp as
well
blended so who's watching this well 48%
of people are from the US for me
actually and then it goes the United
Kingdom 6.2 India Canada and then
Germany so after the first five we start
getting to the but basically one percent
so you have basically half in America
and half the rest of the world which is
kind of kind of cool most people find me
through suggested videos or YouTube
search some browse features and 33% of
their which I'm not sure 88% of my
audience is male I don't think that has
anything to do with me per se as it has
to do with with just the fact that
unfortunately software has traditionally
been a male-dominated field technology
in general engineering in general and I
think that's probably why my views it's
just my audiences is male not because
I'm like super duper male dude alpha
male but because because I think this is
how it works out well one thing I won't
be able to give it away right away but
if you're watching this video and you
say hey men I really like that what
you've been able to do with a coding
channel I want to start my own that's a
pretty common question that I get right
now and working on a side project called
coders course comp and it's going to
have all the courses I plan on making
I'm working on about three right now and
one of them is how to make a coding
channel a little bit of what I learned
along the way how to decide what type of
coding channel all this art stuff I'm
going to go ahead and give away a copy
to anybody who who uses the word that as
the typical giveaway rules which is like
a video comment on a video and then
comment on the video with key word which
will be code let's say coding coding is
good word and definitely give away a
copy of how to create a coding channel
I'm still working on it so probably
won't you probably won't get it for
about three weeks but uh we'll leave the
giveaway open until that time but that
so that's my analytics I would say that
even though it doesn't make about $3,300
in Adsense it's probably closer if you
add everything together probably closer
about $9,000 which isn't too bad now if
you talk about the channel as a
portfolio item which is what I consider
to be at the end of the day it helped me
get my last two jobs I've talked about
this in another video the last job I
worked as a basically a technical writer
at a my tallest
technology trainer blood technical
writer and incontinent creator for a
software company that allowed me to get
my current role as a full stack
developer along with my youtube you know
a lot of hard work but it made me an
interesting candidate so I and the raise
I got in pay for each of these jobs
pretty good so I would say that the the
value that I get from YouTube is not
necessarily the straight-up hard cash
but the the future returns that I've
been getting and the interesting
portfolio items which is all another
great reason to create a channel but
this is what a youtuber in my case with
20,000 subscribers makes I'm a little
bit of a niche channel in the coding
space but here it is and we're on upward
trajectory and I hope it continues to
maintain that as always guys thank you
so much for watching if you have any
questions about I don't know YouTube
analytics or you have any questions
about coding channels or anything like
that I'd be happy to answer them
I really am passionate about YouTube and
I hope when I when I share these things
uh you guys watching you learn and not
you know just take in what you can what
you care to take in but I appreciate you
all if you want to support me you can at

group code taken caffeine and our
discord channels well I'll see you guys
next video thank you so much for
watching
hey guys thanks for watching the video
special thanks to our sponsors dev
