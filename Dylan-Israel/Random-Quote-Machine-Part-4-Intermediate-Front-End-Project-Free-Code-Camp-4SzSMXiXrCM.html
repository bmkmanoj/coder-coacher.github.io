time I forgot to put a tweet out button
so we're gonna go ahead and do that
right now just remind you of the
parameter close generate gregor
regenerating random quote we then want
to tweet this out so there's a few
changes we have to make to our code the
first thing that I stumbled upon or that
I wanted to do was create a tweet button
so let's go ahead and do that so we have
a button here but instead of doing that
we're gonna use a a tag and then we're
gonna give it a class of BTN and BTN s
default these are just bootstrap classes
that are gonna make it look pretty so
let's go and do that and then within
here we'll say tweet out very cool let's
gonna save it so there's our button it
doesn't do anything it oh it's actually
interpret you see how it's doing this I
shouldn't be doing that the reason for
that the reason that in a tweet out is
clicking on it it's because we our on
click function is tied to a class and
they're both the same class so we're
gonna go ahead and give an ID equal to
let's say new quote we'll say new quote
and then in here we're gonna go ahead
and target new quote save that and now
let's go ahead and test that we're like
getting your quote it's not working
oh sure your idea is correct so it looks
like our twe nots not working as it
should but our new quote is critical so
the next thing that we want to do is
basically recreate an on-click function
except we'll give an ID to our tweet
button here that's going to say well
name it tweet and then we want to target
that tweet and we want to say look when
we click tweet so let's go ahead and say
tweet or on click
we're on click run a function that does
some stuff now what is it that we want
it to do what we want it to do is then
run a run a what we wanted to open a
window to Twitter that will then display
something so let's go ahead and just do
that the way that we do that is we're
gonna have it open up using window dot
open so open a window to this and this
is all from the documentation so now
you'll see that this window opens up
when we click it but it's not it doesn't
have anything in there and so what we
have to do is set up that setup so that
our URL there contains the information
that we're looking to have so now we
have to pass over the random quote and
the random author so the way that we
originally set this up was that we call
their function one time and then we call
it again if this was clicked on what we
can also do here is get rid of this and
just go ahead and fill it so it's not
empty and we can say something in an
author in our author box here for quote
we go ahead and say
please you see we can put a quote in
actually let's do that
so would you kindly we'll go ahead and
put would you kindly in there for so by
default it's always gonna load with this
on here and then that's from Bioshock so
we'll go ahead and put that in there as
well and now we'll load it right here so
it doesn't have to run the function
should be a little bit quicker it's just
better practice so everything's still
working but the problem that we're gonna
run into is that we did these variables
here locally so when we need to pass in
a value here so the way that we get the
text added on is we're going to do a
little callback here and so with the
question mark text is equal what we want
the text to be equal to is the random
quote and so that will come out but
you'll notice that I random quote isn't
getting any it is having an issue here
so the way that we can do this is we can
make these global variables so we're
gonna go ahead and do var random quote
and we don't need to recreate it here so
let's take that off and now when we get
tweet out let's see if that fixes our
issue so it's returning undefined so
what is it that we need to do it's
looking like what we can do here is two
things we I think we have to actually
output our random numbers well so that
it is storing in there so let's go ahead
and try that and we'll do we'll go piece
by piece
alright now let's give it a shot
tweet out still returning undefiled
let's go to refresh the page
so there's a random now I'm gonna be
fixed here if not it's still undefined
just gonna try author as well there we
go so we need to include the author as
well here make everything global
otherwise this doesn't really make much
sense and this doesn't make sense
neither is this so now once we do that
you'll see let's get a new quote gotta
catch them all so we should get gotta
catch them all so that is how you create
a Twitter button and it might even be
better practice to do something like
this definitely don't want to come off
as a little new wish so all we're doing
here is basically just cleaning our code
up go ahead and save it test it and
we're getting undefined interesting I
thought we could do that so perhaps I am
mistaken often investigate that later on
so we created our three variables but
that's it
so that's your tweet up button
definitely style it up from here what
just happened why did it break recall
you literally only change that so let's
go ahead and refresh this page and see
why our code just broke
and defined that is very very
interesting
there we go we needed a basically what
we wanted to happen here is we wanted a
random quote you get a new quote set sit
here we just had our we added a little
bit rehearsed here so now we should have
jump stone there we go
you must construct additional pylons
there we go sorry forgot a little
confusing there for a second we just
were calling things in a wrong order so
we called get quote here that's great it
then will reset our random quote value
and then we'll hit this one more time so
sorry that is a little confusing but as
always guys I hope you found it helpful
thing to keep in mind is the twit tweet
button documentation I'll put this in
the description Deb dot twitter.com
slash web slash tweet button this will
kind of give you all the information to
understand how to fully customize your
your URL here and we may later Joran
want to pick this up a little bit more
as well so we have our random quote and
then let's go ahead and add our our
space and then we'll add - live random
author or just I think it was just
author save it let's go ahead and test
that as well tweet that out
undefined undefined
who's going on here
let's see tweet up is it because we
don't run it yet would you kindly and
undefined
whoo this might be an interesting area
where we rename these several things and
we have a Vaart author here and VAR
quotes this is a very bad naming
convention of mine looking back at this
she's going to save that and see if that
fixes our undefined err just gonna tweet
it out now undefined undefined it
shouldn't work now okay cool
so what's going on here with our
undefined error is that we actually
never run this now I changed my code
thing you know we can just insert
something here that was a bad idea
because we actually need to run it and
to someone wants to tweet out would you
kindly bio show if that but uh we put in
a default value without setting it so
the easiest thing to do really is not
choose which one that we want to do
instead what we want to do is when we
run this we want to go ahead and just
call get call get quote like we
originally did this is kind of the
problem with working on stuff that you
haven't touched in a while so let's got
a new quote tweet out that should still
work cool
now let's refresh the page because that
was the debugging we're just doing right
now and now when we go ahead and say
tweet out say hey listen Legend of
Zelda Ocarina of Time cool so you're
getting guys hope you found this helpful
don't forget to Like and subscribe and
I'm gonna leave the debugging in the
video because I think you'll go through
a lot of the same similar situations and
hopefully you'll find it helpful yeah
