no not the other cat - hey are you
coming look oh my my alright alright
guys so April will be here in a second
we are you grab us some waters before
take that for me what I thought you're
gonna go grab a slaughters these are the
clothes we're doing away
all right so would you work on today
baby let me do the traditional what does
that mean it means I went over some
notes and some JavaScript and it also
means that I worked on my portfolio so I
have I'm struggling with paragraph
section because it should be really easy
ah the paragraphs like yeah so like I'm
trying to get in some on the example it
has like the menu I have the menu it
works it functions and then underneath
it is the guys picture and a little bit
of about me thing and I cannot get the
words to show up
I don't oh you want to know you know you
don't want to dive into that no okay
well don't spend too much time on it
because it's probably something small
yeah and if you can't solve it tomorrow
let me know and I'll take a look at it
okay all right so we'll continue on our
JavaScript event that was it thank you
by the way yeah I mean that's all we've
been doing look cool so um to continue
on guys welcome everybody Jordan David
Manu Arora vapor code Thank You Man yeah
April and I recently went through my
closet gonna get rid of donate some old
clothes donate some stuff to since shirt
made the cut but she always says I wear
the same four shirts so now we're
recycling them forward so you guys gonna
see a whole new attire it's basically
the same shirts different shirt
same theme just different
and James yeah yeah now James
no I'm just kidding - uh and Russ
welcome welcome
um all right ooh
so uh have I seen the free code camp
shirts
I have although I believe that free code
camp shop is closed right now they don't
have a shop anymore ah see
I think they're reworking it someone
told me and this one doesn't doesn't go
in it so anything the new dealing yeah
I'm Bob warning it doors open come in
Kelly's pushing does he not know you can
push the door open come by you can do it
push the door open yeah thank you good
bathroom boy is it oh there you go good
boy all right
as free code camp changed its design
this is the beta that we're learning
because there's more stuff and it's not
identical to what she'll be doing and
this is really meant to be a lecture
slash introduction and that's why we're
doing today this is a there dark theme
all right so so what we're basically
looking at here in this very in this
array is an array with an object of Ray
with a single object in it and what's
going on here is it's basically trying
to show you that you can create you can
store first you can store complex
objects into a race and you can store a
race within that object
okay um hey David I'll answer your
question
towards the end yeah um make sense so
far you remember I'll have objects work
and use call key value figures so let's
say we wanted this artist we'd actually
have to target the index and then we
could call the dot artists so if we said
my music index 0 dot artists it would
return Billy Joel yeah cool
so in this we're going to add a new
album to my music so in index 2 and
we'll just go ahead you're obviously
pushing my heart I can't type or use the
mouse there you're good alright so we
want to add another object
remember objects are denoted with the
curly braces and they have the key value
pairs in it and in here what we're going
to do is we're simply going to add an
artist remember this is the key and then
for the value what do you want the
artist to be are they tell us
dolly do L on dolly
what that is that is that the museum
wailing - yeah is that DHI Li da Li da
Li hi alright and then we're going to
add the title was the title will say
Lincoln pic I will just say Lincoln
whatever the Lincoln Lincoln photo was
and then um release here and so this
would be this would actually be a
relatively realistic way that you would
in this case we're talking about albums
but you can see how if you want to
return all the albums from a search
result it might come back in this way in
an array of objects with multiple pieces
of info for each index and so release
Cheryl said mm and then finally Anna
formats array of strings so in this case
four minutes and you'll see it will
throw in an array of strings and we'll
say I've known you I I guess I just
throw two in there and let's go ahead
and run this and so when we can contain
release year which is a number whoopsies
so because it's in quotes as a string
right but all we did here was add so if
we wanted to get this entire object
it's like that that me up I
just don't know don't know what well you
just well okay it's just it's just
knowing there's nothing that you can
teach me everything you sit there help
me memorize every single thing
well don't well maybe that is what's
most frustrating me when it comes to
learning the ins and outs of the
language it takes time and also a key
skill that a lot of junior developers or
people who are trying to be junior
developers need to obtain by struggling
through it is the ability to problem
solve their own bugs as well as to see
them when they're right in front of them
right yeah cool you can also access any
sort of nested object so you see we have
an object within an object within an
object object object object object and
you can do that in various way so um is
it depends how complex the dota is so
like let's take our hand our hands an
object and then we say okay we have five
fingers right so then we have fingers
and so that's your hand has a finger
object and then you have five objects in
there and each finger has a bone
multiple bones so they have bones and
that object it lists all the bones and
then I thought you could just lose those
now um well it's all related to the one
main object in this case car so the car
on the inside we have a glove box and
passengers you see on the outside waiver
trunk and so it really is about just um
the more the four fingers one thumb
object there you go
see you guys are too clever all right so
in this case if we wanted to get the
glove box object we could do that very
easily by calling my storage and what do
you think it knowing what you know is
how objects and the keys work how would
we what would we go together gonna write
it but it would just be
dot memories dot notation and there's
there's bracket organization so let's
let's do dot notation because that's
more than likely I thought that was not
the likely no usually you'll do it like
this so say we wanted my storage is the
whole is the outside and we go deep
deeper and we saved car and we say dot
inside that car dot love oh my god
actually you can't do like this because
there's a space I'm thinking JSON
objects this is a different object I'm
sorry I didn't mean to confuse you here
um glovebox
use dot and bracket notation to access
my source
this is glovebox oh they wanted to
combine the two okay I see that so we
can do it we can actually combine the
two so car dot inside and normally if
this was one word you could use dot
notation this is two words you do
something like this where we combine
notation and odd and bracket notation so
my storage is the variable the key that
we're looking for the object is car the
object within car is inside and the key
that we're trying to get is glovebox so
now we're taking dot notation and
bracket notation and going for that so
uh you can access the arrays the objects
in an array that has its own array as
well if we wanted the value there so in
this case they want us to retrieve the
second a variable from my plants using
dot notation so my plants the second
tree from the variable my plants the
five second tree is this one right so
trees the second tree variable my plants
using object dot and array bracket
notation okay so if we wanted to
remember my plants as an array right and
we know that arrays have indexes and we
can target those into indexes with
numbers so how what would be the if we
wanted to target this value here we
wanted to get that second index what
would be the number that we would want
in my plants good and then if we wanted
to retrieve pine wood using dot or
bracket notation we'll say dot what did
what would be the first thing that we
would do
good and so one thing to remember so if
in case you can confuse just to remind
yourself where you're at in the second
force of my plants we're right here and
then we say okay list where have where
we now and now we're here now using now
what's list it's an array and we said we
want pine so how would we get there what
would be the index no the index because
it's an array we use brackets in it oh
say I don't one good and now we're have
with this variable set to second tree is
point O okay so those are arrays with
objects in it yes this is a variable
there's a number you have to call the
objects with the dot list and the arrays
with well you can combine brackets yeah
so you can combined bracket notation and
dot notation okay
this is a hard one for people great this
is gonna be easy for me this is one
where you put it all together also write
a function that takes an albums ID so
that they have they give us and this is
our example collection right so this is
one artis the first lost uh erased are
going to index zero James that's what
you're asking so the first value would
be index zero the second value would be
index one javascript this is zero I
forgot the rest of it I wrote it down
okay
the first list yeah zero that is correct
okay oh uh yeah do it again oh all right
so use bracket up to what does I want us
to do I wish I'd just put this in
bold so I could see it cuz I don't need
to read this all right oh it's
too much to read uh yeah you got it man
all right so um write a function with
takes an album ID okay yes right here
it takes album ID like two five four
eight a property part like artists or
tracks and a value to modify the data in
the collection if prop isn't in tracks
and value is an empty update or set the
value for the record albums property
your function must always return the
entire collection object so what we're
doing is we are first checking the
collection right and so we're seeing
are we assuming the idea exists okay
also it will soon the idea just and the
prop is what artists so when you say we
assume lady that's not the idea
what are you right there
missile yeah so we'll say bar well is
equal to collection dot ID and so what
we're doing is we're passing on this
number and it's going to retrieve it
actually let's just use bracket notation
for so make life a little easier and so
there you go so that's our value so if
it exists we're gonna get our collection
the next thing that we need to do you
see how I'm breaking out in like piece
by piece right don't get overwhelmed by
the problem instead tackle each little
piece how do you get problems that work
like how do you get instructions what do
you mean I work you'll get instructions
okay there's no instructions there's no
like a here's this unique web
application instruction it's I am
literally archaic tech kidding no I like
I was my boss tell me to do yeah mine
he's just like hey I want this layout
are you happy oh my boss this is
something maybe we should talk about
this at the end this is how long okay
because a long answer to give you the
writing cuz you're saying you're tiny
take it in little fits but that's not
real world yeah but you know in you're
not it in a real-world skill set yet but
funny but the book I know but the the
the concept is the same depending on
where you're at so I'm just curious okay
it's kinda like write revisions
redrafting and a lot of prep work if
you're do beforehand and that prep work
isn't something that free code camp will
teach you by will teach you which is why
I like doing these as well to give you
real-life context okay
so we're tracking we're doing piece by
piece right write a function that
functions are written if prop isn't in
track so the next thing we have is prop
and we say if we do a little if
statement says if um remember we have
the has own property remember that
function for an array or an object see
well in this case we have Val
so we're storing this in a vowel okay a
variable which stores the entire thing
so don't get confused by this because
now we're just changing variables and
we're going to say hey if does this
exist if it does it's going to return
true okay and if it's property
if problem addicted didn't of it 10% of
my bootcamp it's done ah
a lifetime of bootcamp I imagine 10% of
the tutoring sessions art will be done
today um at the other day what I'm
really hoping is put in the daily coding
spirit and grind and half April make it
part of her lifestyle so yeah so here we
we say hey does this value is this does
this prop exists in this case it's
artists is there an artist if there is
if prop isn't prop wait
so if the prop isn't tracks oh so if it
is not equal equal to tracks
we can't rid of the Frog we're actually
saying hey we want to check the value of
prop and we're saying look if it's not
equal equal two tracks my function prop
isn't tracks and the value
and the value you can play with the
Nash's sorry buddy no no we got work
alright I so read function takes album
if prop isn't tracks meaning the values
and tracks and the value is an empty
updater set the value for the out record
album property obtained receptive a
leave if prop isn't tracks and value is
not equal equal tune of g-string kilise
Galloway
don't yell ahem just a baby it's two
years old me he's a baby tears olds like
teenage it's no longer retarded all
right uh special kitty eye and isn't
empty update or set the value for the
record albums property so what's
happening here is we're saying hey first
store that object secondly check to see
if our prop is equal to tracks or is if
prop isn't tracks is not equal to tracks
and the value is not equal to zero this
property if this is a true statement if
both those things are true what we want
to do is we want to target we want to
say Val dot tracks dot push remember
what pushed us yeah
what is pushed in
as it - adds to the end adds to the end
of what stream know of a list oh you're
a good push adds the what you're trying
to add to the end the right so what our
logic here saying is if is not equal to
tracks if this value is unequal tracks
and our value is an empty isn't an empty
string we want you to go ahead and on
the one that we've started remember
starred one these objects we want to
push to the tracks array I think that's
it
can I read property push phone the phone
goddamn it just makes him killed so much
less godly in this sense so you're
actually gonna fee should have worked
he's a good teacher he's very he's been
very patient which I am not so that's
gonna refresh this something that weird
happened on here how couldn't you had an
even a Senate you haven't even run it
with that
so we have our collection bracket
notation really we're going to get rid
of the bracket notation see if that
makes a difference
all right so can I read property push of
undefined
so for some reason my ID is returning
back undefined so maybe they didn't have
a pre-existing ID oh thank you soon no
no it does right here so 5 4 3 903 mmm
I wonder so these are strings
so maybe the oh ok ok I see what's going
on here so what's going on is we are
passing in a number and it's expecting a
string so what we can do instead of we
can do dot ID and let's try this one
more time it's an ID and object itself
no the ID here you should be able to
access bracket notation either way can't
read property push of undefined ID that
track so if prop is not equal to tracks
and the value is not equal to 0 take our
collection all collection is a giant
object that's right and when we say dot
ID dot tracks dot push then push that
value
so here I'll show you let's share this
what we're going to do is write code
over to the side we are going to console
dot log collection got ID dot tracks and
see if we get a value run our test so
it's not hitting that fresh this real
quick
so it's never hitting this
and let's
also dot log test because if it's
returning undefined it's not going to
console like sometimes test us so
it rinse twice it doesn't hit this so
we're going to start doing this piece by
piece so instead what we want to do is
console dot log ID goal five four three
nine let's try it one more time so eight
you see I'm breaking it down piece by
piece trying to find where our bug is or
where our air and logic is what you want
to call it dot ID undefined undefined
okay so let's try it here so now that
worked you see how we're having our five
four three nine is returning an album Oh
 alright so we can't push
to the ICSD to the air we made the
assumption and this is this is a good
example of why you should never make the
assumption I made the assumption that
the tracks array here existed now the
reason that this is important is the
reason our code failed was because we're
pushing a value that doesn't exist we
can't push to an array that doesn't
exist so what we can do is within here
we can say if
collection dot ID is ID'd dot as on up
40 tracks go ahead and add that value
else we're going to add we're going to
say collection dot ID dot tracks is
equal to an empty array and then we're
going to push that value that should do
it
let's go ahead so what this is doing is
saying hey is it not equal to tracks and
is the value that we want to add exists
is it not empty and if this has the Trax
array if that property exists we want to
go ahead and we want to push that value
to it because it's an array if it
doesn't exist
go ahead and create that array and then
push the value to it just a little bit
of logic
can I read property hassle the helis is
it not capitalized
revalue has on for our friends me
so let's try this show you a little bit
more well in console debugging here free
code camp version alright so console dot
log collection ID and so let's run our
test so we get that and so we want to
say collection collection collection ID
dot has own property tracks let's see
what happens when we run that false
false so what did we do differently
all right so it's returning false which
is good that means that it's working now
we have collection Oh whoopsies we did
the same mistake that we did before and
then down here so our logic was right
our syntax was wrong basically so you
just have to go and fix it like we did
before let's go to run this
son of a bitch alright uh so test false
white I used to it shouldn't matter but
it seems to be affecting it differently
back to square one is that was going on
here SC returns undefined that's why
we're not doing it because we're using
we're knees bracket notation
however this returns a correct statement
it says and maybe there's something
wrong with our if statement so saying
hey if prop isn't tracks okay and the
value isn't empty okay
update or set value for the record album
update or set the value for the record I
like this oh maybe I misunderstood what
I was asking it's not pleasure would be
alright so update so the value of your
passing in is ABBA
so
so you would set it
if the prop is tracks with album doesn't
have a track property create an empty
array before adding the new value to the
corresponding you know I remember having
this same issue when I was on
this one this look pisses me off more
than anything is I was here like a year
ago doing this stuff show and I hit this
stupid one and I me up
then - um all right so if prop is tracks
oh wait no if prop isn't tracks and
value is an empty update or set the
value for the record albums property oh
 I did that up if prop isn't
tracks and the value isn't empty yeah
you're right I'm gonna that one oh
and so update our set the value for the
record albums property alright so here
we go uh so we're actually updating the
album yeah alright good catch baby will
say collection ID dot album equals value
property
Oh dot prop ah I get it now aha all
right we got the first one all right so
we're setting the value for this
property now if it is if it is tracks we
want to do our other things so we'll
have an else--if here else--if drop a
equal weight is there anything else for
say I'll do else else else
it's the array because we're setting it
for everything else all we care is that
it's not tracks if it's if it is tracks
we want to go ahead and add it are any
good angular videos going to be recorded
soon yeah uh pretty soon man I've just
been a little busy with this hundred
days of tutoring no uh I love to
do so much uh yeah there's a lot of good
stuff coming up pretty soon Jordan all I
have about Tyra chord like a video every
day to to get this that stuff coming out
so don't don't sweat it man I just
haven't been able to release anything
this week oh okay so remember what we
did here what we did what were what this
verse if statements for is to set the
key value pairs now in this that aren't
arrays now we're going to go ahead and
push a race and so we're having L same
associative collection
now how do we target the collection with
the idea that we're passing in and then
we're going to say dot tracks so if that
exists oops if that exists we just want
to go ahead and push to that array is a
collection ID dot push and whatever
tracks excuse me tracks dot push and we
don't push the value to it all right now
remember we have that issue where it
didn't exist so we can do an else here
and in this case we'll say collection ID
top tracks is equal to an empty array
and then we'll go ahead and say
collection ID dot tracks says if volume
is empty delete the given property from
the album okay similarly we will have
another thing in there so all right and
then we'll say so if profetas tracks and
values and empty pushes the value onto
the end of the album's existing tracks
very cool and if value is empty delete
the given property name all right cool
so before we do any of this we'll just
throw in this same and says okay if
we can make this an else--if
if value is equal to equal to an empty
string collection ID and your how we
delete them with the delete all right
baby
god damn all right so we're good in
there though
we're knocking it out piece by piece so
artists should not be set matter of fact
artists should be deleted right so let's
go up you don't even read these go out
club let me read what we're getting uh
artists should be ABBA
Oh
I my coat up
so if value is equal to so if value is
empty we want to delete that collection
so what I have to do now baby is a sure
fix my logic so we're gonna pace by
piece just start checking off these bad
boys so this one
what happens when we do this so if value
is empty delete the given prop from the
album
see here election ID like reason we're
not cheating off for you in chat right
now man stop trying to give us the
answers
oh so yeah you're right you're
right Damien I should have looked at
chat I would figured it out on my own so
I made the same mistake I made a second
ago where I wasn't using the the bracket
notation like I needed to who sees you
got this monkey so let's change our code
I'm used to
unfortunately so JSON and you'll be
working more with JSON then then oops
with JavaScript object notation then you
will be objects and they'll look very
similar but they are not which is why us
some of my code didn't work so what
happens when we run this one so we're
almost there okay I see what's going on
so there's one last test case where we
don't want to push a value if in case
because it's not a key value pair of
James it is silky value pair it's part
of an object though it's not part of a
JSON that's so you have to pass it as a
string to define it typically when
you're working a web development uh
Gilmore so it's feeling pretty nice
yo-yo more so be working with JSON z--
then then JavaScript objects they are
different they're gonna look very
similar though and I had a brain fart
here thank you to Dean showed me the
heirs of my ways here um alright so last
thing we have to do is just check if a
value is not
equal equal to an empty one we don't
want to push an empty value to it and
then we pass everything so this is
actually really good example of

okay so also the log collection ID at
the end here oh maybe it doesn't want to
sad tracks maybe that would be what it
doesn't want us to do there we go
alright alright so this is a good
example to show you where you know I
kind of fumbled about a bit not a big
deal but this is a good thing for you to
see of how one goes about kind of
systematically breaking a problem down
and when you get stuck go and start
checking things piece by piece what
which is a another thing is like you
asked for me so let's let's this is a
good one to end on because I want to
answer your question that you asked me
earlier and a lot of people will be
interested by it
so I remember the core part of your
question what was the actual question
like what do I do
or how do because you because you were
saying okay you wanna go line by line
which is funny because that's not what
you did there like the problem well not
in the following in your code you know
peaceful face no just before that you
see you want to look at you know what
it's asking you to do and go step by
step which is what you don't do like I
read it I saw it um but then it didn't
treat me to think that okay if you go
step by step and with you know what's
with being asked to you like how in your
work is asked to you step by step like
how do you plan that like what does that
look like so your projects when you're
working on a project there's something
called wire yeah well first you meet
with the client the client is who tells
you what they want and there's a few as
a developer to ask questions
so that you can build them what you want
so some of the part of the job may be
that you're actually inquiring you're
getting you're finding out what features
they need and all that sort stuff and
then you're defining you're creating
tickets tickets are something I'll say
hey this is what needs to be done and
there may be documentation yeah like a
serum yeah and so your device your
devising the best step by step so it's
not necessary step by step but each
individual piece you're devising it the
best you can and creating architecture
and things like that now based off that
architecture which sometimes is there
sometimes it's not you are going to
build it using the skill set that we
have like the skill set in this case was
we're working with JavaScript so we need
to know that for instance has on
property do we use that one yeah oh we
did we did but that was one thing that
we could use to see that it existed
another thing that we could use in this
case we just checked in alleys we need
to know that the not equal operators
existed in the end
operator if and else statements and
other functions and so when my boss
assigns me a task it varies depending on
the task but if he says Dylan that
multi-site I'll give you example what I
did today for a little bit we are using
a multi select that we didn't develop no
time no reason to we use another multi
select it doesn't work the way that we
wanted after you hit two clicks it says
two are selected we want it to showcase
all the values that is selected okay
that's what the client wants sure so I'm
diving it I dive into somebody else's
code I find where they set it and now I
add my own logic where now I need to
overwrite their code and change it based
off the skills
the functions I know exist
in this case that's what I did Irie Irie
fact and not in fact a reengineered is
probably the better word because
refactoring means are just going back
and just kind of make it better and
changing so i reengineering the code
that was there and that led to other
problems so once once you make it so
that it can list it because the the
engineer there decided they were going
to they were going to a they re after
one two is selected that's all I need
have I need that value so what happens
then is then that multi select that
takes up a set amount of space now it's
going off the page and so from
there you have to take your CSS skills
and you have to say look the width is
set for 100% makes sense it should
always take up a hundred percent of
whatever the div is but there's also a
min width and then there's a max width
and the max width will continue growing
and so he's then going to the CS and you
set the max width and you say all right
cool um that that there couldn't be any
more problems
okay there are though so so the next
thing you have to do is you have to set
it so that you're you don't you go back
in your test right you go few so each
piece I was like okay I think I know
where to look I go and I do it I use
this I use the tool set I have to to
work on it from there
I go back each change I test it see what
could break because all these things
don't occur to you it doesn't occur to
me
that after I change this that it's going
to Mac six fanned indefinitely right or
the next air that would happen where now
the text where now remember I change it
from being two selected to say the name
one name two names in your name for now
name one name to name three name for it
indefinitely expanding but the button or
the drop-down staying the same so then I
have to go and hide the overflow in the
CSS and so this you know all these sorts
of things but when when my boss says
we're building a new project what's
what's the goal what's and you did what
you do is you define user stories what
is it that the user wants to do and then
based off what the user wants to do you
start saying what do we need to do that
and then from there you said you start
breaking it down and as individual
pieces why say the user wants to be able
to upload photos and get those photos
what does that entail and then you start
breaking it down piece by piece I mean
that's where the programmer comes in
yeah and there's all this out to your
discussion it's not like laid out uh it
will it could be at larger companies but
at a smaller team like myself you are
quality assurance I'm also doing testing
you are doing front end you're doing
back end you're doing database design
you're doing archit which also
architecture you're doing wire framing
where you're actually making visual
representations because the reason you
do wire framing is not only so that you
can show the client hey this is what we
want to build for you
based off our conversation because in
their mind where the where things don't
link their mind has magically linked it
so that it makes sense so you have to
actually take their idea and physically
manifest it in a picture and say this is
what you told me this is what you want
and then you have to wait for them to
actually sit down for a second take a
deep breath and say say that
doesn't work does it no it cannot be
heads and tails this is why right and so
based off that they change that you
start working out the kinks that they as
developers can so you wireframe it up
and and you know you have user flow
charts and things like that which are
similar but you build it into a picture
and from that picture you look at the
picture you start thinking and there's a
reason you do that and this is based off
the requirements the requirements are
the things that the clients are supposed
to give you but never do and so you have
to keep pulling and pulling and going
back through the data and because they
they haven't fully figured out they just
know they want it right and this is what
they want us to do that they're not
engineers they're not developers so you
make a picture of it from that picture
and for me working through it you'll see
okay I have an ad button here to add a
document so now I need to save the
document and what does that entail well
and it tells a database and tells data
types and tells primary Keys it entails
a way for them to save it entails a way
for them to delete it entails away from
them to update and to add so you have
four things right there you have to add
program in the background in the backend
and so based off that it really depends
on what task you're on you start
breaking it down piece by piece by piece
starting with the conversation with the
client to putting in pictures with the
wireframes what the client wants to
sending the wireframes to the client
explaining your thought process about
their thought process and whether you
were right and from there you know
shooting back and forth between the
senior developer and whoever else is
doing it and a larger company someone
may be doing each one of these tasks
piece by piece by piece
whether is trying to take over the chat
it's like that's cool man
but Oh what is the best place to learn
angular Kok Adam II has a angular course
and I have a couple on my channel where
I had enough cools man
cool story breath put you on timeout
ah do any cool um so um what I use for
wireframing I use a program called
balsalmic uh how sonic balsamic vinegar
what the IQ yeah am I gonna learn
English ooh I am man right now uh when
my finger so I haven't actually been
doing any coding after work I've been
working on side projects and things like
that in in YouTube and and some graphic
design and stuff like that for an
upcoming store that I'm going to be
releasing but um and and tutoring with
April so I haven't been able to dive
into angular 2 but first I'm going to
finish up node I'm going to finish up
Express MongoDB Mongoose all the backend
projects the full stack mean once and
then I'm going to dive into angular 2 or
react I haven't fully decided but one of
the to store yes a developer store where
you can buy stickers you can buy mugs
you can buy posters mouse pads and I
imagine eventually closed as well my my
view for this is to start off very very
easy in terms of I have a graphic
designer that I've worked with for a
while he's a good friend of mine I've
known him as long as I've known engineer
truth which is over 20 years and we've
worked on stuff together and so I'm
going to pay him a percent of the
profits and then we're going to do that
but um so you'll you'll see posters
you'll basically get a t-shirt with my
face on it yeah I it
basically things for you to keep motive
there's also going to be cheat sheets
that are laminated so for like you know
five bucks you can get a cheat sheet
that's going to have all the JavaScript
functions on it all the angular
directives all that sort of stuff so
that might be bad moves can I donate you
some free merch there'll be some free
merch giveaways on occasion not too
often
and definitely patreon subscribers will
get a discount when the store goes live
I would say expect about I probably
won't launch it till after we move what
I do loot box is funny how you are on
the same page as me and James Scott
there is also going to be a potential
once we get some inventory a potential
maybe like $20 a month sort of coding
box sort of imagine loot crate's out
where every month I give you various
things for people who are in the $20
range where I will send you you know
stickers maybe a shirt man we're gonna
look for Cody you shouldn't put that
stuff in there yeah so I have a I do
have a game plan and between the
Facebook group and the you guys getting
a little coating like keychain thing
that'd be cool like a medal and the
whole thing yeah so you'll see a lot of
coding related itself and there's I mean
there's a lot of reasons for it I one I
like to make money and - I think it's a
good it's a good idea and I'm passionate
about it and I think I think a lot of
you guys would like it for me I stay
motivated by having this stuff all in my
face the posters the YouTube channel all
that um yeah you can email me about it
here I'll type my email in it in chat
but um okay so let's uh enough about the
destroyer that doesn't exist yet but
it's on its way probably I would take
two months we'll do a launch we're
moving in a month and then I would say
two weeks after that I'll probably order
the stuff and so I'll probably drop some
money getting some some pre-made stuff
and then a month after about two weeks
to a month after that
uh we'll do a launch party a lesser
stuff all that fun stuff um but um do
you kind of get back to the main point
do you kind of get what I do
like there's not instructions when
you're developer there are guides user
stories and then it's up what you
brought up yeah to figure out how to
implement it
yeah kind of set those how to meet those
requirements maybe like how an I said it
was it's like a Ciaran Oh a ticket so a
ticket based so that I understand
because that makes a lot of sense so
like you okay okay so you have your user
story and based on user story you can
create those tickets I'm where you're at
and then you can framework it all show
the client that and kind of bash back
and forth yeah okay so it don't make
sense
good you suck at breaking down problems
amen
it gets easier the more experience you
get I'm actually really bad at
algorithms I'm good at breaking down
phones but we'll see how good I am at
breaking down coding problems so it just
takes practice to get there uh I haven't
put in the practice with algorithms
unfortunately just because my mind is
all over the place with a lot of things
and so uh yeah it is it's like this this
is a physical wrapper tation Dylan's
head
so this is a good question to end on
David yang says April other than Dylan
what's been a good source for your
learning or intention knowledge so I've
been looking at what was that one school
three I think it's called school three
I've never heard of what you're talking
about
um oh w3schools yeah okay all right uh
w3schools I mean I go to their webpage a
lot I look through a lot of their
examples really how centralize it I
actually look a lotta on um like ebooks
so like I tried I was trying to find a
book but fortunately goddess monkey
bought me a book so I'll have a book to
start reading I'm really excited about
that because I know reading and being
able to mark a book up kind of helps me
internalize that so um and then doing it
so much doesn't I don't know if it's
helping me internalized it but I know it
is frustrating me back to David's
question
um I'm I get frustrated by the code
because what I think is in my head that
I'm trying to apply to my code isn't
working and it's like oh it's working in
my brain is not working here so
apparently something's wrong and it's
finding out what I'm missing here
so that I can put it here and I just
don't have the knowledge base yet to
know what it is that I'm missing so I
have to go and look for it or even
understand what it is that I'm missing
in the first place so that I can
understand that I'm M missing something
so it's it's a it's definitely the lack
of knowledge that frustrates me and then
it's for internal izing it just
listening to this the lecture read going
back going back over my notes writing my
own notes
going through multiple examples of it on
a website that is actually all helping
me very slowly I'm gonna be making some
flashcards or cheat sheets or whatever
to kind of help me do that and then
again I'm gonna have the book so
hopefully combination of all those
things will really help me internalize
it more anything I just need more
information and I'll say this that
supposed to be last question but in
terms of traversÃ©e media there are
three channels guys that I go to for
coding tutorials one is the new Boston
two is Derek bonus and my new recent
favor is traversing media if you're not
already following all three of those and
you're trying to be a developer and you
want good resources Derek von Osten
traversing media are two of my favorites
and New Boston just because there's so
much content you gotta give it to it to
the guy but um what do you know of
youtubers that do coding tutorials oh
those are my three favorite um
traversing media is probably my news
favorite to be honest with you because
he's uploading constantly he's in the
middle of the grind the other guys are
sitting back on the watching their their
checks come in so I definitely encourage
you to follow all three of those I
actually was talking about that today um
I remember you wanna you want to leave
us out I want to talk more Fisher you
don't talk why are you talk more no I
just thought yeah because I was reading
on David David's comment
and rust and stuff and maybe that's
something that we can look like for me
it's the lack of knowledge that's
expressed to me like I love free Co camp
and yes it's helping me learn but
there's and I can understand that they
want to kind of keep it simple because
too much information can be too much
um well I mean take take this problem
for instance the record one do you how
long you saw me kind of mess around with
it for what 20 minutes mm-hmm
this tip could do you think you would
have been able to do put this all
together in an afternoon on your own in
an afternoon what's an afternoon like a
whole day after yeah I think you could
solve this without looking up the
solution just by absolutely not without
looking up the solution that's part of
my issue with is that they give me this
task with not enough information that I
have to go and look for the information
but that's part of their process of
teaching you but in my my point of
teaching someone is I think that maybe
someone should have I would have set
this whole learning skill up differently
like if I it ran my own free code camp
program it would be set very differently
because there are certain ways that you
can lead someone into learning something
and although this may be the original
stop shop of how coders used to do it it
doesn't mean that you can't change how
someone learns code how to innovatively
give someone the advantage and learning
code so that they can become better and
faster at learning code this does not do
that for you but you can most definitely
define a program that does do that for
you and you'll have your your book to
help you with that hopefully I'll be a
better way
so and the thing is is what's great
about something like a program like this
is that they should like they have the
community to talk about those subjects
but it's okay I don't know if you I've
been on those community things it's so
chaotic on one of those chats that I
don't even bother so for me to have like
an index thing to go to on free code
camp about terms or things that things
that they have that reach out to maybe
youtubers that link on that subject or
something like that something a little
bit more organized I think would be
sufficient for me maybe other people but
I just
I appreciate the free education
I do 100% but if I ever get a chance to
rebuild something yeah because this is
not how people learn I mean this is this
is how people can learn I'm not saying
that you can't learn from this what I'm
saying is is that it can be better
taught to be better learn yeah everybody
learns differently absolutely but you
give someone an organized process of
something they can pick and pull a piece
of everything that they need on how they
learn if you give them those options
that are organized there won't be all
this chaotic I have no idea where the
 I am understanding syntax blah blah
blah you have be able to help yourself
pinpoint the deficient cheese within an
organized program Athlon saying all
right
all right so um yeah getting paid while
I learned that would be the best badges
is a bootcamp like with eight-hour days
a man if I make enough money let's say
for it let's say a coding tauros 360s
YouTube channels making uh I don't know
hundred K I'd be out here doing
eight-hour days I could do it exactly
that's my point
uh Graham Graham Craig Graham Gilmore
Graham Gilmore that's exactly my point
is that you can be taught on how to look
for your answers and when you are taught
to look for your answers you can be more
efficient and learning what you're
deficient in and that doesn't do this
for you and that's part of my issue with
it you will get there though because
it's so far we haven't so far all we've
done is is learn syntax oh yeah no I'm
not saying that I'm not far enough into
it that I you know and I understand what
I'm saying is I understand their bases
where they're coming from how they want
their code to set up how it's been done
how it's going how people learn from it
like I'm not saying that it's wrong I'm
saying there are different ways of
learning there are different ways of
systems being set up to help people
learn alright um so I appreciate you
guys watching I have to get working on
those side hustles so that I can get my
 up and running oh the best coding
tool yeah rats have you seen their new
coding ah course I haven't checked it
out yet it is definitely on my to-do
list
hey yeah 50% of the time du livre is
Google's more organized lobby Chatty
Cathy oh hey I don't want to go I keep
talking everybody is so nice oh alright
so um
so if you guys want to support me you
can we're trying to raise money for to
get upgrade the webcam and the monitor
to 4k so that we can do screen shares in
4k
that's appreciate you can do that
through donating or through patreon and
if you don't want to do that or you do
want to do that make sure you also join
the facebook group co tech and caffeine
the link is in the description below
just like that
i I and our cats appreciate you being
here I'll see you guys tomorrow for day
11 we are ten percent of the way through
a hundred days of code which is I think
a strong commitment I think we've had a
strong start to think that it's only
been ten days and here you are working
on the portfolio and soon when you get
that you'll be diving into this stuff
and that's when it gets exciting
oh I'm scared I'm scared so you want you
wanna you want to get a sound or should
I do it you do it cuz I did last time
alright do with the nasa code long and
