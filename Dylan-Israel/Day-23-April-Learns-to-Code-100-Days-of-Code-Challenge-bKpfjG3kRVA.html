actually expected
um hey Milo
let me turn light on this Serena much
hey you been raiding a bunch every boy
oh that cat all right so let's talk
about what you got done today
 you bit
I got to like six of seven ten of one of
the sections good and was that functions
and examine Yap functions
Michael so
what we'll do is we'll review what you
went over and then I'll help you on the
section you got stuck on then we will
continue on so good
do you mind erasing the life work
hey goddess monkey
you
all right after this
yeah after what that you're gracing the
Borg yeah meet me
we got an hour of this no like right
after that I'm gonna wash my mouth out
with Tom on and I'm just going to sack
the out I'm going to wake up at
like 3 or 4 and get all the because
I don't like working after work it's
awful it's like my life baby yeah but
you enjoy working after work I don't I
don't enjoy it then why don't you get up
earlier in the morning
because I already get up at 6:00 season
early I would literally have to get up
at like 2:00
yeah okay all right guys oh so let's get
started here I use GoDaddy for the time
being um I'm just reviewing what you did
here okay so let's start by wedding
define a function called whatever you
want so first off what terminology
what's the function do
I went over yesterday I know the answer
I do
it
so function is a keyword whereas a name
well Scott parameters can't have
parameters can't have parameters
oh it's a resumable code you're usable
yes okay so what do you write an example
function real quick
I have not tried project Euler done it
javascript object as a counter I did see
it I keep that in mind when I finish it
up tomorrow
huh
okay so
and they returned about you right
alright uh what else so you have an idea
what a function does that's good
turn return to okay let's look at our
backyard is literally a lake right now
let's I'll help you with the section
that you're struggling with
so was it work out to that uh no I think
I think we're here how you gonna do
review the other subject I thought this
is only when you got done yeah okay
let's let's you're okay uh alright
what's the variable well it was the
point of the variable his stores of
value good
now what are some some data types you
move on the last day of this month up so
about fourteen days two weeks exactly
you don't need to write it we're gonna
this like fast that's fast no writing
mr. string
object array
I know there's five honey um so what I
was trying to get at
I know numbers that's not called numbers
right no it's called number oh okay
number and then coin flip oh yeah cool
yeah all right cool so your everyday
ties now what about for loops
what if for loops ooh they store a
section of code that you call to and
reuse sort of yes it will rerun that
section of code as many times other
these do when it's in the book when it's
in the for loop okay write me a for loop
that runs three times
I don't know I remember
yes you can get across yep we did
takes in three parts in the parentheses
right
okay give your iterator your statement
every increment created iterator
statement increment will spoil it up the
the creating the iterator that's going
to be used in statement it was when
statement
and then before Lucas Oh point value
to add value Bertha sooo cool
so give us an example
it's really pouring out there
 I don't know
ah
our
under our equals i how do we create very
all we're doing is creating variable
doesn't have to be I we usually call it
I just because it's short
again
so keyword name assignment operator
value
what are your coding we are jumped so I
am in the process of teaching with this
is day 23 of a hundred day coding
challenge where I am teaching my
girlfriend web development so we're
doing JavaScript she's learning syntax
in the basics man okay so I said I
wanted to run what three times four
times five times okay
so set up a statement where one's two
time
how's it going she steadily learning
that's right so what's this a we're
creating a variable at zero right and
add this at this
so saying well I is less than four run
what's in here
and after each iteration was the same
add one add one die okay
is it there like a semicolon
good so for loops all right what do if
statements do embody way to Boyan mm-hmm
so and why do we use them
to make decisions yes
the computer uses balloons to make
decisions I hit this I've bent
it back
looks good though but don't peel that
back right um so what are if else is new
or else this isn't open I'll sit else if
is another form to evaluate your
statement that only happens when when
this Dame in advance
okay what's an else statement do it runs
a statement or if me if and I'll say yes
else will always run if everything above
it fits good
so unless you put an and and that that
strip this good can you put that in and
in or run anyway no you don't understand
what that does okay so let's explain
let's good evaluate it's let's actually
talk about that real quick so what
you're talking about this is another
logical operator similar to how we have
less than greater than
that's an or or an and so okay we have
our in statement and if I say if 1 is
equal equal to 1 or 2 is greater than 1
run our code so this is or so either one
of these is trained it will remit now if
I change this to and I change it to hand
is this true one is equal to one
yeah is two and is to greater than than
one yes so we're on this a bad example
of it there's a to greater than eleven
hey what fun is so one is equal to one
this is true and two is a great villain
eleven is false so it doesn't running
that's your aunt yeah alright so let's
understand that that has nothing doing
else it has to do with how your it adds
more logic to your in statements and
everything else I'm just curious if you
you that um okay so let's take a look at
what you were getting stuck on on
codecademy black mark here would be
awesome all right
hi boys black marker it is for the low
price of $9.99 you can get black marker
in this episode of April learn together
right um I love Emperor salt what the
 are those two bulls that I saw I
was thinking so inside the get tax
functions block which is what's a block
referring to between the curly braces
yeah the scope multiply the subtotal
tires 6% to make sure the return is a
result of this operation
so what function are we targeting I get
some total
okay police I think yeah right I
had too much pasta or garlic what what
the you put in that sound I guess
we feel like weird did you poison me
poison
all right inside get tax you get
subtotal so look at this real quick what
is it do you know the difference between
when you call a function like this and
when you call a function like this do
you know what's happening do you know
that no I was trying to figure that out
though okay so when you call get
subtotal what is actually let me show
you what's actually happening is you're
not getting the value you're not getting
the return value you're actually getting
the whole function so if we run this
didn't do it
but essentially what happens is it
returns this entire function like it
just returns this to you but you really
would ever do that but that's where your
air is here is what you want to do is
you actually want to call the function
this function has a return value of item
count times 7.5 and then it's going to
times it by 0.6 was going on now I don't
know because I did that because that's
what I was thinking but then it said it
was still wrong so then I really got
confused oh wait a second wait a second
are we resetting this real quick because
actually you're right that you taken
this parameter so I was mistaken I
apologize for that
so get tax is saying hey you're oh I see
where your areas I think
so inside get tax function block
multiply subtotal times point zero zero
six let's take it out
the hell's going on here oh yeah your Co
is all jacked up iesson I assume they
set up these functions for you okay so
let's reset did let's explain let's
explain what's going on yeah cuz okay
hold on hold on I'm here sure from the
top wait a second
just let me grasp this because I had a
whole thought process in my head
okay so I'm confused on the I see the
septal total okay so let's start by
taking what we have a variable called
the order count as zero right simple
variable storing a number we're going to
use it later on we have this function
that takes in two parameters a topping
and a crust type what happens is every
time we take an order we increase the
order count by one and then and what
could we change this equals to if we
wanted to write less code remember I
plus plus what's I do adding 1 to I I
initially did have it they changed my
code okay so it be order count plus plus
right yeah way to go and so um you have
a get subtotal item count so what's
going on here we're passing in a number
and you we are then returning that
number times 7.5 so that's our subtotal
each pizza cost $7.50 how many pizzas
are you buying that's the item count now
what happens next is and remember what's
this returning the item count times 750
yes is returning in number so when we
call get tax that's actually calling get
subtotal which is then going to be used
right here and we're just setting this
up now this is kind of weird that they
set this up like this um but look at get
total so get subtotal takes an item and
then you call get tax which essentially
gets that item gets that value times it
by tax and then you that's all it's
returning so do you understand the math
here is we're getting the 6 percent
right here
based off of the value here and then
we're adding it to that value the mid I
feel like it's an extra step it is
they're breaking up into function sub so
this one only gets taxed this one gets
told and then this one only gets
subtotal but you're using functions
within functions now yeah I know I get
I'm getting that part where you can use
functions return and put it into the
next function to do the next thing you
want from so I get that you can hand
down each functions return to you know
get what you want initially from it I
just I just was confused by the e how
they wanted to do it like how they were
saying to do it so were you times it by
0 6 cuz like if you look to my code
prior I was thinking that obviously I'm
gonna drone so he's right we should draw
it out
so
in our inner code here we take three
orders right so what and every time we
take an order our order count goes up so
what is order count so we say a three
pizza something like that
so three pizzas and so the way that we
get a subtotal is we call our get sub
tool we want to say a what is their
subtotal subtotal is equal to 3 times
7.5 we say hey what is our tax so this
is our get social and then we have get
tax we say hey where does our get taxed
well get tax is equal to our so toll
times point zero six all right and then
what we say is a what is our total and
our total is equal to and mind you each
one of these are function calls our
subtotal plus our text wouldn't our tax
give us
no no because remember tax is only
returning a percent it's not rich if now
what you could do is you could have done
one point zero six so because at that
point it would be just point six percent
more zero six percent more but here
we're actually just generating pure tax
okay so that's why you need the three
steps yeah so this gives us our subtotal
before tax that total that were you that
subtotal we need to know we know our tax
rate is flat at point zero six which by
the way would be an amazing tax rate so
we actually have point seven so I took
that point zero seven here about three
to four percent so up soon to be five
percent less by the way guys so if
you're ever wondering why you don't go
to California that's a good reason right
there so so here you have a flat tax
rate and we're trying to figure out just
what the tax rate is now it's not giving
you anything other than what the
subtotal tax would be exactly okay so
then when you ask for the total it's
going to give you the subtotal yeah when
the tax and we're going and we're at
wool we're adding them together right
and what's going to return your price
yes that makes sense so we're calling a
function that this one that function
returns a subtotal this function returns
the tax and get total calls the that
function it adds it to the other
function and they're both returning
numbers so what happens is ten you know
yeah so the parameters of sukkot
and tax going to be used in the return
to add those together yes make sense
California takes it so much tax money
and yet somehow still has yes still out
there still hot somehow broke and they
are still somehow having more homeless
people on the street than anybody else
it might have something to do with the
median income to own the average house
being one hundred fifty five thousand
dollars by the way that's how much you
need to make they owned the median house
the average house is seven hundred sixty
five thousand dollars in California I
can tell you right now most people do
not make anywhere near a hundred and
fifty five thousand dollars to be
average
 that oh it tastes like four people
yeah so good luck with that man
homeowner dream is essentially dead for
those of you who want that California
then and being in there all my life you
won't believe how many people are all
about that signing themself up for a
four thousand dollar loan every month
that's what that comes out to about four
thousand dollars after a little bit of
interest on seven hundred sixty five
thousand dollar house stupid I
should film a video just talking about
how ridiculous that is
um why California is the worst place to
live isolates let's look at what you're
gonna be doing tomorrow and see if I can
elaborate yeah I have to sign onto yours
I just wanna see what what's gonna lie
yeah yeah you're done with that section
because where you make your menu so
where else maybe okay let's talk about
scope I want you to understand so the
hard concept will be able to understand
how all these things work together in
the scope we've talked about global
scope and local scope
what does global scope means it's going
to run all the code it means that the
variable is is a function or whatever
else isn't is available everywhere okay
yep so this is line one we have VAR a
I'll say this is equal to true so even
if we have a function here and call it
we're going to call it clock X and we
want to say console dot log a does this
console dot log
it does because it's the global scope
meaning that this a exists in here is
available for there yes it it's
available to be used
yes it's defined within there so okay so
this is accessible because it's outside
and it's global now if it was inside
that function oh it would be so if I
create a variable here called VAR b is
equal to false and outside of the loop
here i try to console dot log b what
would happen it wouldn't do anything
like an error because it would we is
within a local scope yes in average it
would be undefined
good um so the next question is let's
take this up a notch
um if I have a for loop so for RI is
equal to zero I is less than three PI
plus four plus and I create something
like this
we should go watch our function I found
out my window was sticking there is SAP
yeah and I cleaned it out and it works
fine and I create a variable here at
column bar J is equal to zero and
outside the for loop but within the
function
I console dot log J that was in his
scope
determined once one
all right yep
that's exactly right
yep so when we try a console dot log J
is that within the scope so a console
log and the for-loop are nested within
the function a or ad so when we kind of
try a console up J does it it does it
exists can we use it
what does it print is it within the
correct scope
Oh sofa scope is within scope we may not
be able to use that scale yes miss is
nested of the J not not right there it
could below it right because then it
would be in Moscow but even though the
scope is nested within scope it even
though it's in the bigger scope because
we nest downwards so J would be able to
go into a deeper scope but it can't go
out if we define the variable outside
the for loop okay on deeper scope will
you mean so let's say we had a for
another for loop within our for loop or
J bar J is equal to chase of an example
our K is equal to 0 wawk wawk k is less
than 3 k plus plus and we had another
one and we tried to print we wanted to
print j here that would work because
this is a scope this is one block this
is another block this is another block
we want to be able to do it here because
this is the outmost coat the inner scope
the innermost scope so the inner moscow
could call out I thought you could only
yeah but you see so calling in this way
this is calling yes
going in going deeper okay so it's not
calling out to the Jay it's calling in
yes
it nests downwards that's important
hey Dylan when you were in college the
teachers chief concepts are coating on
white board methods that you use now
some did most were bad the good ones did
that's true I have good eye I would say
I had two good teachers in college out
of all my teachers oh those are the two
that cared would say yeah probably and
coincidentally enough they were both
former students um which most are just
there because it was messed up Manus I
really would like to be a teacher as
much as I would hate the pay and if I
have enough money I would go and be a
teacher and I think I'd be alright at it
but do you any how do you get how if
it's not to click it so scopes you can
add this mini so global scope everything
right there's nothing less why it's
global and it's kind of like think of it
like it makes a lot of sense because if
you think of it like an advert once
again what if you put your bar in here
is it so low global scope with
everything above it yes if it's in the
global stage
you should get paid very good not
America they don't what teachers are you
talking about
yeah um but yeah so do you see how they
messed in words so depending on where
it's defined in this case is defined
within the for loop it can go into this
other four loops that's nested within it
because it's within the same scope the
outer Moscow if I were to compare this
also it's like a global scope within the
local scope Micah you are smoking
 crack if you think teachers in
California make $60 an hour
crack cocaine my friend oh my god you
don't know what the you're talking
about
here we go
right here baby here we go this is this
is for this is the highest this is the
average this is the average salary right
here the average salary is 63,000 and I
bet most of its even smaller than that
right here 57,000 right here fifty-seven
thousand dollars is it the most is the
average excuse me most are below that
actually guess 50% are below that the
top 10% made ninety one thousand top 10%
10% am I do uh and why do I make
yeah those teachers are lucky to get
that that's probably from other source
to incomes fifty seven thousand dollars
is was that break down to per an hour
college teachers how many people are
college teacher that's not necessarily
true either yeah
72,000 there you go man
nowhere near the the average
annual salary is 72,000 nowhere near a
hundred thousand and that is about 36
dollars an hour and then 10 years a
contract so it depends on what the
contract is and that contract it will
only be paid if the the professor fills
the contract so it's more than teaching
you're working more than the hours of a
teaching you're also writing books you
also have to do research you're working
more for the less money than you should
be paid and it doesn't guarantee the
total contract if we don't fill the
requirements that are met by the
university themselves my one of my
parents when I was growing up was a
college professor and she had a a tenure
and other college professors that you
know what sit there at top there was all
different kinds there that that is like
a huge issue amongst college professors
so if you get a good deal then you're
one of the lucky ones
but outside of that it's not as
glorified as people might think it might
be I didn't think anybody thought
teachers glorifying but and by the way
you your your rate of pay is directly
correlated to the unless you're a
college professor that it differs a
little bit but most teachers are
teaching public schools and that's
directly correlated with how many years
you've taught
look man I'm telling you I don't know
why you think they make 60 that the $60
an hour but you are mistaken
do we have any mods in twitch right now
um alright very uh oh my get the troll
get the net than that yeah okay so what
questions you have what do you need so
we talk to us cope there's nested scopes
yeah
I'm going to try to get more done
tomorrow hopefully I'll get stuck again
I got ya Thank You Joshua
eight to nine hours that you can see my
teachers go home kill it with fire this
is one sink look man see this is the
 that pisses me off this is
a single job at a single-ended
and by the way a CS engineering degree
teachers make more because they have two
that can barely get anybody in here but
you are sending me a single job
I'm talking about pure stats the at you
know what there's probably a teacher out
there making half a million dollars for
some reason you can't say the average
teacher makes half a million dollars no
that makes sense okay
you can't pull up a single job app and
say this is my evidence it is one
evidence and it makes sense you can't
have that mindset man and this is like
you can't say oh well this app says 60
dollars an hour you know what I don't
make $150,000 a year and I know
developers who do so for me to say that
I'm getting paid grossly under way if
you get to pay this amount no man that's
that's not how it goes you take the
average of teacher salary you can't take
an outlier
anyhow man for you to say that teachers
make a lot of money is insane insane in
sick you your riot yeah you know what uh
you know man
I can't if you if you're not if you
don't if you think one job app at sixty
and I'm sure you can find ten like that
the thing is is the other ninety nine
point nine percent or ninety nine
percent are not for sixty dollars an
hour not impossible but you yeah you
know that's not a ten-year like you were
even saying it's like the guys who say
it's it's like the guys on Matt's
channel who and we're getting off topic
on the coding right now uh but it's a
it's like that it's not as easy as
picking the right one because you're
talking about the one percent and the
one percent of jobs out there that are
paying $60 an hour you don't pick the
 job the job picks you you can
apply doesn't mean you're going to get
picked man so what happens when
ninety-nine percent of the jobs paid
thirty dollars an hour less than that
usually start at around twenty what
happens then you take it because you
have to and everyone has hours period so
eventually may you make sixty dollars
out of come on men do uh do they make
more money because they obtain extra IT
certifications in this case you probably
are getting more money because it is an
IT related field it's not because of the
certifications trust me cause college
professors have more certifications than
they can fit on their wall no matter
what degree you're looking yeah I'm done
talking about this we're going back a
code sketch trigger in me with this
nonsense uh oh yeah man just just try to
look more objectively at these things um
you're still trying to argue this point
over here you're talking about one job
app you know where I got my statistics
the US Bureau of Labor Statistics that
is the average of all all in America
come on man
it's like saying like well this one app
says hey you can do it
it's not it's not realistic man I'm not
saying you can't make money as a teacher
I'm saying you're putting your situation
where 9 out of 10 times
you're not making good money as a
teacher I'm triggered by that one person
I'm trying to be with the one the one
percent now I'm working hard all right
guys um enough of that thank you
oh we got drawl infestation all right so
uh what are you we have ten minutes of
review and then we'll take questions
what do we got to review now algorithm
time Oh
remember factorials
Oh No
all right um write a function that adds
two numbers together now forget to
factor let's do part for you right now
write a function that adds two numbers
together
you know what better yet after you
finish this well that's that's a good
one godless monkey what review array
functions next okay so keep keep down so
we want it to descend back
good alright racer
now create an array
you see your phone case well yeah yes
aren't you thrilled about well I'm
trying to remember
no I'm ray excited about it I'm trying
to remember this create a variable so
was it what's the order key word
keyword name
címon operator
mccreaney an array
I don't remember
so how do we create variables
we assign values remember its stores
values and then we have a function very
network should be an array why is it an
array and what why did we use a race
what do they do they have multiple
values you know this so how do we add
things to that array say we wanted to
push on to that array how would we add
things
Xavier Athens for that
yes
Oh God
I really vaguely remember
so call the right push
now we'll add it to the end illiterate
whatever value we put in it and if you
want to take the last value off Oh pop
that's right now how do we check the
length of El Rey it's not like good key
darling you're going to be using rate
functions a lot all right guys that's it
for today we'll take questions for about
5-10 minutes you want to get ready for
going to be so tired we can skip the
questions today I'll do this although if
you want yeah howdy nice all right I'll
see you in about a second good night
Oh teacher I I wish they did man
the good ones anyhow I found a lot of
bad ones and I think you'd have more
good teachers uh if they did get paid
good money because it's unfortunate that
you have somebody like me who would love
to be a teacher if the the pay was good
enough I know a lot of people like me
teachers but when as a developer you can
make twice that if not more sometimes
and you don't have to work your way up
and you're not getting a three percent
raise a year you're getting a making uh
it's hard man but now it is what it is
I've had some good teachers too I can't
remember anyhow and then I've had a lot
of bad ones and the problem the problem
with that is is that the good ones leave
because it's the thing that makes the
most sense and the bad ones stay because
nobody wants them and that would sum up
my experience with teachers and the bad
ones for things like tenure and and
other things they get to say no matter
what almost a matter what
I'll think about becoming a teacher that
the day they bring back capital
punishment don't they still have capital
punishment certain states also the
problem in disguise is that we live in a
very skills oriented world the education
system hasn't changed dramatically since
the introduced introduction of of the
internet and computers really and so
what's happening is public schools are
just behind man when I can learn more in
two weeks on my own than an entire class
that takes three to six months there's a
problem when I have skills for going to
a boot camp for three months that a four
year grad doesn't have there's a problem
now these are these are these are real
situations the reason that coding boot
camps exists today is because colleges
aren't teaching the relevant skills in
their in the in the real world most of
the time anyhow and it's unfortunate
because people are graduating with
almost $40,000 a dead on average just 37
I believe and most aren't even getting
degrees that will actually make that
make money back some money so long that
they'll never actually pay it back in
the government will filth will forfeit
the loan after 15 or 20 years um sucked
up
it is ludicrously up meanwhile
there's a very entry for a lot of people
without a college degree in America just
because um keep the riffraff out like me
I guess I don't know
what happens when they forfeit the loan
so there is a program in place where if
you have student loans you've been
making the minimum payments I'm trying
to find it up right now so
it's either 15 or 20 years so
essentially what happens is if you've
been making the minimum payments if
you've been making the minimum payments
on your student loans for fifteen or
twenty years they the government and you
still haven't paid it back and the
reason so let's say let's say as godless
monkey goes here and says your friend
has a stupid history degree for $50,000
some people have things as high as a
hundred grand but on average on average
as of 2017 if you graduate it's thirty
seven thousand dollars in debt now if
you were paying back a small percentage
but the the minimum payment of your
student loans and you've been making
$40,000 and you have $50,000 in debt
there is a chance that you can be paying
off your student loans for longer than
15 years 15 years because you're me and
because even though you went took out
these loans and you paid the minimum
amount for 15 years they will
forgive you because you're so poor
that's that that is the truth you are
forgiven the remainder of your debt that
you have been paying for 15
years 15 year loan to make no
 money they forgive it at the
kindness of their heart because they
feel so bad for you that's what happens
I don't know if the government pays it
back but usually most student loans are
through a government agency of some sort
and I don't know I don't know the
details it's not bad yeah it's better
than not being for you yeah because you
just basically signed up for indentured
servitude for 15 years look man
if you take out $50,000 which is it
that's only $13,000 more and by the way
by the way there is nothing nothing
showing that that's not just increasing
all the data saint's going up
exponentially but but what happens is
every
caught up in the system and I don't want
to be like oh man if we was caught up in
capitalism but but the thing is is that
cultures have no incentive to change and
so they don't and I what I've noticed
recently is the college is now adding
coding boot camps because they're losing
money because potential CS students are
going going to these boot camps and and
instead of going to see us and spending
40,000 50,000 60,000 they're going to
boot camps in three months getting a
better education for a fourth of the
price and actually be able to be hired
now does everyone succeed in boot camp
no do the people who are going to do
yeah what I mean by that is there's two
groups of people list six that ones that
succeeds that one don't and depends on
individual but same thing could be said
for college there's flames people to go
to college graduate have all this debt
and then have to pay it off for 15
 years
damn ah it's it's a crazy world none
it's a crazy world
um and I I'm I'm glad that I I at least
so I'd known engineer truth my entire
life and
and having them as a friend that's kind
of opened my eyes up a little bit to the
options of the world because no one will
tell you
and no one will tell you that that hey
you need to go chase your dreams or not'
or that hey like let me tell you about
these other options that aren't as
shitty just do the shitty option because
your parents did it before them which
was when your parents went to college
chances always one-third the cost by the
way so it's not since then tripled and
earlier we're talking about how a house
in how the average house in California
if you want the median house you need a
hundred and fifty five thousand dollar a
year salary for basically average that's
a lot man um that's a lot that's an
orange counting by the way which county
but that's crazy right
yeah I don't know man
I don't know
I mean you guys see me man you see me so
someone someone asked me earlier what
how do I stay motivated are you still
here man me you no
with this guy um uh yeah um someone
asked me how I why don't people migrate
away from California uh so let me I'll
answer that and then I'm going to I'm
going to answer your question during on
the tape god watch out now um so because
people are caught up in the hype man I
so I I'm I migrated away from California
because all it is is homeless people
poverty uh because what happens is when
when what do you think happens with
houses are houses are one hundred and
fifty five thousand dollar salary is
what you need for the average house in
Orange County
um well simply it so it's unaffordable
and you get sir getting pushed out your
taxes are higher than they are anywhere
else but so I guess I'm getting
distracted by these guys
um but people are legitimately caught up
in the hype I've lived in California my
entire life um and I can tell you that
there's nothing beneficial to it yeah
there's a lot going on but there's also
two hours of traffic and a 22 mile drive
why would you want that why would you
want the highest taxes with the highest
cost of living and all this sort of
awfulness it's just hot and drying
people think the weather is so great
it's not it's awful man um but I got out
I tried to get out and I Here I am
so thank you Joshua I don't know what's
up with these twitch guys man do they
just like jump into here to yell at
channels is that is that what's up I
don't know man how old am i why did I
sell Jericho that's what you're gonna I
am 29 years old and I am wearing braces
I guess I'm not wearing them I have
braces because my teeth shifted and it
was cheaper to get that than Invisalign
that is to shoot so they'll be off in a
little bit um and when you're this
handsome ladies just don't give a
about the braces uh that's kind of an L
you could say that man uh but I mean I
make up for it in other ways so you
gotta you got to do what you gotta do
though man I having more of in it a
bigger L is having crooked teeth I would
say I'd be the honest guy truth so
motivation um so what keeps me motivated
this is a good question Matt because a
lot of people a lot of people have an
issue with staying motivated and it all
comes down it for at least in my case in
terms of tips and what works for me is I
had a clear goal that I only really
thought about uh I can put this once I
had essentially what I consider my
rock-bottom right and that doesn't mean
like you have to be out there homeless
and things like that everyone's got a
certain point in their life where
they'll reach that I didn't ever think
this was going to be my life moment I
would say and if you ever hit that you
really have one of two choices you
either continue past that or you'll say
never again and so for me it was when my
mother kept
when uh times are really hard for April
and I and my mom would bring us
groceries and I couldn't buy things like
like that I she was bringing us
groceries consistently because we can
afford food and rent and all that and so
what happened was even though she
brought us groceries it wasn't enough
and so yeah the how I ended up here
moment was I couldn't buy underwear I
didn't have the money for it - all my
money on food and gas and I wasn't gonna
have money in time I needed underwear
something simple like that and I was
just there have like having it in my
hand and I it was just kind of epiphany
that this isn't the life that I wanted
to live and I needed to make changes and
and I I know what I wanted and I had to
defy as a plan to go about it and I so I
did and every day I said I said to
myself every day until I accomplished my
goal and mind you I had several goals
but you have to do them in steps right
so I think the hardest part about
motivation is you see the top of the
mountain when really you should be
looking at the base first because you're
never actually going to reach the top
because once you reach that next step
you're going to be one step closer to
another step that you have to accomplish
and that's really how you stay motivated
is you go piece by piece by piece and
the top of the mountain is almost like
perfection we're always chasing it but
you're never achieving it because your
goals are going to continue to grow and
you're going to continue to try and
attempt to to to get there because once
you accomplish the once you feel success
and you accomplish success you're going
to want it again and again and again and
you're going to work hard for it so for
me I had to I had to say what is it that
I wanted to change in my life I didn't
want to be poor anymore that was what I
wanted to change more than anything and
what I did was I I told myself and
and April at the time I said look I'm
going to start applying for jobs I'm
gonna get job better job
the software-related and if I get a role
I'm dropping out of school and I'm going
to work myself up into a developer
position and I had a plan and every day
because I had that as you know had the
how did I end up here moment I thought
back to that moment every single that I
said I said to myself what happens if I
don't work towards that goal today I
could go back one day but I'm stepping
forward every day I'm getting one click
one step closer every day and so I just
kept working and I got that job filling
out apps studying and the whole so I got
one step that was my first step right
the base of the mountain don't focus on
the mountaintop the mountaintop was full
stack developer self-employed developer
that was the that was the mountaintop
and so I focused on the base of the
mountain I said I want to get to the
mountaintop but I can't just you got it
you got a got to walk before you run
right so I I made the gotta crawl before
you walk right you got to be the
girlfriend for 20 years before you
married
that's another role
um so for me I I always think back to
that moment of how incredibly bad I felt
and it keeps you motivated it was a
moment where there was a there's a guy
in here and I'm assuming as a younger
guy who came in ass said hey I really
want to study software but thank you
baby
but but I can't stop playing video games
so much and to me it's just you're young
guy you probably haven't had that aha
moment maybe you're living at home
everything's provided for you but there
really becomes a time in your life where
you will say do I want it bad enough and
I did and I do and I still am chasing
the things that I want so one second
guys outfit I'll finish up the I'll
wrapped all this up right now
but motivation right you find motivation
in yourself
external resources help and there wasn't
that and that's not to say you're always
going to be motivated
I've talked numerous times about this
about those times where I didn't want to
keep going and you know you had to
because we all have those moments of
weakness that's the thing about
motivation motivation can only take you
so far it can remind you of your goals
but unless you actually put in the work
and the effort you're never going to
give it because no one no one's is no
one job but yours to achieve your goals
in your dreams and to be happy that's no
one's job but yours and a lot of people
they have dreams and they have
aspirations and they say one day I want
to do this one day I want to get in
shape one day I want to work for myself
and so if I were to say you say you what
are you doing right now to get there and
you're not doing anything you're not
actively working forward towards it you
it's it's nothing it's not a thought
it's nothing all of this is talk that's
all it is so if I if you asked me and
you said hey Dylan what are you doing to
to work for yourself one day I could
tell you three things that I'm doing
every day to be moving forward and if I
were to ask you what are you doing what
are you doing to become a software
developer what are you doing and if
you're not coding daily you're not doing
you're not paying for tutoring sessions
you're not doing courses you're not
billing projects make I mean you don't
you don't want it enough that's it it's
just what do you what are you doing with
your time are you playing call duty I
don't have anything against you playing
call duty by the way but what are you
doing with your time
and a lot of people think hard is
impossible it's just hard man it's just
hard that's it
not impossible it's hard is a hard
decision to tell my father and my
parents that hey I'm dropping out of
school and I'm working at this software
company to do the technical writing it
was hard coming home every day for eight
months
coding for hours after work 1214 hours
on the weekend is hard man have people
had heart or lives of course they have
people on rougher situations of course
but it was hard for me but I knew what I
wanted I was one step closer every day
one step closer man and the only way
that you can get there if you focus on
the step ahead and not the top of the
mountain some people get overwhelmed was
it was it hard to leave California and
drive across country no listen those
easiest decision I had a while but it
was hard to get the skills to to be
eligible so that when opportunity struck
I put myself in a situation I was ready
to go when I when I knew that I wanted
to go I had been actively pursuing this
dream this goal goal may be goal one
goal to whatever you want to say I've
called three four five and six and when
I hit six I'm at a seven eight nine to
ten but the point is is I put myself in
a situation get there and you can too
you just have to actively actually want
it when they called said hey we got a
job in Florida for a full-stack
developer for good pay great experience
everything you're looking for
can you come do you want to come yeah I
want to come and I ended my lease three
weeks before that when I started
applying I moved back home stayed with
my mom hated living with my mom it was
embarrassing
twenty-eight years old living at home
Barisan not what I wanted um
but I was working hard man it's just a
matter of time and when you're motivated
everyone has different motivations find
what motivates you for me is wanting to
work for myself or want to be
self-employed
it's just a pants man but I would say if
you need to find motivation find out
really find out what it is you want to
do and next time you're sitting down
you're playing games for four hours and
you wonder you wonder why why aren't I
happy because I just play ton of games
man I'm really what I ended up finding
out is that I still play games like
occasion I got GTX ten atti in here and
and whatnot if I wanted to play games on
the PC but what I really found out is
that I wasn't necessarily playing games
for fun or enjoyment anymore it was more
of a is more of a
it was more of an escape is exactly what
it was it was a hey I need to forget
about how shooting my life is and and
what I can tell you is that it's not a
what any way to live a life so find what
motivates you and make and you know I
meant get some self-discipline in my
case I got rid of all my gaming systems
I uninstalled all my games on my PC and
I just I knew what I wanted I didn't get
a TV in my house or anything like that I
have nothing other than a PC and I
grinded it out it took me as long as I
did and Here I am and I'm not I'm much
better off than most but work towards it
every day and find what you want
my paypal link doesn't work sorry man
uh you go to the YouTube channel
youtube.com slash going toriel's 360
I'll be on there somewhere I'll have to
fix that was that baby what do you want
my love huh she wants the D no um it's
getting late guys I'll wrap it up with
this find what motivates you think about
it every day and every day and even if
it's just 30 minutes a day work towards
that goal and you'll see progress man
and I think progress is the strongest
the strongest motivator and it may be
hard at first to see that progress it
may be hard at first because it takes
momentum success and motivation is a
very momentum everything when you're
doing well it's easy to be motivated
when you're not doing well and you're
trying to find that motivation it's
harder so just work towards it daily and
eventually you'll see a little bit of
progress and that will be that will get
you going so just think about it daily
work towards the daily and the
motivation will be there that that was
it for me just I I hit I hit that how
did I get here moment I couldn't buy my
chonies and I was out of here and
sometimes it's hard to see your own
progress but when you make leaps and
bounds eventually you'll see one of them
you know it may you may not see the
steady steps as we go
but you'll get there piece by piece man
whatever it is that motivates you you
want to be a professional gamer do the
professional game around now be smart
about it do all that you want to be a
software developer tons of resources out
there for anything that the Internet has
made this world of great placement take
full advantage of it I appreciate you
