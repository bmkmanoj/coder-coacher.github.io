imagine having a coding channel and
watching coding videos I I get targeted
by adds quite often and one of the ads I
came across on Facebook was very anto 25
which is a short for developers and it
caught my eye I checked it out and I
really liked it so I want to share it
with you I reached out to them for a
sponsorship and if you look over my
shoulder you'll see in the background
some of their handiwork which are three
programming posters that I really liked
quite a bit just suppose there's a
frames for something I added that I got
off of i think got at walmart for like
fifteen dollars something like that but
um they actually have a promo going on
right now normally they're 20 and the
others are 15 this eat sleep coder Pete
was probably by far my favorite I I
really like this one functional
programming is cool and same thing with
the programming languages but I wanted
to share it to you because I'm a real
big believer of immersing yourself
completely into software on kind of
making it part of your lifestyle if
that's what you want to learn you need
to surround yourself with developers you
need to be a developer especially as
you're starting out and you need to code
daily and it's a lot easier when you
surround yourself with things that kind
of remind you of that whether it be
notebooks like they have here or whether
it be stickers on your laptop whether it
be the free wallpapers one of my
subscribers actually asked me where I
got this front-end wallpaper from and
you may have noticed in previous videos
i've had this background for quite a
while now it's just part of the process
for me i really like to immerse myself i
think they're very stylish also be
honest like maybe not everyone will know
what functional programming is but i
think it looks pretty legit and you know
there's a lot of cool things there also
have these playing cards which i think
is pretty pretty geeky but pretty cool
is someone who plays poker and also
codes it's like a comp mix of the best
of both worlds but i really like the
site i hope
check it out it's really interesting
that it's a sort entirely dedicated to
developers and I think that's something
that we should support as a as a
software community because it's really
for us that's what it is like random
they're trying to make money but at the
end of the day they're really sharing
something part of the community with
things that we can appreciate and that's
what I like about it so hope you guys
check out vari anto 25.com and let me
know what you get if you if there's
things you like there's things you don't
like and let me know in the comments
section and I can always reach out to
them be like hey I think you should add
this so I think you should not add you
know maybe see what they have to say but
a lot of these guys their programmers
like us so they've hit it right on the
right of the nail on the head as they
say and that's what I really like about
it so I hope you guys check it out as
always thanks for watching don't forget
to Like subscribe and share and let me
know what you think all right i'll see
you guys the next video thanks for
watching the video special thanks to our
sponsor dev mountain definitely check
them out at dev mountain calm if you're
looking for a boot camp that's in front
end development iOS or UX go ahead and
give them a shot tuition includes
housing so you can get up and go and
fully immerse yourself in the program as
always thanks for watching I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
