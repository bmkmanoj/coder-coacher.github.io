talk about two strategies I use that
ended up helping me get my first junior
level role as a developer when filling
out job out specifically and you're
saying what's the you-know-whats
strategy what do you mean I all you have
to do is fill them out and hope
something happens right uh yes I know
but let me talk about what two things I
did that I thought really helped me out
in my job search the first one was when
I was filling out apps I typically use
LinkedIn or zip recruiter those are my
two favorite locations to do so but on a
zip recruiter what happens sometimes is
it relocates you to various other job
search or job posting sites one was
indeed and I noticed that I lived in Los
Angeles if you didn't know that which
has a you know California in general
bustling tech and software community by
no means not only one but tons of jobs
but also you know 20 plus million people
in California tons of competition right
and what I found was that when I'd fill
out these jobs on indeed it will tell
you how many people have applied for
this specific position and some of them
were 300 applicants now as a junior
level developer with no CS degree still
working on their skill set but confident
enough that they can have a you know a
junior front front-end role it's gonna
be really hard to beat out a lot of
applicants it's not saying that you're a
worse developer I'm just saying on paper
it's gonna be hard you have to beat out
299 other people that's a huge milestone
to overcome and what I was finding was
that once I kind of decided I was okay
moving out of California I mean I
applied to everywhere in the United
States it didn't matter if it was Alaska
or Texas or Florida where I ended up I'm
very happy about it by the way but uh I
was open to it right and I found that
when I was applying to some of these
ones on indeed now that I was going up
against five ten applicants tops maybe
twenty but you know ten applicants I
feel like I could be I felt like you I I
felt like my portfolio on these ones
that are ten
are much more likely for me to succeed
than it was for 300 and all I had to do
was start opening up my job search to
less populated areas and states that
have less developers right and that was
one of my keys to success I think is
that I was willing to go to a different
state where and also one thing that no
at least in my experience was that for
these junior level like real junior
level roles I was getting offered
$15,000 less in the interviews in
California which has a higher cost of
living than what I currently make as a
developer in Florida which has a lower
cost of living and no state tax and if
that was one thing I picked up as well
and part of the reason I think that they
were able to kind of offer these low
rolls was one they knew that you wanted
it right they knew that they had 290
other people applying for the job and I
had I straight up had a recruiter when I
started when I counted offered on one of
them for about 10 grand more he said nah
I'm just gonna go to the next guy
straight adjust to that I'm just gonna
you know the next guy and I was like
kind of conferring the bully um so that
that's one strategy is if you can and
you're willing to not everyone's willing
to relocate there their whole life right
I I happen to be one of the people who
was okay with that and so I did and it
worked out very well for me and I found
that after the two initial weeks of me
filling out apps it took me about five
to six in total that from those two
weeks when I noticed this via indeed I
start getting a lot more callbacks and
one of the things I did was on my resume
I put willing to relocate to four great
opportunities or four exceptional
opportunities something like that
letting them know that I was aware yes
I'm in LA but I'm aware that you know
this role is in Tampa Florida and I'm
okay moving to further the job and so
this one one of the things I did to help
make me stand out because it's easier
stand out amongst ten applicants and
it's 300 that's really what I came down
to and I am getting a nicer offer
because of that now the other thing that
I did was I only applied on the on
LinkedIn and zip recruiter via the 24
hour period so I would use the filters
every single day I'd be filled
job apps every single day you know 50
job apps hundred llaves however many
came that were relevant to the search
but I would do it based on the 24-hour
period so if a job app came out in the
last 24 hours I filled it out I never
went back five days back six days back
just every single day whatever app came
out in the last 24 hours I feel out now
why are you doing that well for one you
want one you want your resume be the
first one that they see right because
they want you to be the guy right the
recruiter is looking for somebody and if
your resume somewhat meets it and they
talk with you they devote some time
there you know you could be the guy that
the hire now it goes back to the 300
thing right also it's if you are
applying for the 300 do you really think
they're looking through three hundred
resumes chances are not they're looking
for the first guy that seems semi
qualified for the role and they're gonna
dive in and it's up to you to show that
as a junior developer a lot of times
that you're eager and one way you can do
that is to fill out apps immediately
when they come out which is why I did it
in 24 our fears and these two things I
really think was one of the reasons I
was able to you know in five weeks go
from not a developer to a developer
granted you have to have the skill set
but when you're looking for work
sometimes that's just as hard as gaining
the skills to get your foot in the door
right and applying out of state with
less competition or do me more money in
my case and also okay I think gave me a
higher callback size I noticed that when
I did start applying a say I got more
callbacks than I was getting for the two
previous weeks applying in LA cuz you
know I'm dealing with so many more
people and also when I filled it out
that day as well I noticed that I was
getting more callbacks because you're
hitting the recruiters immediately right
they put it up that day they see an app
that day they're gonna check it they're
gonna be on top of it because they don't
have anybody that they're interested in
yet because it just went up and you're
showing that you're eager you're hungry
and these are all things that you really
need to communicate and sometimes you're
going through recruiters but sometimes
you're going through you're you know
you're the senior developer who put up
the ad so those are two tips that I use
when I was looking for a web developer
Jobs I hope they help you out I do think
they helped me out
