we are back in code fight suing are
similar in the intro section exploring
the waters so what we're trying to
attempt here or what we will do here
other is we are seeing hey are these two
array is similar can we swap two values
out and get a swap of value in each
rather would we be able to swap a value
from one in the other and their that
they would pass only one time right so
let's go ahead and get started the first
thing I did was I found myself coming to
a situation in which you would always
try and swap something when they were
identical or my logic down below rather
that's incorrect did not work so the
first thing I did was hey if we already
start off with something that is equal
and because there are arrays we need to
compare it like so we're just going to
convert them to strings and if they're
already the same go ahead and return
true no need to have to run through our
for loop we're about to do when we run
it here our first steps will pass the
one so this this example here will pass
and return true now can we swap a value
in one with the other and it still be
true that's the next thing we have to do
and in our example here we can but how
do we go about that well the way that I
did it was I created two arrays and I
when the values weren't equal I push the
value into both arrays and then I
reversed it I said hey is the length of
our array two or less and are the
strings equal if they are then our test
case passes and we can go ahead and
return true if they aren't return false
so how'd it go ahead and talk about that
so I just called this VAR c such as a b
a and b we create this to an empty array
then we have VAR d and we also set this
to an empty array we're going to end up
reversing one later on the idea being
that if they reverse and they're ident
then we can swap them and everything
will work so we'll do our for loop now
based off to that logic where we're
going to iterate through a let's say
well I is less than a dot length I plus
plus and then we'll say if now if they
aren't the same that's when we want to
push to the array so if a of I and
because the arrays are the same length
we can just use the same I here if a lie
is not equal to B of I go ahead and push
in C a vise value and in D we're going
to keep track of that with B of I with
the the B index rather say fi and then
deed push beautiful all right so now we
have our C's and our B's what we need to
do is we need to reverse because if
they're identical we're trying to see if
we can swap them and if we can swap them
they're going to be we need to reverse
it and they should be equal to each
other so we're going to reverse the
really matter if your C or D we're just
going to reverse D here so we're say D
is equal to D dot reverse and our last
statement here is just an if statement
is to say is the length of one of our
arrays it could be again C or D as you
see and is it equal to two and are the
arrays now that we reverse C and D
identical when we only convert it to a
string
is this a true statement now if this is
true it means that we were there
identical meaning that we can swap and
we only swap two times which is
essentially 1 in 1 so if that is the
case and remember it's 2 because you do
the first swap where you're you're not
technically swapping you're inserting of
value say these don't match up ok cool
let's store those values then they say
ok these don't match up either now
all right cool and then we say hey do if
we swap these things what our values be
different and if that's the case return
true and if it's not we are going to
return false because we've tried we've
put logic in for all the true statements
and now it fails like so and then
hopefully I'll have the syntax here
submit and we are good to go this was
one of the harder ones this one was
something where I kept on trying to find
figure out how to actually remove the
values and how to swap them within the
erase and that was when it started
messing things up and this was a much
easier way of going about it
but that's always guys I look forward to
you sharing your solutions for this some
of the solutions on here very intricate
and much better than my own but this is
what I was able to come up with and yeah
here we are so thank you for watching
