ageism in technology and software
companies is it a thing one of my
thoughts about it how should you handle
it if you're an older individual how
should you handle it if you're a younger
individual is just worried about it and
you just want to be part of a healthy
environment those are the types of
things that we're going to talk about
today you guys before we get this video
started just want to do a quick shout
out to myself if you're interested in my
JavaScript 360 part 1 course it's about
seven and a half hours of content has
almost 5 stars and I'm actually still
adding to it so if you ever see
something like Amen I wish you went more
in-depth than this or hey I notice that
you skip this would you mind putting in
here I'm actually I've just added two
new videos to it as well giving a brief
introduction more to JavaScript from a
less technical standpoint and what it is
so if you're interested in that there's
a link in the description where you get
it for a real cheap so I said a little
bit of reading lately about ageism and
in tech and I don't know that I
necessarily agree with it being a
rampant problem but it is a issue in the
sense that ageism sexism racism it will
always exist you'd agree but how much of
an issue is it right as I say that we
shouldn't try and combat these things
right we shouldn't try and and make make
the perfect world we're never gonna have
the perfect world but we should try and
make the world better every single day
and one of the things I found really
interesting now I'll post the indeed
article that I read about it and this is
this is one of those things where you
hear about ageism and in tech and I want
to I almost want to say that the that
the tech companies have actually tackled
the the racism they're the you know the
inclusive issue in the past with with
women and with minorities and they they
essentially are actively going about
fixing that and there's this thing about
ageism where it's almost like you don't
really care uh and I don't want to say
that to be like dismissive but in terms
of when you compare it to those other
two categories it's like yeah
just hold up dude like yeah no one's
hiring the senior developer at 20 years
yeah right bro but in reality there is a
little bit of that going on where as you
get older and you want to work at one of
these top companies in Silicon Valley
right there you know maybe Seattle or
something like that
that you'll notice that you know at just
age 40 still pretty healthy dude a young
guy that you're striking might start
feeling some of this is ageism why is
that well I don't know that's the truth
of the matter I have my theories on what
parts of that argument is true and what
parts isn't so let's let's start there
for one I think and it's in this article
and I think it's probably pretty true is
that when you're younger you want to be
where it's you know quote unquote
happenin right the Silicon Valley right
and that's why part of it is you're
willing to change change your lifestyle
to say hey I'll go and live in the super
high rent compact city maybe you don't
have kids yet or you're just starting a
family it's okay I want that because I
gotta be I want to be a Facebook man I
want to be where it's it's going down
and I'm gonna be part of all the meetups
and just the environment and the your
your desire for environment changes
right so statistically speaking the the
baby boomers and the people are just
older tech individuals they actually um
as they put it in this article very cast
a wider net meaning that they're not
looking to apply to San Fran they're
looking to apply to like Salt Lake City
Utah that's where you can get a nice
house beautiful weather it's sort of you
know there's Adobe in the area and I
just give that as one of many examples
but the point being that there are ton
of companies that are looking for
software developers and it's an older
individual you're more worried about
maybe my house you're more worried about
raising a family not necessarily just
having a family raising a family and
settling down right it's gonna be pretty
hard even with a a six-figure senior def
salary to to settle down in SF just
because of the crazy home prices and
everything else so there's a little bit
of that going on as well as
in today's market especially in the
webdev world
this shit's changing daily and
oftentimes when you are and not every
every super senior developer older
developer is guilty of this but
oftentimes when you have ten years of
experience in JavaScript for instance
and the various frameworks and you know
for all we know the web changes tomorrow
and now everything C sharp and dotnet
right oftentimes you have to go and
learn some skills and you might say no
that's a that's a fair statement you're
like I have 10 years experience I don't
like like like if you are a front-end
developer 20 years experience you know I
mean react experience you may just say
look I learn react on the job I got kids
I got family I got time to deal with
this obviously my 20 years experience
will say show that I can learn react not
always the case maybe they want you to
know beforehand and get up and running
and so the point I'm really sort of
trying to get is that if you do have
experience you're super senior dev I
still think it's important that you go
and get those skills and you know have
build projects and do all the same stuff
that people who are maybe a little bit
more hungry because they're less
experienced and they haven't been beaten
down quite as much just kidding but
they're there trying to make a name for
themself they haven't got that super
senior dev spot yet are trying to do
have that try and get that spotlight
right trying to get get that attention
so I said I think that might be one of
it one part of it I also think that and
this is just my personal experience on
this is that you know case study of one
but for what I've seen with the you know
the three software companies I've worked
at is that I haven't seen personally
ageism in the three again a variety of
aspects but in when it - when it I
wonder when we're talking about ageism
and tech and software are we
specifically talking about developers
are we talking about the industry as a
whole so this is something that I I have
found very interesting
to be a developer to be a successful
developer a long-term is a very big time
and lifestyle commitment right you are
going to if you really want to push
yourself and you really want to to be
the best of the best it takes more than
a 40-hour workweek it takes 60 hours 680
hours so you're doing you're going to
meet ups you're giving speeches you're
building courses you're writing books
you're you're doing presentations you
are interviewing once a year you know
there's a lot of stuff going on it takes
a lot which isn't necessarily conducive
to being the best family person isn't
necessarily conducive to being the best
man the best husband but it is conducive
at times to be in the best developer and
so I feel like as you get older your
your priorities may change and you may
become less desirable because you
haven't gone down that route and what
ends up happening again this is just a
case study of one is that most of my
project managers most of my business
analysts they're older most of my
quality assurance they're older and and
they typically transfer out of
development sometimes they have
developer experience so they put three
four or five years into it realize this
wasn't for them they didn't want to
maintain what it takes to maintain to be
an exceptional developer and no one just
wants to be good at anything or all
right at least I don't think so and it's
very hard to be a developer long-term
and just be mediocre yeah it's not
something that you're gonna feel good
about yourself imposter syndrome kick in
at any moment but any transfer over to
something that's a little less
time-consuming not to disrespect
business analysts or project managers
I'm sure most PM's and bas work very
hard but it's a little bit different
right you know every p.m. and BA I've
ever had goes home to their family they
they watch the Netflix they have dinner
they don't go home and learn the latest
framework build a new p.m. project build
a new PA be a project go to conferences
there are some that do it without a
doubt but not not everybody and I would
say when you compare developers to those
two to that other side of the world the
QA the PM the BA developers are probably
you know five times this often and so I
think perhaps some of the oh that's
that's where my question comes in is
when we're talking about ageism and tech
are we talking about the entire industry
are we talking about very specifically
the developer role I don't know and
there's also a lot of a lot of roles
that older generations just aren't
interested in they give a great example
here of ten tech jobs that Millennials
specifically are more likely to click on
on indeed specifically indeed is a the
world's second largest or our first
largest job site after LinkedIn I
believe and so there's a lot of and this
goes back to the skills that are in
demand now I'll list it off so bait a a
millennial is three times more likely to
to click on something for UX researcher
so what we can tell by that is that in
terms of skill set that's a relatively
new thing right user experience is a a
very new category of job that okay is
that ageism or is it that the skill set
wasn't there for you know the a little
bit of an older generation and you can
go on here where ten tech jobs
Millennials and these other ones are
very relevant skills so four times more
likely Java developer full-stack
developer Python developer iOS developer
data scientists some Java developers
been around for a while full stack
developer still same thing Python has
exploded recently iOS developer mobile
apps are relatively in the in the
schemes of software development when
we're talking about someone who's been
in the industry for 20 30 years is a new
item as one the same thing with data
Sciences so these are new roles where is
it is it discrimination or is it that
these are new roles that your skills
that don't align anymore with what the
job market demands could a developer 20
years experience in C++ go and be a
Python developer probably are they going
to necessarily give you that role or are
you going to continue to look for C++
roles or
see rolls or whatever whatever you're
you're mean at this point you probably
have three four languages under your
belt I would imagine but whatever your
main language is and then it continues
on where five times more likely that a
millennial is going into front-end
development Android development game
testing or web development five times
more likely so now we have a three or
four and a five times as likely to apply
to jobs and review the jobs that they're
interested in so it goes back to my
thing is I'm not educated enough to say
that ageism doesn't exist or anything
like that about the issue
I just want to race the question asked
you to what degree right so I agree that
all these things exist in one form in
another right we all have our
stereotypes and our biases and we're all
human and that that transcends to the
workplace to human resources and
everything but it makes me wonder a
little bit when you have jobs that have
come in the last 10 15 20 years and
you're talking about older jet and the
old older generation with skills that
are you know experience is valuable it
really is but if you don't have
experience in the things that are
relevant and you're not up-to-date on
the technologies how much you know that
experience can only go so far
so that would be that would be my sort
of thing that think about what ageism
attack just as good absolutely is it as
big of an issue that I think people make
it out to be in my personal experience
that the three companies I have worked
with I have a range of Ages so I I
haven't personally experienced it I do
think that you know it kinda depends on
the skill set I also think it depends on
where you're trying to live what you're
trying to do right go Silicon Valley if
you have like five kids you're gonna be
like half a million dollar salary to
live in Santa San Francisco and you know
buy a house and just craziness but if
it's just you and you know a recent
fiancee and you know a little bait baby
Dolan running
you know maybe you can get a one-bedroom
apartment and just grind it out for a
bid and just jump into the the scene and
the culture and a lot of people are
different stages in their life so that's
kind of my two cents on it I don't I I
don't know what that what it is I'll
link to this article I thought it's very
enlightening obviously we're not gonna
solve ageism by one video I think one
thing that we can kind of talk about is
just have open conversations about these
things sometimes people when it comes to
controversial subjects want to pretend
like these things don't exist it always
exists but to what degree and sort of
just educate yourself and if you find
yourself having some sort of bias
leaning one way or another to go that
now ageism outside of the US may be a
very real thing because one of my I
forget what country it was but one of my
um one of my subscribers told me that in
their country it is a standard put your
age on your resume now to me that just
sounds like bam straight out the gate
why might there on my age on my resume
it's a little scary that seems a little
strange right but uh that's the way it
works there and maybe they're a little
bit more okay with that blatant ageism
in either way right there's plenty of
ageism you know we've we pretty much
have only talked about ageism for people
who are older but there's a lot of
positive it goes about being an older
individual one you're considered to be
more mature especially if you're new the
industry and you're a little bit older
you're like this guy wants it right he's
been grindin he's just getting a start
he's probably got a family and kids so
they think you're gonna yeah you know
they were fairly confident and I got
shelf to work half drunk the next day
like maybe you know a 20 year old or 21
year old and then there's a little bit
of ageism on the on the on the other
side of the spectrum where you're so
young do you have the maturity to hold
the job down are you are you gonna
actually care about this role are you're
gonna value it are you gonna understand
what it means to be part of a team when
you've never been part of a team before
so it can go in either way but typically
in tech we're always talking about
ageism on the on the higher end of the
spectrum but that's my thoughts guys
don't forget to comment like subscribe
share support me on patreon all that
good stuff I'll see you next time bye
hey baby do you think I'm too old to be
a developer I'm like a fine wine baby I
guess I get better with age quick link
