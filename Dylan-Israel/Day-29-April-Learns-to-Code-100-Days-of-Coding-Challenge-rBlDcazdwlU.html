bro Florida yeah okay so hey buddy um
yeah this cat's also rented also that'll
be a shirt is that cat even yours movie
everyone's inside joke I should I should
make a shirt that says do you even scam
bro and that put the quote - ty Lopez ha
ha so that's what I should do man
and then scan it on all his like his
stuff so people can buy it
good cuz they would they would buy them
and we think that it's his alright
um so yesterday what we decided that
we're going to do is I'm going to start
going over the documentation and um of
JavaScript so that while you're solving
these JavaScript problems did you make
it through the whole video by the way in
two days it's our 40-minute video were
you working on other things
okay all right
now James that's coming on pretty
literally trying to wash it and like
follow not just like have it play and be
like oh yeah I watch it um okay so where
were we uh number methods so um
last time we dungeon dynein put the chat
down no don't do that be anxious if
you're anxious you don't know what
people are saying yeah they're saying a
damn Dylan I didn't know you feel so
passionate about ty Lopez um alright so
javascript is easy to learn
hey Seth I lot of people uh any of those
people so what do we got worried about
our Tony so we'll go for about forty
minutes or so um well good for those
people that they think it's easy
I hope one day I'll be like Oh
JavaScript it's easy here we are to
stream with it do you remember what that
does I remember you're the thought
string no I was not slice so to string
what that does is it returns a number in
string format oh okay okay to
exponential we'll take a number you can
call dot two exponential and I will
return that in its exponential form to
the amount of places that you want as a
parameter
yeah I just watch this on the video
actually alright to fixed we'll return
it back to a certain variable number so
in this case you see returns ten returns
9.6 this is our variable calling it on
our number so it takes in a parameter
and then where it returns it back to a
fixed normal position decimal yes yeah
you showed that about with like money in
a balance
I'm not quite sure what the difference I
think he talks about it okay so the
difference between this is one of those
things is stupid in JavaScript
so there's a few things I'd like
duplicate functions what one hour and 40
minute JavaScript video did you assign
April to read I'm interested in watching
it it was the Derek bonus Laren
javascript in one video video hi i'm
potato chips so what uh well Kevin she's
just socially aware that these exist so
she gonna solve the algorithms that
actually makes sense I take this
call it this message then comes out
yeah I get that it's coming on so the
value of method returns a number as a
number as long does there's some
functions that I have never used your
methods but value oven like tax
precision are those yeah so there's
number when wouldn't it be to the
advantage to like ease every method or I
mean it just depends on the situation
that's all I wonder what I found
that would be really interesting who
makes JavaScript the people who make
xmas script there's like an organization
I know you want to go talk down asshole
what the you're doing all the time
yeah let's do that on this channel we
should go and interview them all right
so um parse int parse int um takes in a
string number a string and returns it as
a number yeah you talked about this too
that something like I know he went over
he goes over it real class like you do
so I have to like pause it go back
listen again so sometimes you get a
string but you need to convert it into
an integer to do your equations or
something okay so it's kind of like dot
slice for our strings don't into rings
alone
it turns strings into numbers yes
oh so like know the saying that both can
like change them well split is takes and
it takes a string and turns it into an
array yeah and this takes a number and
turns it into a string or its Australian
turns it into a number okay
but when we when we parse an INT it'll
only will take the first int and it will
drop off the other things infuse parts
if you're using if it's a float it's
going to drop it off jerry-san
Parsloe will return at all if you're
trying to get a floating-point number so
typically it's better to always use
parsefloat it doesn't really matter
though at the end of the day so there's
also some number values like if you want
to get the maximum value possible in
JavaScript because there are limits you
can do so by calling number max value
this is the max value in JavaScript like
60 numbers or something it's more than
that because you see this is e to the
308 to power you have a min value you
also have negative infinity and there's
not a number value favored see this
chances are you probably had some bad
logic in your code where you're trying
to convert something that isn't a actual
number so nan nuts this stands for not a
number
let's go over the math library I think
this is important so there's the math
library built into JavaScript so if you
want to get pie you can just call Matt
thought pie yeah I despise already
programmed into JavaScript yep
there's also math dot around it
are you upset with me or something
I don't know
so there's mac dot round you'll see
we're taking in the parameter four point
four and so it's going to round it up or
it's gonna round it down based what's in
there in this case our ends up down to
four okay if it worked like six it would
round it up there's math lot powers as
well what that is is yeah just like that
that actually takes a number and sends
it to the power so the first number you
pass in is the the value and then the
second number is the power that you want
to put that to so and it's eight times
eight to the second power is 64 eight to
the third power is probably was 60 times
8 is 32 plus
sure figure it out it's like five
unified twelve ah
but where you are a sec yeah I should've
got that mad math dude numbers I kinda
said is like so easy and for him to be
like uh I mean it just goes to show you
how a real sick Mia's oh are you still
working and II shouldn't be should be
sleeping at Mustaine so that you can go
full speed ahead you know for the record
most women are upset that their men
don't work enough that's what most women
really well I am NOT most women and I
think we've declared the fact that I've
stayed with your ass for six plus years
after all that we've been
through obviously so don't stay here and
tell me that work is more important
because you know it's more important
than work done your health because you
can't do work without your house
so don't stay here and try to argue with
me about it
why always heal anymore sure Melissa
you're upsetting the cats and the
viewers so
there's math dot square root you get the
square root of thing so 64 square root
of 64 is 8 mm-hmm so it's not like a
modulus it's the actual like you guys
use a math library to call that okay is
there like just oh so this is the math
library yes okay
absolute so if you want to get the
absolute or something it's math dot
absolute Erick ABS excuse me
so unban hewan in the chat one needs an
insta ban can we get a certificate for a
while a little parade alright um so
Matt thought seal rounds whatever the
number is up to the nearest integer
regardless of its for 4.0.1 it's going
to go up to five okay so that's sealing
it goes to the ceiling oh yeah yeah
all right Matt top floor does the
opposite it takes it down to the lowest
value math dot sine is the trigonometry
sign is it a sign yeah looks like sin
sign so what's sine and cosine uh oh I
know those yeah I have to do those
 things
trigonometry trigonometry so there's
also math thought men and math thought
max so if you have a bunch of numbers
like this will return the min value have
a bunch of numbers like this it'll
return the max value
okay
Matt thought random we've talked about a
couple times where you want to generate
a random number math dot random
generates a random number between 0 &amp;amp; 1
so depending on how you want to how you
want to what your number wants to be if
you want it to be between 0 and 10 you
+1 1 and 10 is sound between 1 and 10 so
never go below there actually 111 should
be ah but no here dot this matha floor
do you math up floor it will generate a
random number to a whole integer yeah
yeah pictures right so it's it's not
it's it's because good tonight I would
say you're multiplying after 10 plus 1
means that you're starting at 1 and not
zero because it was sake is because the
extra numbers past 10 and we had a
column at the floor choose for second
but yes so this is this would be an
example of how you generate a random
number between 1 and 10 so math math dot
round will give you a random number it's
up to you to use the other math
libraries and a little bit of algebra to
be able to generate what you need to but
this is a common thing that you would do
for something up
well there's other properties here
probably never touch on but there's a
lot more going on here it's all
basically anything that's on ain't
graphing calculus Gregg yeah graphing
calculators on there that's pretty cool
man oh we've been so cool to do like
trigonometry homework with coding yeah
all right so I don't think that we
talked about everything in here this is
basically exactly what I said
the map thought floor mat thought random
this is a good example to see how if you
wanted to generate a number between the
min and the max you can do that as well
by multiplying times the max minus the
min and then having the min value same
same thing we did for remember how we
wanted to start at 1 that would be our
min value in that case and then if you
think about what we want our max to be
we want to save max minus min and so
what that's going to do is it's going to
set a range then we multiply that the
start of the range that's all all right
so um
let's talk about dates I wasn't
originally going over this but they'll
probably run into dates sooner or later
so if you track if you call date
function like this it's going to get you
your time zone in your local date so
we're in Eastern Daylight Time
this GMT general mount timeline is 400
and it is approximately miss mountains
let me take a camping yeah log cabin I
promise your trip once you got a job
yeah
neither of us have any time off right
now so see that happening we're not
going to fly to Idaho
Colorado Friday camp for two days and
fly it back or are we yes Lee
um what's typescript typescript is a way
of writing JavaScript that is in
typescript so the way that works is you
it's a it's a new way of writing
JavaScript so typescript is a cleaner
and more conventional way of writing
javascript in an object-oriented
approach and so with that how it works
is you write it in a different format
and then it compiles it into JavaScript
so you're writing in typescript and then
gets compiled into a JavaScript file to
run for your web browser my dis time
skirt look like ah it looks like a
combination of JavaScript new JavaScript
syntax so instead of what do you mean
Inc it's compiled because what are you
doing now so typically when we run our
JavaScript it just runs like it's
reading a page yes now when you're
building a large application with
typescript what happens is you will then
it will actually run your typescript and
then it will build that page and then
we'll run that page so web development
gets a lot more complex that's pretty
interesting because doesn't that
actually take more
so well it doesn't do it on the website
okay so you use typescript to write out
JavaScript that won't load and tell them
what
so the website the website this is so
let me explain yourself so what happens
is locally when you're developing you'll
you'll basically compile a build and
what that means is depending on what
what things are using there's things
like gulp and Bower and things like that
where you have setup dependencies and
typescript is kind of like that in the
sense that it needs to compile into
something that a browser can read first
and so you write it in a certain way in
typescript and then locally you compile
it into JavaScript meaning it takes
what's there it's like it takes English
and it converts it to Spanish Matt
that's essentially what it's doing and
then when we go and we launched our
archetype when we go and we launch our
website or web diplomat it doesn't
compile it there it just goes and reads
the JavaScript file that we already
compiled and we just put up there it
seems like it would cost the application
more time to load or no no no it's the
same it's loading the same as if you
wrote in Joshua it's not reading the
typescript files reading the JavaScript
file and the the load items and these
zip types great to solve so javascript
is really flexible in the sense that
it's just new it's new syntax and new
stuff in it it's more conventional than
other it makes JavaScript more of a
conventional language then then if
tradition is
sorry I saw nothing you need to worry
about right now you don't get it no I
don't get it
it's all right um you know yeah I'm
gonna skip this we're going to Ray
methods actually let's jump into arrays
first um if you ever find yourself
needing to work with dates just go read
up on the date states format to date
date methods okay so we know how to
create an array let's see if this little
this will mod you Kevin see if it this
will allow you to are you now mod I
don't know I didn't restore him out if
that will work
you might be able to post if you are
anyhow so we know how to create an erase
or anything in here okay so um arrays
have the dot length property they
already know returns the lane there's
also the sort method what the sort
method does is if it's a number in order
to sort the array now let's see if we
can get a good example so pushing adds
to the array remember that to the H pop
push at the end of the right paw for
Moosey into the array
um okay so do you remember what indexof
does we just talked about that all right
yeah so that index of actually was let's
wait till there's better example so we
go into the methods thanks fun I'm
hoping for it does many disciples nice
you killing alright so here we have a
dot join what this does is it takes the
values that are in the array and then
joins it together in a string format so
our result you see our result is it's
tiny yet what's is not time to change it
that's just how we're deciding to joins
together a space and a stroke than a
space okay insert the comma yeah we
could put a happy face or something in
there for all we care
or just a space but if you put nothing
it will come out as they come okay so
pop removes the last element in this
case would remove mango mango
push ads loss element so shift adding QE
shift will actually remove it's
essentially popped for the front oh yeah
we talking about that
um yes so and then unshipped adds to the
front you do a function for your coding
good shirt if God you know do a for loop
or something
if knows JavaScript how do I would read
anyways I'm not supposed to know about
the coding got Sharia baby
Oh Han just posted it yeah all right so
we talked about unshipped
all your life knows there's ways to add
to the arraign there's ways to delete
from the array yeah and when the time
comes you need to do something light you
need to come back here review that
elements now if you need to delete an
element but you still want to leave the
index space open you can use delete and
then target that so in this case the
first element banana would be undefined
set there one index would be orange
apple make note center so splice allows
us actually pull values out or put
values in so the way that this is
happening it's going to bring this up so
we can visualize this is when we splice
we're going to actually insert limited
Kiwi where where Apple was what if you
wanted spaces in there
you mean in
in Cuba yeah well in this case we're
actually changing your a forget about
how it looks well agree uh every example
I seen it there's no spacing so I was
just wondering it but by default this is
how it prints out unless you change it
so remember how we joint use the join
function not too long ago remember with
the time signs if you want to change how
it comes out we can do it like so we're
joining each index together in a certain
fashion so you can also splice elements
out
it's just what you're doing is you
target and then if you want to splice an
element out and not replace it you say
what index it is and then how many
values you want to splice out if this
was two it would not only splice out
banan it would also splice out orange
and then fruits would only be apple and
bingo Oh
gingka can't native strings so you can
add two arrays together as well with
concat just like you can add two strings
together so we have this array cecile
and Loan and Emile Tobias and Linus what
happens is when we see this is our new
right here where it's creating this
third array and it's the combination of
these two
so you can add tuition - this isn't two
strings this is two array
yeah but same thing is with this stream
function Cat Cat
and you can do this for more than one
array out of time you just pass in a
different a comma in the second
parameter at the grammar or fourth
grammar
there's also the slice not to be
confused with splice what that does is
it actually slices out the value yeah
okay I was gonna say it's like a slice
and slice come on I'll have a splice
slice and dice this is there a dice
sir dot dice no dice
what it does is it it will actually
create a new array from the index that
you're slicing out so we're slicing from
index one on so this is
so if you ever need to cut out a value
without affecting the original array
can't was with slice
now if you don't put a second parameter
in there it will do the whole array if
you only want part of the array you say
hey you want orange and they want lemon
so you pass in two separate parameters
slice without all the arguments I
believe take copies the entire ring
let's find out let so we're in it yeah
so you want to copy all da-rae you can
do that as well without putting in any
arguments
so okay look I got a man
all right uh bullying's blends you know
there's a guy who works in the IT office
at my work his name's Leon didn't know
his nickname is bland because no one can
say is real name so they call him plan I
was like oh my god that's so funny
you guys named him after a value and I
like what I was like boolean true or
false right and I was like oh all right
I didn't think it they don't even know a
boolean mean so I'm gonna when he comes
in boolean you're saying it
where is Joe William when he comes in
tomorrow me like a true or false forget
any great so there's the boolean
function which you can basically write a
statement in it and or return true or
false so you say bouillon bouillon
bouillon
look I'm telling you what the functions
called okay I'm Kerry say and then
returns of value if it's journals so in
this case it's true tennis for the night
you have to use their comparison
operators equal to greater than less
than all that sort of stuff
now it's also used to detect true values
or false values now everything that has
a quote real value is true numbers are
true floats are true negative numbers
are true strings are true just like a
statement or like a vibe that you can
give something that makes it true or
false right yes
now there are things that return false
as well Ciara returns false negative
zero returns false well one is true zero
is false
so like yeah
undefined returns false as well if you
were to check it
Noah returns false basically everything
it doesn't real fault value false
returns false not a number of returns
false so if you try to divide a ten by H
that returns false
oh why don't we stop there I say this
guy's question and then we continue on
tomorrow with one more will do one more
day of going over in JavaScript
libraries and then I don't know what
we'll do now to get it too much thought
I'm hoping that you are ready to jump
into the algorithms again okay so I goon
Amir Ali says hey guys you do you have
advice to begin with the beta on free
code camp for the previous well this is
my advice man my advice is to do them
both there's so much more content on the
beta than there is on the on the the
production version and I think I think
it benefits you even if you you know
people are real well I have to do it
twice in general that mindset you should
enjoy the fact that the second time you
go through it you know you should
enjoy it joy the fact that the second
time you're doing it you can you can
pace your skill to see how well you're
doing so I would say do the beta first
and if it doesn't carry over which it
probably won't just go ahead and redo it
on production and continue on from there
because if it took you five hours to do
one section you'll probably do it in two
if you've been working at it and it'll
definitely remind you of some things
that may have slipped through the cracks
as well excellent answer Cody God please
tell us more I could but it's gonna be
$19.99 per minute you heard it folks
straight from the mouths of coding God
Himself that'd be a good skin I could be
like a white Miss Cleo sort of live
where you call in with all your coding
problems but they a did you check the
syntax yeah yeah and probably have to
practice on the accent of it but
yeah so people are definitely getting
the frontend cert done it's really good
I'm taking credit for some of that let
it be known ah I'm glad that people are
working hard man I front it to get the
front answer that ain't easy
um alright guys as always if you haven't
already joined the Facebook group what
are you doing man if you're not already
I encourage you to to take part man in
the coding revolution as we say that is
known as code tech and caffeine on
Facebook I'm just a t-shirt for you the
code knee revolution it just I was like
a terminator in bed in the background
no that's cheesy like cut it out um I
think we had over 2,400 today we're
pretty close let's see
I don't know what I want to do with this
coding group
you're waiting to tell you're worthy
you're worthy Kevin you're what you're
welcome to join men can enjoy housing
joined I don't know I mean one more for
4k get in there Kevin Kevin you'd be
there you'd be 2 point 4 K if you
enjoyed right now just saying if you had
met the month monumental occasion you
feeling like that not one just um you
know van was my 500 subscriber your I my
500 subscriber was van really yeah I
distinctly remember and and I was like
talking to them and I said hey man I'm
at like 499 subs I'm growing and
spelling along really excited and then
he's like he's like hey I you
over the 500 right now
that was my 500 subscriber oh my god I
love it I do somebody here you go Kevin
I guess figure out why restream doesn't
put my my auto settings in there but
alright guys
Milo says goodnight I say good night
April says good night don't forget if
you want to support me you want support
the channel you can at patreon.com slash
coding tutorials 360 this was day 28 I'm
sorry if it seems like I'm losing a
little bit of steam I am I'm not feeling
too well
I'm a little bit stressed all that stuff
you know we're moving in a week
am I getting on later for algorithms I
did algorithms in the beginning of this
James is actually almost 9 p.m. here for
me man so yeah you start getting ready
for bed at 8:30 I was doing some work
before we got on so slowly first
especially because he's sick
yeah so if you catch me in a late night
coding god radio stream which I had a
lot of fun this last week and if you
guys weren't there you'll probably catch
me doing some algorithms late night this
weekend so um yeah I it over it I'm sure
over time it'll get better unless I'm
just not worthy of jeaious
maybe you're basking in the light as a
coating God every day you're gonna get
there won't worry the other so one way
or the other I believe determined to get
there so I'm hoping that I get at least
something within a year
well you get in a hundred days out of me
so I think there's gonna be the siren
illness when you said a hundred days I
was like I bet you he doesn't know what
a hundred days live don't be throwing
words like wife around brows hey this is
my baby's mom right here like the mother
of my cats all right um hey buddy the
girlfriend of six years that's how I
introduce a woman I introduced him as
this is Dylan I may or may not want to
be much good associated guy my look so
Milo's Lawrence cat's name is Milo our
black cat who messed up his paw
yesterday or his claw his name is
Achilles and our our tannish brown cat
is Tito he's not tan he's looking a
mixture of grey and like weird marble
looking so he's like a tail like a
marbled kissing tan black and brown
striped cat where'd you do
okay sorry most irritating what skills
do you get from attaining a front-end
certificate you'll you'll be a fairly
decent at HTML CSS JavaScript and jQuery
it's up for you to to take your skills
from there I do a great video on my
channel called was free code camp worth
it and I break down what it does for you
and what you can do with it I encourage
you to go watch that Adriane with that
guys I will lead us out tonight code
long and prosper we'll see you tomorrow
there's a comma in there it's not oh
that's right what Gray's code long and
prosper
how do you how do you like you know code
a pause you deal with that time in and
said timeout okay we'll set time in
pause set timeout five seconds with
after code long your PIN nails</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
