in free code camp in the jQuery
calculator advanced front-end project in
our previous video we set up kind of the
the overlay of the HTML we did a little
bit of the CSS so everyone should be at
least to this step and now we're going
to go ahead and jump into the JavaScript
aspect and how I ended up solving this
project and the more complex stuff so
again we're using jQuery to do this
let's start by calling by basically
getting our document ready so we're
going to document dot ready it takes in
a function that does some stuff
essentially this is basically us just
saying look when this docu when our page
loads run this jQuery so I'm going to
try to break this down piece by piece
one thing I found really helpful was
breaking things up into functions a lot
of times people don't do that definitely
take the opportunity to break everything
up into a function that you can so what
we're going to do here is we're going to
try and comment this as we go so so
everything is pretty clear um this is
going we're going to create a variable
that stores our input stores the inputs
from the user to calculate later
so this basically what we're going to be
doing now I did this in an array it may
look a little funky because uh what I
ended up doing was I ended up creating
this inputs array and I started it with
a empty quote in here because I was
having some validation issues without
putting that in there so that's why
that's there we then have a variable
called total string and we're going to
leave this empty for the time being so
what total string does is it's basically
the string that is being outputted right
here and when we update it so it's the
string that we're going to be updating
later on within the function it's going
to be in several functions so that's
what it does string
to store store current input string of
that makes sense the next thing that
we're going to do is create a two
variables one called operators one and
operators two now these will be used for
validation purposes we don't want our
calculator using logic that breaks it or
doesn't work so like for instance you
can't do a plus minus you can't do two
multiplications right after each other I
divide a two decimals all these sort of
things all these things are not accurate
in math and will break our calculator
so I created a variable the first one is
a operators array for validation without
without the dot and so this will be our
VAR operators one and we're going to set
this equal to an array and this is going
to have all our operators so we're gonna
have the plus in here we're all but the
dot excuse me we're gonna have the minus
in here we're also going to have the
divide and then we're going to go ahead
and have the asterisk as well now the
other one uh we're gonna have another
operators to its operators upper ears
array with the dog so this is just
another array that at the time there's
more than one thing into it but when I
ended up in an have just reading a
single dot so this will be used for
validation as well multiple for
validation
cool the next thing is our final global
function here that's called varnum's now
this will be used to just to make sure
everything is a number and everything's
on the up-and-up
three four five six seven eight and nine
and we'll go for the comment numbers or
validation all right listen
yeah numbers for validation works okay
so we have all our variables created now
let's see where I want to start update
good total so I have three functions I
could probably have made for the first
set so let's go ahead and create those
we have a function called get value this
will be the one that actually updates
all our stuff and it has one parameter
input the next thing that we have is a
function called update now update is the
function that we're going to call when
we want our code here right here to
update to the most current value so
every time we do put a nine nine goes in
then we do put a plus now it's nine plus
in there and we put another nice nine
plus nine and then when we hit total we
want it to update to that total as well
so that's what update does and then we
have get total as well function get
total which basically evaluates that and
goes from there so all this is pretty
straightforward so far I hope now let's
go ahead and dive in and then we have a
a a on click that does some stuff as
well now let me go ahead and see where I
create inputs
okay uh we have a input so remember our
inputs are right here we're going to do
some stuff with that right now I think
the the most the quickest way to fully
understand update this is just kind of
showcase it so update we're going to
take that total string variable that we
had right here that's empty and at this
point we're going to say look we want to
take the total string and we want to set
it equal to our array but we want to
join it so that it's a string that's
what we're going to do an update now
update that needs to go ahead and update
that spot which we called we gave an ID
of steps and this will be dot HTML so
total string and we just want to go
ahead and update it to that string value
so if we add an array that that would
run zero here
we if it was nine plus nine it would
then put nine plus nine into there
that's what update does we'll see that
in a second before we get into the some
more complex stuff so good so there's
update get total is kind of similar
except we want to evaluate to that so we
have our total string which is going to
be equal to our inputs array and then
again we want to join it together as a
string and then we want to take this we
want to say look target our steps array
except we don't actually want it to
output the entire string what we wanted
to do is evaluate it and then return the
total of it and to evaluate a string as
a math operator you you are going to use
the eval method and this will do that
for you so that will take if we have a
string of eight plus eight minus five
point two it will then evaluate it and
return you a single number that's
basically what get total does now let's
go ahead and jump into something that
isn't a function quite yet so we have we
when we click on our buttons here a
seven and eight and nine whatever we
needed to do quite a few things now how
do we target something when it gets
clicked in jQuery
everything's used as a selector so we're
because of the way we set it up we set
it up so that we could just target the
anchor tag to be clicked so we want to
say look when on click our dot on when
you click something run a function so
basically when you click an anchor tag
run a function and do some stuff now
this is where we get into the logic
quite a bit so we have if the item that
we clicked and how do we know what it is
we can say this dot ID this dot ID will
return the ID of the item that we click
so if we click delete all ID would be
delete all if we clicked our AC excuse
me the ID would be delete all and that's
what we're going to say so if it's equal
equal to delete all what we want to do
is we want to go ahead and reset the
value of inputs because now we're
starting for fresh so we're just going
to go ahead and set inputs back to its
default value and then we want to
actually call the update array so that
it will then update it to the most
current value which would be empty at
that point which at this point I think
we probably even just changed this to a
zero but uh we'll see at the end so I
don't break my code at all now we also
have this back one now back one our ID c
e where is it of course I can find it
yeah where are you here we are so we
have back one right here that's
basically going to remove the last value
in our inputs array or our last input so
we're going to do an else F here
so as else if this dot ID the item that
we clicked ID is exactly equal to the ID
back one we want to just go ahead and
pop off the last value of inputs
basically just pop off the last array
value and because say we have six plus
six but we didn't mean to add that last
six when you pop it off the value need
our steps in here needs to actually
return to six plus and that's where
we're going to go ahead and call the
update array or the update function one
more time now we have another else if
that says if the ID again if the item
that we clicks ID was total we want to
go ahead and call the get total function
okay so we're basically doing all the
we're just going down the line of all
the unique stuff now we're getting into
a little bit more of the logic stuff so
part of the issue that most people are
going to have is the validation of
making sure there's not multiple
multiples and all this sort of stuff the
way that we can do the next step is we
want to we want to add the values use
our get value operator so what we're
going to do here is a simple else
statement that says if do this so else
do one of these two things if it's this
else do this so basically if it is not
so if it is equal to right so we want to
forget it into this so our if statement
here we want to check our inputs the
last input of our array and we want to
say look if our inputs dot length minus
1 meaning if the last input of our array
does not either contains this does not
contain the index of our operators and
one of our operators again we have our
plus we have our
- we have our divide we have our
asterisk and then we have our dot if
that's equal to negative one so the last
one is equal to negative one go ahead
and call the get value of this dot ID
else call this value here that's
basically all we're basically doing is
setting some conditions where we need to
call our get value function that we're
going to define right now and this will
make a lot more sense so let's go ahead
and because that was quite a bit
we spatially said when you clicked a
link we want if it's delete all go ahead
and reset inputs and then update the
value if you want to go back one go
ahead and remove the last one then
update the value if you wanted to get
the total called the total and then if
for everything else basically go ahead
and get the value here call the get
value function which we're going to
define right now you'll see that there's
an input parameter here let me go ahead
and move up okay so this is where it's
going to get a little tricky
because there's a lot of logic in here
not not a ton I mean this whole thing is
like 50 lines of code but trying to
explain it may be a little difficult so
we're going we're going to start off
moving down what we don't want is to
duplicate dots because you can't have
that in your in your validation so what
we're going to say here is if operators
to remember operators to is our is our
our dot array if it that includes
includes basically checks a value to see
if it's true LLL return ebullient if the
value that you're checking is within
operators - or return true if it's not
it will return false so if the last
value is so the last values input slot
length minus one is exactly equal to
true and our input remember input is the
ID right here so this ID is getting
passed right here so the item that we
clicked is getting passed as a parameter
into get value if that input is exactly
equal to the dot we just want to go
ahead and console dot log an error
message essentially and say say console
dot log and we can go ahead and just put
the duplicate single quotes on the
inside dot because we're using double
quotes on the outside basically just a
little error message saying hey you
can't do that
and you'll see that we don't update the
value there because of that now the next
thing that we want to do is we want to
make sure that our validation Earths we
want to put validation in to make sure
that we don't start with an operator
meaning like we don't want it to be plus
5 or times 2 when there's not a number
in front of it so we want it to either
start with the dot or start with a
operator or excuse me start with a
number so we can do an else if statement
here
that checks now in our else--if
statement we're going to say look if the
very first number so input cell length
is exactly equal to 1 which it should be
because we're starting with a single
item in there the empty quotations and
the operators 1 so all our operators
minus a dot dot includes our input is
equal to false meaning that that what
we're trying to put in is a number or
not an operator so if this is exactly
equal to false meaning it's not in there
go ahead and add that input to the value
to the to the inputs array so inputs not
input so inputs is our array input is
the list ID that we're adding so
basically checking if it's a number so
next what we want to do is check to see
if the last so we're going to do another
else if statement that checks look was
the last operator uh was the last input
and operator if not feel free to add an
operator that's basically what we're
saying because we don't want two pluses
now now the first this else if that we
did right now check the very first spot
because you don't want it to start with
an operator our next logic step is to
make sure that we don't have duplicate
operators it can go plot one plus one
plus one but it can't go one plus plus
one that's basically what we're trying
to do right now so we're doing elsif now
this says operators one so we're again
we're checked we're doing a little bit
of validation dot includes inputs and we
want to check the last one again so
that's going to be inputs not length
minus one if that is equal to false
meaning if we don't if our last thing
was not an operator go ahead and add
that input to the array so input stop
push
input I'll be amazed if this runs on the
first time by the way because we haven't
grant we haven't tested this as we go
and it's kind of hard in the video so
that's kind of what I'm worried about
finally what we want to do now is check
to add a number so finally we're going
to do elsif and we're going to say look
if num stott includes so if the input
includes and because because how we're
getting the idea it returns as a string
we need to convert that to a number if
it includes that input and the way that
we do that is just by using number so if
that's true we don't have to do the
double equals to set it equal to true
because it's assuming it's true if we
don't do that we got we want to go ahead
and go input stop push that input to the
input array and at the end of it all we
want to do is call the update function
and this will update the value at the
end regardless because only because of
the way we set this up only one of these
will trigger as they should
so here's d-day let's see if this works
so we want to do 5 plus 5 so something
is not working so we have to go pause
the video and come back and see what
we've wrote
alright guys so the first mistake that I
saw was right here we have a syntax
error so we're going to go ahead and
change that to input I don't think
that's going to fix what we're trying to
do but at least we call it something so
do 5 plus 5 yep that's still not working
our delete seems to be working so we can
start with the dot but not a double dot
so that fixed that let's go ahead and
see what else we can find
alright guys so as expected we had a
slight syntax error which was kind of
breaking everything so right here
the reason our operator wasn't working
was we forgot to put a little bracket
here so look let me let me I'm going to
go ahead and copy and paste in the
correct version so you can see so the
last character was not an operator and
this was we need to go ahead and have
that so we're basically checking is
there an operator in the last position
if not go ahead and add that so once we
go ahead and save that also there's
another slight air down here you didn't
affect it but I had a negative one in
here there's no reason to have that in
there so go ahead and remove that if you
did it other than that I believe we are
done so let's go ahead and refresh this
page um you probably didn't have that
error if you were falling along it was
like aw man Dylan don't drop the ball
there all right guys I think we are
pretty much done so let's go ahead 8-5
we'll go back or clear all will do 8/9
go back go back we can do 85 times to
hit equals 170 so cool I hope you guys
found this helpful getting you started
on your calculator application I'm sure
there's one or two more validation
things that I'll need to do for the
calculator and we'll do that in an
