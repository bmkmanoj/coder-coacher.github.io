free code camp intermedia algorithm
scripting we're doing DNA pairing so
what are we trying to do in this
essentially we are taking in a letter
and a string a tcga and then we want to
return its corresponding DNA pair so if
it's an A we need to return the pair a T
if it's a TTA C c/g
GGC etc so in this case the way I did it
was at first I added you don't have to
do this but this was kind of I've had
these issues in the past I've actually
done this assignment for a class a while
back and so I put everything in the
uppercase format and the reason they're
type up because I don't want to have to
worry about the input of being a
lowercase C or an uppercase C I just
want to whatever it is make it strong
because I use a if statement so we're
just gonna we're gonna uppercase
everything the next thing we're gonna do
is take our original word our original
string then we're gonna split it up and
we can split it up just by calling dot
split on it
and say we want to say we wanted to
split words in general we would just put
a space or you know comma if we want to
split up on the comment but in this case
we want to split every character and
that's how we do that so the next thing
I did was I created a empty array and I
just called a placeholder array and
we're gonna set this equal of that to an
empty array okay so where do we go from
next because we want to add to our
placeholder array the DNA pairs so you
could do this with a switch statement I
didn't I did a for loop either one would
work so we're gonna start with a simple
for loop starting at zero so four of our
eyes equal zero while I is less than the
length of our character array our string
so stre don't lines
we're gonna continue on of them we're
going to increment by one all right so
what now so the first thing we need to
do is we're gonna have four if
statements one to check for G one to
check for C one to check for a and one
to check for T so we have our four DNA
base pairs and then we need to add to
the place holder right so let's just go
ahead and check will start with G we'll
say so if the current item we're
iterating through and our character a is
equal to G we want to take our
placeholder array and then we want to
push that value onto it and so again
they want us to return a array so we can
do it like so so it takes in a G and
then comes the placeholder or the
corresponding base pair so the way we
can do this then we'll set our string
here equal to placeholder to overwrite
at the end and then we just return let's
see we could also just return
placeholder placeholder all right cool
all right so we can just check to make
sure everything is working by putting in
a G and looks it returns GC perfect so
we're just gonna have to basically do
this all all over again
so Elsa Elsa
SGR I is equal equal to see will do see
next we want to take our placeholder
array and we want to dot push the array
pair and then we just steps within the
values here so starting on C and C
corresponds to G and again we can just
kind of check real quick this is really
how you should be doing it when you're
writing this code out is you should kind
of check at every every statement just
because it's so much easier debug while
you're working on things to make sure
things are working rather than writing
20 lines of code and then trying to
figure it out after which is what you
know I do most of the time and I hate
myself for it
so we're returning we're checking for a
so we're gonna go placeholder or a dot
push and then we're going to be checking
and we're saying look if it's a return
the base pair 80 and I feel pretty okay
that we're probably doing this right so
I'm not going to check it so let's go
ahead and do another else if our final
elsif and this one we're just we're
checking the last one we have to check
this is for a t so we're going to say RI
is equal equal to t oh and we forgot a
quote here and then we're gonna say
nice little placeholder array push and
then we're gonna say look going taking
the T return a TA and then when we run
it that should be it
oh except we let's let's see what's
going on here
so where is our air here
t so it takes in a returns so this is
only returning three pairs right now so
it goes a which returns ta T
you go ahead and put this in here and
see if I should be the same thing huh
so if our string I or trans G so let's
just go ahead and return a T and see
what happens here so T returns ta no hay
a returns a T so I'm not quite sure what
the issue is here so we want to return
let's just return the place holder all
right so we should have ten letters
getting returned here GC c g GC
area we have uh oh no that's right so
this is our function pair bring
everything the upper case you break it
up
ta ACG might know ta g hey you know it
should be 80
oh here it is whoops and of course don't
forget to put that you're checking the
character right there we go so a simple
little error there before we move on
this guy to put our code in and of
course you saw right there I kind of
contradicted myself oh yeah we're good
to go and I broke it so let's just put
our comments in here changes string to
upper case or simple checking and then
here we'll put in breaks string up into
a character array and then here we'll
play the empty array of G right to be
added to I I highly suggest that you
click comments in your code either while
you're doing it or after just because
it's really gonna be helpful down the
road um alright so loop to iterate
through character array and we'll only
do one of these two statements because
they're kind of all the same so we'll
say checks current character and if
equal adds to th a placeholder array the
corresponding DNA pair and then we can
just do ditto ditto
if you really want to be anal that I
didn't did oh so that was the DNA base
pair I hope you guys found that useful
so sorry for the stutter step there but
uh you know it's programming that they
should happens all the time so uh oppa
if you did it better you use the switch
statement that's also a great way to go
about it I just happened to do a for
loop an if statement so I'll see you
guys the next video and as always
questions comments concerns and anything
constructive it's really appreciated
thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
