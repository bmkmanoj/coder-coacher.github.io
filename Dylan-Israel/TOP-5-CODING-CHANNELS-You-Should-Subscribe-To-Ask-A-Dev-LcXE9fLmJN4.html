my top five favorite coding channel
sorry these are the channels I watched
the most for a variety of reasons
although I am subbed to like 30 or 40
coding channels which i think is
probably all the coding channels on
YouTube
at this point I I watched these five the
most and they're all slightly different
so I thought it'd be a good chance to
maybe expose you guys to some some
channels that maybe you haven't heard of
maybe you have a lot of them are much
larger than my own but I just wanted to
show some love in whatever way I could
because I do watch their content I love
it and I hope you guys watch it as well
these are in no particular order they
just it's just who I pulled up that I
like and the first one up is Chris
Hawkes if you don't know Chris Hawkes is
Chris Hawkes is a another self-taught
developer who has been working for quite
some years and you can see I watched
like all of his video I love Christmas
just keeps it real man so if you like
someone who's gonna tell you how it is
sometimes you slow click baby tiles it
doesn't matter to me I click up every
single time I just I like he's a guy
that really will say it like it is and I
appreciate that about him and I'm glad
that he's making content he kind of this
topic oriented video similar to what
I've been doing lately you can kind of
see a few here but I I would say Chris's
videos are probably the the videos that
I watch every single time one comes out
I'm very excited about Chris let's go in
a different direction now and we'll talk
about our boys simple programmer so John
I watched a lot of John's videos not
every single one because jump throws out
three videos a day
John is kind of a self-help coding
channel if you're not familiar with
simple programmer and you can see right
here in the last two hours seven hours
Dinos John's John's a workaholic and
he's putting in work so you can see how
Java
College you're always gonna have
problems don't avoid it so I he he tends
to have a go in the direction of
software but it does just from the sheer
volume of videos have to do a lot with
self-help and how in and personal
development and I encourage you to check
it out he is a lot of life experience
and very successful so a lot of people
are very interested in what it takes to
be an entrepreneur and things like that
so Jonah as simple programmer is another
channel I watch quite frequently now a
channel that I know you guys probably
know him more from udemy than anywhere
else is our boy max a
million maximum makes a million our max
is Eric from Academy basically he he and
his partner here I guess I'm not
familiar with this partner but they do
tutorials on udemy and they're they're
quite popular and you can see that
recently I watched a two hour video
going through angular 4 since I started
my new role but they're more of the
tutorial types and occasionally they
will do a video talking about their
thoughts or he will do a video talking
about sauce but for the most part
they're you know detailed in-depth
tutorials very very high quality usually
they're excerpts from their course from
his courses that he puts on udemy he's
probably one of the largest coding
courses if not in the probably the top
five content creators on udemy selling
software tutorials I would imagine does
very well last time I checked yet
something like 175 thousand different
students so great great tutorials and if
you if you're like those long detailed I
want to learn a new language or
framework it couldn't recommend it more
last but our next not we got one more
after this don't go nowhere
alright for the free code camp kill two
hundred ten thousand I didn't know they
had this many subscribers to be honest
with you I just saw a video the other
day about how they got their silver play
button one of the cool things about the
free code camp channel is because it is
open source much like free code camp
that they have a bunch of different
content creators so you get exposed to a
lot of different things now why I really
like that is you can see that they have
different sort of not only different
story teachers but I also have different
tutorials going over various things so
this one is by beau who who has
completed all of free code camp very
impressed life coding with Jesse was a
good one I started a couple of these but
there I think this is probably like
they're probably going on like 40 videos
on this but uh Jesse's been live coding
through different aspects you started
with react I'm not quite sure what he's
up to now you can see we have this ask
I'm a per net I mispronounced this but
troth I or prithi I apologize some a day
at so they they now have a series where
you go and see what a what's a day at
Amazon like with Jeff so you can see
there's a lot of different content going
over get get a whiteboard tutorials all
this sort of stuff and they probably
have got probably 500 videos or
something like that and they're doing a
great job it exposes you to a lot and if
you really like one of their series they
go very long because there's different
different people teaching different
things and so not every it's not one
creator which makes it so okay I'm gonna
hone in on to this one topic of react
and just Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam forty
videos later so I really like that about
it and last but not least we got our boy
traversing me Brad who's been killing it
taking over the the YouTube game 180
thousand subscribers if you're not
familiar with traversing media I I
suggest out of all this in terms of what
can better your career and get you
exposed to the most technologies in web
development Brad's doing an excellent
job in that you see right here he's
recently started releasing courses on
udemy I believe this is his third one I
I specifically like this this one
because a lot of times people are asking
how can I go from start to finish and
this is a video doing exactly that from
let's open up a lets open up an editor
to deploying to note
and I'm currently going through his boot
shop for and his angular 4 course but he
knows in-depth tutorials he also has
crash courses which I couldn't recommend
more I recently watched the angular for
crash course followed up with the jQuery
crash course and I'm moving on to the I
think you had a tutorial bootstrap for
I'm gonna hit before I did the boot
finish up the bootstrap for course but
if you just want sort of a refresher
these crash courses are amazing um for
the most part brad has been putting out
content every single week maybe twice a
week I would say Sunday see what's out
like a little hey let's build a little
project which are super fun like it this
last time build a landing page with
something called skeleton CSS I love you
stumbles to he's killing them thumbnail
game I might have to take lessons teach
me senpai but uh so those are my five
most watched and favorite coding
channels right now a couple other ones
that I watched off the top of my head is
ricky garcia and program with eric and
there's there's so many i i watch so
many different coding channels but those
are the five that i watched the most and
that i appreciate there's a different
sort of very variation you can see chris
hawks talks about talks about some of
the things that he's interested in and
software and web development and then
you have a kind of mind and diversity
media who more so focused on the
in-depth tutorials and john who's a
little bit software a little bit
personal development and the free code
camp which is kinda all over the place
and a different a different sort of
slice of life at the end of the day and
i appreciate that as well so let me know
in the comments below who are some of
your favorite channels because these are
just my top five there are so many great
channels to knit and inch is also really
good so there's so many good ones that
the net ninja r.i.p the new boston the
new Boston's like the og right the new
Boston just took up and bounced

like the og channel 1.7 million oof all
these guys are killing gang yeah last
time you uploaded was one year ago

those channels show some love to your
favorite content creators these are a
few of mine I'm gonna do a video about
my five favorite non coding channels
just so you guys can I can share some of
my interests to show some love to a
couple other channels that I'm I'm very
much so interested in and maybe you are
interested some of the topics I'm
interested in such as finance investment
that's all that comes to mind right now
maybe some gaming but I don't have too
many interests outside of coding but
I'll share that with you in another
video sometime soon thanks for watching
guys I appreciate it bye quick shoutout
to device plus comm if you're interested
in the latest IO tease hacks
do-it-yourself projects revolving around
Arduino and Raspberry Pi there's some
great how-to guides I highly encourage
you to check them out and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
