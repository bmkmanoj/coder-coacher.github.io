struggled the last few times let's go
back into the wizard hunt I see more
arithmetic I'm not happy about this
let's see what we can do though oh my
god it's so hot
please right now just cover the gate to
the astral plane you've gained entry but
you've heard rumors of a gateway to a
secret chamber parallel dimension
cadential treasure maybe you should just
off walk your way into it
listen carefully to what each was it say
so calculate each magic number you'll
need to take things one once at that
time all right the secret number is 40
divided by 4 and then till the number de
missy here all right what dude this
guy's welcome friend now divide by five
and tell the number you get to be
oughtta guess this is beyond so so what
we can do here is just myth actually do
we need we'll just create a new bar here
we'll save a lot actually let's move to
that guy first
divine missus number by beta summer
alright so cool so we'll say VAR num 1
is equal to myth divided by 5 move to
beta viata so we're gonna move back move
to 40 to 20 and then we are going to say
the num 1 and then we are going to
create a new variable called num - I set
that a equals two myths track betas
number from mithy so myths
- betas is our know one and we want to
move to Sandor here and you want to move
x-wing and that was 38 36 and we want to
say num2
I let's run this actually submitted I
think I feel good enough so we go one
two three four now we know what's going
on it was what a team
what a team
all right we got a new gate here 25
variable levels alright pretty cool
pretty cool the Wizards plane I guess
will keep going down the wizard route
basic syntax with those ticking
variables we're trying to find the
hidden gold right now doctor waiting a
mysterious alternate plane in reality
only cleverness was there five secret
rotors carefully calculate a tragic
number oh all right
more math multiplication all right so
I'm gonna say subtract one and multiply
by 4 to get the sauce all right so say
VAR z sofie equals
so trifling multiply a 5-4
secret number is 8 multiplied by 3 and
subtract 2 until the result of Tomas
okay so I'm gonna assuming they mean
from Tam so there's 4 and then let's
move to this is 32 24 let's make sure
that's correct
because I don't actually normally would
say what's going on here oh we actually
say oh if I all right let's go ahead and
run that see if we died here ma'am
that is not correct
subtract one and multiply before it
against number most wait so you subtract
two to get Thomas longer secret number
is a okay I see it's gone I think we
have to do this eight minus one times
four
let's see what's going on what a team
nasty
what a team never see
all right so we have used parentheses so
we didn't do it earlier let's see if
this is correct
what a team hmm
what a team
ah there we go alright so they wanted
some minus 1 then x 4 in that order
ok now next add this number to tump
Thomas number and then divide the result
by 2 so let's create a new variable here
called flower Thomas and we'll set it
equal to C Sophie plus M divided by 2
and then we want to move that XY to this
guy at 40 20 and then we want to 0 say
now let's go ahead and run that and make
sure we did our arithmetic correctly
what a team
all right at time on Sophie's number
all right so create a new one yeah and
we're called this far
Cecil or sizzle I don't know I say that
all right so we want to add Tam plus
this is Sophie subtract
based on some orphans elfies and
multiply the results all right so we're
gonna multiply the results of I
understood this correctly Sophie -
was this Fonz
take that's right
we have to move there as well so this
was 48 16 48 16 and then from here we
want to zero it I say all right let's
see it's great fingers all right let's
go baby we got it
nasty
damn we did it not too shabby
not too shabby masked man is sorry what
you want all right uh useful cornucopia
I will do useful competitors say ogres
must I clicked gather all the clones
I've I see arithmetic in this so okay
all right the coin Phyllis when pseudos
vials a deadly poison ogres are
attacking while their fans are trying
they're trying to steal your coins
attack the enemy only if the only if the
type is not equal to P on any but I'm
not equal attack gather the item only if
it's not equal to I find them we into
this if I know it's not equal to
actually if items uh ID because I don't
have an ID
why don't try that dot ID it is not
equal to poison we let's not use a
strict equals I know
move XY see item dot X and I know you
guys why
see if that make sure that crashes crash
alright so this seemed to work but
let's carry of that we don't need the
item we actually wanted to here on out
the item let's see damn straight to
death let's show this alright so if
there is an item go ahead and do that
and then we'll say see I'm not fine near
Sidon let's go ahead and look at the
documentation we have item top position
dot X I don't have a position outline
move to the position of the item
let's try this
if item is equal equal to coin we will
move to its position
took on maybe Jim let's try the war zone
item is not illegal poison oh my god
oh I didn't see the dot type so item dot
tight let's try this because they do the
P on right here I was trying dot ID
there we go
I haven't got time
so basically we're just letting these
guys it looks like we got it just item
that tight that's what we were going for
your dad not good
thank you get the stuff man how do you
get the poison
the gym with the gold down yeah yeah I
think I got our coin this was supposed
to happen like that
I guess that's good now gather all the
coins
alright guys uh that's pretty good one
just learning more about the game item
that typed now we know that exist
next up logical path salted Earth and
coin a copia coin neucopia so as always
I think for everyone's been supporting
me on patreon
thank you for subbing thank you for the
shares and I will see you guys in the
next code Kombat video see you next time
you're watching the video don't forget
to check out my collaboration with
ericsurf6 going over how to get started
coding and if you're looking for some
coding help go to code mentor using the
annotation or card and if you're looking
for internships or part-time jobs or
full-time jobs as a student or recent
grad check out way up com see you guys
