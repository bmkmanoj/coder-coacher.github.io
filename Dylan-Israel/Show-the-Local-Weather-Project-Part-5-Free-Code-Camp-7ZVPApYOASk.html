time that we were doing this we said we
were gonna start working on being able
to display the data on the page and
that's styling it so how do we do that
in this case the way I did it was I gave
IDs to some unordered list will start
style these in a minute and then I just
kind of turned it into HTML and inserted
the string so in this case our API our
API is now coming out now that's not
very useful to us right now so why don't
we change this to city and then in here
I'll put let's say a city or a location
yeah there's a city here we'll just put
hashtag hashtag city and this is gonna
target this ID here and then in here
it's still putting in our API but we
want to go ahead and just so Fort
Glendale here so I try and keep the
variables in JavaScript to same as the
IDS it's just easier for me to remember
all right so we won't do that for let's
see the temperature as well we may have
to turn that into a button at the end
we're gonna worry about that in the next
video
but all right let's just go ahead and
start displaying our the things that
we're gonna need and then we'll cut work
within a second so we also want to know
the weather type right oh and don't
forget the quotation marks or it won't
work and then we'll go we'll go ahead
and go right here will say look output
this to the weather type ID give me
weather type and now we're just going to
go ahead and go to the other window say
ID is equal to weather type
and you'll see that there's a clear sky
right now in the city of Los Angeles so
what else is there we want to be able to
see the temperature so we'll we'll
probably have to do an if statement a
little bit but for the time being why
don't we just go ahead and target the
Fahrenheit temp and then we'll do some
stuff with that in a little bit so we
have F town actually let's set it up
properly all right we'll follow a little
our convention it's gonna do something a
little different but we're not but I
like to tackle things once one at a time
so you may find going getting just like
the bare minimum for each section like I
like to do a little bit crazy it just
for me helps me just knock out one
section I know I can do and then
everything else will kind of work around
it so we'll just say that this one is
our temperature and we'll go ahead and
give this an ID of temperature and this
is again just some basic jQuery okay
cool so it's about sixty three point
nine degrees outside now that's a pretty
long number I don't really want to even
deal with that so probably when we start
cleaning this up we'll make that a
decimal the Iraq excuse me to like two
places or one place passed the decimal
so what else was there wind speed all
right so we needed one for wind speed as
well
excuse me my internet slag him a little
bit alright so we'll just go ahead and
give this a title one speed and we're
gonna have to go ahead and do it in here
now at this point we'll go ahead and
this should be once you kind of see this
done it's not too bad so we're gonna
target the windspeed ID and then we're
just going to straight up output one
speed
so this is 0.88 I'm not sure what the
measurement is but I'll be looking that
up to the next one all right and then
finally we I believe that's everything
we need now what will we be doing in the
next video in the next video well
actually going to create a button that's
going to toggle F temp here we'll
probably do an if statement to kind of
say if it if if Fahrenheit turns the
Celsius if Celsius display Fahrenheit
and because we already have the math
done we won't actually have to do it in
here we'll just put the variables in
there but we'll be doing that next video
