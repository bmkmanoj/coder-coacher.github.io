introduction to reaction as part one
components and advance to extra so you
have a little bit done here for some
reason it wouldn't reset to code but
this first example is basically just
showcasing everything that we already
know right now so we'll just go over it
real quick you're seeing it's rendering
on in our localhost here but it's
basically saying import this file import
this file create a component called
quote maker with the render function
that takes in a bunch of HTML and do
some stuff with it and then render out
our component at this location
everything all that should be review but
we're basically gonna be making it more
complex than what we've done in the past
so let's go ahead and get started here
so we're in a PJs what it's asking us to
do is first import our library so we're
gonna say Bar react is equal to require
and then we're gonna import the react
library like so then we're going to do
the same thing for react dumb and we're
gonna set this equal to require and this
is gonna be react - dumb so we're just
importing our two libraries right now
now in our component class which we
capitalize because it's a component
we're gonna create a variable called al
al this is gonna be equal to three react
dot crate class so we're creating our
component and in here we're gonna pass
an object into it like we normally would
one is going to have a render and the
render is gonna be a function that
returns a div it looks like we're not
actually putting anything in the div yet
so let's go ahead and run that make sure
everything is pretty straightforward
so render out a div in this component
class when we call it it's taking a
second to run we haven't actually
rendered it yet though
so it takes a little bit to run this but
let's go ahead and see what step three
is here so inside of that it wants us to
nest an h1 and because it's multiple
elements we typically want to wrap it up
in parenthesis and in our h1 we want to
pass in the AL title so we're gonna use
the brackets like so or the curly braces
and say al title and this will output
our h1 once we call this I'm just going
to run that we haven't output it yet
though so that's why it's still blank
and then on a new line add an image
element it says here so it's just making
sure JSX is all correct so within the
div we want to but outside the h1 we
want to do like so and don't forget that
when dealing with self-closing tags in
react you have to close them it's not
optional like it is and html5 it's it's
a it's required for that it to be a self
closing tag you can't just leave it
empty so here we're going to set the
source equal to the Alva source which is
our variable here and then we're gonna
go ahead and set the alt tag equal to
al-qaida
and then after this assuming that I
didn't mess this up we are going to go
ahead and have the react DOM dot render
out our component or our application and
the location of it so here where we want
it to render out so here we want to
output our component and then we want to
do it at document dot get element by ID
app now what is this this is just a
simple location in our index here so if
we were going to pull this up you'll see
that we have an app right here this is
the idea that we're talking said
basically same throw our react code
right here let's go ahead and run that
and now it should output correctly
assuming I didn't make any mistakes any
typos there we go beautiful out never
seen such a beautiful out very cool now
render is saying renders must have a
return function you can do calculations
above it stuff like that it's basically
showing us that we can use math dot
random and just do it outside the render
function excuse me this should be within
the render function not outside of it so
outside the return statement so let's go
ahead and make some render function with
logic in it we're gonna import our
library again so require and what are we
requiring or applying the react library
and then we're also requiring the
react - dong
it's all hot in here yes I know how it
is where you guys are at massage it is
all right uh on line 20 declare a new
variable named friend all right fair
enough so mark friend and it's a
component so we capitalize it and we're
gonna set this equal to react dot great
class because we're creating a component
and we're gonna go ahead and pass in an
object like so oops and then in here we
want to give it one property called
render and render is going to be a
function and what do we want to do with
that we just want to return a dip so
right now we want to return diff just
kind of run that real quick
here it says inside inside of render we
want to declare a new variable called
friend inside the body of render declare
a new variable called friend so of our
friend we're you're just gonna set this
equal to one of the friends our array
we'll go ahead and do friends index one
this is our friends all right and then
set friends equal alright cool so we're
just creating a variable within render
because that's where we're gonna use
that so we're creating in the correct
scope here so inside of the return
statement what we all we want to do here
is create a h1 tag and then within there
we want to just go ahead and call in the
curly braces friend dot title so this is
going to be index 0 out of the index one
friends type we know how to output that
real quick
and then it looks up next outside the h1
though still within the div
friend
that should work friend title let's go
ahead and run that one more time it
seems that there is an issue inside the
return statement
in Jack's friend title
uh a friend zero when I did this before
and it worked just fine so let's see
what's going on here probably a small
mistake somewhere let's see if we can
find it we create a class render it our
friends yeah I don't know it looks like
you often do friend zero friends one
isn't working so something to keep in
mind looks like it's a little bit bugged
well yeah so now we're gonna just do the
same thing so now we're gonna do it with
an image so we're going to IMG and
remember we have to have the closing
bracket and we're gonna set the source
equal to friend dot SRC of course make
sure you spell everything correctly
I'm pretty cool and then last but not
least we actually want to render this
out so it's just going to be a react
render and then we're gonna pass in the
component which in this case we called
friend and then we're gonna pass in the
location it's document dot get element
by ID app and now when we run it we
should see who our friend is and what
their title is yum and then whatever
that's a bomb language dragged on render
oh excuse me it's rack Dom not react and
then there is our boy looking yummy
apparently um so we're gonna have Chuck
J yes it says you can see a variable
called 50/50 what's going on here is
it's choosing a random number between
1.0 and 0 and if it's greater than this
or return greater than 0.5 returns true
else or returns false that's all that's
going on here so starting on line seven
right a new component class name
tonight's plan so far tonight's our
tonight's plan is equal to react dot
create class and we're gonna go ahead
and pass in an object and it's basically
saying output this if it's true output
this if it's false now they have an
example here that we can use to do that
but I don't think we need to look at it
so it's just a simple FL statement so if
true do this if false do this so we say
if 50 50 is equal to true true
see equal legal should probably be
triple equals we'll just do equal legal
and don't forget this is going to be
render and whatever you're entering a
function let's go ahead and throw our FL
statement in there as well got a lot
head of myself so if that's the case
remember
render has to do a return so we return
an h1 if it's true that does what
tonight I'm going out
whoo else return an h1 that says tonight
I'm going to bed
whoo let's go ahead and run that
basically just adding some logic to our
renders what this is showing this a
pretty simple if-else statement
if it's true do this if it's false do
this and of course make sure that you
have your semicolon to that pass it
might pass about the semicolon which is
kind of bad I'm just curious before I
put it in there if it's gonna pass it
does pass but make sure you through
Cermak semicolons on your return
statements all right yeah so now that we
set up that logic let's go ahead and
render out and see what fate has in
store for us as they put it so
dramatically so Rach Dom render and then
in here passing the component tonight's
plan
this would have been so much cooler
thing I like if they were just like
Netflix and chill or I don't know some
Sun they could have made it a little bit
funnier that's why I have my main
critics of like doing these tutorials is
like we're all trying to learn but why
don't you make it a little bit more
entertaining
in the meantime yeah so are we going out
or are we staying in and doing the
Netflix and chill see here so it looks
like we're going out boys for the life
of the party
all right um next up it introduces the
this this is used a lot in room and
react now what is this this basically
refers to properties that are in your
objects a lot of times so it's not
specific to react it works exactly kind
of how you would use it in in javascript
in general but I think the easiest way
to kind of see how you'll use it is just
use it right now so we're gonna create a
property here called name and all we're
gonna do is give it a value we'll go
ahead and put in my my name coding
tutorials 360 don't forget to call them
up because these are parameters that
were passing in here or properties
excuse me properties so what we want to
output here is name however if we were
to do something like this this would be
looking for a variable that's not
accurate well we need to do is this dot
name because we're looking for a
parameter so you say this represents the
object my name and it's looking for
object my name the object we're in for
the parameter so find the name parameter
from this object which happens to be my
name
Oh might explain that well but basically
this just refers to the object that
you're currently iterating it
there we go there and then inside the
functions oh we wanted to do more than
just that we actually wanted to go ahead
and in the h1 tags put my name is space
and then a period
period and then go ahead and run that
my name is cody charles 360 BAM we're
killing it boys
it looks like maybe we need a space
are you kidding me
I think we have to put this on the same
light it's not registering our code
there so h1 / H 1
my name is this stuff name everything
should work there we go
a little bit technical difficulties
there render functions often contain
event listeners so it gives us a nice
example of an event listener we have the
parameter here scream and then we have
rent render and what we want to do here
excuse me property I keep saying
parameter these are properties of this
object of our component object our
component class here what we're
basically gonna do here is just pass in
our render here an on-click event and
we're gonna set this equal to this or
are we setting equal to anything yeah
we're setting equal to this dot screen
we're basically just defining the
function that runs on click here and
what is it it's the property of our
button component
very nice and then as we normally would
render these things out we'll do react
Dom render and within here what are we
rendering rendering our component which
is our button right here and then we're
gonna render it out to the usual spot
document dot get element by ID and that
is to the app let's go ahead and run
that
we should get a button that displays it
says ah and then when we click it will
get our alert so it's our event listener
is working just fine let's go ahead and
go to next and we have completed that so
basically everything that we already
know about importing the libraries how
to create in component a little bit of
logic and render the main thing that was
kind of different was that you were you
know we did event listeners I don't
remember too that before but this just
understand that this refers to the
property of the object that you're
currently working within and you'll
you'll have a easy time but up next guys
will be doing the components render
other components so your applications or
your components are gonna help work
within each others start linking them
together should be a lot of fun so I
have to always guys thanks for watching
