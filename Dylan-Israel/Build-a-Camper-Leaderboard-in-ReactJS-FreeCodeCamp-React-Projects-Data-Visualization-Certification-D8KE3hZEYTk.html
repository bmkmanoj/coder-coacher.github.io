back in free code camp building a camper
leaderboard in react.js no less this is
going to be fun it's going to be the
first react video I've made I've been
doing their course on the udemy react
now degree so I figure I knock out one
of these now what are we building well
we have two API endpoints that they
provide us here one gives us the top
points by a user in the last 30 days and
the other gives us the top points of all
time so you'll see here if we click this
it's all time if we click here it's past
30 days and it swaps right I wonder what
the lowest of the top hundred is for all
time I need work I need to get myself
into this list that's a lot of checking
I want to be in the list maybe all right
so uh area that's what we're building
I'm not going to be using cocaine to do
this buts what not if you are a code pen
person I have faith that you'll be able
to do this as well
we're going to be using the create react
app so if you don't have node and get
bash installed you're going to need that
so take a moment to do that now I
recommend if you're installing the
Facebook create react app for your build
here to install it globally so you don't
have to worry about that
now once you've installed it globally go
ahead and launch create launch the
applications we created react - app and
the name of the folder I think we'll
call this FCC YouTube so I'm going to
call it and so this will go ahead and
generate our requirements for this
generate our our build for this
Oh apparently you can't have capital
letters so we'll do it like this so
create it name it whatever you want
leaderboard we already have ours that
we've pushed it by the way the V code
for this will be on my github which is a
pizza poker guy so if you are interested
in looking at
source code for everything that I have
here it will all be there as well for
you to reference all right guys so that
might take in a minute now the next
thing that we want to do that we've
installed the react app with cracka so I
just go ahead and CD into that directory
real quick so you'll see now that we're
there and then we want to install the
packages that come with with this now
there may be a few if instantly take a
minute after that after it's done
installing we're going to stall some of
our own so why this is going it's going
to be a minute let's talk about what
we're installing and why we're going to
install Axios as ax iOS the reason for
that is it's actually going to make it
easier for us to do our Ajax calls when
the issues I ran into when I was
building this project was that our our
vanilla JavaScript Ajax calls we're not
setting the state of items as
efficiently and it was causing issues
with our UI so instead of us having to
worry about that
Axios it seemed to work much better with
that and that's where we're going to be
doing there so while we're at it go
ahead and do I have yarn installed yarn
and yarn add rather yarn add Axios we
had that as well and the last thing that
we're going to going to be adding is the
react bud strap react bootstrap is Reax
version of bootstrap and essentially
it's taken all the cool aspects of
bootstrap and it turned it into
components that allows us to easily use
them and I'll talk a little bit more
about that when we actually get into
building out the table that's where we
uses the table in the images and it's
very very intuitive very helpful now
documentation is is great as well so I
encourage you to check that out now last
thing we need to add is yarn add and you
can do this with NPM install as well but
one of the reasons I am using yarn other
than the fact that it's built into the
react create react out uses faster my
understanding I don't have a detail
understanding this but my understanding
is it will essentially fetch packages
that you already have instead of having
to go and get them which makes it faster
that's so having go and get them on in a
database somewhere so that's my
understanding of it so those are the two
packages we're going to need to install
for this application on top of the
create react app now why we're doing
that go ahead and open up wherever your
react application is stored so we have
FCC YouTube right here very nice and
you'll notice that it comes with a bunch
of great files and we're going to be
working primarily in app KS and index
dot CSS best way to test if everything's
working properly is just go ahead and do
yarn start and it's going to launch our
our local machine now another benefit to
use in the crate rack gap is it will
actually have a page in your local host
right where we're developing it'll have
it constantly refresh every time you
make an update to your code which is
very beneficial in my opinion so you
have to it's just a small it's so small
things that make things go faster so
what you should be seeing is something
similar if everything got installed
correctly in terms of the create react
app what we're about to see here
almost there and you'll see right here
starting development server compiled
successfully so it should load any
second now and BAM so this is the
default that's come out here in it we're
going to go ahead and clear this out
right now you're going to need you're
going to want to have this running
pretty much the whole time for faster
development now I'm going to be jumping
back and forth in between what's here
and there to show you our progress as we
go along now first thing that we're
talking about we want to delete
everything that's not this app I'm going
to treat this as if you guys have never
used react at all before which I imagine
if you're watching this video you're
pretty new right so let's go ahead and
delete what's in here in our app
component we also the reason we're not
deleting app here is if you go to your
index J essentially this is where we're
bootstrapping it at and we're saying
look for a document dot get element ID
by root and then you'll see we have this
is where we're actually launching the
application that app actually app right
here we're launching app here and then
in index dot HTML excuse me when we go
here you'll see that we have root so I
got that backwards so basically we're
just injecting it into our root right
there now for this we can oh if we want
to really get fancy FCC leaderboards
we're killing it all right let's jump
into the react aspect of it so we're
going to jump into a PJs so this is
where we have to start figuring out what
we need to do this is where we're going
to output the data this is where we're
going to output the UI and the data and
up here we have to kind of define what
we're going to use so we know that we
need two arrays right now the one array
that stores all the data for the 30 days
of the most points on free code camp and
the one that's sourced the top hundred
times to the top 100 times top 100 of
all time so we're going to create our
state object here
in our class we're just a state or in
step this is here and in our state we're
going to call the top 100 hundred days
we just set this gen FDR a and then
we're going to have top 100 all-time now
this data actually is already
pre-ordered so we don't have to sort it
which is nice now we have our state so
how are we going to get that state well
two things we are going to use Axios to
get our our AJ salt now the first thing
that we want to do here is we just want
to say Axios we need to import Axios
first so that we can use it right even
though we have it installed we haven't
actually done anything with it so we're
an import Axios from axials going to
save that and we can also we're at it
let's go to Gary this logo distance
we're no longer using it so that we
don't get this error so now that we've
added access to our application it's
going to look if you're familiar with
jQuery it kind of looks the same right
it's just another cert a service to call
our data so we're saying Axios get and
what do we want to pass in there well
let's go ahead and get the most recent
URL which in this case is this this URL
now we're going to write this in a get
FCC data function but right now all we
want to do is we want to showcase that
this works before we convert it into a
function so this the Axios get and then
its other way around it and then we say
dot then so that's where we're going
right to retrieve our JSON data and in
here what we want to do is just go ahead
and copy this real quick what we want to
do in our then is we want to pass in
some data this is our data object that's
within the then we have our callback
function here and we want to consult
law's data now where are we going around
here so we have our dot get and we have
our dot then and we have our
person myself am i typing so we're going
to copy pastas out in there real quick
wham-bam
will comment that out and sorry guys
a my fat-fingered all this
I guess so this is how I originally
wrote my code and for some reason I
couldn't I don't know where I was
messing up my syntax here but what I
wrote was this is going to be our get
FCC data function and it's going to get
the URL that we're passing in and then
with the data we're going to do
something with this and this we're going
to pass in the state name which is going
to be top 100 or top 100 of all time and
then we're going to set that to the
value this will allow us to do our Ajax
calls when the component loads so how do
we how do we normally when do we call
our normally when we call our Ajax cells
you want to do it with the component did
mount this is going to fire off after
the application is loaded to start doing
our Ajax calls so the component did
mount and in here in here all we're
going to do is say this don't get FCC
data and that's why our HS call wasn't
loading there as well so my mistake here
is if we wanted to just straight-up call
it we could actually just copy and paste
this into component did mount so in our
get FCC data the first thing that we
want to pass in is that first URL here
and then the second thing is just a
string for the name of the state that we
want to change in this case our
parameter is called
state name and we are going to pass it
in top 100 days so the most recent and
then we are going to pass in just going
to copy this one more time we're going
to call it a second time because we want
the top of all time so here we go
Bam Bam Bam copypasta and top 100 all
time now just as an example to make sure
everything is working let's go ahead and
jump back to here go to inspect we
should get a console log of the same
array in the the data here we hard-coded
that so let's refresh that
interesting so let's see why our project
isn't calling that console.log just one
see if it's actually getting hit
interesting
hmm
now I wonder if it's because we have
nothing in our application sometimes
you'll have issues here where you won't
load anything so let's go ahead and turn
each one in here
all right so here is our spelling
mistake right here
our fat-fingered up component as to be
expected there we go now we should
finally see our r1 loads and then of
course our array so you'll see here we
have a all time point the image for the
user image we have the last update the
recent three one four and then in terms
of points and then the user name now
what we're going to do here is we're
going to go ahead and continue on so
we're just going to be using one
component but you because tables are
kind of a pain to work in everything has
to be within the t Behati but you can
also probably take a little bit more
time to write a second component called
row or data row or anything like that
now this is where we're going to now use
the table the table component from react
from react boost job now you don't have
to do this but this is what I did when I
when I talked with Steven my you also
has a Coney channel and he's kind of the
guy I go to on occasion for reactive
I've also hired him for tutoring on
occasions when I want to learn something
pretty rapidly I I pay him for about an
hour of his time and we go and we hit
the ground running and it's very
beneficial I couldn't recommend him more
but here he recommended that I use react
bootstrap now what we want to do is
import the table component from react
bootstrap now I believe we already
installed this if I remember correctly
so everyone should be on the same page
and we're taking it from the lib and
then we're going to import the table
oh and don't forget from so now that we
did that let's go ahead and delete this
h1 we're going to create a table
component on the table tag notice the
capital T here and this is just going to
give us some nice styling as well now
how are we going to have that styling
they have profs assigned to the CSS
values for instance so we have striped
we also have ordered we have hover and
condensed or condensed then hovered
there are four things that are going to
just add a little bit of nice swag to
our table now I also added this class
called color black and this is just
going to go along with our CSS that I'll
be setting down down the road and let's
go ahead and add that now notice that
it's class name because react obviously
we can't use the word class because it's
a reserved term in JavaScript wrench up
into index dot CSS we're just going to
go ahead and create a excuse me app dot
CSS we're going to go ahead and jump an
app CSS and we're going to create our
color black which is just going to set
the color of the font to black for our
CSS that we're going to be out of down
the run now again you can sell this
however you want I just put some basic
coloring in mind
I usually don't worry too much about CSS
I don't really enjoy CSS I enjoyed the
logic I enjoyed the the JavaScript the
database stuff that's that's the cut
type of stuff I enjoy so here we go so
we have our table just like in it at
this point it's going to bring it up but
something in it we're going to add some
stuff though so don't select that
oh I accidentally closed my thing now I
do apologize I forgot that we are
actually going to add one more library
we're going to add the font awesome
library as well this is going to give us
the carats for when we click on our
table to the drop down so go ahead and
take a second to install that right now
and moving forward what we're going to
do is we are going to now just create
our basic HTML for table head this is
going to be our tablet now in our first
row we want our CLR right so our table
row we just want to go ahead and we want
to add in some pH text or table head
tags essentially a table data right and
we're just going to put the hash tags
and keep track of our number and then
below here we are going to have another
th this is going to be our camper head
or excuse me camper name or that's going
we'll go ahead and launch our yarn start
again and there we are going to have the
was this points in 30 days
and then here we are going to here we
are going to have all time points very
nice now in our table we need a table
body this is going to be where we're
going to be outputting our data right
the body of our data let's go ahead and
jump out a table head and we're going to
jump back down into table body here and
in table body this is where all our real
logic is going to go now for the sake of
this we're going to start by just
outputting hard coding one of the arrays
up so let's take our top 100 days now
we're going to be using a Deconstructor
here to just save us a little bit of
typing we're going to take cons and
we're going to deconstruct this to take
in top 100 days so that instead of us
having to say this dot state top 100
days every place we use it we just going
to set this equal to this stop state and
then we're going to do the same thing
here for our top 100 of all time so in
our body here what we're going to do is
we're going to we're going to output our
entire array with table rows and table
data using the array function map so
take this or six top 100 days and we're
map it up right now one thing that we're
going to do is we're going to output the
data and then we're also going to each
element and then the second parameter
the index for our our number that we're
iterating through an add one to that so
starts at 0 don't really like starting
list at 0 though right is unnatural
except in program you can so we have our
return statement here instead
there we go I like to break these up
just to keep track of all my parentheses
and all my curly braces now we have all
our data and now it's just a matter of
creating our table rows now if if you
haven't used react before what you're
going to need to do I have one too many
of these if you haven't used your axe
before we need to keep in mind is that
you have to assign a key this
essentially is a primary key so that as
these things get sorted they have a
unique value in our case it's going to
be username now I called this row so
we're going to set key is equal to Rho
dot username again for when you output
the array you have to have a key to keep
track of the date of the outputting so
now we have our table row and in our
table data here the first value we want
to output that's going to be index plus
1 this is just going to be this is just
going to be the keep track write the 0
to 100 nice and we're going to go ahead
and copy this bam bam bam and the next
thing that we want to do is we want to
go ahead and output the image name there
excuse me the image and to do that we're
going to actually go ahead and import
image the image component from react
bootstrap as well this is just going to
give us some nice circle image to go on
circle images to go on it also to degree
and it as I've been using it it makes it
a little bit easier to follow your code
when you start thinking of every aspect
of your code as a component so it's it's
something about it's very very easy for
me anyhow to follow on so but to each
their own
now in there they actually had it linked
to the the individuals free code camp
shell so let's go ahead and create our
anchor tag
in here this is going to go to HTTP
colon slash slash WP re code camp org
now.org guys they're moving on up good
for them right and then we're going to
go ahead and concatenate that will use
back ticks here so backticks will allow
us to do our string interpolation what
that basically means is that we have a
better way of creating strings with
variables in it and it's not going to be
a complete pain yes why is my stuff
breaking oh we have to have our curly
braces to do that so make sure you
surround it with curly braces first
otherwise it'll just think we're writing
nonsense and then so that we want to
pass in our variable in this case our
row username because that's the
catenation for what we're trying to do
so we have row username so you'll see
here save that and that will take it to
that will be whatever that username is
and then in here we want to pass in that
image attribute that we just created so
our image component that we imported and
the source is going to be equal to the
row IMG without C URL and then in here
we have this class name that I defined
that was just called image height the
reason for that is the images that you
get are like 800 pixels large so we just
got to bring it down the level there's
probably a class that goes our prop that
goes with it I didn't see one but uh
very well could be so an image height
I believe I set it to let's see here 50
pixels
okay so image height just define our
class in here we have height of 50
pixels we also give it
we also float it to the left so I
thought that'd look better again all
this is optional and then we have a
border that goes around the image to
make it pop out a little bit one pit one
pic what border of one pixel and with
solid and then black for the color it's
going to save that and the last thing
that we need to do for this is we are
going to use the circle prop property
this is just going to make a circular
and finally outside of that we're just
going to go ahead and add the user name
this is going to be Rho dot user name
and we're almost done with our first
example here we just put the most recent
the that is the thirty-day value and
then the data for though dot all time
it's going to save that and I believe
assuming I don't have any syntax
mistakes we should see the first output
a date it's not going to be super clean
or anything but you can see right here
we have our data nothing's jumping
around now it should be styled oh so one
thing this took me forever to realize so
I'm hopefully you guys are still
watching the video is a you you're only
importing the components with react
bootstrap if you actually want to to use
the stylings you have to go ahead and
link to that and it doesn't actually
come with the module they just prefer
that you use the latest one so go ahead
and take a link tag and throw it into
the header I'm going to pull this up
here so in your index dot HTML file
that's in your public folder
go ahead and copy and paste the latest
version into your react application that
will give us the styling that we want
right here so we'll close this and this
should be much better now so cool so you
see we have this very nice little hover
effect and it's looking much cleaner
than it was before
you can see as we go might be hard to
see with everything that's there I might
just leave it like this for the video so
I actually think it looks better than
the awful styling I put on it so make
sure you add the bootstrap now let's get
back down to the logic forget about how
it looks for the time being
we are going to accept here let's go
ahead and app add container so that I
hate I hate that goes to the end so
we'll add the container which will bring
everything in right so that's good all
right so we have one all we have to do
to copy this for the other is because
it's the arrays are designed the same
you just want to go ahead and control
see this and it's a top 100 days we
actually want it to be top 100 all times
now the problem with this is is
obviously it's going to output both
right we're going to have a 1 to 100 and
then we're going to have a 1 to 100
again with different values of data we
don't want to both the show at the same
time easy enough fix we're going to use
the state and we're going to create a
basic true/false variable here in this
case I believe I called it current yeah
and we're going to set current initially
to true
and what we're going to do is when you
click it when you click one of the
column names it's going to set it to
true or false we're going to define a
function here called point change not
the best name I was really suckin on
name and things when I did this project
guys I'll be honest with you and it's
going to take in a value and in here
it's going to check to see if the values
of the same meaning if it's true there's
no reason to go and set it to true again
but if it's not go ahead and set it to
false we can go ahead and do a simple if
this dot state dot current it might do
the value that we're passing in will be
true or false is not equal to the value
go ahead and reset the state of current
so this dot set state what are we
setting and this it's going to be
current and set it equal to the value
now probably would have been cleaner
just just make this current say with
some text but it doesn't matter so
that's the point of this function now
all we're going to do here is in our
column in our heading we're going to go
ahead and create a on click event right
here so we're used on click set this
equal to and we're going to pass in the
callback function that's going to run
our event so here I say when the event
gets launched we run our callback
function and this is when I say this dot
point change so true is going to be
we're going to set it off by displaying
the recent one first
so point change true and then we're
going to go ahead and and the same
things I've put it for false for all
time now why are we doing this well
we're going to have it basically a
variable that says hey if this is true
display this array if this is false
display that array that's how we're
going to do it
and we're going to do that by just
clicking on here and having a go at now
next thing we want to do is change our
our values here ever so slightly so top
100 of all time just a current throw an
an basically if this is a true statement
so if current is equal to true go ahead
and wrap that it's going to display that
if this is true it will display what's
inside here now
excuse me we want this is the top all
hundred time this is going to be the
false one so if it's equal to false it
will display now if this is true it's
going to display this one just going to
save it and make sure that everything's
set up properly current is not defined
Oh remember when we deconstructed our
value here we never added current so
instead of saying this dot state current
we said current but I don't want to do
that so we're going to say current like
so cool so you'll see by default this
guy right here is displaying the top
thirty days but if we click here you'll
notice that it changed but we don't have
anything showcasing that all we're going
to do is have a little caret that shows
up based on which one is being displayed
this is why we installed font awesome
Daioh icons which coincidentally it's
the number one kickstarter software
kickstarter of all time raising like a
1.1 million dollars it did video about I
encourage you guys to watch it's very
inspiring all right so how do we use
that if you're not familiar with font
awesome and how we're going to do this
we're gonna do it exactly how we did
this for just going to throw essentially
an if statement in there and display an
icon if it's true or if it's false right
here we're just going to put a little
space and we're say cur it so if it's
true
which could be wrong we need our curly
braces my apologies if it's true we are
going to output I class name not class
right because we're working with react
and in here this is going to be fall fog
- carrot down - carrot - down and we'll
go ahead and copy this and instead of
true we just want it to be false right
it's going to save that oh and of course
we have to import that to our
application as well so all we have to do
