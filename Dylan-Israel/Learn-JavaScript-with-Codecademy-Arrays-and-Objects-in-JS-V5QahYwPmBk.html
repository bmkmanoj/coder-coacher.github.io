in objects in Jas under data structures
as you see I did this section and if
your notes in the past videos I recorded
some and the quality was bad so we're
gonna be working our way through it
again and so I'll be resetting the code
as we go so and this we're gonna be
asked to create an array so far we'll
call it gaming array we just call it
gaming I'll set that equal and we'll put
two values in it will make them string
so we'll put I'm actually playing Final
Fantasy 9 right now so Final Fantasy 9
and we'll put Breath of Fire 3 because I
think that'll be the next game I go and
play so let's go ahead and save it so
much
maybe see okay
so apparently I forgot how to declare an
array I think it's so what is it like
this okay fresh this take a look at our
previous code I think it's lost now
though hard languages I wonder why it
didn't work
alright let's go back to our first one
so our games
equal Oh with at least three elements
all right so we have Final Fantasy 9 so
we're declaring it correctly we just
weren't following the prompt correctly
so we files down c9 breath Breath of
Fire 3 and another RPG code in and we'll
just put the original so leave that like
that same assignment did you click
declare an array called list okay so
they we actually wanted to be nameless
so there's our list of games BAM
so we've declared our trait we haven't
done anything with it yet so log the
third element of languages of the
languages our age of the console so in
this case we want to rename this
languages you probably want to change
the values of this why do they okay
whatever we're changing the value here
so let's take our languages so here's
this it's a little weird cuz they
probably actually gave us that the only
issue is that we're redoing our code so
hard languages and we want to get the
third elements index so remember that
index starts at zero and not once so if
we want to get JavaScript which would
be the third item so third item we are
going to console dot log and then in
here we're gonna call languages and we
are going to ask for the second index
value cos 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 so the third item and
I believe I should work I'm sure you
spell languages all right BAM so there
we go or JavaScript so under your
existing code logs a number of elements
and languages so arrays have something
built in dot length and this will tell
us how many we have so we have five
values here it doesn't tell you the
index value so that if the max index
would be four zero one two three four
but this tells you that there's five
values in here all right so go ahead and
use a for loop to log each element of
languages so we'll do it like this so
four of our is equal to zero because we
spend x value starts at zero so you want
that's where you want to start we'll say
while I is less than languages dot
length so we max of 5 I plus plus and
then in here we want to just console dot
log the languages one time for each so
basically and then we're insert I I will
increase and that should print out each
one so we have all H down all the way to
Ruby
so we're going to create a heterogeneous
array called my array with at least
three elements first element should be a
number all right so heterogeneous or a
is basically an array that doesn't like
last array was just drinks this one is
going to have multiple types so far they
wanted to be named my rye so far my
array equals and the first element is a
number second element will put true and
the third element should be a string
just a string cheese I don't know why I
just ate some and bam so we didn't do
anything with it so we don't have an
output but it did however give us the
the it did take the data for the
heterogenous right so we'll be able to
do something with it so I'll create a
two dimensional array called new array
editor the way you want to look at
two-dimensional arrays are rows and
columns I guess it's the best way to
think of it
so they're basically an array of a race
is kind of what you want to do so we
should have three rows and three columns
containing any day that you like so
we're save our new array and just to be
make this simple because it does get
confusing we are going to in here have
three rows three columns
so there's that
and we'll just fit to two and then three
oh sorry and this should be three rows
all right so one two three row column I
think I have to add an additional value
here so let's see how did she put three
arrays inside new array yeah so wait I
think we need one more value here no
you're gross is this considered one row
oh okay
so let's go ahead Bam Bam see what
happens
Sousa reset our code so this is a two
dimensional array as two values so to go
for a three dimensional array oh you
know what I think maybe the comma there
we go alright so that was thrown off
make sure you have your comment in
between each array so they have three
rows and three columns each and you can
see three different arrays with three
values so we're good to go
I uh create a jagged array called jagged
you can place whatever you like in the
line requirements has at least two rows
alright so and the rows cannot be the
same length so a jagged array is a
multi-dimensional array like in the hand
here where they don't have the same
length so far jagged same way we've been
creating it and we'll just have one
color too and this needs to be in a
bigger array put a comma and then we can
another one yeah so we'll just put true
I believe that should work so cool so
one value different value even a
different value variable type and
different amounts so that's fine so in
this section it's just asking us to
reflect on well we've been messing with
before move on
so heterogeneous race meaning that you
can have different types of variables in
your array multi-dimensional arrays more
than one layer and jagan raised more
than one layer and they have different
values in terms of lengths and so you
could have two two values in the
dimensional multi-dimensional array and
then the second array in the multi
dimensional array could have three four
or one so let's keep it moving all right
we've seen right so this it just looks
like an example nouns verbs really see
objects so we are creating something
here oh we're create it looks like we're
creating an empty object we're then
giving it a name a number and creating a
function and then we are calling that
function on it and it should print out
calling this name at this number dot dot
dot
BAM all right so this is kind of our
first look at using objects and
JavaScript that section is coming up
pretty soon so using the above syntax as
a guide create an object me and the
editor
all right so we're gonna save our me
crouch Camilla they should have a name
key all right so we're gonna set this
equal to and then in here
barmy we're gonna actually we're gonna
leave that empty and then we're gonna
say actually that they don't want us
they wants to declare right away
so there is not let's go ahead and get
rid of this rock new set for me he's
gonna go suit X I should have a name key
so we'll say name and then we'll set it
to Pete's poker column and then I should
have a HP solenoid page this will be 27
okay save and submit do you create an
object using curly braces see
there we go all right so make sure you
use some sort of quotations for the
strings or a little mess of everything
let's go to reset this so recreate your
me object network but this time use the
object constructor once you make it use
either the brackets or the dot notation
given name property string value okay so
we'll say farmy equals and then we'll
say name and then we'll just put an
empty quote and then we'll put age and
we'll also put an empty quote and then
our person let's do that and then here
we'll say var me equals new person and
then in here we're gonna say me and that
name is equal to Dylan and then we'll
also do the age the other way so we'll
say mean dot age is equal to no no
quotes because this is a number 27 and
we can actually probably just heart
let's might be better just do it like
that even though it doesn't matter
because we're going to be overriding and
let's go ahead and say mr. Mac did you
create an object using the object
constructor I believe I did our person
so let's look at a hand here
um maybe I can straight up just declare
it my object our Dylan is not defined
okay so what's going on here is that the
way you declare an object it looks like
in JavaScript is we have to literally
save our me Eagles new object and then
when we say me equals name it can't get
it from this person class and go from
there so that's what it looks like is
happening and then rotors and prints out
the age for the me dot H let's try this
actually see if this is working
oops equals Dylan just go back so you
want to go back a section it really is
important to understand what it is
you're doing here so it may just be
consoling this out as a console dot log
once a me dot name and then we'll
console log in you got age semicolon
semicolon so yeah in theory it needs to
print out Dylan and age oh my god so
there goes okay so it's getting the
value of correctly so that's what you
want we want s4 so the next lesson so
let's go ahead and reset this so once
it's a create three objects called
object for an object to object three in
the editor so far our object one equals
and for the sake of this let's see if we
can just leave them empty and see what
happens
I mean that we may not be able to it
looks like an antiquey alright so we'll
say object 1 and we'll say name object 1
and then one day we'll give the same
type of key value for object 2 3 ok so
we were able to create three objects and
we just basically gave them default
values for their name a quick review
what objects are objects are kind of
like items item classes that you can
manipulate the you know the example is
person and then we created me which is
an object and then we borrowed from the
person class or reset the values for
standard things like name and age object
syntax we learned a little about that
and we learned how to create objects so
it may be a little bit difficult if
you're not familiar with objects or if
this year is your first time using
object-oriented but just practice
practice makes perfect when it comes to
this stuff and you'll get the hang of it
pretty quickly like creating a rake
we're gonna create an array again so far
my array I set that equal to its first
element should be a number so one is
second should be a built bonus it'll do
true and its third should be a string
and we'll say it is nope it's well we'll
just do my YouTube youtube.com slash
pizza 87 and then the last should be an
object you can add as many elements so
I'm just ill will say do we need to
declare a new object let's see how they
do it here
all right so we're gonna create it looks
like they want us to create an object
real quick and we'll say me and we'll
say VAR me it goes to object and we
don't need to add anything here
currently I don't believe so uh even
though this is a blank object it's okay
to submit that just in this example
obviously a blank object would have very
little to no purpose
all right make an array called new array
so are you alright I'm gonna set that
equal to should be two-dimensional so it
might be easier for you to set up your
two-dimensional array before you start
putting values and jagged the meaning
that they should have different lights
so we'll do one two I almost said it
wants ultimate kicker make
so we'll do meaning it so it not only
it's a jagged but we'll do our me equals
you object save and submit cool so a
little bit review I add a key called
interest to my object so here we want to
add something called interests and give
the key an array value it can be any
value you want all right so let's create
an array real quick
so so far in my array and we'll just set
will put one value in here you see equal
to true and that should work just fine
and so interest is equal to my array and
we want it to take in the zero index and
there's no comma after because it's the
last value did you give your interest
can't array value what state did they
not want us to use exactly what we're
using so in interest
okay that's correct
my array I had a key called interest to
my object give this key in a rave al you
can contain whatever you like let's see
if that is better okay so let's go ahead
and just take a quick look we're at
sixteen seventeen because I think this
or probably just have a little bit of a
syntax error here more than anything
else so far my array equals that try
adding one okay so we're going to go to
the Q&amp;amp;A forum and like at sixteen
seventeen so here are my array interest
equal oh so it looks like maybe they
want the whole array so let's see if
that's actually the case here okay so
that's what they wanted they didn't want
a specific value from the right they
just wanted the array and then let's
create our own object called my own
object so far my own object and we'll
just give it one property we'll set it
equal to O we're creating object object
and here we'll say
my own object also can we can we wonder
if we can declare it like this this
would be interesting it's actually I
don't think we can
so just refresh this page real quick so
in this case I just gave it a key value
that's all they really wanted so let's
go ahead and redo that so my object
equals theirs
we're doing it this way I keep on doing
it like we're creating the object when
we're actually creating the class
without creating insa so I want to say
name should be fine there's a problem
with through syntax so Michael object we
want to put it in here semicolon and
hold your name Dillon and that should be
good unexpected token okay so let's look
at our syntaxes obviously I'm brain dead
I can't figure this out let's see here
huh
maybe it's the double quotes so let's go
back here and I believe we've been doing
double quotes this whole time but let's
go ahead and just take this out and set
it to one see what happens it's a
problem with your syntax so are my own
object equals and we don't need it
interesting so let's go ahead and look
at another example see what's going on
here
no we just looked at this one
for some reason the Help section
sometimes it doesn't back always I don't
know I just
object rattling 17:17 get your own job
Churchill are my objects and sit like
that
and then we're gonna say let's try it
let's try declaring this object so we'll
say okay so I didn't work
oh don't name equals I'm doing this like
Java all right there we go
so a different way of doing it I'm not
quite sure what the issue was beforehand
but uh we'll create an object like that
and it will add a dot name for it so a
little bit of a first-hand look at
objects in JavaScript as you can see I'm
not too familiar with the objects in
JavaScript but uh we did okay I think so
let's see what we're up to next next up
we're going to be making a contact list
we'll be using more objects and calling
functions on them and going from there
so I will see you guys in the next video
and I was always constructive criticism
and anything you you want me to clarify
feel free to leave me a comment and such
suggestion down below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
