demand I finally got around to learning
some node nodejs
and we are going to start building out
some of these API projects starting with
the time stamp micro service now I'm not
I'm going to just be using my local
version just showcase this so if you
want to follow logging use the exact
same tools I'll go over that that's what
the point of this video is kind of a
part zero or introduction first thing
you're gonna have to do is install node
you can just go to node.js org download
the version and install there's no
tricks there's no gacho's you literally
just install and you're good to go
the next thing that I'm going to use for
an editor is Visual Studio code this
will be the text editor I'm using so if
you really want to follow along to the T
that's the text editor and one of the
resources I'll be using as well is
postman you can download a postman by
just typing in postman Chrome and it'll
take you to the page you get to the web
store it's it treats it as a Chrome
extension and then basically what this
will be used to send send URLs and test
things but I don't worry too much about
that right now
but those are the few things that you're
gonna need to get started and most
importantly of all you're gonna need to
have your essential oil diffuser going
at all times to keep you on track but
now that's all we're gonna need to get
our project started let's go ahead and
jump into the first one the time stamp
microservice hey guys thanks for
watching the video if you're interested
