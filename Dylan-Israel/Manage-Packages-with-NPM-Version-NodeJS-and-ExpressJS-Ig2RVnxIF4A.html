back in manage packages with NPM we just
did publish and now we are going to do
version so go ahead and open up that and
get to your version section so we're in
version there's a lot of information
here about version it's all pretty
important so as we update our our
packages there's going to be different
versions and the the TL DR version I
like the fact that they did this this is
more my style if you don't know TL DR
means it means too long didn't read so
they this is this is a good model tab so
the basic rundown is that there's
basically three things the first one is
the most important it's a major version
update for breaking API changes the next
one is the minor version for maybe
update to API editions and then patch
version which is just an update to how
things work basically or update to for
every change so kind of goes the order
of importance right so NPM has a special
command called NPM version which will
update our package JSON file and commit
it and also commit to change that we
learn more about going to NPM help
version now I did this earlier there's a
ton of information here and i encourage
you to on your own time to go ahead and
check that out it's not something i'm
going to do for this video just because
there's so much going on there and it's
so overwhelming i'm more of a let's just
jump in and see what we can do um so we
also can update our package JSON version
by jumping to two-and-a-half version on
here yeah here's version we go in here
and just manually update it as we've
done with so few other things so let's
go ahead and do it first we're gonna do
NPM version was that it right to the
command
so much text where is the own this is
from something called December or a
semantic version i think it was npm yeah
mpm version there we go so now it will
go ahead and update everything according
lee and we can go ahead and you see we
still have one point 0 point 0 and we
are now going to verify that we did
everything correctly how to NPM verify
version is still one point oh all right
so what did it want us to do so we can't
actually oh ok so the NPM registry won't
let us do unless we update the version
number so let's go ahead and open our
package like JSON and we'll say we just
did a minor update and went up to 1
point 0 point 1 and now when we do in
p.m. version well you'll see that it's
now updated properly right here and now
we can complete this challenge to verify
cool so things take away about
versioning is how the how what this
number actually means which by the way
is something that I always wondered like
how do we decide about this and I've
seen these before and I'm glad to see
that there's actually the December
semantic version if you want to know
more about it go to cember org um but I
just kind of understand that when you
release a new version you need to change
the version number or else it won't let
you release it to using NPM but as
always guys don't forget to Like
subscribe and share and I will see you
in the next video support me on patreon
and thanks you who do I'll see you guys
next time special thanks to our sponsor
dev mountain if you're interested in
coding boot camp why don't you check
them out where they include housing
alongside their tuition so you can get
up go and immerse yourself in the
environment if you want to support me go
