are back in solo learn JavaScript doing
objects let's go in and jump right in
introducing objects objects you can see
you have a variable and you start adding
key value pairs here to kind of describe
that variable if you will kind of like a
JSON so in reference to object color
might wait now name examples are all
examples of properties we are also can
set things using dot or bracket notation
so what bills are probably is used to
count the number of characters and a
character's property dot length glasses
are a little dirty an object method is a
property that can finds a that contains
a function definition okay so it's
basically a function what access the
color property of the hair object so I'd
be here dot color that's how you
actually you can also access it
oh well that's what the dot syntax you
also use the bracket notation but dock
for the for the dot let me go ahead and
move this chat back down actually I'm
already looking it's gonna move this
back down to the rightful place to its
rightful home now let's go ahead and
move this guy Center actually yeah hey
dims life is the 365-day coding life
challenge boys don't likes to create a
constructor function so this dot title
is equal to title and this sought
director is to equal the director a
constructor is where you basically set
up an object and you have to construct
it firsthand so when you do create a
movie it knows that the title parameter
you're passing in is a title and the
director parameter you're passing is a
director
they might be getting some new glasses
soon from my favorite site Warby Parker
great site to get glasses
not that I'm sponsored or anything cuz
I'm not although I wish they would send
me some free glasses some cheap what
keyword is used for creating the
instance of an object so new when you
create a new version of an object you
let it know that the new keyword you see
right here VAR John is equal to new
person John 25 and we have the
constructor above it to say what it is
that we're creating which two components
are necessary in order to use
information contained within an object
so objects name
properties name constructor functions
name no I think it's asking when you
create it there we go
object initialization so you can by
default just immediately start creating
it I'm so Simba oh sorry I got
distracted here yeah it's just something
to put the brackets in here so you're
you're setting up an object and when
dealing with objects JSON objects in
general you need to where's my phone
dinging Facebook Messenger is telling me
Happy New Year's well Happy New Year's
you Facebook and dear Mark Zuckerberg
yeah so um spaces and line breaks aren't
important but it's a great way of
breaking up your code so if we wanted to
document outright the simba the object
with the category property we'd do it
like so does category there we go
please the following expression is
slicing this object property oh it's
category and they don't have the bracket
at the end there we go uh the monstercat
license so the monstercat license is for
two years once we get I think no no
excuse me it's it's it's good for a
lifetime that's that's uh that's how
long the monstercat license is alright
literary methods so methods are
basically functions within your
constructor that you can inherit this
keep wearing the method means the name
of the given the current object there
you go
methods can also define the functions
outside of the construction constructor
and associate it with the object this
dot you're a birth is equal to born year
born year here is a function return 2016
- this dot age okay seems simple enough
please associate the test data
constructor this is our constructor with
the method called my method so we have
my method and notice how we don't
actually have to call it with the
bracket so if we call it with the Brat
air with the brackets the because the
curler things anyhow these things it's
actually going to call the function
we actually just want to pass the
function in which is why we do it like
that call the method as usual all right
in order to use objects property within
a function use we're going to use the
objects property within a function use
the VAR keyword uses this use the
function same no alright let's go back
and review real quick then
this is not the functions name that
we're calling call the method by the
property name you're starting a
constructor rather than the functioning
oh whoops property name what huh
let's go call the method by the property
name in the constructor function rather
than the function name so what we're
doing
we already did this in order to use the
object's property within a function you
need to use no sounds of our keyword
said this keyword I guess I don't
understand the question
yeah it's for a lifetime the monstercat
license anyhow and objects properties
are similar to variables methods are
similar to functions cool
what is the result of the following
expression
my string dot length so length will
count how many characters there are in
this case it is six cool and then
complete the expression create an object
constructor taking them to account that
height and weight are properties and
calculate is a method for the given
object so this stuff height is equal to
the height of the constructor that we're
passing same thing was wait and then
this a simple calc is equal to Cal Q
lake which is the function that we're
passing in nice so that was objects I
hope you guys enjoyed this we still
build a little bit there I do pass
through this pretty fast so sometimes
you may want to pause the scan and
hopefully you have a better
understanding I like to kind of cruise
by these things I don't do too much
object-oriented JavaScript in all
honesty so some of this stuff's a little
bit of a refresher which is good but as
always guys don't forget to comment like
subscribe and share the video and
support me on patreon comm slash coding
tutorials 360 and don't forget to look
forward to our weekly Friday interviews
on behind the code where we interview
software developers designers anybody in
the tech or software space and we ask
them questions and as always asked to
answer your questions at the end so
thanks for watching I'll see you guys in
the next video special thanks to our
sponsor dev Mountain if you're
interested in coding bootcamp why don't
you check them out where they include
housing alongside their tuition so you
can get up go and immerse yourself in
the environment if you want to support
me go over to patreon.com slash coding
tutorials 360 so we can put out more
content thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
