hours it's like the young one goes in
for the kill the eldest feigns death
goes through the jug not quite sure
if they are playing or getting is
getting real suddenly Achilles the black
cat get surprised by the outdoor noise
but only for a moment or he jumps back
in on Tito this is then seized the most
right but he's caught let's get back
into codeine yes I just wanted to wish
everybody a happy holiday hope you
enjoyed the black semi blooper of me
just getting distracted from coding with
the cats if you're a younger coder a
younger person in the software grind
you're probably out getting candy and if
you're an older coder you might be doing
the same thing or you might be handing
it out or you might be taking your kids
around to do it either way have a happy
halloween in terms of what's going on
with me in my life try and do a little
bit more vlogs every now and getting
proval one every two weeks this is my
third week officially of being a web
engineer learning lots of stuff lots of
great angular getting much much better
it's amazing how you just spend hours
upon hours you just feel start
skyrocketing so I'm getting much better
at angular I'm very excited about that
another thing is i started doing jasmine
and karma unit testing so i'm doing
testing as well which is great if I ever
decide to go down the QA route but it's
also great to just have additional
skills that will make you more valuable
which is a something that I really
appreciate about my jobs as far as they
really want us to do a lot and so that's
a good thing I'm excited by that excited
to see the finished product as well it's
going to be interesting to actually make
something that someone's gonna pay for
which is awesome but yeah learning lots
of great stuff what you can look forward
to in terms of the channel is a more
angular content
redoing a lot of the free code camp
projects in angular I'm trying to decide
if I want to release them for free or if
I want to make a course out of it I'm
trying to raise money to buy a 4k
monitor and a graphics card that can
handle that for the channel so that our
future content can be in 4k I'm also
kind of running out of things to do
there's a few things left to do on free
code camp I'll be re working through the
updated codecademy courses as they come
out the introduction are learning HTML
section they just did part 1 and i also
just did the react part 1 and i also
just did the HTML LCS part 1 which
should have just started coming out in
terms of what's coming out in the future
as of right now tomorrow you'll have a
cool interview with simple programmer we
it's about 30 minute interview of us
just shooting the and get a lot of
cool information about how to actually
get a job in in software if you're
trying to break in and you don't have
any experience so that seems to be the
real barrier of entry and we talked
about that we talked about a lot of cool
things look forward to that I really
enjoyed doing the interviews once I get
situated in my new apartment which I'll
move into about two weeks after the time
this video comes out I'll have a quite a
few interviews planned one with Quincy
Larson so what we get out would be
talking with the man the myth the legend
himself who by the way put us in one of
his Korra pieces as one of the YouTube
channels to learn programming from we
got a nice describer bump so welcome to
you who may have came here from there so
I hope you enjoy the content but yeah so
keep out keep an eye out for stuff and
happy Halloween and if you're if you're
going out to party or if you're just
