what to expect when moving across
country and I thought it's about time I
released the blog version which is
essentially me traveling across country
car all packed up and just kind of
narrating my adventure over the 2,500
miles I drove and seven or eight states
and before we get started I'll just show
you some of the the highlight of the
trip for me was just taking pictures in
front of the like every time you enter a
new state you know this is Texas for
instance I just got I would stop in
every state that I saw the hey welcome
to Texas welcome to Louisiana welcome to
New Mexico and doing this you can see
how tired I am in here but I was real
quick pulled over took a took a little
quick quick stop and went from there but
yeah hope you guys enjoy it I hope you
guys like it I don't do too many vlogs
but I thought maybe some some of you
would like to see what kind of it was
like for me to drive across country so I
hope you guys enjoy
alright guys is day one I am just
leaving Long Beach right now for we're
hoping to go about 900 miles a day and
yeah just getting ready hit the road
last day of work was yesterday plan is
to get there Friday I'm 12 hours a day
driving about 900 miles a day know it's
gonna be a mission we'll do it all right
if I ever if I ever needed a reminder as
to why la drives me so insane I think
the fact that I'm leaving for 36 hours
of driving and I've had nothing but
bumper-to-bumper traffic this
whole time is a pretty good example so
I'm just gonna play back this clip to me
if I ever think Ola wasn't that bad
and we remember that it took me an hour
just to get out of La all right
Captain's Log it's day one 200 miles in
I'm now on a stretch of road known as
the desert
we've had critical failure of the radio
which is now displayed only static and a
really awful mariachi slash cowboy music
depending on the station even worse so
it's not coming in clear Spotify is now
not working as I cannot get a signal
there's roughly 22 star days
or him
gruffly
there's roughly
there's roughly 33 star hours left on
this voyage
how will I arrive when will the radio
comeback
where will we stop to refuel and give
food find out in the next episode of
Dragon Ball Z Sardi
11:36 galactic standard yes Tita we've
just entered into a our five six seven
commonly known as Arizona there is still
nothing but desert among us
we'll survive we will thrive we will
need to find gas and food shortly
keeping an eye out for the next rest
stop
Captain's Log
is now 27 Pacific Standard lactic
our speed has increased - it suggested
speed limit of 75 miles per hour we all
know the Galactic police will allow you
up to ten miles over the speed limit
speed suggestion I mean before they will
take it you and they will take it you as
I've seen numerous cars pulled over
receiving tickets we are about 50 miles
from the birthplace the home of the
motherland of grandparents Phoenix
Arizona my grandmother lives there
fortunately due to restrictions of
time-space continuum we won't be able to
stop by and say hi we are now roughly
300 miles my ears my ears into our trip
our voyage which is roughly 12% complete
it's depressing much more to go shoot
your locks coming soon all right guys
stardate 520 PST Captain's Log we have
just entered into N and three to nine
seven one one 3xy commonly known as new
mexico the holy call I knew it looks
like the green part of Arizona no more
rain
just keepin a move in though we're about
620 miles of my thousand mile goal I've
been on the road since 7:00 a.m. it's
about 5:20 I think I'll get a thousand
around 11 p.m. or midnight so hopefully
we can do that keep it moving is now we
are now Captain's Log nearing TX one to
five
commonly known as Texas as you can see
it is extremely dark
we are 740 miles into our journey it is
7:00 a.m. 7:00 p.m. PST and we still
have like 1800 miles ago
damn it's been fun
a little bit tiring to get this light
off you know Spotify hasn't been working
so we've been listening what's on the
radio which unfortunately seems to be a
Britney Spears marathon at the current
moment
just keeping things going damn happens
long day - I'm exhausted
there is a mutiny overnight but we
managed to maintain control
currently leaving the very firm in Texas
we're actually down in ours now Florist
showing the amount of days and our just
taking now we're down to hours infinite
so they have 23 hours and like 15
minutes to st. Petersburg Florida
gonna keep it moving today it's going to
primarily just be going through Texas so
big that it's gonna from coast to coast
therefore border to border of Texas is
going to take 13 hours but we did about
150 miles in Texas last night so it's
probably going to be around 11 hours
maybe around there so let's see a lot of
Texas one of the cooler things that I've
seen are these flats are all over in
Texas or it's just like flat hills and
flat tops I'm not sure why they're flat
but they're very interesting looking
captain song we are halfway through our
voyage
we are currently still in TX one two
three
commonly known as Texas because it's
huge as we are 18 hours in with 18
hours to go the home stretch I think now
it's gonna be a little bit yesterday we
did 15 hours of total driving we're
gonna try and do the same today and then
try and try and do a shorter day would
still like probably about eight hours of
driving Friday so let's get back to it
again we are and the Louisiana finally
is about 5:20 PST or roughly about 708
whatever times that I'm in now we've
done a 732 miles today I believe we have
about twelve and a half hours left I'm
driving if we're gonna continue on to
st. Petersburg Florida as of right now I
am going to go for a couple more hours
and try and get this down to about an
eight-hour drive tomorrow I hope will
say to me I might come out but uh lots
interest interesting stuff thus far I
really like Texas 80 miles of 80 mile
per hour our freeways is really dope and
then there's also in like California New
Mexico and Arizona there's always cops
hiding trying to give tickets and I saw
a ton of people getting tickets I didn't
see that in the like thousand plus miles
and I drove throughout
so definitely one of the cooler things I
couldn't just spend my experience but it
is nice to see that you know people
aren't laying in wait trying to take it
you for stupid as you're trying to
travel so yeah it's uh back in Louisiana
just was here recently for New Orleans
I flew in though I'm gonna see a little
bit more of the state I liked what I saw
last time is very green as you may be
able to see here a lot of marshes and
things like that but uh I'm gonna keep
on driving
high voice the end of day two it's
coming to an end right now we were about
to pull up to the most fancy galactic
establishment that there is we are
currently in Louisiana or Alex one two
three whatever you want to call it the
Motel six very fancy
gonna get a couple hours rest a hot
shower clean up then back to the road
for the last 600 or so miles we did 980
miles today I've say pretty close to our
thousand mile goal yeah today now it's
about 11 11 p.m. over here whatever time
zone we're in so hopefully we have about
nine hours and a half hours of driving
to do and then we are at the new home
location of st. Petersburg Florida
looking forward to it man don't ever
forget the grime guys Lou this this is
what the fine establishment of the motel
6 you don't even get a bathtub you get
BAM a shower Captain's Log day 3
there are only five miles into the trip
and we are actually in Mississippi we
spent the night in Louisiana now we are
in Mississippi we have about nine hours
of driving ahead of us
assuming of into a hectic travel ahead
of us and then we're there and the real
fun means I'm very green you know we're
definitely far from California of this
much green just like the farther east
coast I've gotten this just got a
greener greener and drier and drier on
the west coast let's go oh yeah stayed
in the world's worst motel 6
they didn't even provide shampoo shame
on them or Wi-Fi those cheap bastards
so no Wi-Fi last night and I went to bed
for nearly and no shampoo and so my
luscious locks will remain dirty not
wash it with soap it's are a cheap very
cheap it back to the room free
but we got you know we're in some
different we got marshes and like
bodies of water over there
all right so we have just entered
Alabama only about 80 miles from
entering the Louisiana
I wonder if or I actually didn't look at
a map I'm not quite sure what states
were hitting so it's always a nice
little surprise when the GPS says
welcome to Alabama all right cool
all in all it looks the same as
Louisiana in terms of the 10 freeway it
was kind of cool passing over a bunch of
marshes and rivers I'm a couple of
bridges on the way here has it right now
still have about 550 miles to go which
is roughly about eight hours of driving
did the home stretch plant in Alabama
I'm gonna see what's one wonder what's a
1x
cavitus log day 3 we have just
penetrated country it's a weird for twos
right now FX 1 2 3
commonly known as Florida we are just
seven hours away we're just entering
Florida however however my job isn't so
important so we got a bit to go we're
driving another 500 miles but we are in
the correct state so that is half the
battle make sure we arrive some correct
place so far looks down the same is
Alabama a little less water
no marshes and stuff like that but we'll
find out what Florida has the offer is
we have about seven hours to drive
through it and see some things so let's
keep it moving
