freelancing you guys liked it so much I
thought I would have a second video
where my roommate Dolan gives you his
take on freelancing as a full-stack Wix
developer I think it's gonna be a fun
interesting video and very enlightening
so on so on we go Dylan says you got to
record a video don't
some of you may be thinking Dolan it's
running behind schedule Dolan runs his
own time he goes for everyone
you may be wondering don't long I
thought you just woke up how you look so
good
how's your hair so clean Dolan's always
ready to go you never know when that
money is gonna be she's knocking on door
long's door bell on thought he left you
with enough knowledge last time when
he's telling about how to do that full
stack wicks development life apparently
Dylan said you needed some more help
just at Dylan's that Dolan I need you I
need you to teach them how to freelance
doll huh Dolan's gonna teach you you're
gonna learn today step one of Dolan's
tips to freelancing much like real
estate it's all about location let's go
ahead and check out the location where
stars are made the freelance stars so
Dolan legally can't go into Starbucks
anymore
so the next thing that you need to
understand when you go into a Starbucks
is to let them know your web developer
how you do that best way this would be
an Apple shell so what you can do
because chances are you ain't got money
for a Mac quite yet
you can take some old headphones like so
they're not going to be working any more
with your iPhone anyhow
I so Dolan just got a new update to his
iPhone it overheats now but battery's
gonna last forever I know he's so
amazing I love you so much I appreciate
you looking out for Dolan like that so
you take you can take some headphones
and you just cut them because they're so
the new iPhones are so advanced that
they got rid of all your old shit you
just cut them like so now now and you
ain't got monkey you ain't got you want
to be an Apple shill but you ain't got
the money to be an Apple show because
you're just starting out freelancing so
you ain't got you don't have the money
quite yet you get those Apple air pots
the air stands for air head for spending
$200 on such an ugly thing but what you
can do with those old useless headphones
just go ahead and make your own and just
continue to show everyone there that you
know what you're doing some of you may
be wondering Dolan how come you didn't
go up go into the Starbucks and show us
how to search their environment down
make sure that we're at the same level
as Dylan well don't long last time we
was there may or may not have gotten
banned Bob bish smack in that WordPress
developer Dolan hit him with the Wix
life had to go establishes dominance now
don't want no longer can go into
Starbucks now that Dolan shown you where
the phones gone you may have thought
that Dolan didn't mean to get a phone
call that's actually some of that
freelance money coming in right now
Dolan had to ignore it cuz that's what
the first step is here on how to seal
the deal with that client let me tell
you it's just like dating you probably
don't even know what the meaning a
dating is Dolan and team in there
getting it done all right
dating all right now what I mean by
dating was that me
was it really mean well much like dating
you ain't supposed to call for the first
three days Dolan does seven
much like dating you gotta you gotta
keep the the hand strong you know I'm
saying you got to keep your options open
so when those clients call you say hey
don't lie don't know we heard you were
the Wix god don't lie
don't says you heard right but Dolan
ain't telling you that for a week you
got to wait the reason for it is you
want the desperate clients the clients
that ain't got no one else those are the
ones you're gonna give you money whether
they should or shouldn't all right then
that's how you're gonna build up your
customer base you're gonna get the worst
and the cheapest but you're gonna get
the most desperate and that's the secret
to freelancing as a Wix developer they
ain't gonna know any better
they ain't gonna expect shit no one else
wants to deal with them Dolan will deal
with them Dolan take your money
Dolan give you that that full stack
wicks life you say that you say that hey
dogs a little busy I call you back in a
week all right
some of you baby AC saying don't long
what about portfolio what about showing
the clients what they need aren't going
to talk about that Dolan doesn't want
any clients that don't believe in Dolan
like Dola believes in himself if they
need to see proof of Dolan skill they
aren't the client for Dolan all right I
don't need them in my life
they're not gonna understand dolana them
and that can get along very well let me
tell you people who don't get along with
Dolan don't last very long doe long they
don't last very doe long and last but
not least you promise things you can't
deliver because Dolan gets half his
money upfront
don't let may not get the other half but
you got that first half and don't lawns
happy with that right don't go back to
that couch Dylan's got a nice couch you
saw it earlier
Dunn just upgraded from a futon to a
couch
now he doesn't need all that money
that's a comfy couch Dolan's gonna be
sleeping on it tonight tomorrow as long
as he has that couch that first half all
he need so you tell them what you want
to hear much like dating a girl yeah
yeah don't lawns looking to get married
have some kids pop out little little D
Dolan's do a little Dolan jr. little
don't lon jr. just a second all right
so you tell those clients what they want
to hear and get that help front money
that first half don't deliver anything
in the second half
it isn't about repeat business y'all
it's about that one and done just like
dating
just like Dolan see you later
so you may be thinking Dolan's put on a
little weight when you a boss like go
along you just stack gains Dolan stack
