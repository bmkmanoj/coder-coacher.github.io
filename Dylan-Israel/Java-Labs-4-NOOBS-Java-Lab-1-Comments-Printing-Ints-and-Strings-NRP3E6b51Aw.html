when I was trying to learn how to code
before I was actually a CS major was
trying to find stuff that wasn't just a
very specific example I wanted a full
lab done and so that's what the the
purpose of these youtube videos are
gonna be they're gonna be entire labs
taken from actual college cs courses in
java and i got approval through my
instructor to use his labs and
everything in design so we're gonna
start off very basic in each lab and
each one's gonna get progressively
harder so it may go a little fast it may
be short in the beginning but that's
because i mean these are the basics and
you have to build off the basics and go
from there so i'll show you the lab
right now that we're about to do and
we'll go we'll go we'll go on there to
code go on to code from there so here is
this so basically this this lab is it's
it's about learning how to use comments
and your code it's very important
because it will allow you to put stuff
in there that you don't want the
compiler to read so that you can come
back and be like you're gonna look at
your code a year from now be like slash
slash comment that's what it does so
we're gonna learn how to put comments in
there by putting your name in there a
multi-line comment we're going to learn
multiple variables in Stanford integer
we're gonna learn strings as well which
is a text variable and doubles which is
a another variable which stores decimal
places like three point nine five and
then we're gonna learn how to print it
out so here we go guys we're star
necklace I just named it basic lab one
the first thing you really have to know
is that you need kind of a starting line
what I mean by that is basically every
every program you you use just gonna
have a main method that's your starting
line and the main method always has the
same thing name is public static void
main string args it may sound a little
confusing I remember being like what is
all this all about
and don't don't really worry about it
right now just think of it as your
starting line this is where we're gonna
do the bulk of our coding early on and
a little tip because you're gonna start
typing stuff out it's gonna look on for
me if you hold ctrl shift F it'll
actually format what's out there so the
first thing the instruction said is to
put a comment with our name in it so we
need to know how to do that so double
slash will give us our comments so you
know my name is Leroy Jenkins so that's
just a comment that's just so when you
go back you can see that the name is now
we want to do a multiple you see when I
go down here it's not green anymore
that's means no longer our comment so
that's a one-line comment so a multiple
line comment for when you have a lot of
stuff to say you do a slash asterisk and
then an asterisk slash and so this is
multi-line comment okay so that's how we
learn to calm it's pretty basic stuff so
the next thing it asked was for us to
create an age variable now in this
example we're just going to create it in
our main method here a public static
moines may avoid main string args this
is our start line so this is basically
everything runs from here so we're just
going to say int age and what that did
was it created an int that this is your
type your int is your type and the age
is the name and then we're just going to
set it age equals 26 and put the
semicolon at the end to end it it's our
no sign we could also have set it let's
go back to our comments like this int
age equals 26 and one line so just a
just a little note so next it wanted us
to create a double another type but that
remember it's double and we'll set it
that way so double GPA equals three
point one so am i calling to end it so
there's that last but not least we're
gonna create a string a string it's
gonna be a little bit different just
because a string is eight it's basically
text it's like you're stringing letters
together so I
right so for our name and the difference
here is you're gonna actually win it
when it comes to text ninety-nine
percent of the time we're gonna put
quotes in there just so that you just so
they knows it's actual text similar to
how we comment it out so we'll put for a
name Leroy Jenkins and there's that so
okay we have our age very well we've
learned how to comment stuff and multi
comm multi-line comments and we have our
age and we have our GPA and now we need
to string it together so this is how
we're gonna print this is how you print
something out system dot out dot print
we're gonna have our parentheses here
and then right here there's a couple
things we're gonna string it all
together a little bit so we have our
name variable so we're gonna say we're
gonna type put some text in there first
my name and remember the quotes is and
we're gonna put a space at the end here
so that it formats correctly because if
we didn't put a space at the end it
would put my name is Leroy would be all
one word and that's not what we want so
next we're gonna add our name so now
this says my name is Leroy Jenkins and
then we're gonna add again we want to
say okay we want we want a space in
there because we don't want Jenkins to
continue on with that so we're gonna put
a space in between our our parentheses
here or quotations rather and my name is
Leroy Jenkins and oops sorry about the
caps and my GPA is and then ran where
another space plus duh
GPA that's our very that's our double
variable and then we're gonna do another
plus and we're gonna say another space
and I'm plus
we're going to call our age here plus
years old period so sorry with it so
system dot out dot print my name is plus
our name variable Leroy Jenkins plus and
my GPA is plus our GPA variable three
point one plus and I'm our age variable
which is ant 26 years old so when we
save it and then remember control shift
F will format it automatically so it's a
little bit clearer like that we're gonna
go run run and then right down here my
name is Leroy Jenkins and my GPA is
three point one and I'm 26 years old so
I'll have this slab there up on my
YouTube comments page just right there
but also have a similar lab the exact
same lab pretty much and in here I'll
have lines you can see the comments here
are significantly greater and this goes
into a little bit more detail on how
this is gonna work and why we did the
things we did and so this may be helpful
for people are a little bit struggling
on it so I hope that you guys enjoyed
this video and I'll I'll do my best to
have a second labs they're gonna go
pretty quick I'm going to knock them out
about one every five days so make sure
you subscribe and see you in the second
