camps from a responsive web design and
starting applied visual design let's
jump right in
visual design is and what I was just
thinking this is a very broad topic
basically we're gonna be talking about
color theory animation we're basically
going to talk about how to make our web
page cool and functional it's kind of
the gist of it so creating visual
balance using using the text align
property now what text align does is
let's go ahead and run this real quick
so what we want to do with text line is
we want to Center our h4 tag so let's go
ahead and find our h4 tag to set it to
center so it looks like we have it right
here so we're gonna use text - align and
we'll undo center let's go ahead and run
that real quick so we can change so see
right here now our Google text just
centered itself you also can set it to
justify and let's see what they wants to
do here so your code should use the text
aligned property on the P tag to set it
to justify so let's go ahead and do the
same thing here text - align justify
there we go and finally we want to add
the now justify I'm not too familiar
with I'll have to review that it doesn't
look like I tell us what it does too
much it looks like it spreads it out a
little bit so that everything's evenly
spaced and it goes down to the end of
the line more or less so finally our 8x
which it looks like the by accessing the
class links so we have it we have to go
ahead and create our alright the class
is created here links we want to set it
to less so basically we want all our
anchor tags to float to the left pretty
straightforward and we're gonna use the
text-align:left for that cool so
basically what we need to take away is
that you need to be able to to have your
text flow and in the list to the left to
the right to the center or just kind of
cover it evenly all right you can also
specify the width of an element your
code changed the width property of the
car to 245 pixels using the full card
class selector so we talked about width
before see our full card here instead
we're going to do two 45px now when we
run our tests up the width property
your coach should change to the Blitz
property of the card to 245 pixels by
using the full card class selector so
what is the problem let's reset this
real quick we're gonna clear the code
and in here we're gonna set with 240 5px
now we're gonna run it
you know let me try zooming out real
quick and see if that helps there we go
so sometimes what happens with this with
your sizing is when you zoom in I think
it kind of it messes with the the CSS a
little bit because it's probably
detecting it on the page at a hundred
percent zoomed in now we're gonna go
ahead and do the same thing for the
height so you can actually set the
height of these as well so let's go
ahead and see the before and after and
I'm not going to zoom in till after here
we've said this to 40px to run our tests
you'll see the height of it now notice
that the font doesn't the font size
doesn't change but the height of the
element does that's why we have a larger
gap right here right now so we're gonna
go ahead and change this back to 25
pixels because this is way too much
height for that right so you kinda need
to play around I kind of like that they
throw that in there because we CSS a lot
of it is I don't want say guess in check
but you want to see it and then you want
to see how it affects the other elements
and it's it's easy to kind of visualize
this stuff but it's easy to think you
can visualize I should say but in
reality it's always best to kind of see
it and then make adjustments so the
strong tag is basically bolt makes
things bold that's all it does and we're
gonna go ahead and wrap our strong tag
around the P here now there's other ways
to do this but right now we are uh-oh
strong tags should be inside Stanford
University so we are looking for
Stanford University and notice how you
can you can wrap these around individual
words as we're about to do with Stanford
University so we're gonna do it strong
we zoom in one more there we go and
you'll see that now Stanford University
is is bold
now you can do the same thing with
underline by just using the u tag we're
gonna do that on the pH PhD students so
using the u tag like so we can now
underline pH PhD excuse me okay I think
it's a pH P students your code should
have an M tag so M is to emphasize the
text so now we can underline text we can
bold it and we can emphasize it which if
I remember correctly basically means it
makes it slanted that's all it all it
does so we want to wrap around the P tag
so now we're gonna do we're gonna have
the entire paragraph tag nested within
the EM tag and when we run it you'll
notice that all the tell the LD
paragraph text is now slanted now I
don't know what the del tag is so let's
listen let's hang out for a second just
oh it's the strikethrough text I dunno
what this is so you can also apply this
in your CSS using text decoration - line
through however if you wanted to use do
it as a text element as a HTML element
appears that you can do this as well so
we're going to put a line through
include the word alphabet and the h4 tag
alright so we're gonna say Google
alphabet
and we are also going to go ahead and
we're gonna strike out Google is that
right so basically del you'll think
delete right that's kind of the idea
behind it and now you'll see that Google
is straight strike through in in there
as well
and again if you don't know this is one
of free Co camps dark settings I you can
go into settings and change it as well I
personally prefer the dark setting it's
kind of easier on my eyes than the white
but it is a preference thing so it's all
the same code all the same exercises and
everything but don't be thrown off that
it is a it is the dark mode I guess
which is really cool by the way cuz I
don't know about you guys but as a
developer the first thing I really do is
get my IDE set up for my texts that are
set up to be in dark mode and to look to
kind of to kind of look and feel better
for me cuz if it makes me less tired or
it's easier for me to see things it's
easier for me to see my syntax mistakes
it's easier for me to see my code I
think it's it's worth taking the extra
five or ten minutes to do it but yeah
that's not adhering over that so the HR
tag is basically a horizontal rule it's
a line that goes from left to right
right horizontally so what we want to do
is have this H arktech between the title
and our paragraph so we're gonna do
throw a simple HR tag notice how we
don't have a slash on it no not needed
and you'll see that we now have this
little line here now we're going to be
talking about RGBA so in the basic CSS
we talked about hex colors we talked
about RGB and we talked about just
putting a word value in there RGB a
sensor red green blue and alpha that
alpha is our opacity so if we want to
make our color partly see-through we can
do that with relative ease as well so
what we're going to do is for our h4
class
which do we have an H for in here no we
don't your code should add a background
property so we know how to add stuff to
the page or to our CSS so H for we're
gonna set the RGB a red green blue to 45
45 45 and then we're gonna put Point C
and notice how I put 0.1 it's always
going to be somewhere between zero and
one but one is it's not see-through at
all so let's go ahead and run this and
oh we also want to add some padding
Coleen and we'll just go ahead and put
ten pixels all around it looks like and
then we also oh I'm sorry background -
color I forgot to put that so the
attribute is background s color and the
value is RGB I so sorry sorry about my
mistake there the height property so
we're gonna set height I'm go ahead and
says Eero px as well
and I believe that should do everything
that we wanted to do so now you'll see
let's let's forget a second you kind of
see this partially see-through gray
right here kind of off-center cuz of the
padding and everything we're doing
don't don't really sweat it but you're
able to have this partially see-through
it's kind of hard to see on white it
doesn't here it doesn't really look like
you're seeing through much but yeah I
promise you it's working just the size
of a header versus a paragraph tag all
right so remember we're talking about
how we the height adjusted the size of
the tag but instead what we want to do
now is actually read just the elements
height what we actually want to adjust
is the font size of the h4 element so we
want to make the font bigger do that we
use the font - size property and we're
going to set that to 27 pixels and
you'll see now that we have this nice
big font there
now the box-shadow property is pretty
cool it will add a shadow to your
elements to kind of give it a
three-dimensional look now we're going
to add a box shadow for the thumbnail ID
so let's see we'll add our thumbnail ID
right here and remember that thumbnail
our IDs are with hashtags so in our
thumbnail we want to give it a box
shadow the the above box shadow a lot of
stuff's going on here so there's a lot
of properties that go on here where you
want the Box shadow what color you want
the Box shadow and how much box shadow
you want to a top and bottom so they
offset it here let's just read this real
quick because I don't I don't want to
misinterpret it there's a lot of
parameters that go into box shadow I'm
actually gonna copy this so don't make
any sin tax mistakes here but the Box
shadow property takes values are offset
of X because you need to set how much do
I want it off of the elements X property
and how much do we want it off of the Y
property what is the blur radius spread
radius color value and color value in
that order so a lot of a lot of stuff
goes in went to making your box shadow
but it's a pretty cool effect you can
see there's one eight eight inputs for
this one attribute and so now you'll see
did you see the little kind of the
little shadow on the bottom here and the
shadow on the left that's what the Box
shadow does it make it be kind of hard
to see in the video but maybe if we do
this let's go ahead and just make this
red real quick to kind of just make it
stand out a little bit so you can kind
of see that the red shadow around the
edge adds kind of a three-dimensional
sort of look to it put that back real
quick
continue on
so soon later how rgba works where you
can set the opacity you can actually
just set opacity of things directly
so we have our links tag here what we
want to do is just set the opacity of
links to something like 0.7 and our
links will be slightly see slightly more
see-through it looks kind of on on here
that they just become a little more grey
but they're becoming see-through now you
can also transform text to be certain
things as well so like say you don't
want to actually have to type out but
you have a paragraph that it needs to be
all capitalized you can do that but
instead of actually having to worry
about going through and capitalizing
everything you can just use to uppercase
you can also capitalize things or if you
want um you want transform me right here
to be lowercase or excuse me lower case
you can use lowercase uppercase
capitalized we'll just do the first
letter of each word and you know none
uses the original text initial use the
default value but these are the really
the main three that you kind of need to
know lowercase uppercase that
capitalized so I didn't go on so we have
our H four so it's going to be text -
transform because we're transforming the
text to be a certain way and in this
case we want it to be uppercase now when
we run it will see that our alphabet is
all capitalized
so the body tag should have the family
name of open songs and generic name was
sans-serif so we had already talked
about family name so we our font family
the thing that you really need to get
away from here is you're gonna be
importing fonts now like lobster and
these open these other things open sans
is another popular one and when you
import these google fonts because
they're not the same as the browser font
so we actually have to put quotations in
there to let it know that it's a phone
or it's just it's just the convention
it's just how it works you need you need
to do that so we're gonna have our body
here and we're having a font - family
and because open sans isn't native to
browsers we're just saying open sans and
quotes you'll notice that we can
actually just have sans serif oops
sans serif like so because this is
native to browsers and you notice that
the of course the check the text changes
as well set the font size of h1 tags to
68 so you could do font sizes for all
sorts of things or you could so by
default all these let's friend this real
quick this is our kind of font sizes but
you can you can resize the size of h1
elements if you want to so with h1 will
do font - size 68 pixels and let's go
ahead and copy this yeah h1 to h6 just
as a reminder there's six headings and
so we'll go through it's 68 then 52 then
our h3 is 40 and then our that's 32 21
and 14 so there's our age 4 which is 32
yes at age five which is 21 and then
here is our H six which is 14 I was
gonna run this you'll see now our texts
are all the new the new chat the new the
new the new sizes there we go Oh words
man their heart so font weight refers to
how heavy the font is in terms of like
how thick or thin you want the
characters to be so the heavier the font
weight the more the thickness of it the
greater the thickness so we go ahead and
set the font weight of this as well so
one's gonna be 800
these aren't pixels just the font weight
then we have a font - wait oh and make
sure you notice that we're gonna notice
the changes of these first three here so
font weight 600 400 300 400 500 is the
next one finally
400 300 alright and now when we run this
you notice that our Tech's got thicker
on these first two here because we
increase the font weight pass where they
wrap now font - sighs it's not limited
to heading so you can do this for
paragraphs as well so we'll see our
paragraph here which is 10 pixels we're
going to increase it by 60% it's gonna
take a lot more of the screen now 60%
bigger by having those extra six pixels
so there's also the line height property
let's say you want a little bit more
space between your paragraph tags we're
going to set it 25 pixels and no set all
right spaces in between our text here is
now decided to get a little greater now
let's say we don't want our anchor tags
to be blue by default they typically are
so when we run that you'll see we have
our blue anchor Tanger like yo man this
is like this is so a o/l times like no
one has blue anchor links anymore man
this amateur hour so making it look real
bad we go ahead and set the color and
we'll set it to black like so the color
of your handkerchief you like all right
apparently that wants to do the do it
their way which is hashtag zero zero
zero the shorthand X value
oh I don't know make sure you of course
throw the element they trying to target
going on it is a Friday guys I've been
working five days so far so I apologize
if I make a little mistakes like that
you can also add the hover pseudo-class
what that basically means is that when
you hover over an element you're going
you can only apply certain CSS style
attributes such as like tooltips or
additional info or maybe change the
color now we're gonna go ahead and do
that so how do we apply that pseudo
class of hover you just put a coal in
the element and then our the element
then a colon then the effect so or the
the pseudo class so we want there is
look when you hover over it we want it
then to become blue and then we want the
text decoration so by default this is
underlined the anchor text color remain
black only s yes
we want the text-decoration to remove
the line how do we remove texture how do
we remove that text-decoration or the
line it's check decoration none let's go
to run that and let's let's check it
real quick so you'll see when we hover
over it's now blue line is gone this CSS
is only applying on the pseudo class now
it's gonna be really important to get
comfortable using those pseudo classes
if you're if you're not already so we're
talking about the CSS box model but this
basically refers to is you need to be
able to position your elements
accordingly
so in our h2 element we're gonna set the
position property to relative and we'll
read what that is right now when a
position of an element is set a relative
allows you to specify how CSS should
move it relative to its current position
on flow on the page so it's basically
saying you'll interact with the other
CSS on the page more or less and so it's
it's willing to shift left or right
based on what elements are surrounding
it what which elements are relative to
it so we're gonna set the position here
I'm going to said it's a relative and
then we want our we want to set the CSS
we're gonna offset to relative position
h2 15 pixels away from the top from
where it normally sits so change
position age to the relativity is the
top
we're basically offsetting from the top
by 15 pixels and so when we run it
you'll see that it drops down oh dang it
before we do that let's run this real
quick and so here we are here's our move
meat and what we're gonna do now is you
notice you have to define this position
I didn't say that but you have to have a
position I'm think by default it
inherits relative or the default is
normal flow okay but you'll see that
this moved down and move 15 pixels from
the top it doesn't
move up 15 pixels to the top moves away
from that by 15 pixels so we want to
move our H to 10 pixels upwards so in
this example we would just go ahead and
put bottom 10px because again we want to
move it up so we're pushing away from
the bottom by 10 pixels and we want to
move it towards the right 15 pixels so
that would be the left so when we run it
what's gonna happen is the movement is
going to go up and to the right and
you'll see that's exactly what it did so
lock an element to its parents with
absolute positioning so what that
basically means is an element becomes
absolutely placed and isn't cannot
really be can't cannot be pushed around
by normal CSS factors like we showed
case beforehand and it's it's to its
parent element right so to do that you
assign position wrote a position up
salute and so what we want to do is we
have our search bar ID which is our form
and then we want to say we want to give
it the position it's gonna zoom in one
more time position absolute like so and
then we want to offset it by the top by
zero pixels so we don't want any any
offsetting of zero pixels to the top and
to the right of zero pixels as well so
we run this we fried around the
test beforehand let's go ahead and run
it real quick so we could see this
oh you don't really notice anything cuz
it's already in place but if it wasn't
in place it would definitely not be
moved by other elements now fix stuff
let's read the fixed position and it be
honest I always get a little a little
loopy when it comes to these positions
that sometimes it's a for me it's a
little bit of guess in check but now
once you kind of get the hang of these
things you get you just have to use it a
lot
which is how coding is in general so the
text layouts again the CSS offers this
fixed position which is a type of
absolute position that locks an element
relative to the browser window so fix
locks it to the browser window why
absolute is locked to the the parent
element so if it's located in a David's
to that div while fixed is to is
absolute except on the on the window
okay so what we want to do here so we
have this and we want to give our navbar
the position of fix and then we want to
have top zero pixels I have to say it is
very nice that they give us a they kind
of clean up three lines here for us to
put our code in there's nice saves us a
couple extra keystrokes and have to do
that so you'll see right here now with
position fix we're putting it to the top
and we're putting it all the way to the
left and thus it jumps to the top of the
the window to the document now you can
push things still left or the right
right so this home in this context kind
of weird so what we want is the ID left
we want to float it to the left meaning
we want everything go left and then the
right we want to float have our text go
to the right and when we run this
waitwhat they must have done some
additional things here okay so we're
gonna float these these things to the
right oh they did that section it's not
the text I'm sorry
so each one of these sections one's
going to left and ones going to the
right so you'll see BAM
so that goes there right now and it's
gonna float around so it's not gonna
drop down the same light it kind of
floats around as long as they're spaced
all right so the z-index property allows
us to position how our elements stack
typically the way that your HTML browser
will do it is it will stack the most
nested one on top now we can go ahead
and assign the z-index value of two to
this first element so let's run this
real quick so I'll see we have a red and
blue so what's happening is by default
we've already set the ER but not by
default we've set the z-index one now if
we want the first one to go on top of it
the z-index needs to be larger than that
so in this case we're going to pass too
you'll see now our red is appearing on
our blue
now if we want to Center something
there's a couple ways we can go about it
the easiest way is to go ahead and just
put them Center things based off the
margin we've already said margin to auto
and as long as nothing no other elements
are affecting it between going from this
side to this side it should Center just
like we did right there
so we want to what's the bill this learn
about complementary colors okay so
there's a lot of color schemes and this
is kind of something that I think you'll
probably need do more research about
where you can type in you need to Google
something like web complementary colors
and they'll bring up a bunch of color
Pickers kind of show you what goes
together on a palette and a lot of
themes will already have these built in
and like angular material or bootstrap
or something like that but just just do
some research that's kind of the main
point we don't have to dive into that
too much but we're blue and yellow go
together quite nicely so what we're
gonna do here is the div element what's
class blue it's gonna have a background
color of blue and then let's run this
real quick
so we have blue and then the yellow
should have a background color of yellow
so blue and yellow looks nice together
another great two colors to put together
is cyan and orange as well as raspberry
these kind of all go together relatively
nice so we can go ahead and put that in
in this case we're gonna pass an orange
let's actually run this real quick
Orange cyan is going to be cyan and then
we're gonna have raspberry
be raspberry a rasp excuse me
rasp berry
oh and of course they don't want to say
let's use our hex colors it looks like
so hex color cyan is this X color you
just copy and paste this in here you
don't really mean it to memorize it if
you do god bless I will never but you
can see these kind of look nice work
together so we're gonna continue on kind
of talking about complementary colors or
in here cooking with free code camp
bunch of stuff on here so this all black
is about to let and white is gonna look
a lot better once we had some some
colors we want our header here to have
this color we run that BAM it's already
looking like it's got a kick in the ass
all of a sudden and then we're going to
add this complementary color to the
background color of the footer just go
ahead run this and we'll jump down the
bottom you'll see now it kind of you
know this page is looking like it
belongs together and it's not an
outdated newspaper or anything like that
and then we're gonna set the color of
the h2 element it's got some flavor to
it as well you see now what now it's
really as my as my boss would say we're
cooking with gas which is something very
strange to say goodbye fitting so the
button element that we're gonna consider
white we're gonna go ahead and give it
some flavor as well when I set it to
orange but it's a much nicer looking
page and then just to pure black and
white so we're gonna talk about how to
adjust the hue of a color so your code
should use the HSL property declare the
color green so you also declare colors
via their hues by 0% 50% 100% just
passing numbers so on and so forth but
let's go ahead and so green so this is
red yellow green you see you'll see
right here what value you have to pass
it in to get that so so using background
- color we can do this HSL and pass in a
certain hue with our color
as well which is a background - Color
Oops now this is not something that I've
I've touched but I have seen it so we're
going to change the color green here and
that's going to be 120 and then we're
gonna set the hue to a hundred percent
and 50 percent let's actually run this
so we can see so you see this green is
slight we've set the hue right it's not
our traditional green and we're gonna do
the same thing for our cyan which is
black right now and we want to set the
hue of that as well
and our cyan to do that is a hundred
eighty
are example we are going to pass in 100
percent and then 50 percent we got a
little nice hue of our scion color and
finally we're gonna do the same for the
color blue blue is 240 it's just so now
what it HSL stand for
stands for hue saturation and the
lightness cool so that those are the
values that that goes into HSL so blue
is the 240 we're gonna pass in 100% here
as well 50% and we're gonna have a nice
blue this could be off by our tradition
blue you can also adjust the tone so the
navigation bar on this site let's run
this real quick
that's background color so now if
saturation 80% 25%
so let's go ahead and change our our nav
where is our nav right here and we're
gonna set the background color to HSL
and I don't even remotely remember
oh I don't need a rubber start here so
we're gonna we're gonna match this right
here this is gonna be set 178 80% and
25% I'm gonna have to go back and look
at what the actual color scheme is you
see we has this nice little hue shadow
kind of saturation effect hue saturation
and lightness there we go you think it
would be easier since you're they've
called it HSL but it just shows how bad
I am so you also have a linear gradient
so the gradient is where you kind of
have two colors and then it transitions
from this color to that color that's all
it is it's another thing that we can do
to the background property we're gonna
do it in this div right now so we're
gonna have a background and in here
we're gonna use linear - gradient and
you need to apply similar to box shadow
quite a few things when you use the
linear gradient first the degree in our
example we're gonna put 90 degrees then
the first color which will be red then
the second color which will be yellow
and then it looks like we can apply a
third color as well which is pretty cool
which will be RGB and you'll notice that
we can put in any one of these values
right or any style of the colouring
issue any we can input the color in any
fashion that we see fit so that's our
example let's actually follow the here
so we want to set it for 35 degrees my
bad we then want to set the first color
- hashtag CC FFF and then once up the
second color - hashtag FF CC CC it's
gonna run the test you'll see now we
have this nice linear gradient going on
here it looks like I did not get my code
perfect so let's run this one more time
see what deal is because I forgot a
semicolon we can see we have this linear
gradient that goes from this sort of
palest pink to this light blue
definitely much better than just a solid
background color something you should
get comfortable with just kind of me
this will really look good when creating
a portfolio better than just a solid
color so you can also do repeating
linear gradients goes into a lot of
detail here the gist of it is you just
need to understand how to pass in the
values so we're gonna do background you
see the example here of repeating linear
gradient and you can see it does one
linear gradient to the other repeats one
linear gradient to the other it repeats
one linear gradient to the other repeats
so and so forth so instead of 45 to 90
degrees what we wanted to do think and
you know thank them for putting this in
here because this is gonna be a big pain
to type
I appreciate that we're now setting the
45 degrees so 90 degrees you kind of saw
how it just goes that way 45 degrees at
an angle and you know it go on so so on
and so forth one color should stop at 40
pixels so this is how far it should it
should go for it stops so okay 40 pixels
so I believe they want this one be 40
oops
no yellow stops at 0 pixels
one color sauce so basically where you
soft color so yellow goes zero to 40
blue goes 40 to 80 Anderson oh so it
goes yellow should be a zero pixels one
color stop at 40 pixels should be yellow
second color stop should be black
let's reset this room quick okay guys I
pause for a second here to kind of get a
better understanding of what I was
misunderstanding but let's start fresh
so the first thing we want to do is
change our degrees to 45 degrees so it's
instructions say now the way to think of
this is that when you have these color
stops there's a starting color and an
ending color and you're transitioning to
them so in this yellow zero pixels is
where it starts and it goes the blue
pixel right here which is 40 and it
blends it together now if we don't want
that blend and this is what what's
throwing me off is we don't want that
blend we're saying start at the zero
pixel and go to the 40 pixel yellow to
yellow so it's going to be a solid
yellow like so and we're gonna do the
same thing for the black here where
we're starting at 40 pixel and then
we're going to 80 pixels for the black
so what we're gonna get is a black and
yellow mesh like so which is pretty cool
it kind of looks at those good old idiot
books which I read all the time for the
record create a texture by adding a
subtle pattern as a background image so
you can also add a background image to
the bot not didn't mean do a hint run
test so you can also add a background
image here using the URL how you add a
background image background URL pass in
the I am pass in the URL tag and when we
run it you'll see that we have this
little background here it's kind of hard
to see but they're like little squiggly
lines it's not like a cool cat photo so
say we wanted to scale the size of the
image we would use the transform
attribute and the scale parameter and we
could do it to 1.5 times its normal size
so let's run this you'll see we have
these two little balls here to show the
difference we're gonna scale ball two to
1.5 times the size
transform scale 1.5 now this is where
screen vector graphics will be start
being used more and more in the web the
reason for that and this right now is
just CSS but you can use this on images
as well screen vector graphics the way
that they're created is that they scale
evenly so it doesn't matter if it's the
size of a penny or the size of them like
an apartment it should scale even evenly
and have no issues being transformed to
that size because it uses geometry and
basically it's its design so that it
scales perfectly depending on if you're
using SVG images so just something keep
in mind now the size of a div element
should scale to 1.1 times when the user
hovers over it so remember how we were
talking about our our CSS or our pseudo
classes we're gonna do the same for here
which we're gonna do div hover oh excuse
me I am in the div here not what I meant
to do hover and we're gonna do transform
and this will actually scale it's just
1.1 and this is kind of a cool thing
that they showed this because and we're
gonna show this because you don't you
just want a little bit of increase you
don't want it to be too blatant but like
you go from here to here and typically
what you would do is you would add a
slight animation effect so that this
isn't so sudden and this is really make
your sort of page look a little more
interactive a little more user friendly
and much more current right you could
still have it like this this is what you
prefer but typically what would happen
is you would have an animation that
maybe there's 10% increase in size would
happen over half a second or something
like that I think that's probably where
we're going yeah in the future here you
can also skew things off the X&amp;amp;Y axis so
typically things are perfectly like a
coordinate system now we may want to
have it slightly diagonal and things
like that and we're gonna skew that
using transform as well so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna skew the bottom
by 24 degrees
the way that we do that is transform
that's the attribute of the parameter if
you will will be SKU X and then we're
gonna throw in two for here too for dag
let's go ahead and run that
there's notes what did it say oh I hit
hint so you'll see now we're skewing off
the ends of the attribute everything now
it's not that they're getting chopped
off we're just kind of shifting right so
imagine you have a you know it's just
like me right so I'm tall lanky guy
normally I stand like this but if I
wanted to skew I'd go now I'm skewed X
amount of degrees I skew this way X
amount of degrees I don't know if that's
a great example that's the ones we're
good we're going with so it just leans
you in leads the element in the opposite
excusive brain in the opposite direction
all right
you can also be skewed along the y axis
as well you do that with skew Y so we're
gonna do that to the top element which
we're again it's transform is the
attribute and then the value here will
be ask you why we're gonna do that by
negative 10 degrees as well
well we run that you'll see that we're
skewed upward now it's not the sides of
the value of that is skewing it's the
the y-axis of skew and we're skewing
like this before we're skewing like this
and like this
now we're skewing like this up and down
now we're gonna into some of the cooler
html5 stuff so uh and cs3 stuff or cs3
stuff is what we're gonna into which is
the newer CSS all newer it's really
quite old but the stuff that if you
never touch the assessee never moved
into really getting kind to the next
level this is kind of stuff that that
we've been talking about something so
background color you can also set this
property to be transparent border radius
property the value border radius alright
so what we want to do let's run this
real quick so we have this we're gonna
add a border radius of remember 50% will
set things to be circles will do this
piece by piece
which is
how I like to do my CSS so that we know
so you'll see now these are circles and
we want to set the background color to
transparent let's go ahead and run that
you'll see now we got rid of that color
and it's kind of looking like a moon
kind of cool and we're going to add a
box shadow effect of 25 pixels for
offset X 10 pixels for offset Y zero for
blur radius R 0 for blur radius 0 for
spreaders 0 0 I don't think we have to
have px I'm not sure though we'll find
out in a second
there we go so we got rid of the blur
radius we got rid of the spread radius
and then we just had kind of this curved
moon it's basically just multiple CSS
interacting with multiple elements right
there
pretty cool so you can kind of design
shapes based off your CSS let's see a
lot stuff going on here so you have the
before and after one of the most popular
shapes is heart shape we need to
understand that the colon before and the
after selectors these selectors are used
at something before or after a selected
element in the following example so it
kind of makes this right you have this
element and you're saying whatever comes
before target it and whatever comes
after target it because maybe perhaps
you don't know what it's gonna be but
you know you can set it up in the CSS so
we have our let's around this real quick
so we have this and we have this and so
our heart is our div right here and
we're saying before the div target that
so base it on the left hand side and the
right hand side and what we want to do
is the heart after should be pink we're
gonna change this so this will now be
pink and the border is for heart after
should be 50% all right
that so you see kind of looks like a
finger
I guess maybe and then the transform
property and a lot of times if you're
trying to create like complex shapes
like this I'd be very impressed if you
memorize all of them but there's so many
it's really just a Google search away to
kind of find this so so what class are
you pointing this to the heart class
excuse me
so we're gonna put in our transform here
we're gonna add rotate because you can
rotate things as well and we're going to
do that by negative 45 degrees and
you'll see now we're kind of rotated
like one like so and then the content of
the heart will floorselector should be
an empty string okay I have no idea why
that's an empty string though let's read
this when the before and after selectors
add shapes the content property is still
required but it's set to an empty string
okay so apparently we just this is just
something in CS cs3 that we have to have
in here to get this to work this is a
strange but apparently that's what you
have to do that's how you all all this
code right here which is why I would say
that you have to look this up not to
memorize it we have three classes here
with what from line three to line 35 32
lines of code to make this heart shape
which is why I don't worry about like
memorizing that stuff too much it's more
about the general concept of hey I know
I can make CS shapes and CSS let's go
ahead and look that back up real quick
so ever element with the ID erect and we
want to have an animation name property
with the value of rainbow so we're
talking about animations just a second
ago so here's here's our square our
rectangle and we're gonna add animation
are we doing a keyframe animation to it
I believe we can do keyframes outside of
yeah so what this act keyframes is it's
it kind of names your animation it's
imagine storing an animation value and
all it's basically doing is we're saying
at keyframes and we're naming we're
basically saying look our keyframes the
example here colorful we're naming our
animation and then you'll see right here
we pass it in to the animation name now
we can set the animation values and
things like that and traditionally how
animations go is it goes from a zero
percent to a hundred percent so when you
start the animation and when you end the
animation so animation starts here and
then it animates to the end at a hundred
percent
does what it needs to do right so at
keyframes and we are calling our
animation to element citation English
property with a with a value of rainbow
so I believe we're calling this rainbow
and what we're doing here is animation
named rainbow and let's go ahead and run
this piece by piece because this is
gonna get a little complicated and then
the element of ID with rec should have
an animation duration for a second so
here we are defining how long this
animation should take place four seconds
now we haven't really we haven't defined
what the animation does so like nothing
that's happening we're gonna define that
right now so we want to do is that zero
percent where's the zero this is at zero
percent we want to have the background
color be blue
and then at 50% so notice we can
actually do multiple it's not just the
arrow to a hundred you can add multiple
ones as well we're in the background
color green and then at a hundred
percent it should be yellow so how this
should work is once we once we set the
background once we trigger the animation
it's going to start off at blue at two
seconds because 50% durations four
seconds it's gonna turn green and when
it finally hits four seconds it's going
to turn yellow that's basically all that
our animation is gonna do all right
let's go ahead and run our test and
you'll see right there our animation and
because the way our animation is set up
is that it should run every time we were
in our code one time typically you
probably want to have animation that
runs on clique or something like that
but we'll kind of go over that right now
so you CSS animation change the hover
state a button remember we were talking
about doing this when you cut when we
had that one with the scaling effect to
it so what we want to do now is who want
to the keyframe should use the animation
name background color okay so we have
background color now we need to go ahead
and define background color again
remember keyframes such a weird name
this this refers to animation which is
an intuitive if you haven't never used
like Adobe Adobe After Effects the
keyframes are where you start the
animation where you end the animation so
that that's what that refers to
I think it of it as a variable but
you're basically naming the keyframes
and the name for this is background -
color which is an awful name because the
same
as an attribute but that's what the name
is here and we are instead going to be
passing and we're gonna say see we're
just gonna say add a hundred percent so
we're saying there should be one row
under key friends that changes the
background color to okay so all we want
to do here is that a hundred percent
we want to set background - color -
whatever this color is 479 one D oh
let's run this and so what happens when
we hover over it you'll see that change
this color and it's stuck it runs it
after half a second then it stops
so modify fill motive and animation so
this is what we're talking about it
resets every half a second which isn't
what we want so where this can we're
gonna instead do something that it's
called animation film mode proper to
forwards animation film mode specifies
the style applied to the element when
the animation is finished so animation
film mode for it set the film on
property button to hover to forwards to
the button stays highlighted when user
hovers it
okay so we have hover
so button:hover and what we're doing
here is we're gonna set animation - Phil
- mode - forwards and what this should
do if I understand it correctly is this
animation film mode forwards is going to
allow our once the animation hits the
end it's not going to run the animation
again that's gonna keep this filled the
color that we want it to be great
movement using CSS animation so so far
we all we did was change the background
color but you can do a lot more than
that with animation so what we want to
do is we now want to set the let's run
our test real quick it's the most
updated HTML here so you'll see that
this is now moving instead of going from
top to bottom we wanted 0% to offset
left at zero pixels and I'm not sure if
they want us to get rid of the top they
don't so there's that and then finally
we want to a 50% offset by 50 pixels and
then finally add a hundred percent we
want to left offset by negative 25
pixels oh excuse me this is 25 pixels as
well so you'll see we're going left to
right like so kinda like a little Mario
game but so you can move elements as
well with animation
so what we want to do now is we can and
you guys see how you can now start all
all the CSS that we learned like opacity
we can go ahead and set these values
here and these keyframes just this
percent we're passing the keyframes into
the animation name and then we're kind
of defining what takes place at each
percentage points so at 50% it kind of
fades color so you'll see right here
it's it's it's fading it's the color
every so slight slightly by down to
about ninety percent less than its value
or 0.1 I should say so the so you can
also set how many times you're actually
going to iterate through the animation
so you can set it to infinite you can
also set it to 3 or one or two or
whatever you want it to be let's go
ahead and set it to infinite so we are
going to jump into here in the set of 3
when we run this right now it's gonna
bounce three times
pretty cool animation if you ask me but
we're gonna have this bounce infinite
amount of times so it's just gonna keep
going a sale go much past three it'll go
on as long as your professor is open as
we can see right now let's go and run
this real quick maybe I'll put into that
so we have we have we have all our heart
CSS again and what we want to do now is
we want to go ahead and give the heart
class at infinite scaling as well so
let's jump up to our animation -
iteration count
I appreciate that they gave these some
very detailed names like its you can
kind of guess what animation iteration
count is but that is a lot of tests to
type out so we're gonna do the same
thing let's run this one time so it's
gonna go Bam Bam and we're gonna do the
same thing for the heart back class and
we're gonna add it as infinite as well
animation - iteration - count we're
gonna add that as infinite as well it's
gonna run that and so you'll see that
it's changing color so on and so forth
going from one color to the other so you
can kind of combine a bunch of
animations as well so the act keyframes
roll for the star - one class
should be 50% let me let me understand
what they're trying to get us to do here
so to illustrate the enema sure cuz it's
a two stars that each oops
they each just decrease the size you can
change the keyframes rule for one of the
elements so they tweak out different
okay so what we want to do all that all
that this is basically saying is that
you don't have to have all your
animations at the same rates so what's
gonna happen is one's gonna twinkle at
20 percent and one's going to twinkle at
50 percent so that it's gonna throw each
one of these off now the the the
duration of it is still the same and if
we kind of mess with it it might be a
little bit better to kind of see we'll
run this real quick you'll see one is
duration like this one is taking five
seconds than the other one but all
that's really happening is that they're
just changing sizes at different points
but still over the same amount of
duration so the animation duration right
so you don't have to have the same
duration the same anything with your
animations which is kind of the point of
this the animation property for the star
class once you remain at one second okay
so start once again remain at one star
two is going to be 0.9 seconds and then
this star 3 is going to be one point one
okay so zero point nine and then we are
also oh no that's one point one and then
this is 0.9 so now we'll get a better
idea kind of what I just showcase more
or less and you'll see they're all kind
of popping off slightly at different
times kind of hard to tell
animation timing function controls how
quickly an animated element changes over
the duration of the animation okay so
there are number of predefined keywords
so there's some keywords here also
another great course for this is so
learned cs3 class I have some videos up
on that I've done the course and they
goes over animations and details as well
if you're looking for additional
materials so the animation timing
function property for the element should
be ID ball one should be linear I mean
it's goes the standard route and then
ball to should ease out
other options include ease out which is
a quick beginning the slow zener ease in
which is slow in the beginning so it's
basically ease out is quick in the
beginning that slows down and then ease
in it's the opposite so what we're gonna
do is show linear for ball one we're
gonna have animation timing function and
this is going to be linear let's go
ahead and run this real quick to see the
difference right so linear it's just a
linear fault
and then so you'll see that it's falling
equal right that's what it means by
linear it's not speeding up so let's do
anything meanwhile here we want our
animation - timing and notice how we
don't actually have all this in one CSS
one CSS ID or one CSS class because it's
inheriting this from the classes and
hearing that this the bulk of the bulk
of the animations CSS from the Baals
class and we're defining the IDS with
additional values this wouldn't work by
itself obviously or without the
keyframes which are getting defined
right here so here we're gonna do ease
out
so you'll see it kind of picks up pace
slows down all right so we are in apply
visual design learn help Bay sign busier
curves work your curves are another type
of timing function for animation let's
run this real quick we should fail so
you see kinda seems like everything's
going the same but now what we're gonna
do is we're going to have the linear
equivalent of the brassiere curve that
is going on for ball one so where as
ball one so we are going to let's look
at our example here cubic yeah here and
we are going to say is 0.25 0.25 0.75
and 0.75 all right so this is the linear
equivalent the cube root for 0 let's
read over this real quick though it's
basically another function where you
have an x1 a y1 and x2 and y2 and what
you're all you're basically doing is
setting a coordinate with the X&amp;amp;Y
location and a coordinate with XY
location so this is coordinate 1 this is
coordinate 2 and you're saying I want
the animation start here and I wanted to
go from here to here so before we think
I'm assigning top and bottom but this
gives you another way of trying to set
the linear effects so we're setting top
and bottom by in this fashion so this is
where it starts this is our axis era our
Y and then this is where we want it to
go that's why it goes in a straight line
cuz values match
so we're gonna change the red button
here or the red one and instead of
linear we are going to give it a cubic
Bezier I apologize if I'm saying this
incorrectly brassiere I believe it's how
it's supposed to be now it's pronounced
zero zero come to zero point five eight
and one and so let's run this real quick
so we can see it looks like the rest of
it is all set up so everything's going
at the same rate as everything else very
nice so the property of the elements ID
Green should be a cubic Bezier excellent
light okay so we go and green run our
tests so for green we want it to instead
be kind of see the difference so you can
see it's starting from the bottom going
the top sorry from the bottom gnome here
uh we're gonna let's go ahead and change
these values to be and also you can
actually go as many places as you want
although each one is one-tenth less than
so I don't think we've gone to three
digits but you can you can go as many as
you want it's not gonna make much of a
difference after a certain point though
and then finally six and let's go ahead
and run this just go a little bit faster
a little bit more smooth everything's
looking pretty good going a little bit
higher than it was before if you notice
it's going almost all the way to the top
and that is it we finished the oh my god
I forgot the name of it it's been so
long we finished that section that's
what's important I hope you guys found
this helpful
we just got done doing the responsive
web design specifically the applied
visual design up next we'll be working
on applied accessibility this section
will cover
to basically make our websites more
accessible to people with learning
disabilities visual auditory mobility
cognitive as they say there and this is
really important because when you're a
lot of jobs there's certain standards
you have to meet this is typically one
especially as a developer works with the
government or for government agencies
it's kind of required that we meet a
certain accessibility standard as you
should right you want your product to be
used by as many people as possible but
