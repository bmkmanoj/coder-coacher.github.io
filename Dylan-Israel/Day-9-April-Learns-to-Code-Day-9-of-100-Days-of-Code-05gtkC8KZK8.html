here
so yeah working on morning no because
I'm busy working on YouTube and working
in side projects paying all the bills
that's why oh yeah baby oh um so what
are you been working on the last day hey
where you been working on today catching
up on my notes what do you mean by that
the grind right there by Andy um it
turns out our one-hour sessions go a lot
faster than I do in terms of like
subject matter and learning the concepts
and being able to remember and apply
those things um so it's open full if the
doors open all you do is push on it um
so anyways our one hours go a lot
quicker than I do and so I've been
spending the day since I didn't go to
the gym catching up on my notes to
hopefully getting to where we are right
now but that isn't the case but I did
get a lot closer and taking a lot done
so I'm not too ashamed of myself but I
wanted to do more I'm I'm school close
to me
probably after this see six seven so
we've been sup you've been studying the
basic JavaScript section basically and
taking notes so we're gonna continue on
with that and in the meantime she's
going to continue with the portfolio how
far are you on that same alright I
haven't touched my portfolio in tiny
kitchen my advice is to finish that up
first okay so well I don't but we have
the videos here so that when you do get
stuck and go back yeah but we don't have
videos labeled on which subjects so and
it's not like right along with mine the
only reason why I know what videos are
on what videos is because I remember
which day is that I don't remember that
for long okay well well don't worry I'm
here also
I'm helping you for a hundred days oh
he's terrible asking me through whore is
enough anyhow so ungrateful
I'm sending her a bill at the end these
hundred days guys do it alright um yeah
um so we're in the JavaScript section
and we're now doing the basic JavaScript
where are the counting cards this is
essentially remember how we're kind of
putting in all together is another one
where we're putting all together and in
this case we're in count cards I
remember
yes so let's read over here and the
casino game blackjack a player can gain
an advantage over the house house
meaning the casino by keeping track of
the relative number of high or low cards
romanians s deck this is called card
counting this is doing specialty area
having more high cards remain in the
deck favors the player so the higher the
card somewhere you want to bet basically
anything at 18mm will your county in the
cards um but uh basically let's just
jump down to here we have we have our
what each card value it took me over a
year to get my together this man
would quite possibly murder me because
his patience is from 0 to 9 in 60
seconds
I'll murder you on the live stream right
now uh no all right so you'll write
we're gonna write our card counting
function um and in here it'll receive a
card I would have to say if I could
stick to this for a year and possibly
quite possibly for the rest of my life
I'd be extremely happy so good on you so
we have our card parameter and then it's
going to be a number or string so in
this case it's going to be a string if
it's an ace the king the queen or a jack
right no suits for this otherwise it
could be a number such as two to ten all
right the function will then return a
string with the current count and the
string bet if the count is positive or
the hold if the count is 0 are negative
all right so what we're basically doing
is each depending on the card we're
adding 1 to the count minus e1 or
nothing and based off of if the the
higher the count if it's positive we
want to bet if it's an if it's zero we
want to hold or if it's negative we want
to hold so you'll see that the count
here is outside the scope of our credit
card
and in this case yes um which is why we
can why are we kidding
which is why we victory dance for that
one which is why we can call this
function five times and the value
remains the same now if this was in the
local scope it would get reset to zero
every single time and then we wouldn't
be able to count cards properly so here
what we want to do is we want to write
an if statement let's say if card ah
better yet why don't we do a switch
statement because we're going to check
the single value of the car ever how
switch statements work we take take a
parameter see what it is and animals and
we'll start from two all the way to ace
okay so yeah case two and what would we
do in this case if it is two what would
we do to count we would add add one yeah
so count is how was it how would we add
one to count is it plus one
no um count plus plus
yeah man you remember you and here the
other day and what do we have to do also
in our cases so that it doesn't do it
again break that's right oh I think so
we have to break it like this guy's
actually wins on me now what we're going
to do the same thing now we see right
here we plus one we could do in a case
three right or what else could we do we
could chain them all together okay you
were going to do which is why you use
the switch yes but you can also I was
trying to
hey everyone thanks for joining us a DB
proof thank you man
uh hello to our friends in Poland I
found your channel by searching
tic-tac-toe tutorial you're doing Thank
You Man
um okay so I remember when you did that
it tick tack toe yeah it's one it's one
of the tutorials actually want to go
redo cuz I did a it's did not a while
ago yeah a long time or not I don't
think I did a very good job on it the
problem was I did it and then I didn't
do a video on it and then I forgotten
what my code at how my code worked which
it which shows you that it's bad code by
the way I should be able to go back and
fully understand and I won't sad day
understand it but it got a little it got
a little loopy in it it's definitely
something I can write a better moving
forward all right so four seven eight
nine we can just seven eight nine so we
can do the same thing here we won't have
a default statement in this case so k7k
seven actually we can just leave it
alone because we know we're not changing
the value to anything so we'll just
leave yeah so can you go six seven eight
nine well here is it's zero there's no
change so we'll just we won't even put
it in we can do case 10 oops is 10 okay
what you have to do it you have to do a
case Jack she seems quite happy today
must be doing well isn't she
you guys talk like I've got so great to
be uh not here but here are you guys
talk about me hey man she's always got a
smile on her face when she's spending
time with her man especially after that
girl yesterday want a piece of this
hotness oh yes I knew that side and this
girl's arts are one of our neighbors who
I see all the time doesn't speak a damn
word to me all of a sudden becomes
Chatty Cathy with this man out there
three cats and I was like look at this
bitch I was like you know what the
moment he finds out that you're
crazier than I am he's gonna come
running right back so I got nothing to
worry about especially in that bitch
talk and boy she is crazy
anyhow so uh all we want to do it's
after we set this alley we forgot to
return it right even though it's running
our logic we want to go ahead and why is
there no windows 8 cuz 1700 Milo um like
that yeah that man you do think but I
got it it's good see this cat on my
right now that comes climbed up your
back
alright so um one thing that you one
thing that we made a mistake on here is
we need to actually return the value as
well so after we add the value we just
want to return the value and this break
we don't need it and the reason for it
is because it's gonna end after the
return statement same thing here okay so
is this good practice leaving out the
seven eight nine no no we have to fix
that right now um
so in this case we are going to have a
default case and that's going to be our
seven eight nine and because we're not
change anything we're just going to
return the value here make sense now
what is the logic between putting it in
a default can you remember what a
default is if if it's none of these
values it hits the default and returns
it's like our else statement so in this
case the the only time count ever
changes it adds one if it's two three
four five or six so we have to add one
to it and then we return what the value
is so if this is one it's now two and we
want to return two and then if it's ten
Jack Queen King or ace we want a minus
one and then we want to return it so go
back to one in that instance and then if
it's zero all we want to do is return
the value so it's not changing at all
it's neutral so we could we could
actually do case seven eight nine or in
this case we're just using default but
you're not labeling seven eight nine
will it still know that what if you used
anything outside of what if you put
eleven down well eleven doesn't exist in
the game but it doesn't know that it's a
card game just a done well it's we are
coding it in a way so that it works with
a card game there's a program to count
cards thus it's okay to assume that it's
counting cards
because we're designing it that way if
if the user is putting in an incorrect
thing there's going to be other issues
so you should its shouldn't like program
your code around it
well none of our tests fast so let's see
here
do not reset count to zero when the
value of seven eight or nine oh it's
going to refresh this hint do not reset
count oh I think I wanted to us to
return something else so it wants to
sexually return the value bette or hold
and so here if the function will then
return a string with the current count
and the string bet if the count is
positive or hold it's the count is zero
negative so we have to do a little bit
more logic in here and so what we'll do
is we'll add to the count just say if
count is greater than zero or print was
it uh we can do it like that will return
count and then we want to concatenate
numbers and strings strings so if it's
greater than zero would that be better
hold if it's positive we want it to bet
so it's gonna return else we can return
count plus and then we want to put a
space right so let's and then hold
we actually don't need this else
statement because it's going to hit it
if this fails we're going to do the same
thing for everywhere else as well
shouldn't it be less than through is
your lesson
what is zero a lesson me uh well here
we're saying hey if it's pot if it's
greater than zero return bet because
it's one or higher if it's not it yeah
so we're basically eliminating an else
statement
run faster code and cleaner code same
thing here and then finally we'll do the
same thing here except and there we go
holy I want to see it print will
not print anything it's well it's
technically running all this no oh you
want it you want to see a print yeah
it'll print out one of these so I can
print them out all so oops
I'll run it on one more time alright so
what we can do is we'll run
Faceman scription so run our cutting
you'll see it will do the test we only
did the bet one so that's why I only did
that I don't want to go at in a bunch of
code okay so you're seeing how we're now
putting things together case statements
variables accounting streams and numbers
and returning things and eliminating
refactoring our code a little bit by
getting everything else so now we're
moving on to objects um this is a good
example this is one you'll understand
so objects are so objects are really
important um in JavaScript and there's
something called object oriented
programming where a lot of your
programming will relate to objects it
doesn't have to it just depends on the
structure of your project but a lot of
programming languages like other
programming languages are object or into
Gilley's it's just plastic charming not
so alright uh so here let's let's it
look at the example our dog we can
create multiple versions of dogs to
degree and we're sending parameters but
here we're just setting a basic object
yeah so in this case we have our dog has
a name it's camper our dog also has legs
which is four and then it has one tail
and then it has an array of friends
which the value is everything everything
so uh in this case to don't not to be
confused with an array but it can have
multiple values right so we see that in
the way that we would find out its name
is we could actually call our dog name
and would return back camper or we could
now how many legs it has by saying hard
dog down legs and then if we wanted to
get friends we would say our dog dog
friends but that would turn the entire
Ray but if we only wanted the zero index
it would be our dog dot friends bracket
and then the index zero to get
everything so let's go ahead and
actually use it I think I think we'll
have you I'll be more card thing made
more sense in London I know but this is
new the car thing was just reefer the
car thing was us just putting together
everything that we've done so far yeah
so make an object that represents a dog
called my dog which contains properties
these are concealed properties so if to
name our properties in the object we use
the quotation and so this is the name of
the property so when we want to know the
name of our dog we'd say our dog name
we're actually getting the name property
of the object our dog and in our my dog
property we're setting the name here and
what do we want the dog's name to be and
and how many legs does Dustin have
Dustin has the real ace is he got hit
like our unique and how many tails does
just in half - because she's born with
two again and how many friends does he
have and then here we will pass in one
now in our object here what we have done
is we have defined an object my dog and
we have given it for properties named
legs tails and friends
we give as many as we want we can
actually have objects within objects and
so these can get very complex and if we
wanted to see let's let me see if I can
bring it up here if we wanted to see how
complex objects can get and pulling a
website or a quick and see if I can get
the entire call
you know what I may have to pull it up
oh yeah not gym pal
I see it you'll see it not chimp out
Jesus alright give me a second I gotta
pull up the source code Oh better yet
let's go to code pindaya because I have
a bunch of API calls there
so we'll do the twitch API for instance
and you can see how these objects can
get nested with various things you did
was that your tribute page right there
on the right uh my Ben oh all right so I
believe I'm already logging it alright
it's the first thing first we get a
small channel right here so this is a an
object already has an object in it now
let's go ahead and see if we can get
more detail here
all right so we will console dot log
data to let's go oops
oh so this is actually even too big for
us to see here that's unfortunate
so what we can do is we will do this
let's see if this will let us do it I
don't think it will because I think yeah
she you can't see it oh let's try this
data to dot follows still too much
all right
zero all right here we go
so here's an object within an object and
in here there's actually like 20 of
these so we have all this data and more
data but it's an object nested within an
object five hundred pennies thank you
bit code but you can see the point of
this is called a JSON it's similar to a
object don't don't worry about the
technical details but it works kind of
the same you can see here we're signing
out what's this is actually returning a
lot of data from using an API an
application programming interface and
such as display name how many followers
they have what game they're playing what
language are speaking what their logo is
is a mature audience all from all
basically using an object or something
very similar to it I never thought you
can use it like that yeah it's a 8j
silence are a massive part of yeah Vic
codes name should be baller codes right
so as I was mentioning we can access
these properties in a couple different
ways although you really only use one
you can treat this as a there's dot
notation and there's bracket notation
JSON is my my blood
so I'm you can use bracket notation by
passing in the this value here the
property so we can use the instead of an
index but really the easier way is just
calling test object hat instead of test
object bracket quotation hat so just for
the most part you're going to use dot
notation so in here we are we want to
read the property values of test object
and we want to be hat value so hat value
should be ball cap the way that we would
get that is this is still a variable the
type of variable it is is an object so
it's just like a more complex variable
so here if we wanted the hat value of
our test object all you all we would do
is test object hat and if we want the
shirt value we would do test object sure
and this would give us Jersey for the
shirt value and ball cap for the hat
value hey Kevin I got your your email by
the way accessing object Farber's
bracket notation so we're talking about
that's called dot notation as you can
imagine because it's just a dot and then
the bracket notation is with brackets so
if we wanted to use bracket notation we
do so like this and if we wanted to
entre value um we would type in entre
and that would give us hamburger and if
we want to drink value we're doing it
because they want you to show you that
that bracket notation exists that's all
so what's the difference between the two
just preference John Dean says does
anyone else have to write documentation
for their projects it really irks me I
do I actually spent the last week wire
framing things out as well as doing
database schemas which once things are
finalized the wireframes have since been
reworked about two three times but once
things are finalized I will then go and
the in terms of the schema rework the
schema and then I'll make documentation
for that in something like MySQL
workbench and then I will upload all the
API I would design the API objects are
they the JSON objects at which point I
will then have a test API documentation
to showcase how each get post delete and
put should return as well as go in so
yeah I mean it's just part of the
process you know so the hint in this
case we use bracket notation to get the
same result okay but was there like a
big difference no dot notate you you
probably won't see bracket notation ever
um she seems more tedious yeah
well people better get prepared for my
comments because I'm gonna comment the
 am I good as you should especially
when you're just starting out anyhow so
you can also pass in variables that are
strings using bracket notation so in
here we have tests object and we want
player player number should what we're
going to turn to the back we want it to
return back Montana so if we set player
number equal to 16 and we want to end
notice these aren't strings either you
can do this with objects usually usually
you wouldn't usually it would be a
string so if we wanted to find out using
a variable and using bracket notation we
could just like that makes sense all
we're doing is the same thing except
we're passing it we're passing in the
property as well it's still property but
we're just passed it we're passing a
property in here using a variable that's
all
say that again so don't don't changes
say exactly what you said before we're
passing in a property into test object
using bracket notation but instead of
passing it in directly we are first
storing it into a variable okay you
changed it I always try to say what the
hell you said the first time um alright
so updating object properties so we can
actually reset the whole value of the
object or we can reset just a property
like let's say our dog Dustin grew back
a leg so now there's four legs so we
would go and change our dog object to
have another leg so in here update my
dog's object name property let's change
her name from coder to happy coder so we
don't want to go in here and change the
happy coder the way we want to do it is
you see right here just like OGG or my
dog and then the property name which is
what no we're changing the name to happy
coder name is equal to happy coder and
so all that's change all the only thing
we change here oh so a change name yeah
I did this somewhere earlier today good
you can also add new properties to it so
let's say something needs to be added
later on that's possible so let's say we
want to add bark the way that we would
do it is we would just say my dog dot
bark is equal to oh really is my dog
it's our dog villona barks are you
adding it yeah we're adding it so even
though this isn't in here yeah just by
doing this is now getting added to it so
we're adding this property and the way
that we can do that is we want as a
property bark and we'll use wolf for the
stream and so now it actually has five
properties named legs tails friend and
bark
you can also delete properties from an
object as well
um so here the way that we can go ahead
and fleet our duck if we wanted to
delete the tail from the dog poor dog
glosses sale we would use this delete
keyword and we'd say our dog because
that's for an array and it remember only
removes the last one it you can find a
way to toggle it in there okay the the
st. the functions that are for array
does not necessarily mean that that
therefore are objects they're different
now
arrays are objects but why that's some
advanced stuff all right but for the
sake of 99 percent of what you need to
know they're different okay we're like
 the things aromatic area so but
anyhow arrays are different than objects
or the sake of this conversation okay
secretly they're not they're like
different eye but if we wanted like the
red pill or the blue pill all right so
if we if we wanted to delete the tails
of our dog all we would do is leave
tails
oh my oh my dog would you take the blue
pill honey
[Laughter]
so obvious should be thought of a key
value storage that's how you usually
think of it so like the property is
usually referred to as the key and the
value that stored is is the value so key
value pair is something that you may
hear we're talking about objects did you
get that so the property name will also
be referred to as key the key and the
value to what it's equal to will be
returned will be referred to as the
value and that whole thing is considered
the key value pair because you have the
key and you have the value key value
pair so what do one do convert the
switch statement into an object called
lookup use it to look out the vowel and
assign the Associated string as a result
so convert the switch statement into an
object called lookup
so here you're seeing we're checking
each value we're passing in a value and
we have all these switch statements that
are going through here instead what we
can do is we can go ahead and just
change result to actually go change
result into an object and return error
we can create an object and then set the
value equal to a result so what we're
going to do is we'll have an object
we'll do the exercises in order so we'll
save our e^x object example object is
equal to a knows how it's with the
carrots right or the the curly braces
this is how you denote your objects and
then in here the the first value that we
have in here is alpha the property right
or the key and these atoms know the
value is atoms so the key value pair is
alpha being the key atoms feeding the
value our next key value pair is the key
is Bravo and the value is Boston
our next cute key value pair is Charlie
and the value is Chicago and finally not
finally we have two to go Delta Denver
and then we go easy we have to one more
I guess I can see echo and then easy box
shot and then finally Foxtrot now this
doesn't mean you're going to be able to
switch every area change every switch
statement to an object it just happens
to work in this case so here we have
Foxtrot and we're going to set that
equal to Frank
so now that we have that we can go ahead
and get rid of all of this code and what
we're going to do is we're just going to
simply set results equal to our example
object and using bracket notation pass
in Val and so in this case what's going
to happen is we're passing in charlie
the result is going to be set equal to
Chicago Chicago just like that hi the X
objects it's not defined well apparently
one is to name it a certain thing
phonetic odd lookup that's what it's
called
wait no oh
into an object called lookup so it's
called
I'm here to refresh the page really
Oh
so it's thinking that our old code is
still there
see how this e^x object is in existing
so what we have to do is we have to go
and clear the cache get that value out
of there
welcome godless monkey and we'll run it
again
oh this one you have to change it to
look ah look at you debug in our code
baby good job
alright so testing objects with
properties so there's also object
properties remember we're talking about
array properties yep orell excuse me
functions and methods if you ever here
function methods are basically the same
thing so they're changeable so we can
use the has own property and then what
we're what this has own property does is
if we if we want to find out if that
property exists in our object we can say
the object dot has own property and as a
parameter passing in a property and what
it will return is a true or false value
to say yes it's here or no it's not here
it doesn't exist
it will return a bullion so in this case
what we want to do is modify the
function check object to test my object
if the property is found then return the
property value if not return not found
so what we're going to do is $5 for the
for the monitor and $20 so April can buy
a smarter way to learn j/s on Amazon
thank you man that's awesome
thank you I tell you why man I'm gonna
go ahead and add it to the cart right
now because
dollars dollars away from sin smarter
wave learn Jas I'm an Amazon hey little
girl
let's see yeah this looks like it
make sure that's it um marks it mark
Meyer yeah well add it to the cart right
now man thank you very much
godless monkey that's appreciated man
I'm not a big book guy when it comes to
software but I think a book is exactly
what April needs she she she's a much
bigger reader than I am nowadays I am a
book person as an English major you can
only imagine oh I had to give up all my
books to come to Florida and I cried and
he made fun of me yeah okay
I'll add it right now thank you very
much man I'm gonna check out right now I
just kind of let you guys know where I
live it's uh
you can't remember the last time you
learned my books Kevin also has a it is
a masters and as a professional
developer or twice opinionated by the
way and I don't know I I guess maybe
from like my college career just
learning from books and like that was
the way that I learned oh you can see
right here I just learned it ordered it
a smarter way liked it
a smarter way to learn Java sir thank
you very much my appreciate I appreciate
you supporting April in her coding
journey here day nine and hopefully uh
sizzle get here by Saturday so today's
shipping may be Friday for lucky fools
thank you so much man thank you for the
five dollars towards the towards the
mater uh okay
books are physical representation of
what I internalize that's deep man
it's exactly it I couldn't agree more I
do I know the the the demographic of my
audience I do I know everything about
you guys I saw I got a move um but so
bit code one one thing that may interest
you is we're coming up on the two-year
anniversary of my channel we're about a
month away and last year I decided to on
my one-year anniversary release all my
analytics and talk about them and I'm
going to do the same thing this year and
discuss you know we'll discuss where the
channels going and all that stuff but
one of the cool things about it is I'm
gonna bust out the green screen like I
did last time and will showcase the
analytics as as time to go on so uh
you'll get you'll get to see that so
that's about a month away well
whoa he's stalking us megalis look he's
got some life uh I could do it live
I I wasn't planning on it's gonna be its
own video um but I was going pretty
in-depth so I'll probably just do I'll
probably do a video and if you have any
other questions you want to ask I'm
happy to answer them um all right uh
let's see here so we're talking about
object methods or object functions and
what we're going to do here is we're
going to find out does this property
exist but we don't want it to return
true or false what we want it to return
in this case is a string value you got
that so we if it's true we wanted to
return a different string hey it exists
or in this case if the property has
found return the property value if it's
not we return not found so what we're
gonna do remember the has on but we're
gonna we're talking about certain of the
more common functions that work with
objects that are object functions okay
so we're checking to see if the property
exists so like if we were to say um my
object has owned property cat it would
return false because that property
doesn't exist if we were just returned
has on property pet it root would return
true because it does exist okay so look
like a bland property but it's just a
function sort of yes so in our if
statement we're going to say my object
dot has own property and in here we're
passing in the parameter that we're
passing into the function right which in
this case is gift so if it's true we're
going to return
yes my object dot dot dot we use bracket
notation because it's simpler in this
fashion
but so has on property if it's sure
return this and we want to return that
property and we know it exists so we can
do this right because we already checked
and you see see this see these two this
is the hassled property function that
goes onto the meth and then the second
house side is the f1 um that's what we
call in multi dimension no it's not a
multi-dimensional anything
so here if it fails we want to return
not found and we don't have to use an if
statement because the other return
statement is going to hit right
I'm Kevin I know this family she's just
gonna start it so we got a teacher about
object function but what Kevin's saying
here is that we can actually pass it in
my object and this property property
property property directly like so and
if it exists it's true if it doesn't
it's false but the shorter cord code
which makes it better code yes but I
also believe that may be that's not the
point in this exercise that's all that
 Maddox but but you get you get
what we're trying to do here we're
checking if a property exists using a
function that's in it yes all right so
we'll stop there we have our ten minutes
now to go and answer questions
everything let's stand up look any stand
um so again thank you too bit code and
and gah this monkey thank you for the
book man fab says not to be a negative
Nancy but this doesn't seem like a
practical way to learn how to code so
this is one our negative Nancy this is
one hour of me introducing her to topics
through free code camp and she's
spending about three hours a day redoing
these as well as doing the projects on
her own and I help her with anything she
she gets stuck on so one thing that we
did with the projects one thing that we
do with the projects is she does that
all on her own and then I was I show her
a way that we could refactor the code
and make it better and when she finishes
the portfolio project will actually be
diving in to get and I'll be teaching
her what good is and how to go from
there as well as divert into a text
editor so um I'm kind of trying to
introduce her to topics cuz that's how
she asked me to UM so everyone learns in
their own way
and part of my time as being an
independent study for my whole high
school career and most of the time when
I was in college which fit my style of
learning very well I do really well in
lectures asking questions being involved
in the class and then going home
reiterating all those things to myself
trying it out then going back through
maybe a project or any type of thing
that interacts on that and then learning
it that way so I know that a lot of
people are saying get the hands-on part
I do get the hands-on part but it's not
the first thing that I do because I
don't like not knowing what it is I'm
about to go into because for me as a
person I'd rather be safe than sorry and
that extends into my learning as well
like I won't go run a marathon without
reading on how to go run a marathon and
that's just how I am
um so I'm not helping her with the
projects and I don't mind helping her in
the way that we are with these examples
and stuff like that because the projects
are really where you're going to learn
to think like a developer when you have
to break down piece by piece and she
hasn't got to that point in the
JavaScript section yet um so I'm kind of
I consider these more like lectures than
anything else guys except for it we're
actually falling free code camps
lectures in my own um I I actually agree
with you guys um that's what I wanted us
to do um from the get-go she she asked
me to do it to teacher in this fashion
which is the way that we're doing it
because one of the things when you're
learning code and you're learning styles
is different is change it to your
learning style as well as try and make
it as least taxing as possible right so
she has me here but I'm also working I'm
busy and she's doing this three I always
want is help you know I charge money for
my help all right uh yeah well people
are living with you
nice day and night day and night day and
night um so it's nice gonna be on top uh
it's one of those things where she's
gonna be overwhelmed no matter what she
does right um I actually agree that I
think the implementing of bootstrap is
kind of counterintuitive and not and
I've kind of instructors trying to stay
away from that as much as possible as
well uh after April becomes a full-stack
a developer do you see the two of you as
a team doing side projects on a side
hustle
I have several side projects that are in
the works right now I'm building a agree
on projects that's the problem he wants
to make money and I want to help the
world yeah I'm happy to help the world
once we make some money like I don't
like I I can do a lot more help with
money than I can do with that right um
so I would imagine that in the world
where we work on a side project I have
already built it and now it needs to be
maintained and she helps in that fashion
with the business side or whatever uh uh
I don't know man that the thing is
whatever happens happens we're a long
way from that um so that's definitely
more than
yeah today's we're having for me to get
an internship yeah a hundred days she
gets an internship I'd be happy
um I'm gonna do my best to help her in
any way I can from resume projects
learning process and and answer
questions after those hundred days but I
am a hundred days of tutoring straight
is uh is that ever gonna do it again
yeah I I went through the hundred days
he's like I don't want to see your face
in here ever again no over it's never
happening that's what he said no I did
not say that's the exaggeration my
statement was that I am get I'm get like
the hardest thing to do guys is to set a
is to set a sort I'm looking for a
pattern a habit the hardest thing to do
is set a habit especially you're talking
about coding so if you can set that
habit and we are over a hundred days
straight
I'm missing every mark of a habit yeah I
think that uh she'll be continued going
on so what do you think about learning
nodejs once you have a beginner
knowledge of JavaScript and basically up
to objects I think you're jumping the
gun quite a bit man um because a lot of
times with no js' you're really using it
as a back-end connect databases so
you're gonna have to kind of get
familiar with databases as well as
create endpoints and things like this
that are it's not impossible but you're
definitely jumping the gun and I think I
think you'd probably have better it'd be
better for you to get a little bit
better with JavaScript and at least
finish the algorithm at get if you can
finish the intermediate algorithms and
all the projects and finish the
front-end you'll be fine uh it's
WordPress worth learning no oh and the
reason I say that is as I've worked in
WordPress by the way and so the money
that you would get and I say this it's a
money thing so if we were to do
WordPress developer salary just
something like that the amount of money
you would
get is for what you're more of a web
designer than anything else and it's
about 45,000 now if we were to do full
stack developer and you can so somewhere
between 40,000 58 full stack developer
salary you'll see that it's about 73
which is significantly higher than 44 48
and and this is actually a really low
average pay for a full stack developer
um that's a loaded question would you
invite us all to the wedding ah but uh
we're never getting married man we're
gonna be that couple that's 20 years
deep talking about look at all these
guys getting married so early on he's
gonna be single wanna be single so we're
on the 20 year plan one of us is I
thought we're on the 20 year plan
together Oh apparently not
Oh viviana plan together when you're
together yes that's it that was a junior
full stack salary anyhow um back to code
because that's what's important not
about our 20 year plan um anyhow guys
that's why a wordpress is also harder to
get it's more of a web design how do you
know you're a how do you know your full
stack developer without being
overconfident I mean I don't think
there's any problem with being
overconfident as long as you don't come
off cocky I mean I think it's I think
it's important to be confident there's a
difference okay so confidence is look at
all the work I've done this is what I do
this is what I stand for this is what I
do in and out being cocky is I'm the
 fest I don't have to show you
anything yeah I'm just a great you
should hire me off of what I tell you
that's being cocky I mean I I'm I can
tell you right now I know nothing and
I'm pretty confident even so because oh
yeah godless monkeys right here if
you're getting paid for you should be
confident ah juice box says if someone
wanted to start a blog what should they
do uh you could just use word for us if
you're really more focused on the
writing that probably be easy
um but I think they're I think what
happens is you have a you have to be a
little cocky to get a job for Ella I
don't think so I just think you have to
be honest and explain your skill sets if
you have to be a little cocky to get
into that job culture that's the culture
you're walking into yeah I think it's
more about being honest about where
you're at having good communication
skills good projects and explaining your
thirst to learn especially as a junior
developer um yeah it's a it's everyone's
developer journey is different and it's
very interesting so if you have to if
you if for you for you to learn the job
you have to use with confidence and
maybe you're actually not very qualified
for it but you're willing to put
yourself in a situation where I'm gonna
try my best and I hope I keep this job
that's okay if you're okay in that
situation what's the difference between
a junior Devon a dev internship well I
can speak about my work in in terms of
what's actually expected of the
individual so if you're in an internship
if you're in if you're in an internship
you're probably going to be given some
of the easier tasks for one um you're
not going to be doing a lot of
architecture if any right and let and if
they do have you doing architecture
chances are you're going to be doing it
on the very basic stuff also your work
will be more highly reviewed and you
won't you probably get paid less and
also but it's just like you would
imagine you would have someone maybe do
the you didn't want to do and the
easier stuff and you'd review their work
a little bit more than you might have
colleagues um they're usually worse than
junior devs that's basically it what is
the minimum amount of projects you
should put on a John Hawkes
if I had terrible grades in high school
is it still possible to get into a
university of washington NCI
for computer science well you have to go
to their page and look up as as possible
if they don't have anything listed there
about any policy or procedures for that
then give the admissions a call and see
if there's any possible way for you to
do that sometimes some of the options
that they'll have for you is either you
can go to a what is it a public college
get your grade get your GPA store or
increase your GPA at a community college
and then they'll possibly take you over
with your new GPA with all your gen Ed's
and stuff like that or sometimes you can
do clot testing sometimes they'll take
what does it experience as part of the
class if you can test out of it
so there's different types of tests that
you can to get into a college it really
depends on the college themselves
because it's their policies and their
procedures so there's no basic one that
everyone has to follow it's every
school's up to their own discretion on
how they want to handle that in terms of
and we'll make this the last question
before we get going here because I got
work on some YouTube stuff and oh I want
to have a popsicle is I would say the
the healthy range is three to five it
but that doesn't mean that you can't get
a job with one really impressive project
so if you've been working on something
and it's amazing it's got authentication
it's got a back-end a front-end it looks
great it functions great it's a great
idea you may get a job just based off of
that when it comes to your portfolio but
I would say five would probably be a
healthy max because if you start
throwing like ten then I gotta look at
ten they may look at five they'll
probably look at your first two and go
from there but I would say somewhere
between three and five and but don't be
discouraged if you only have one if it's
really good and that's when you should
be going for those internships and be
building up your resume and getting that
experience and going from there how
how's the hand
it is healing you see that my wrist got
bandaged up again and the scab is
holding my finger in there
ah it's good though man it's healing
it's going well
yeah it's it's a great field to be in
his heaven says lots of money to be made
with that stay motivated keep working
hard guys and I know you see April
you're doing it you only see her for
hour but she's finding two three today I
asked what a lot more tonight I spent
from 6 a.m. to 3 10 today so she was
that about nine hours nine hours of
cutting today so shoot but if she put in
some work today granny not everyone can
code nine hours on a game on a Wednesday
um D Chris Shawn get his first job only
knowing HTML CSS I believe so but I also
believe you took an unpaid internship as
well so I couldn't I couldn't tell you
you'd have to ask him but uh I I don't I
know he did take an unpaid internship at
some point anyhow but you want you want
to let us let us go okay all right say
say baby code long and prosper what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
