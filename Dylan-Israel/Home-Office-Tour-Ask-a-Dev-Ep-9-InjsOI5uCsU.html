my home office Georgia scuffle you've
asked me I force April to be in here so
she's sharing part of the office so you
wanna say anything maybe before I go
over my schpeel that's it that's all you
guys get so of course we have the three
posters here that kind of keep me
focused to remind me to code that's part
of the reasons why I keep these up
although I do think they look pretty
cool same with the other sort of plaques
up here we have the one where I
volunteered with code.org and then we
have you know leadership thing but then
most importantly the free code camp
certificate over here which I'm very
proud of by the way I took a lot of work
so we have the we have the whiteboard I
encourage everybody have a whiteboard
then a bunch of craziness printer Google
Wi-Fi router the futon now this i'ma
show you something very high-end and
custom this first insert here now this
has manually done this a custom job done
by our cats because I don't like the
windows closed so they can lay in bask
in the Sun now now not only is that
super baller and my cats are super
baller cuz of it they say you know what
one is not enough so they decided if I'm
on the left side of the couch I need to
make this other hole just right here so
that's that's the one little thing now
we have my desk over here with the you
can see I have the essential oil
diffuser going my desk is a automated
stand-up goes kind of slow but it works
it takes about 10 or 15 seconds two
monitors this setups actually gonna get
upgraded pretty soon and we get a third
monitor and once I upgrade my graphics
card a little wireless mouse keyboard we
got the blue Yeti microphone as well if
I step back for a second just kind of
give you how high up it goes it's about
forty six point eight off there you can
see the eye of the wall pretty much
sound proofed it helps but it's really
just cool more than anything
in my opinion right we got the simple
I'd like corkboards the super clean
closet and most importantly the Chuck
Norris photo in the corner or poster in
the corner that I have yet to put up and
I guess the last but not least we've got
some essential oils over here and then I
guess one other cool thing is we have
the Tryndamere and rice statues from the
League of Legends World Finals in season
two

little bit show you a little bit of
where the magic gets made now I guess
