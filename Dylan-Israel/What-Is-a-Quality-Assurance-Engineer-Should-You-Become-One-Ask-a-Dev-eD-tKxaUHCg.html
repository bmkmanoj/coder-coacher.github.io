want to let you know so you're not
worried that the guns you see in this
video they're all legally registered
guns you have nothing to worry about
yes I want to talk to you about Quality
Assurance testing what it is what the
the job role is and and what the future
holds for it and and right now it's it's
an interesting thing because I feel like
this this field is becoming more and
more appreciate appreciate it as time
goes on part of it is because more
companies are are hiring more QA
engineers because we're out there all
software companies and I'm starting to
realize that when their site goes down
when their app goes down because they
wanted to save money by not spending it
on on quality assurance testers that
they are losing hundreds of thousands if
not millions of dollars in some of these
cases and there's a newfound respect for
for QA engineering you can see here that
the national average for just one quick
thing I pulled up here out of 3,500
salaries it's about seventy eight
thousand dollars it's not too bad
now one thing to keep in mind as a
Quality Assurance engineer is from my
experience a lot of places a lot of
software companies will actually take on
recent grads and put them into put them
into a QA role and kind of meld them
into a developer later on it's a pretty
common practice where you might start
off in QA and then you'll move to front
end or you move to back end or you move
to full stack whatever it is but or you
may stay in QA if that's what you like
there's nothing wrong with that so what
is that entail well QA entails quite a
few things and essentially you rut you
make sure works and works
under certain circumstances right so
what I do at my work is I I do some
basic testing and what's what are called
unit tests now what that entails is you
essentially write functions that test
your functions in your application and
so say I have a function called add I
need to make sure that it adds
everything together and I get the
expected results so that's an example of
a unit test and then there's end-to-end
testing which essentially you will write
commands that will iterate through your
code and as if a user is clicking on the
screen and making sure that when you
enter here and when you enter there all
that all that works and everybody's
happy so that that's two examples
another another big thing if we have any
gamers the stress testing and what that
basically means is hey we are going to
your ear so your application works when
five people are using it or ten people
are using it what happens when we
simulate an environment which a hundred
thousand people are using it how does
that how does that how does it work out
for you then right because let's talk
about real world and as we've kind of
found out through the PlayStation
Network and the Xbox Live that sometimes
they don't do the best stress test
because when that happens things go
haywire right just servers are going
down and people are getting upset all
this sort of stuff but it is an
interesting thing in this I've had a
just a taste of kind of diving into it
and I've seen that my old work they had
about thirty developers in total and
about five of them were purely for
Quality Assurance a lot of their job
other than just writing tests and making
sure that the code that the the front
end and the back end developers wrote
worked and performed the way there
should be was hey we're about to push
this out right and the Quality Assurance
team it's their job to make sure that
nothing was missed so they have the test
but now let's actually click through it
let's see if we can break it and then
you you kick that out back let me
see if I can find this a great meme to
kind of quote this Quality Assurance
Gumby so this is this is a there's this
great jiff that I always have like that
is really cool area so this will pretty
much show you what happens
you got the designer production system
the QA like nope
your coat out of here because today it
is not passing right now you need to get
back to work basically and shown where
it's breaking so that's another another
aspect of quality assurance um well the
reasons I want to bring this up is
because a lot of times people think that
because I talk about full stack
development front end back end because
that's the that's the field I am and I
do as a full stack developer you will
typically depending on the size of your
team write some testing now that's fine
but you're not going to be doing as much
as a QA engineer would do because you
know you're in full sector you're you're
sort of pulled all which directions
because they want you to do as much as
you can in one way and that's good but
you can make just as much money as a QA
engineer as you work your way up one of
the reasons I wanted to bring it up is
because I had been getting some
criticism about not talking about other
things as much but I typically like to
talk about the the idea the things that
I've done and the things that I feel
comfortable talking about another
another reason I want to bring up is
because of the growth of QA our great
sponsor dev Mountain if you guys don't
know I'm sponsored by dev Mountain is
now launching a six-week boot camp to
become a QA engineer it's pretty pretty
cool in my eyes because I think this is
a field that you know there's so many
boot camps to focus entirely on
front-end development back in
development full stack development that
if you're a recent college grad or
you've just really liked QA and you want
to learn more about it you know here's
one of very few QA boot camps that
exists in Salt Lake City and free
housing and you know you'll you'll be
going over a little bit of get github
JavaScript so this is all stuff that you
know because to be a Quality Assurance
engineer you have to actually know how
to code right because you're going to be
working the unit test framework that I
use is called karma and Jasmine at work
that's that's built in that's a
JavaScript testing framework you've
specifically for angularjs so you have
to be comfortable doing that
writing manual tests that manually
testing code so you have to be able to
go through and see oh I think this might
break if I
do this based off how the codes written
unit test those are the examples where
you actually write functions that will
test the code automated tests that are
running in the background and those are
the the those are the like protractor is
one that I use so this is a this is real
stuff that we use this at work
protractor was the one where I tell you
you are writing tests that are actually
simulating how your code is going to run
in you if you it it's like if if this
was your project you would see the mouse
going and it typing it's pretty cool
actually when I when that when I look at
it
then there's the stress testing load
testing API testing this is super
important as well because a lot of times
in your applications you're building so
many endpoints at least in my project
where you need to ping you nee a pull
data and you need a post you need to do
gets and there's proper ways of testing
that to make sure that the data not only
it's going into the database and being
retrieved but are you retrieving the the
correct data because if you're not
there's huge issues and then agile so
agile is a part of the methodologies
that a lot of software companies work
kind of a project management mindset and
so it's pretty cool so at the end of it
you'll get of this you'll have some
projects and and I encourage you to
check that out if that's something
you're interested in I really love this
meme anything else I think this is this
is just this is just how I feel about
quality assurance but so you will be
picking up some testing skills as a
full-stack developer but if you want to
go in that direction in which you love
crushing the developer souls at the end
of the day when they need to get
something out and then QA is like nope
nope and then the big boss sometimes
will say look we just gotta ship it out
I understand QA saying it ain't ready
and uh I've seen that happen a couple of
times but uh you got to do what you do
sometimes but Quality Assurance is an
interesting role it's one of the one of
the things that I don't that I think you
might have a better chance I have any
stats to back this up on this is just my
gut feeling because there are less boot
camps that are going in this direct
right in the QA role or maybe you
already are a full-stack developer and
you just want to get you want to learn
something new you want to make you want
to get something on there I think you
should check out Quality Assurance as
well as add it to your applications one
of the things I've been saying about if
you're a developer or you're trying to
become a developer one thing that you
can do is just some basic testing
through unit testing usually like karma
or jasmine or mocha and chai and add it
to your application so that when you go
and you interview for these positions
you can let them know that you have the
the basic entry-level skill of that
skill set that will go a lot way it make
you stand out very few developers that
I've ever seen interviewed have any
testing in their portfolios just I've
built this this and this okay well you
know how can you how can you
differentiate yourself so that's another
great skill that you can add to the
resume so I encourage you to check out
look into Quality Assurance testing
software QA all that sort of stuff it's
one of the one it's it's a great starter
entry point for a lot of people who are
how can I break into to this how can I
move forward how can I do this for an
application because there isn't this
sort of sexiness to it and I say that
because a lot of people put emphasis on
building stuff and you are building
stuff but a lot of times you're testing
stuff that is already built and you're
making sure that it works properly which
is really important and unfortunately
sometimes in the smaller companies it's
just let's build something if it breaks
we'll fix it immediately but in larger
companies where a lot of QA roles are
you know you have this much more mature
outlook on software so I'll check it out
guys that's my two cents on quality
becoming a software QA engineer as
always thank you so much for watching
the video don't forget to join the
Facebook group support me on patreon all
that stuff all the links are in the
description below I'll see you next time
bye hey guys thanks for watching the
video special thanks to our sponsors dev
Mountain if you look for a coding boot
camp where tuition and housing is
included definitely check them out
appreciate it and I'll see you guys in
the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
