back in the twitch JSON API what we're
gonna be doing and this one is we're
going to be iterating through the array
that we just created doing another get
JSON we're gonna be using something
called to get JSON done that is slightly
different because some of these channels
don't exist so we're basically gonna
kind of get like a 404 error or
basically just an error that says hey
this guy doesn't exist and if we didn't
do the dot done it wouldn't come back
it's kind of like when you just do get
JSON you're thinking of the best-case
scenario like hey send a request and
then receive a response now a POSIX S
and a success
now the done will let us get a success
on our second try so in this situation
we send a request the response back hey
I don't have that and then I say oh do
you have something like this and I said
yeah we do and the send it back that's
kind of what the done does so we're
gonna go ahead and do that now because
we're gonna need to iterate through all
of this info here we're gonna be using a
for loop to do that and we're gonna be
doing multiple JSON calls alright so the
first thing that we want to do here is
we're gonna stay within this JSON
function here which is right here so
we're gonna run a for loop here that's
going to iterate through our array now
if you remember correctly our following
array is just a list of names that we're
gonna use and goodkat a string for our
get JSON done function so let's go ahead
and just get this set up so we're gonna
hit rate through the whole thing
all right Lavar and we'll call this URL
to is equal to let me just go ahead and
copy and paste this in here we're gonna
do the callback on here as well this
callbacks gonna allow it say all right
look if we get a response that's not
what we're looking for
callback go ahead and we're okay with
that essentially so we're gonna this is
where it's gonna get slightly different
so the dot get JSON we're gonna pass in
URL to here then we're gonna called dot
done on the function that we're going to
call our that we're gonna pass in a
parameter data 30s so slightly different
but easy enough to follow so and here's
where we're gonna do our code now
there's a couple things that we could do
i straight-up just create three
variables here three local variables one
for logo one for name and one for status
so let's do that our logo our status bar
name these will be the things that we're
going to input here so the first thing
that we want to do is we want to be able
to get the info that we want to let's
first check if we're getting an error so
we should be getting an air for comps or
404 and for also for Bruno fin so that's
gonna be what we're gonna do right now
now the way to check that is we I guess
we can just showcase this so we'll do it
like this so if data three dot air
exists so we're just gonna do that so if
there's a this parameter in here
the idea one too many so if David
three-dot air exists console.log URL -
and then I can show you so it looks like
that did not work why did that not work
instead of URL to call us about log beta
dot air interesting
oh I see what happened all right so
right here it looks like it thinks it's
a string and that's my fault I made a
mistake here we just have to get our
quotations right so there's some there
we go now we have unpossible entity so
that's how we know that we're getting in
there
why we know that let's go ahead and
output URL to it'll take us to what
we're trying to get so this is
University Oh soon comp sir 404 and
you'll see right here so comps are four
or four we're getting this status our
URLs not going through there because
it's not succeeding but this is where
we're getting that unprofitable and
unprofitable entity now let's go ahead
and so what's in here all we're gonna do
is basically do the output for the ones
that don't succeed so all we have to do
is set logo in here we're gonna set logo
equal to a URL of our choice because
they don't have an image so we're but we
don't want we want our stuff to look
fairly familiar so we're gonna go ahead
and set this like this so we have our
logo string and then from here all we're
gonna do is set name equal to data to
dot message we're also going to set
status
equal to data to dare and then we're
just gonna put prepend to our follower
info div right here now if you remember
this follower info is everything that's
gonna be below right below this and
we're just gonna add on to that because
to save myself some time and quotations
we're gonna copy pasta my my link in
here real quick my info and I'll explain
what's going on it's mainly just
bootstrap stuff and a lot of quotations
so we're gonna swap outdated message
here and we're gonna put in name and
we're gonna put in status
alright looks like a cure myself so
contact target select use the selector
follower info and prepend this HTML and
information to it here and then what we
should get is some stuff that isn't
loading it should be loving so let's see
what we did wrong here
there we go so undefined undefined we're
having some technical difficulties here
alright let's let's slow up for a second
right here so let's make sure our code
is working we instead want to let's take
out this console log as well we want to
console dot log name we're gonna
undefined undefined which you're not oh
this should be data three and data three
there we go so there's our info simple
mistake now all we're gonna do here
clear this clear this we're gonna do
exactly what I did a second ago Pender
data logo name and status
and I believe I've copied one of those
over and here we go so channel Bruno
Finn is not available status on possible
entity so this is our case for when the
channels just don't straight-up exist so
the next video what we'll do is we'll do
it for when they're offline and then
when they're online and those will be
the kind of the more straightforward
ones but as always guys thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video and thank you for anyone who's
been supporting me on patreon and
everyone that's shares I really
appreciate it helps a ton hey guys
thanks for watching the video my good
friend Matt an engineered truth has a
three-part interview with Quincy Larson
the founder of free code camp go ahead
and check that out and so you'll get a
lot of really cool stuff thanks for
watching and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
