rains of reason of the introspection
doing chessboard cell color now what are
we doing here well we have a board and
we want to know if they are going to be
on the same color or not now
you can tell by looking at the board and
mind you the horizontal are letters and
the vertical are numbers now but you
could tell by looking at the board that
is a perfect square and that there is a
pattern to it so you should kind of be
you should kind of be triggered on the
point that say hey there might be a
pattern here and there is now the way
that I solved this was I basically
converted these eight through G's to
their numeric values and then I I added
that I added the the board look the the
horizontal and the vertical together and
then what I did was I compared the two
the cell one first cell to to find out
if when we modulo it by two they're
identical if they are it means they're
on the same color so for instance we
have one and three so when we add these
together that's 1 1 is 2 3 1 is is 4 so
modulo 2 this is zero this is zero now
if we did 2 &amp;amp; 1 and you can see that
it's going to go for the same for all of
them by the way but if you did 2 in 1 so
this is 2 this is 3 modulo 1 and then
this is module 0 so if we follow that
pattern if you're able to see this
pattern it becomes very quick task and
again some of the things to look for and
I've talked about this in the top in the
past is the pattern recognition and they
give you a nice big perfect square here
with a clear pattern you should see that
something is up so how I did this was I
defined an object called board and this
is how we're going to convert our a
through G's so board is an object and in
here we're going to have a
na has a value of one we're going to
have B B has a value of two all the way
down to the H so C is 3 D is 4 B is 5 f6
G is 7 and finally H is 8 alright now
that we have our board set up we now
just have to we know that every letter
that's coming in each rather each
argument that's coming in will be start
off with the letter the horizontal and
then follow with the vertical so so we
know that we can go ahead and find
define our two variables total one which
is essentially cell one and we're going
to set this equal to a parson value from
the string value which is
the second value I did this in a strange
order so I'm going to change it up so
it's not confusing so we're going to
take our board remember that board we
just created and sell one zero we're
saying hey go ahead and return the value
associated with so if it's an a it's
going to return 1 if it's a beads can
return to so that's what we're doing
there and then we're going to parse the
end of the last character which is in
this case a 1 if we had parsing it
because the string obviously and we're
going to go ahead and add that together
so now that we have that we have total
one and let's go ahead and do total two
as well space here and it's going to be
the same thing except for the second
value so we're going to check the board
and say what is actually the numeric
value associate with ABC all the way to
G we SL to the first character and then
we're going to go ahead and parse the
end of the second character of the cell
- excuse me and then at the end here all
we have to do is we have to compare in
the day return total 1 modulo 2 that is
equal to the same value as total 2
modulo 2 if they are identical if it's 0
if they're both 0 it's true if one is 0
and 1 is 1 it's fall so they're both 1
is true and so when we do that we're
done that's basically it's just a matter
of following the pattern there's
probably a couple different ways you
know about this I think this is probably
pretty simple we didn't have to loop
through anything we just check a does
exist is another exist
I found this a kind of a fun one once I
realized hey there's a pattern here but
