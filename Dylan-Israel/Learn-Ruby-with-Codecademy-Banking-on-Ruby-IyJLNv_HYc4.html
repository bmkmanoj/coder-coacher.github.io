object-oriented program part 2 of Ruby
banking on Ruby so let's get started
it's a real quick one we took a quick
view at it so actually the first one
right here it's just it kind of shows
you what it is that will be making
attribute reader initialized stuff we
lead in the last section so let's go
ahead and get started so we're going to
create a class called account and in
this class we are going to the attribute
reader and we are going to say it's
going to work for a name and if you do a
comma you can continue it and bounce and
then we're going to find the initial is
it initialize Riley and that's going to
have the parameter name and balance and
we're going to automatically set the
balance to a hundred now we're going to
end that right there and then we're
going to say at name equals name and at
that point equals balance yeah let's see
here that should that should be good to
go alright so we have our name let's I
believe we can do with a comma but maybe
I'm wrong so good under furrier to see
if pulling balance let's see if that
works remember they needs to not be a
gap for that there we go so make sure
you don't have a gap for your attribute
reader add to private methods to account
so we're on a new method are where's a
private so private say death the class
or death been rather
and that then drive it also deaf and
understory air on that and then pinch
should have no arguments that set an
instance variable at pimp so if fins
going to have Pat pin equals log excuse
me pin at Penn equals 1 2 3 4 &amp;amp; chair
should simply return the string access
return access denied in Courage okay
cool same in sweat looks like your pin
air meant it doesn't return access
denied let's go ahead and just copy oh I
think we need a period on the end here
and now it should work nice so next
we're going to define a public sort of
public well death display under sport
balance to our account class and it
should take a seagull single parameter
pin and underscored number and then the
body of your method should check whether
pin number is equal to fan the result of
calling the pregnant should do they want
student if same possesses going on let's
go ahead and check back to the original
example so all right yeah that's what I
wants to assume so so if
if can underscore number is equal share
if it is display balance the body of
your method should check whether the pin
number is equal to pin the result of
calling private pin method is equal to
pin if it is display balance it puts all
right so if it is puts let's just go
ahead and copy this over so we don't get
any syntax or else we want it to put the
tener message so keen destroy error
let's go ahead save and submit but for
you alright so the route 9 23 so let's
see tweet we might need an end for our
ish statement so let's see here if else
this end goes nice with draw so if those
encourage finding a systematic retained
so this is a wireless collector I think
it doesn't give us very good error
messages right now and does it else puts
pinare see let's see if I think we may
need a hammock leiria so I make sure you
have an end for your if statement at a
public withdrawal method to your class
it takes two parameters pin number and
amount so out of public withdrawal
method so we're still in our our class
of the draw and in here it's going to
have n go to for number and it's going
to take amount and then if 10-4 number
equals 10 you rent the should try to
subtract the amount
we'll go ahead and just copy this in
here and bam and then an else statement
that says else we're going to display
our pinare message and then we want to
our guys sorry I took a quick break but
let's go ahead and get back to so I'm
going to reset the code and start fresh
right here so we're going to add a
public withdrawal method to remember it
public and then we're in death withdraw
and it's going to take two parameters n
underscore number and it's going to take
amount we're going to write an if
statement is n the cord number equals
pin this is your track Timon so we're
going to say at balance so we need to
keep track of their new balance equals
at balance minus amount and then we're
also going to say we're going to put
this put statement in it else we want it
to put the pen air saying that there's
wrong we need to end it and then we need
to end this as well and just clean this
up and that should work just fine so bad
last step create an instance of your
account called checking account so
checking on this for account equals
account new give it whatever name you
like and we'll just say pizza poker guy
and starting balance you like and we'll
just say I have 2500 I don't want sound
too bro
alright so we created a new account and
now we have it working so if we wanted
to call some methods on it we would say
checking underscore account dot display
on your score balanced and we need to
add our pan just one two three four and
now when we run it it will display our
balance of 2,500 and that completes our
our final Ruby critical stuff estimated
nine hours of time it's beginner level I
hope you enjoyed the tutorial next up
will be doing ruby-on-rails later on to
take a little bit to to get there also
be doing some Ruby API so so if you're
interested in that check the other
videos but thanks for watching I'll see
you guys
