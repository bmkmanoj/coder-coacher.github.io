fights doing Bishop and pawn of the dark
wilderness of the intro of the arcade
section now what we're tasked with here
is we are getting the position of a
bishop and we're getting the position of
a pawn if you don't even think about
chess upon can only move forward and a
bishop can move diagonally we only care
about the diagonal we want to know can
our Bishop as you can see what these
circles hit our pawn that's basically
what we're checking here and what we can
do how I did it was I created a board
object and if you watch the other video
in which I so I use it use a board
object to find out there's another chess
related video on here another chess
related algorithm I don't remember
exactly what it was off the top of my
head but I kind of recycled that logic
for finding out what board piece we're
looking for so I create my board here
and basically what we're trying to do so
you see we have abcdefgh and then we
have one two three four one two eight
what we're trying to do is we're just
going to convert those abcdefgh s which
are in here our moves are a is a 1 or C
is a 3 we're go ahead and convert those
to a number that's why we're creating
this it's a board or a probably a better
name for this would be x coordinate or a
maybe um any I'll name it whatever you'd
like
EF G and finally H
all right
the next thing we're going to do and is
we're going to get the x coordinate and
the y coordinate of the bishop and the
pawn so let's go ahead and create
variables to store that so remember our
bishop our we're getting it put in as a
string or call this Bishop X we're going
to set this equal to the board object
and we're going to pass in Bishop or the
first character of the bishop string
that is going to in case a it's going to
reset this to one right and then we're
going to go ahead and do the same
something similar to the Y because Y is
already a number all we have to do is
parse the in on that character so we
have Bishop y and just parse int and
I'll turn it into an integer and that
will be Bishop 1 for the second
character we're going to do the same
thing here except now we're going to do
it with the pawn and we're say let con X
be equal to the Ford of fish up excuse
me up a pawn 0 1 my apologies sir
so that's gonna give us our x coordinate
and then we're going to get the pawn
y-coordinate equal to the Board of not
boys I can assert assessing here of the
int that is the second character in that
in our first test here c3 it's going to
get parsley on one character art so now
we what we have here is the x-coordinate
and the y-coordinate of the bishop and
the pawn we're going to set a single if
statement that is going to return true
if it is the case now what we have to
calculate is the vert whether the
whether the diagonals in either
direction down or up are on the same
path and we can do that just by adding
the the values together or by adding the
X with the pawns what the bishops x with
the pawns y and the pawns X with the
bishop Y to see that so that's where
that more statement goes and so the easy
one to kind of understand today if
bishop x plus bishop y is exactly equal
to paw and y plus phone x then return
trip however this will only solve about
half the use cases we then have to take
care of some other ones that are going
to be added on as well and the reason
for that is say you're right here you
need to kind of be able to figure out
this coordinate as well so there's two
use cases so say our pawn is here or our
Bishop is here and our pawn is here
we're just going to do some additional
math or here or here whatever wherever
it's at but we just have to figure some
things out and it gets a little strange
but it took me a second to kind of fully
understand it but Bishop X so in the
case that they're not identical in that
fashion
another way that we they can be on the
same location is if we add our Bishop
and
if we add our Bishop X and our pon Y and
our pawn X and our Bishop Y if those are
identical it is also a true statement
so if either one of these statements are
true with my girlfriend send me maybe
it's not a live stream appropriate
picture that's good
what is this is send let's go ahead and
close that real quick so Bishop y plus
on X so if those are identical it's also
true now those are the only two cases we
need if neither of those are correct we
will automatically return false and
there we go we are done that is it again
it goes back to just kind of being able
to find a pattern that goes with the
board and understanding what calculates
the path of this Bishop to pawn ratio so
we basically just say hey calculate the
the true statements after we break it
down into a numerical value with our
board object in the land bam thank you
ma'am we are done but as always guys
thank you so much for watching the video
