section control flow switch in PHP and
here at Asus write an if else if an else
statement so we'll just use one is
greater than to bear if one is less than
two I go out one is less than two and
remember we have to put a space here or
it messes everything up else if two plus
some 10 something went wrong with our
page let go this oh and then one last
else and the let go out we don't forget
our semicolon my fill out this area
still I come on sis syntax error on line
17 i'm going to copy this and refresh
the page
so let's save and smitten this shit'll
work so we have one is less than 20
quite sure why the signal is pretty now
taping your toes and switch statements
try and figure out which the case was
gets ex-students submit so switching
cases are just kind of like if
statements with outcomes I guess so
switch to is case 2 so the value is to
just come out
alright so on line 10 there's a switch
statement saying switch Apple insane
fill spots the correct code so this will
be case 0 we get rid of Apple here or
actually let's try like this case 0
Apple echo and now we need to break it
see if that works
ok so this case we're just using Apple
we're just testing around here
alright let's see this case it looks
like that should work though so case
apple then we break it so let's just go
ahead and copy this real quick and we're
going to refresh the page and see if
that will work once we owe it looks like
we have to instantiate the default that
says echo none of the above garriott
semicolon
cool there we go that was the issue
you're having place the two underscores
to make the switch also check for three
and four so let's look at our exam
player all right so so in case one some
case 3 k's or not sure if this will work
let's go ahead and find out doesn't look
like it's going to make sure you're
checking for three
I was going to hit here but they want us
to combine them so okay I guess that's
all they wanted us to do all right you
have two ways of creating a switch
switch and then n switch just a
different syntax and that ur you have
the code of the previous exercise makes
make the kids use the alternative syntax
rather than a curly brace okay so in
this case we're just in colon we're
going to take out this and then we're
going to call and switch so Michael it
should be it or fresh the patients PHP
sections having issues on here
save and submit there we go now our last
section create a switch statement with
three different cases and a default I
personally like the switch statement
let's say here with the brackets is what
i like and Wilson will create a variable
here called i say i is equal to one look
for this then we'll do case 0 echo this
is case 0 the case 10 this case one and
then we'll do is to echo this is case 2
that was our default default and that
should work oh no we need to break all
right great
so did we declare switch incorrectly so
so let's see so let's see here we're
going to control our the page and look
at our hint here right just in debt
because they have it I don't think I
need to there goes alright so cool we're
going to share as we always do and our
next section it looks like we're going
to be getting into array so raise her
pretty much an integral part of
programming and shouldn't be any
different in PHP so we'll see you guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
