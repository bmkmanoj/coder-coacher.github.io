might I say in Ruby on Rails I've been
avoiding this because I struggled with
it I was able to finish the first
section but it did take me about five
attempts so then I haven't touched it
for about three months so we're working
our way we're gonna work our way through
the first step here and this was called
what was a comb Oh just whatever the
first start section is so in this case
it looks like we're going to tell rails
to create a new my site now if I
understand this correctly this is going
to generate all the files that we're
going to need for our Ruby on Rails so
you can see it creates all that we need
for the Rails object my site so next we
want to run bundle install and it looks
like maybe this adds some libraries
various libraries that we need cool and
then we need to call rails server and
that does some stuff as well and we can
view our rails app by going to localhost
so this is kind of where we're at right
now not too bad so next up all right so
rails new created a new rails app called
my site cool so we were right about that
bundle installed did install all the
software packages that we needed
apparently those are called gems and I
referred to as gem files and the rails
server command starts the rails
development server so we can preview the
app cool so let's move on so looking at
the request response cycle we need three
parts to build rails applicant roller a
route and view let's start by creating a
controller cool so we're gonna say rails
generate controller pages
so cool that has generated our
controller pages so that's our
controller we need a route in a view so
let's see here I got an opener open the
apps
oops it was apps controller pages
controller dot RB within the class pages
controller Adam method so we want to go
here just select the directory app and
then when you know what selected
directory controllers find only
controller oh ok just under support
control huh what do we do it from in
here so now controller pages controller
arm Oh pages controller there we go
so let's open that up so cool so we open
up this file and you can see there's
nothing going on in here right now so
let's go ahead and add def home so we
want to add a home function that doesn't
look like it does anything
right there goes took a second alright
now that we have a controller let's move
on the second part of the request
response icon credit route so in this
case we wanted to open up config I think
it was routes our views what was it
yeah trots RV so routes are be open that
up opening it underneath line one
so under line one the rest of this is
commented out we want to say get welcome
to okay just
cool that's going well note that we have
a controller and a route
listen third part and create a view so
view it looks like it's gonna be our
HTML this is gonna be how it looks oh
you okay just that's what I wanted so
let's go ahead and just copy this I
don't feel like typing this out so we
have a div classmate in a container and
a hello my name is my name is Dylan I
make rails apps we may be ahead of
ourselves with this commented but let's
let's keep going with it
cool let's see what our rails app looks
like now so it should have hello my name
is Dylan I make rails apps not too bad
not too bad um apparently it's
inheriting some styling somewhere but
that's probably one of the classes that
is generically created so cool it looks
like is at the end of it so so far we've
been able regenerate our new rails app
generator controller add an action a
route and then view it with HTML CSS so
in the next video it looks like we're
gonna be going more into the request and
response cycle so look forward to the
other video so I'm hoping to have them
all out in a few days and as always
questions comments concerns all that's
appreciated and I'll see you guys in the
next video
oh and I created a forum on my channel
page of Google Form that if you want to
help me with some advice it's just like
a questionnaire and then a second you
know ask a couple questions
that'd be that would help but a
tremendous moment bye guys thanks for
watching the video don't forget to Like
and subscribe that'd be great and leave
me a comment letting me know what you
liked about the video what you didn't
like about the video see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
