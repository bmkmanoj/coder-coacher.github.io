in free code camp we're working on those
intermediate algorithm scripting and
what are we doing we're doing convert
HTML entities so what is that entail so
essentially some special characters like
and the carrots or the Lila quotations
they have these HTML entities or HTML
values so for instance the + sign is a
that amp semicolon and you know the this
this is for the less than carrot budding
off so that's basically what we're going
to do so the way I tackled this project
was simply by by breaking the whole
thing up industry as an array of
characters and then from there doing a
for loop and if we encountered any of
these five or six things I just did a
switch statement in which we then
replaced it so let's just go ahead and
get started so first thing first we're
going to create a variable called
placeholder and we're going to set this
equal to the string that we get inputted
and we want to split it up on every
character pretty pretty straightforward
so far next we're just going to do a
standard for loop we're going to say for
VAR i is equal to zero while I is less
than placeholder dot length I plus plus
because we want to iterate through the
whole thing correctly and if it's been a
while since you've used a switch
statement the way you start off to
switch and then you want to put what do
you want what do you want to check this
is basically where you put the value of
what it is that you're checking in here
and in this case we're it's going to be
our placeholder
the current value of our placeholder I
and
then : and now what so next we need to
do our case cases so the case is where
you say look if it's this value do some
stuff so let's say just you what let's
see what was the first one so this first
one is to replace the ampersand if I
remember correctly is that the correct
name of that but the + sign that and
then again it's : so that we started me
off I'm just like the brackets a little
bit better so we're going to say look
when it's that take our current
placeholder that we're on and set it
equal to this value and it is this camp
put that in there
I'm sure you don't have that space or
I'll probably throw everything else a
semicolon and then we're going to break
it so that it doesn't keep on repeating
the reason that we're gonna just dot the
reason that we use the break here is
because we're actually using some things
here that may hit it again so what's
going on here
statement body should be inside braces
oh excuse me there we go yes there we go
so the colons are on the cases the
switches use brackets alright so when we
run that you can see oh and then of
course if you do it the way I do it I
always you're we're going to need so
after we do the additional statements
we're gonna then need to take our
placeholder or set STR equal to our
placeholder and but we need to join the
array back together the array of
characters back into a bunch of strings
so we want to say equal placeholder join
and we want to join it on every letter
so now when we return our string it
should placeholder is not defined
there we go cool so you can see right
here is four that's the first thing so
let's just go ahead and start a knocking
out the other cases so our next case if
according to my notes here is the lesson
sign so again if you want just do a
break before you forget and then we're
just going to say look our current
placeholder you want to do it I is equal
to and in this case just go ahead and
copy that over not sure what what that
dot is and now when we do that and all
the Sun hmm
right okay let's go ahead and let's just
see what this outputs it's always good
tester cut step by step again with the
placeholder sure you follow your naming
convention
I believe what I'm using is camelcase is
what I was taught first and in Java more
or less I kind of apply it to everything
I'm not quite sure if this is correct
for where's the standard rather for
JavaScript so anyhow so we're going to
do the greater than sign now : go ahead
and throw our break in and we're we're
gonna say placeholder eye is equal to
let's go ahead and put this in the
old-fashioned way and GT someone :
so my clone we're gonna run it real
quick cool there's our next one I should
make a note that there is a much better
way of doing this um this is kind of why
regular expressions were invented
because we're only doing five or six
here but you can see how we just did
three it's taken a lot of lines of code
and it's going to run slower in a big
application compared to anything else so
what are we going to train the next
thing we're going to do is quotations so
in this case we want to do single quotes
and say look when we hit one of these
quotations we hit this quotation here
through our break in here and then we
want it to mark SEC quote so we want to
say place holder I replace placeholder
current replace the current placeholder
with
Marx and quote don't like lime semicolon
that should be that go ahead and run
that let's see my nameless marks
stuff in quotation marks let's go ahead
and just put this in here make sure we
invest anything up let's see this might
be it right here
uh-huh
oh it says this you take out this marks
I don't know well I have marks in here
and a quote there we go so just the end
quote and then last but not least we
have the apostrophe so case put the coal
in we want to break it in this case we
actually need to use the double the
double quotes to distinguish here or
else it doesn't work so we're going to
do place holder I is equal to at a pause
semicolon semicolon and that's that so
again you can do this regular
expressions and filter it and basically
you know replace whatever value that
hits that regular expression but for
this this also works so regular
expressions better way of doing it but a
sometimes it's just about getting your
code works so let's go ahead and calm in
our code because it's uh we're gonna I'm
probably going to use this later on in
life and even so it's just good good
practice so a subscriber today brought
it to my point that I've been putting my
comments underneath my code which may be
confusing because I believe the
standards put it above so for now on
I'll be putting the the comments above
just something think about you know
always trying to improve the little
things really do matter in programming
so here we're going to split strings
string into character
iterate through character array check
current value of character and that's
what we're doing in the switch and then
we'll do we'll just do a general one
here if a case is met replace with HTML
entity and then finally down here we
want to join character back into string
and that's that so I hope you guys found
this helpful
as always keep on doing not cut trying
to improve your code the best you can in
this case I just did the comments above
because that's kind of standard and that
it makes more sense really so that you
can read what it is and you see it so I
hope you found it helpful I'll see you
guys in the next video thanks for
watching don't forget to Like and
subscribe and thumbs up if you just same
things like I'll see you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
