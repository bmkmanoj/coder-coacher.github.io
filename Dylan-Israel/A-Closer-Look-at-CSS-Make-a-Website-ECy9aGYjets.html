in code Academy we are doing make a
website they've reworked this course we
have done in the past so we're doing the
new version
we're in unit 2 a closer look at CSS
cascading style sheets it would have
been cool if they use its use sass
instead of this but that's not what they
did so it looks like we're going to be
building a little page with a link and a
background image so let's use index @hl
main CSS inside the head element and
index.html so we're gonna go ahead and
pull up in duck stat HTML click open so
it's asking us in our head element to
insert a link that contains a link it
looks like this is already done so
they've already done this for us or
perhaps I did this step first so let's
go ahead and go to next so now you're
gonna see if you think so how does this
work so in this case in the CSS styling
we're going to define the element the
name or the class in this case we're
talking about h1 we're then gonna use
brackets and within there we're gonna
set properties so in this case we have
color colon then red semicolon to end
that property so it may not CSS oh my
goodness
in main.css we want to locate our h1 so
here's our first heading this is
probably an h1 right here and we'll be
able to see the changes so we're gonna
say for the property font - family we
want to give it the font Palatino now
the reason there's multiple fonts here
and the commas is because some browsers
depending on what browser you're using
certain fonts may or may not be
available so we have backup fonts they
go in the order left or right we're
gonna palatino and then we're gonna
Palatino Linotype and then we're gonna
have serif and now when we run it you'll
notice that our h1 here change pretty
cool that's really what we're going to
be doing a styling now styling is a huge
part of the way you organize in the way
you construct your web pages and web
applications so this is definitely um
not as code intensive as maybe a
programming language but styling is
definitely important so in this case in
the h1 we want to go ahead and add the
font family we want to add you must set
our h1 color to red so that's when we
run it we is now red not bad so it's
will go deep sky blue so these are some
colors I didn't even know or part of
styling typically most of the time
you'll put in RGB values or you'll put
in hex colors if I'm saying that right
and I apologize done' so scott deep sky
blue it's pretty nice i like that and
then now you'll see that we can put in
our hex color so we'll go ahead and do
this one this is what i was talking
about a second ago
so you'll notice that that one was kind
of a soup pea green and then we can also
take the we can do RGB colors as well so
there's multiple ways of defining the
color depending on what color you want
you can do RGB like so you've red green
blue value and now when we run it
they'll change to what looks to be some
sort of pink
now we're gonna be working in it looks
like our index.html now in here it so
excuse me we written so there's a div
that is called hero now this is a class
the way you did note classes are with a
dot so classes you can reuse now what
it's asking us to do here is set the
font family so that the font family for
everything on the PC for everything in
the diff so you'll notice right here
that there isn't it's saying there's a
to two tags so it's saying look when
you're in the hero class and it's a link
this is what you what we want you to do
so don't change that the more specific
of classes or a heading is like this the
that's kind of the order things going so
in this case we're just going to go
ahead and change the font family
- Trey Boucher MS and if they don't have
that will take loops hell better CO and
if they don't have that will take sands
- Sarah go ahead and run that and you'll
notice that it changed the font style
all right
so typically H once all the way up to I
believe h6 the h1 being the largest h6
being the smallest they have some innate
sort of sizing so in this case we're
gonna set our h2 I want to set the font
size to be a little bit bigger so we're
just gonna go ahead and do 48 px and
when we run that you'll notice that
that's a little bit bigger now exactly
as we wanted now we want it apparently
they want us to change it again and they
want it to say that that's still too
small so all we have to do is change it
to 56 running it's gonna get a little
bit bigger pretty nice and now for the
piece selector ad font size so P is our
paragraph tag now to ram let's go ahead
and do that long so it's too green now
it - MS emphasis I don't remember what I
rammed the differences with Ram so let's
see here
okay so they're not exactly gonna tell
us using REM values I don't exactly
remember what REM values are I know at
like e/m emphasis it means they're
basically two times in its normal value
which we'll be doing in a second here
but it's saying right here let's resize
our anchor attack so what we're
basically gonna do is take whatever
value it is right now and we're gonna go
ahead and go font size and set it to
whatever would be standard to 1.25 now
now this may be smaller or bigger so
this is one point two five times the
normal size essentially now a decrease
we chose 24px is larger than what that
is cool the next thing we're gonna do is
be adding a background image now this is
pretty straightforward in this case
you're going going to the CSS and we are
in our hero class now if you don't
remember what the hero class contains
it's this whole div so basically it's
it's gonna cover this whole section here
it's our main div so in this case all
we're gonna do is go background - URL
excuse me background - image URL don't
read some icon in the side here we're
gonna put quotes and then we're gonna go
ahead and take this URL put it in here
say look this is the image you want to
get from this location and now we have
our sprouts so in the web browser we
assume is kind of close up that is true
so we can definitely style it so this is
more very important because as we as
technology has developed people spend
more time on their phones than they do
on computers and so that means that you
have to kind of use responsive design
and this is not necessarily responsive
design but it's kind of practical design
and at the end of the day responsive
design is practical design meaning that
you have to kind of think these things
out like you can't really choose a
perfect image well you can do is you can
then zoom out so now this is only going
to cover the whole image based on the
size of the window
so you'll notice right here that the
image isn't getting distorted we're not
zoomed in but it's just gonna kind of
cover the entire width without
distorting it so that's that finally and
watch h2 and P they should give the
Harrow selector of the color property
all right so we're gonna say in our hero
class here we want to go ahead and just
color things so if as long as none of
the other classes are more specific it
will inherit this value right here which
is the color white and now we have white
not bad
so now what we want to do is set the ID
now IDs you only use once and these are
unique classes you can use multiple
times so we're just going to go ahead
and set this to footer and now the way
you denote a ID from a class is you use
the hash tag or the pound sign if you're
a little bit more old-school like I am
so we haven't actually given it any code
yet but in this case we're just gonna go
ahead and define it as font size 0.75 m
we write and run that oh excuse me your
m and that's gonna change the footer as
you can see down below here it's much
tinier and more standard it's how things
would normally look so that was our
completed lesson for CSS like closer
