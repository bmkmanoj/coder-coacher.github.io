Python as you can see I have a little
bit experience with it um I've had some
coursework I had one course of Python
that's why it's kind of partially done I
got gave myself a little bit of briefer
on it so we're just going to start fresh
because I haven't touched in a while at
the end of this we're going to do
something a little bit different at the
end of the course rather the course I
took our final project was we made a
game out of Python using the PI game
library so what I'm going to start doing
is when we finish this Python every week
I'm going to upload a video showing how
to do a simple thing using the PI game
library because that way we can get some
hands-on stuff with our own labs and I
can get some source code for myself for
potential projects that I can show the
employers and stuff like that even
though it's just going to be a game
we'll decide on the game and maybe I'll
do a poll or something but you know
let's get started we're in Python syntax
and I'll have to reset the code as we go
so ready learn Python click Save and
submit code done so it looks like print
statement it's just straight-up print
and then followed by by the quotes and
if I remember with Python
they are very like that I believe that
you have to space everything perfectly
why I could be thinking PSU bang-up so
we're going to set the variable my
underscore variable so it doesn't look
like we need to use quotes or anything
here or semicolons save and submit so we
have a my variable that's how you set
the variables it looks like it's just
going to automatically be set to an
integer when we give it an integer value
so same thing here
my underscore int equals 7 my underscore
float equals one point two three and if
you're not familiar the float is it's
just a number with a decimal place of
one point two three for example in this
case then my under school bull we're
going to
that's a true and Oh capital trip
make sure your boolean is capitalized
BAM
good to go here so try it and see change
the value of my int four seven to three
and then it in the editor rather so we
have three we're going to reset that to
three and so now it's going to override
it because we've changed the value of it
and it's going to print out three cool
so let's take a look at this and see
what's going on here so it looks like we
have a def which is our function or our
method called spam we're going to say
eggs is equal to 12 returned eggs then
we want to print spam so we should get
12 file Python indentation err you
should see an error message okay
so you see right here it says we should
see it so continue on so properly indent
the code before spaces before eggs and
line two so it looks like these need to
be indented so one tab you just select
it in tab and now because it's indented
it should work properly and you can see
right here we now it works properly
because we have 12 so Python is very
syntax and indentation sensitive so I'm
going to reset this so we're incredible
called spam and we're going to set it
equal to true and then we're going to
create a variable called eggs we're
going to set that equal to false
all right so let me sit code so the
comment a is pretty simple it's just
pound this is for single line comments I
believe I don't I don't remember what
the multi line is so we'll say this is a
comment period cool so if we want to do
multi-line comments it looks like we use
a couple brackets so you're going to
need six in total and we're going to say
this is a multi-line comment let's clean
that up a little bit this is a
multi-line comment yeah so let me save
and submit there we go it looks like our
code is working very nicely so pound and
then the triple parenthesis so it's
going to reset this so now we're going
to set the variable count to the equal
to sum of two numbers so if you're
familiar with any sort of coding at all
this should be very simple so let's just
do 723 plus 7 I don't know why and we
should get 730 and we're good to go we
can do the same things for
multiplication
so in this case we want 100 eggs and we
don't want to do a 10times then we want
to do to the power so this would be
multiplication but to the power we want
it like that so 10 to the power of 2 and
we should get a return of 100 and use
modules that spam equal to 1 you can use
any two numbers I believe remained
everyone to do this so modulo is
basically what number so you divide 3 by
2 you're going to have a remainder of 1
and your module will be 1 so 3 divided
by 3 is going to be 0 because there's no
remainder so we want a remainder so
we're going to 3 modulo 2 let's do 10
modulo 9 so we're going to have a
remainder of 1 and there we go
so just a quick review
it looks like write a single line
comment so that's just the hashtag or
pound or an percent if I said that right
it's for the loss if I use a millenials
kids call this the hashtag comment what
else are we want to set a variable of
Manti equal to true and we want to set a
another variable python equal to 1 point
2 3 4 and then we want to set a third
variable equal to fight on squared so we
want want t underscore python equal to
one point or equal to python to the
second power and we should be good to go
and that was our first quick
introduction to the python syntax up
next it looks like we're going to be
doing a tip calculator so you have that
to look forward to it looks like it's
only 5 sections so it's pretty quick the
overall course is about 13 but I'll see
you in the next video for the tip
calculator and as always constructive
criticism is always</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
