in freak cook Adam II we're back in code
Academy doing HTML and CSS learn HTML
CSS part 1 in the third section CS
fundamentals doing the CSS setup so what
does CSS stands for cascading style
sheet now it's very important when
dealing with CSS to understand the point
of it its style it's basically hTML is
great to get out the bear content but
CSS is what makes it look good and
that's that's really what you need to
know about it and you have to link to it
if you watch some of the earlier videos
we talked about how you might do this
you'll see right here they're actually
importing a font and you'll what they
want us to do now is link to our CSS
sheet so we're going to put this in here
the href is where this sheet is located
this is a relative URL you may want a
hard-coded type you're gonna put text
slash CSS and then rel is stylesheet
this is basically saying look if we call
a class or we call an ID or an element
that they're styling for please use it
from this file this is our style sheet
now you can write CSS directly in your
HTML if you would like using a style tag
this is generally considered a bad habit
but it's it you're gonna want to get
comfortable with good folder structure
and separating things out but I guess
it's good to understand that you would
want to do this so what we could do here
in our head tag is just go ahead and put
this style tag slash style
this is basically saying similar to
aware HTML tags this is where we're
gonna put some styling options so we put
it in the head like so granted there's
no style in it but this is where we're
gonna put it in the head within the
style now this asterisk here let's go in
a copy and paste this in here so this
astrick tears st. basically goes for
everything that this applies to so
everything that a font family a pop
flies to go Georgia then x then Sarah
so if Georgia isn't available x is the
backup and if that's not available serif
from there now here we're gonna go ahead
and put in the you'll notice that
there's brackets with all these as well
this is basically where this the name or
the element are there the class or the
ID everything in there same thing here
we're targeting anchor tags color is
going to be a sea green tech decoration
text decoration is basically let's go
ahead and run that you'll see our learn
more is no longer there but that's green
our font has changed as well and then
finally image we're gonna set a border
radius of 100 so once you set that to
100 it becomes a circle a border radius
basically is the styling that that goes
around the corners do you want to pull
it in at all so let's go let's go move
on
so this goes in they start talking about
what I kind of suggested was this is
generally bad practice yes you can input
style directly into your HTML document
but at you'll learn as you progress and
as you become better web developers or
web designers you're gonna definitely be
breaking these files up it's just gonna
get too complicated and you're gonna
need you're gonna want things to be as
simple as possible and may feel a little
weird we were getting started but you'll
get used to it all right so in this case
they want us to cut out the styling here
and because we're removing that Oh we'll
do that next so what we're gonna do is
actually remember how we linked to our
run this real quick it looks like we
didn't do it yet so we we put we're
putting all our style in here but notice
how it's not displaying first let's go
ahead and remove these style tags we
don't need any more but none of our
style is just displaying it's because
our our link isn't referencing anything
it's not there so this goes into the
href it's basically the path of the file
the type for CSS this is Tex slash CSS
rel is style sheet so we're going to do
is just take this link and put it in our
head file like so so let's go ahead and
we'll do it piece by piece
notice that there's no closing tag for
this as well it's just link
now we're gonna add the location on the
file with an href say HR F is equal to
this is gonna be slash style that I CSS
go ahead and run that we're gonna put a
you'll notice that it's there and we're
gonna put the type and we're gonna set
that equal to text slash CSS and then
we're gonna go ahead and add the rel and
this is gonna be equal to stylesheet
don't worry too much about what all this
means and what all this does just
understand that if you're linking to
other files at other style sheets you
need to know the location with the href
and then you just have to input the type
in the row that's all you really need to
know from that and now because we did it
everything got styled nicely
blink style.css to index.html alright so
let's go ahead and do that one more time
so we have a link and then we have an
href which is equal to slash style
close that dot CSS and then we have a
rel which is equal to excuse me a type
that is equal to X slash CSS and then we
have a rel which is equal to a
stylesheet let's go ahead and run this
and now you'll see that we have this
beautifully designed page so it kind of
really shows you what some good CSS can
do for you and why it's so important
this looks much better than what we had
before I hope you guys found this
helpful and trying to understand or
actually let's go over weight length we
learned that CSS for styling we learned
that you need to link to other uni it's
better to link to a style sheet rather
than you say a style tag and we learned
how to do that now in the upcoming
lesson we'll probably learn a little bit
about some more common styling
attributes that we can set to stylist as
