doing check palindrome so what is a
palindrome it means that a string is the
same forward as it is backwards or
either they give you a nice little
description here is same left to right
as it is right to left so a a B a a is
true while a B a C is false and then a
is true as well right there's only one
character so it's always going to come
true so how can we go about solving this
the way that I did it
and you'll see right here that says
consisting of lowercase characters so in
theory a palindrome should be the same
if it's uppercase or lowercase so if
they didn't actually assign say say that
the input was going to be lowercase
characters you would have to go and
change that as well in the string so
we're not going to do that but what we
can do here is we can say we do a simple
return statement using the ternary
operator and what a ternary operator is
is essentially a if or else statement
shorthand you have your statement in
this case we're going to say is input
string equal to input string dot split
now what this does is it breaks it up
into an array of characters now let's go
ahead before we actually do anything and
I'll show it piece by piece because it's
going to get a little long it's going to
get fun so you can see here it breaks
our string ABAC into a b a c a character
array we're breaking it up on each
character now the the now that it's an
array we can reverse the array with the
reverse function so now it's going to be
cava or whatever see ABA
once we call reverse on it and you'll
see there's our cabba and now that it's
reversed we have the reverse version in
a ray form but we actually want to go
ahead and put it back into string form
we can do that with the function join
so now when we run it we're going to get
back kava so our output is kind of it
now all we have to do from here and say
hey if input string we actually don't
even need to use a ternary now that I
think about it are these identical
it's the string that we put in that we
now reversed that we broke into an array
reverse the array and then joined it
back into strength are they identical
the return statement will evaluate if
that's the case and when we run it why
is it taking so long you'll see that we
passed so we don't need a F or announcer
a ternary operator we actually just put
this as a statement and we're done
so we split it up into a an array we
reverse that array and then we joined it
back together and compared it with the
original string and that is how we were
able to solve this is it a palindrome
