in code combat we're gonna be doing the
race sword we're doing this in
JavaScript we're gonna be working with
basic syntax and strings
so we're basically learning the ins and
outs of JavaScript the core essentials
of any programming language is always
starting with the syntax cuz if you
don't know how to write something you're
not gonna be able to code that's pretty
much it so what we need to do here is we
need to feed the ogres we also need to
remember that these guys take three hits
or two dates so all we have to do is
command our hero to attack and who do we
want to attack we want to attack a rig
and we want to do it again and we want a
grade once more and then we want to
attack dirt and we want to attack dirt
once more so we're telling our hero
object to run the method or function
that then takes in the parameter which
is a string which is their name to know
who to attack that's what's going on
right now so we're saying have our hero
guy attacked twice this person and then
we repeat that two more times
essentially
alright let's go ahead and run that
so Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam oh I got rolled
over we're gonna need to go by the
tarnish bronze breastplate so here it is
fifty 50 coins our code was right we
just weren't strong enough to survive
that so we need more HP so not too
shabby it's good to know that we're
coding correctly we just weren't able to
survive the attack let's go ahead and
try it one more time we run this you'll
see where a look we're a lot tank here
our health rarely goes down and cool
we're gonna go it's important to
remember that this is a game as well as
a learning story so there are gonna be
game aspects such as that that may you
bit oh my codes perfect bottom of the
right items sorry bro part of it enjoy
basics in taxes strings we got a new
item here this is gonna allow us to loop
I believe will probably do a while loop
and with the brackets let's goody equip
the programmatic on one is get started
in this so say the password and moved to
X
all right so it looks like our hero will
move right doesn't know the password
tells us we can get the password in our
help guide here
the password is hush if you ever get
stuck the help guide is a great place to
go to to see if it can provide great
resources or you could just come watch
my videos equally as good if not better
but don't don't take it from me I'm
biased so we're gonna open the door and
then we're gonna move right one more
time so let's go ahead and run this to
see so move right say the password move
right to the X it looks like se is a
function that our arrow can do for them
to say something so that may come in
useful at a later date we'll see all
right next one that's up is the fire
Nancy so we're gonna be using a while
loop and basic syntax
I think our character is okay to go
forward so we need to dodge the
fireballs and they want us to do it in
under four statements so it looks like
we're gonna set up a wall true loop so
watch removes the hero right so all
that's gonna happen now is just gonna
keep moving right until it gets pegged
by fireballs so what we want to do is we
wanted to move left so move right then
move left indefinitely because where you
have nothing break the loop but we're
just trying to dodge fireballs we're
trying to always be on the move so move
right move left move right move left
move right move left it's 40 note that
this is an infinite loop right now it
ends because this gets within the game
but if you're learning programming you
typically are gonna have something
that's gonna break that true statement
so that you can not have an infinite
loop
all right cool loop-de-loop let's go
baby
looks like we don't need any any other
sermons all right so we're trying not to
die by the lightning beam and we want to
do it under six statements Michael so we
have our wall true and we're moving
right moving left moving so we want to
stay behind this thing should be simple
enough just move up left and then move
down note that we're within the brackets
here otherwise we wouldn't be calling
this within our wallet but this is why
we we are because we know it's within
its scope
so we're dodging the death threat
collecting coins getting that cash money
more cash money please here we go nice
so we did it under six statements one
two three four I'm not quite sure out of
the count statements maybe each function
but
pretty straightforward so we dodged the
death ray we're out doing while loops
and basic syntax here let's go ahead and
jump right in
all right so if you look the maze goes
right up right right right
up up right right up up up right so
that's kind of the logic we need to find
we want to get to the end move right
twice move up twice sorry had a phone
call and so we're moving right moving
right and then we want to hero dot move
up then we want to move up and it's
gonna run that for as long as it can
move right twice right right so our
while loop is reiterating through our
instructions that we have set up here
and then once it hits the bottom it's
gonna continue to go through it once
more and there we go very nicely done
cool so we just go we just finished
another five sections when we come back
we'll be doing the second kit maze as
always thank you for those of you this
morning on patreon is incredibly
appreciated don't forget to Like and
subscribe comment and share the video if
you enjoyed it and I'll see you guys in
the next code combat video thanks for
