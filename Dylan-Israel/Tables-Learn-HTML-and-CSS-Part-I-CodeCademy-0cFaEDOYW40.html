gentlemen congratulations have you made
it this far into the core screen in HTML
tables tables of learned HTML and CSS
part 1 so what are tables tables are a
way of kind of organizing your data in a
table structure so you'll see right here
this is a great example of a table we
have our table heading and then we have
various inputs in our table now there's
a lot of nesting in tables so if you're
not comfortable with nesting things at
this point you're gonna have to get
comfortable pretty well you'll see we
have a table a table head which is this
section right here this ends then we
have a table row which is basically the
row across here and then we have these
th's which is basically the table header
in our table head in the table row and
then we have our table body which is
where the bulk of the data goes and then
we of course have our table tag so let's
go ahead and jump right in so in
index.html created table I guess we'll
do it below the search so all we have to
do to start off is basically declare
kind of like how we declare that we're
going to start at HTML kind of same
thing we're still clinging our table is
gonna go within here next we want to add
two rows to the table you'll notice that
we don't really have anything on here
quite yet we're basically just getting
things set up so we're gonna have a TR
slash TR and then a TR closing TR tag so
we're adding two rows again nothing's in
it yet because we haven't actually added
anything data so up next what we wanted
to do is go ahead and add some data to
our table so to do that we have these TD
tags table data in the second row we're
gonna add three cells to Davis so here
we're going to add
/ TV so our first row data is gonna be
Adams green work our second row of data
is going to be 14 and then our final row
of data is going to be our packaged
items it's gone and run that and now we
should see at least one row of data
there we go
and they have it nicely styled and
everything by default you'll this will
be ugly as it's so so definitely
organize your data look nice so they
make a good point here that table data
doesn't really make much sense less you
know what it is you're looking at at so
that's where the table the table header
comes in hand so in the first row we're
gonna add some table header stuff here
so let's go ahead and do that so we're
gonna add a tea head
and then similar to the table data it's
just to may th and we'll go ahead and
copy and paste that over two more times
and then we want to put company name you
want to put a number of items to ship
and then next action very cool so now we
have our table header here that it's
basically saying which each one of these
columns represents
so it talks about how we need to add
some stuff to the you can't really see
the kind of how I said earlier how
you're gonna have trouble seeing the
table they've added some nice CSS they
suggest maybe adding a border using the
border attribute to do that and they're
giving us some additional data here so
we're gonna go ahead and just copy and
paste this under our first row of data
let me run this we now have this nice
table very nice
so the next thing that we're gonna do is
sometimes we want we want our table data
to take up more than one slot so like
right now each one of these is only
taking up a single column but perhaps we
actually want just one section to take
up more than one so we're gonna see you
see this call span is basically set it
stands for spanning two columns so we'll
go to Adams Green Works here and we're
gonna sign call span by default this is
one we're gonna change this to two it's
go and run that and now you'll see right
now it's gonna throw off the rest of our
table but our column here is taken it is
actually taking up two columns now now
you can do this for rows as well so
we'll do it to the one just below it and
we will do I believe it's just a row
span right yeah row span so you need to
you need this to span more than one row
you do row span equal to two so this one
right here should go down so you see
right now this is taking up two rows
granny doesn't make a lot of sense with
what we're doing
alright I'm gonna try a different row
because apparently they didn't like that
row they - oh I forgot that this you
have to run this one time before getting
it to go
otherwise the IDMS as though so there we
go
well yeah so we have our row span on our
call span
so we also have tea body tea body is
kind of like how we have the body to
contain everything that's kind of what
tea body is for the data so let's go
ahead and do that to control everything
so we're just going to go ahead and put
tea body like so actually what's going
to run this page real quick
- body /t body nothing changed it's more
of a functional thing as to why that's
in there
I believe we already did this this way
so you're saying to enclose the first
row in a tea head which we already did
so there's also a table footer see
similar to how we have a table header
now I was talking in a previous thing
about making something dynamic now what
that means is say we don't know what
these numbers are they're changing we
could set up a table footer to count
them up and a dynamic sort of way in
this case we're not doing that we're
gonna go ahead and add a footer element
that right here add this to it
so within tea body we're gonna go ahead
and create a tea foot /t foot it's going
to throw that in there run it I think we
may have to add a table row oh I guess
not so here's our table footer right
here and you'll see that they have some
styling here that they're telling us
about and whatnot so we're gonna jump
into the style of that CSS because we
don't want the the footers and the
headers to look too identical so we want
to change the font of all table headings
and table data to 18 pixels so to do
that we're going to do T head remember
you can target elements and TD's and we
change the font size to 18 PX that
should be what we're trying to do and
there everything is now a little bit
bigger a little bit cleaner so we have
just finished part one of learn HTML and
CSS what did we learn about our let's do
a quick review what you learned about
tables we learned that what tables do
the purpose of them really just a kind
of organized data that doesn't
necessarily need to be responsive that
needs to stay in order we learned that
you need to have a table tag and within
that you have the table body you have a
table header for the headers and then
you add a table row rows across table
data for the data aspect and table head
tags we also learned about table footer
we learned that we
can span multiple columns he's in call
span and we learned that we can span
multiple multiple rows as well using row
span so it was a it was definitely a
good HTML and CSS course even someone
like myself who's been doing it for a
while you learn new things all the time
I hope you guys enjoyed this I learned a
little bit in a nice refresher on some
things as well but as always guys thanks
for watching don't forget to Like
subscribe and share if you're looking
for a section to go from from here I
believe there's another HTML and CSS
course on code Academy an outdated one
but it'd be nice refresher you can also
jump over to the free code camp and do
the HTML and CSS portion there and
eventually work your way up to
JavaScript I have videos on all that so
if you get stuck check that out and I'll
help unstuck you unstick you uh-huh but
as always thank you to those who you're
supporting me on patreon I really
appreciate it and I'll see you guys in
the next video thanks for watching
thanks for watching the video special
thanks to our sponsor dev Mountain
definitely check them out at dev
Mountain com if you're looking for a
boot camp that's in front-end
development iOS or UX go ahead and give
them a shot tuition includes housing so
you can get up and go and fully immerse
yourself in the program as always thanks
for watching I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
