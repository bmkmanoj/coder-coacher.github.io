coding and wake up thinking about coding
and I'm excited about it I uh this isn't
the first time it's happened to me and
I'm gonna tell you about what I think it
means and why I'm excited about dreaming
about coding
special thanks to our sponsor ac3 dot IO
they are a new learning platform where
you have content creators like myself
and those on udemy putting up courses
and they're using the blockchain
technology make sure when you go over
there to download their wallet it's
pretty cool right so there's a lot of
craziness going on YouTube and it's
always exciting to see technology apply
to help make people's lives better and
they're live right now you don't have to
wait this isn't something that's going
to be coming out in a year from now
they're actually up and running all you
have to do is go ahead and download
their wallet there's no credit card or
anything like that and there's coins to
buy courses and to support those whose
content help you become a better
developer to help you become better
educated in skills and I really think
that's pretty cool that AC 3 IO is doing
that and I'm excited to see how the
platform continues to develop so i-i've
worked with them in the past on other
projects and it's excited to see and
this new project come to light so I hope
you guys check them out again this AC 3
dot IL so as I mentioned I've been
dreaming about coding and I've actually
wake up about coding things I have been
coding and some of you may jump to the
conclusion like yo man stood stressed
out I am Zen baby you must be thinking
like oh man this guy's put it in 60 80
hour weeks at work forty all right so
that's not it it's not like I'm overly
stressed and overly worked I am putting
in about twenty to thirty hours in my
own time coding and doing all this sort
of other stuff and lately I've been live
streaming every night doing building
courses and studying and
and one of the reasons I'm super excited
about it is there's another point in my
life where I started dreaming about
coding and it was right when I decided
to stop going to school and study code
full-time almost as much i i'm studying
almost as much now as I was then where I
am now devoting all my off hours should
I'm super like reinvigorated about
coding and part of it is I'm not
uploading videos as regularly on YouTube
because I kind of got D motivated by
them D monetizing every video I've had
in last 3 months and it's been one of
those things where I am instead of
focusing more on that aspect I've dove
back into just coding things again like
actual just taking that that that 1015
extra hours a week and actually just
working on projects and building courses
it's been it's been super exciting and
when the last week I've been waking up
and and dreaming and and waking up
feeling thinking about all the projects
I'm working on instantly like the moment
I wake up and the only other time it
happened to me was when I when I was
studying full-time for hours after work
in like 10 12 hours a day on the
weekends and when I started having these
dreams it's the exact same sort of thing
it was the moment in which I gained a
level in my coding I've talked about
this before about the sign of their
being levels of this stuff and I I think
I'm on like the the brink of maybe
moving up a level of skill if that's and
that's why it's exciting because the
last time this happened where I was just
totally engulfed in it it was my mind
sort of wrapping around its is MOT it's
it was my brain wrapping around concepts
that perhaps I didn't fully grasp and
now I am now sort of innately knowing
it's almost kind of like learning how to
speak right at some point you just all a
sudden can talk and words start making
sense in and the you know you learn
letters and you learn how to make words
then you learn pair
and it's kind of the same thing we're in
coding where you learn certain skills
and use it even as a developer you get
better right so what but how do you get
better and it's well the stuff that used
to be hard is easy so it's hard yeah it
gets easier and the stuff and then you
go find new challenges it's very
exciting for me because everyone I've I
it was so profound when that happened
that I'm very excited to see if it is
actually something or am I just am I
just the cat's very excited the cat's
excited about me being excited and boom
alright but that's kind of how I feel
like like Achilles right there just
excited about because I I've had this
sort of feeling before and there are
people that when they dream about coding
it's because they are stressed out and
that's unfortunate and I encourage you
to leave your job today if you're
putting in 80 hours a week leave life's
too short
there's a bunch of companies I'll pay
you almost as much you'll probably make
more per hour in reality than anything
else but there are a lot of companies
that will work you to the bone so when
you when you're watching this video
there's a few people are probably
expecting that's what this video is
gonna be about my company's great to me
I work I work it's the most relaxing
environment I've ever had in my life but
I will say that there are a lot of
people who don't have that and they
dream and sleep about code and I have
panic attacks and I know this because
when I googled this before the video the
first thing that came up in the majority
of the post was I am stressed out beyond
belief I think about it I wake up in the
middle of night sweating because I'm so
worried about it and I feel bad for
those people I really do and I hope that
if you are in a situation in any job in
which you're unhappy understanding of
bills to pay I understand that but you
need to figure out a way to get out of
the situation whether you go home today
and you say enough is enough I'm
starting to fill out job apps I'm
starting to take interviews I'm gonna
get my Linkedin together the github the
resume do
all that I'm sorry studying after work I
know I got kids and I'm in school I'm
doing all these sorts of things
find the time yeah I I encourage you to
get out of that bad work situation but
that's not what this is for me for me it
is like a Renaissance of the coding mind
right and I am about to go to the Golden
Age as far as I'm concerned but uh it's
it's interesting to me because I had
such a good experience with it
especially in a time in which I was a
very happy individual but that was one
one sort of real profound moment for me
and I wonder if I was to compare the
developer I am today with the developer
that I was a year and a half ago or so
it is it is night and day it really is
and I've worked almost every day towards
it and in a year and a half coding
almost every day it's just the second
time in my life where this has happened
for you know second period of time I
can't even remember how many days had
happened before but I want to say it was
about a two week period where every
single day I was dreaming about coding
working on it and just it was just I
wake up instantly alarm goes off I'm
thinking about scouting already like I
I'm sure eat because I dream about you
know how you kind of wake up in a dream
and you don't really know what it's
about but you're like damn man I was
into I was in something like I don't
know what was going down I was rescuing
the princess er I was you know I was
beating that boss and Final Fantasy I
don't know what I was doing but I was
into it I'm having that feelings with
coding it's very clear that I'm thinking
about what what it was that I was
working on last night and and and it's
it's it's exciting for me
do you guys dream about coding am I the
only one is is it just me and I by the
way I'm not one of those people that
normally have like very vivid dreams I
know some people do and and they have
very lucid dreams and things like that
and I'm not taking like I know there's
like T's you can drink to give you lucid
dreams and stuff over-the-counter
teas to clarify that you can drink to to
have lucid dreams that's not the case
here
I'm really just I think what's happening
is I've been so focused on coding that
it's sort of in it's been impossible for
my mind not to I come home I worked so I
work all day right and I come home and
I'm excited I can barely eat dinner
because I'm so excited to get back to
coding it's kind of crazy right I sit
down I scarf some food down sometimes
last night was last year actually eating
Austrian coding right um
and sort of this break from YouTube I'm
not it's not a full break I've put out a
video a week but compared to the three
videos a week and and and sort of diving
into my own projects again instead just
studying it's exciting because that was
what I love about coding is you know
what enough of falling in somebody
else's building blocks right I will
build my own blocks and I'll walk on top
of them and that's kind of what I'm
doing again I'm building my own projects
and I'm building my own courses and you
know I'm designing some merch and stuff
look forward to that but it's it's
exciting that I'm so engrossed in it um
it's kind of like like uh like you
remember when you fell in love for the
first time and you're just infatuated I
haven't I have ivory fallen in love with
codeine not that ever fell out of love
but often times you're always in love
and you fall in and out alike right as
thing is that Chris rock that says that
because when you like somebody yeah
you'll do a lot more than when you love
them okay but I I really have started to
like software again and I've been
engrossed in and I'm probably putting in
30 to 40 hours a week in my off hours in
reality because I'm coming home every
day I'm putting two hours in sometimes
three and then on the weekends I've put
in on Saturday on Saturday for those of
you were here I did four live streams
one of them was five hours long and the
other were a couple hours apiece I think
I did twelve hours that day and that's
and by the way I could have kept going I
went to like midnight on one of the I
was having a blast man I was having a
blast so I'm really just finding that
love and the infatuation and
dreaming about it is something that has
a good place for me because the the it
was at that moment like I tell people a
lot of times like hey sometimes it's
just not clicking and I tell you know I
get that and it was when I started
dreaming about it that over the next
month all that hard work all that effort
all those tears all those energy drinks
they all paid off and I finally got it I
finally got what I was working so hard
to obtain and I I could just the the
level of development skills went up a
notch and I hope that's happening now
and that's what makes me very excited
about it so do you guys dream about
coding if you do tell me your experience
is good or bad I love to hear about it

my channel anymore for whatever reason
you can't I patreon.com/scishow
notorious 360 I'll see you next time
thank you so much for watching the video
bye hey baby I was dreaming about coding
again I guess if you're looking for a
fun little project to do I have my very
first course out called learn angular by
projects part one where we build a
personal portfolio it's about three
hours of content it's one project I can
teach you everything in angular by any
means but it's a great way to get your
feet wet and go ahead and check the link
