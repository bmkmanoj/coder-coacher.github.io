Academy decided to give me a nice little
sponsorship and so we're gonna check out
their site a bit and we're gonna do one
of their projects you go their site at
bata hacksaw academy.com it's beautiful
site I I definitely want to talk to them
about their graphic design I kind of
really like it but we're gonna do this
landing page product we're gonna jump
right into the first aspect if you're
interested in trying it is 14 or $24.99
you get a 14-day free trial go ahead and
check it out we're gonna go ahead and
log in right now you'll see that I
haven't really started I just kind of
checked out the projects but I only saw
the first page so we're gonna be seeing
this together and see what it's all
about you'll see right now the in terms
of projects we have the landing page the
to-do list portfolio page email catcher
interactive quiz html5 video player
movie database working with API advanced
responsive page and this just launched
cuz I logged in like two days ago and
this wasn't here a paint clone you make
a copy of mspaint
and it looks like pretty form control so
seems like they're having a lot of stuff
and they break everything up into about
30 minute or less segments so it's not
too overwhelming you can definitely work
on it
you know once free today I say is it
callin a sprint is kind of a term from
agile from an agile shop so this first
one we're just gonna be working with
HTML basics it looks like an
introduction to the platform and some
core web development concepts just
really give us an idea of like how
Hacksaw works it's got a nice little UI
here it kind of reminds me a little bit
of code pin where you can pull up and
across and so on and so forth so you'll
have your JavaScript file here you have
your CSS file here and then you have
your I your a channel here instructions
and then your output so let's go ahead
and get started it looks like that's
what we're gonna be making here
so in our HTML this is HTML panel we're
going to be creating that looks like a
little bit of a span here so if you
don't remember what a span is a span is
basically like container that takes up
no space or anything like that you kind
of just use it to just style stuff we're
gonna give it a class here of demo -
text and we're also going to give it an
ID equal to demo so just a reminder
classes are not specific while IDs are
unique so you can use a class multiple
times but you can only use a ID once
that's kind of the the difference
between them so this is an HTML is what
this is what an HTML snippet looks like
cool so the following a CSS snip bit
replace two CSS panel with this to apply
some styles to your HTML so we're gonna
target the body element of our HTML
document and we're gonna say look we
want the background to be a certain
color so we're gonna go ahead and give
it the color of hashtag D - f 0 C 6
which is kind of a a brownish gray we go
ahead and zoom in a little bit and then
we're going to say look we want the text
to align Center so you know from a lot
of my videos I don't mess around with
CSS too much so I'm actually finding
this pretty helpful padding we're gonna
have a 40px padding is what basically
within the element gives it padding
around it while margin pushes away from
other elements so that's a little bit of
hot tip their demo so we're targeting
our ID or excuse me our class with the
dot txt classes are always denoted with
the dot and we're going to go ahead and
target this like so we're gonna change
the color so everything in our demo text
color wise will be white and then we're
gonna say look font - wait you want to
make it bold you can go ahead and do
this instead of using the strong tag you
new font - family what sort of font do
we want to use and we want to use
sans-serif so I'll give it a nice font
here make it look unique cursor oh wait
I know about this I'm excited for this
cursor we want a pointer yo look at that
I'm gonna remember that one I like that
padding again so we use padding so we're
just gonna give a little bit of padding
at 20 px and then finally a background
here of pound eight zero b c a0 cool yep
so you'll see padding around it and nice
man everything's looking sharp as can be
and then we're gonna have our JavaScript
file here now what are we gonna do in
our JavaScript file we create a variable
here called demo underscore alert we're
gonna set this equal to the function
demo alert so we're just creating a
function here demo
on your alert whoopsies
very nice I don't forget to put some
Michael in it and we're gonna set out
Lert which is nothing more than a simple
pop-up and because I butcher all of my
typing we're gonna save us all some time
time I copy and paste that in there so
now while you run this oh we haven't
called it yet so we're then gonna target
our document say look this is us just
some vanilla JavaScript we're gonna
target the ID document dot get element
by ID the demo and then we're gonna add
the event listener which basically means
add track the action of so what's the
action we're tracking we're tracking the
click action and when that happens we
want to run our demo alert function so
let's go ahead and rerun this and you'll
see
pop-up blocker barking
let's sit here did I do wrong I think
we're doing okay here
all right so tag names will be used with
forms basic headings so I'll say that
all right so basically told us what's
with HTML tags are it looks like we'll
use that in the future I think it's just
talking about how these tags work from
this point we recommend typing in code
snippets into the editor instead of copy
and paste them so you get a feel of try
changing the contents of few HTML - yeah
so we're gonna go ahead and copy and
paste this in here because it's a lot
basically all you need to know is that
h1
all the way to h6 getting smaller and
smaller and smaller so that's basically
you need to know it's gonna look bold
it's gonna look dark it's gonna look big
that's basically your heading so now
what we're gonna do is add some
paragraph tags it also goes on about
line break so if you're not familiar
with that we'll go ahead and add a
paragraph pJAK here and we'll say go to
beta dot X dot academy.com and then
we'll have another paragraph here this
is it is really great and then we'll go
ahead and maybe we want a align space
between we'll put a colon here and then
we'll put a br slash and we'll put a
line space here to go vanilla and you'll
see right here if it breaks our line
very nice now we're gonna do anchor tag
so anchor tags are basically how you
make the links the href is where you put
your your link target equal to blank
well let you open it up in a brand new
window so instead of taking the window
that you're in it's going to open it in
a new one so let's go ahead and do that
we'll put it around our beta Hacksaw
Academy
at an anchor to here a href is equal to
and then we'll go ahead and copy this
again I'm gonna zoom in a little bit and
then we will close it as well very nice
oh I close it automatically for us so
now we will have when we run this a nice
little link let's go anywhere in this
you'll see right here it's good to go
aah
oops uh except make sure that you put it
in the correct spot now we should there
we go you'll see right here it's now a
link and we click it it's gonna issue it
should normally open up in a new page oh
we forgot the target is equal to blank
so you'll see by default it says target
to auto which are something like that
but basically the default auto is in
allow it going to the page now where you
run this you'll see that we're now in a
new window which is what the target
equal blank does nice nextstep nesting
so you almost by default and hit enter
it's nesting the stuff so basically it's
showing right here
how nesting works you basically want to
kind of follow the same similar sort of
nesting patterns you'll notice by
default so basically it's saying
something like this kind of want to keep
your stuff organized typically you want
to have stuff on different lines of code
for different nesting things so like
right here this anchor tag we might
indent because this BR ends here but
it's still within the paragraph and this
is a new one as well so it's
basically what it's talking about there
is when you have things within each
other you're gonna want to indent them
within each other or four spaces but
that was our first HTML basic page we
kind of learned some basic HTML in the
next video we will be going over
building the header for the landing page
so that's a little bit of a longer one
this first one's about 20 minutes pretty
straightforward because we know HTML
basics but if you're definitely entry
level it's gonna give you a nice
foundation but I think you'd a hacksaw
