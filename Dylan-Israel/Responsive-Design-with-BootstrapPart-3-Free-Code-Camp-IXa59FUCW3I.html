finishing up responsive design with
bootstrap should go pretty quick we have
about 10 of these left so what's
basically going on is that we are using
we are doing all the prep work to get
started on like 50 our projects and
going step by step to create an entire
working web app and I was taking a look
at so do pay attention we're going to be
using bootstrap quite a bit i have a
feeling so additive element below rh3 so
we want to add a div here and / div and
we want to give it a class of row so
we're going to set up a row from our
bootstrap container and I think that's
all they want us to do for this one cool
so we just were just getting things set
up it looks like so in here we now want
to add two columns so how do we do that
I'll create it great another div and we
want to give it a class equal to and
it's going to be a column it's going to
be extra small and it's going to be take
up six rows and we wanted to create two
of these so we'll just go ahead and
control see that
alright so additive clock element with
class while inside each of your div
classes all right so it looks like we're
going to create too dibbs here and we're
going to give it a class equal to well
so it looks like that does some coloring
in like background and border radius so
let's go ahead and close that div and
then we're just going to copy this and
we're going to put in this other one and
you can see that both of these take up
about half the page and that's kind of
what we were going for their cool so
bootstrap wells it's a visual sense of
the depth of your columns sort of said
thing so now nest three button elements
within each of your divs cool so we're
going to do it here and we'll say do oh
excuse me button start classes button so
button it looks like i just want six
basic buttons but they haven't told us
what goes in it yet so three in each one
and bam bam bam good to go so we're just
kind of getting the layout set up
alright so now for each one of these
buttons we are going to give it a class
equal to be TN so first thing you see
right there it changes the to make it
more button like you know visually and
we're also going to add the class BTN
default and you can see it's going to
add some more styling to it so rather
than typing all that out for each one of
these know how to copy and paste and
replace these and bam bam and so run the
test cool
so once the supply the target class
target I think this is what they're
asking so
cool I don't see exactly what's coming
off but apparently this makes it easier
to target the entire class for jquery
stuff so give your left well that idea
of left well okay so
if you're confused with what the
difference between IDs and classes our
IDs are as specific as they come you can
only use it once per page so in this
case we won't be able to use left well
again because we've already used it so
it's it's for very specific things so
then we'll do ID right great as well
if you're right what idea right this one
oops and of course make sure you add
this in the right spot there we go
so now we are going to add a do they
want it within the text left what I so
they want it within here so we're going
to set at age 4 h four elements should
have the text pound left well
and we'll just go ahead and copy this
create another age for and we're just
going to swap out put pound right well
so that word we didn't looks like we're
doing a mistake here somewhere so let's
back up
let's reset this start fresh so add an H
for element we're going to check step by
step here to each of your div class call
extra small mesh six elements so we'll
add at age four and then we have a / h 4
cool
we don't actually put anything in it
let's and I believe they go within the
wells
so let's try it outside the well okay so
that's where they want it cool now we
just need to do the text with text test
here there's that and then we will do
pound right dash well just a little bit
debugging you'll be spending a lot of
time doing that in life I feel like what
element should have the ID target one
all right so we'll start fresh ID ID
equals target one and then we'll set and
we'll run it to make sure we're doing
all this right for you start changing on
that and just save a little bit of time
control see this here we're going to set
the ID of this button class I'm gonna
set target two and then we'll set that
target three and then we'll set this one
to target for Tiger 5 and finally last
but not least target six now run that
 DJ cool not really doing much with
it yet but still looking pretty nice so
given elit re 1 and a text pound target
one alright so there's target alone cool
so again we're doing things six times
here so if feel free to type everything
out I used to do that when I I thought I
actually do think it's a really good way
to learn is by typing everything out
manually but in this I guess we could so
target for and I kind of talked to
myself the way I do in the videos where
it's like this does alright this is
target five and then in my head I kind
of run over like oh but in the class is
starting at five and we're sending what
are we doing we're saying the text for
basically found target six so you can
see that they are
do you have some classing some hover
stuff let's go ahead and run that cool
so all we did there was label so start a
comment the coma I should have the text
only change code above this line
and if we don't want that extra to print
out so we got to comment this out by the
way this is the worst way to do
comments I've ever seen in my life
excuse-excuse e f bone right there but /
/ it's just so much better in Java so
let's go ahead and take this out
it's closed
huh it looks like we're getting some
sort of air here let's go ahead and
reset the code pair my code copy that
and here we're going to start with the
exclamation point we're going to in here
we're going to put the code we're going
to run it and we still get an air what
the hell all right so an economist let's
get some help it looks like
alright so sue we are on let's go back
to what we were looking at we are on use
comments to clarify code
well so just see from my tabs here I
opened up about 15 pages on closed
lunches are going long to finally find a
right solution so there's a they've had
issues with this in the past but it's
kind of cool that's how we found their
their kind of form section so
essentially this is how you need to
write your code you need to write it as
text and then just do a multi-line
comment like that it's just a bug they
have so as long as you understand how
comments work it shouldn't be an issue
so just be aware that there was an issue
with that oh I think we finished so um
let's go back to our map and we just
finished responsive design with
bootstrap and kind of weird thing than
not comment but next section is gear up
for success it's a really quick you know
ten minute thing as we get started about
how to use their site and LinkedIn
alumni network which is kind of cool I
like all this sirsa so this is a really
great resource next we'll be doing
jquery and then basic JavaScript some
object oriented and so this will go by
pretty quick and then we get into the 50
hours meet bonfire reverse a string all
this sort of stuff is stuff that I've
actually done in Java and it should be
really fun for the first time of these
are basic things that you're going to
need to be able to do and you know it
looks like some of these will probably
be making a little game or something so
I'll see you guys in the next video and
as always constructive criticism is
