doing our weekly our weekly a live
stream normally it's done on Saturday I
do apologize for those of you look
forward to it on Saturday
I recently thought so tomorrow April and
I are going to going to Universal
Studios I have been working very hard
I'm not a big theme park person but I
wanted to essentially say thank you for
her kind understanding that I wasn't
able to spend any time with her the last
three or four months and so we're going
down the Universal Studios we're hanging
a lot specifically the Hogwarts section
that the Harry Potter section I'm not
really a big fan of rides and things
like that but it should be fun it's
gonna be a change of pace and I'm
looking forward to it so we're we're
doing that so thank you again I do
apologize that it we're not doing this
on Saturday morning so maybe the people
who are usually here won't be here but
at least we'll get to have some people
who aren't normally here here the good
news is we are about to hit 27 thousand
subscribers which means I'll do another
livestream going on sometime around
going on sometime around us Sunday so I
think where are we at right now if we go
to the dashboard
I believe we're getting pretty close to
27,000 which means time for another
thousand subscriber livestream I'm not
going to stop doing those because now
I'm doing the Sunday once this is just
employee are at 26,000 814 so we'll be
close enough on Sunday that I'll
actually do a morning life from there
you miss me I've been putting out videos
man I know I haven't been live streaming
as much which is why I'm also
implementing this I have been studying
non-stop when I get home off work
and maintaining YouTube and everything
my current role I wasn't aware that we
were gonna be using angular for I'm very
excited that we are but I was unaware
because all my all my work was in
angularjs and all my testing was an
angularjs because that's what I knew and
so I kind of have a you have the you
have the normal stuff that you're
playing catch-up on at a new job where
it's ok live meeting the people
understanding how the organization
functions how it rolls kind of getting
taken out of your comfort zone in terms
of I have to meet new people I have to I
have to kind of go and meet with people
I normally wouldn't meet with yeah which
is fine I get I get along pretty well
with all the developers that I work with
which is great a lot of times it's easy
to get along with developers because
you're a developer and you have the kind
of the same hobbies right like we were
playing some board games tonight after
work and that was really fun I enjoyed
that so yeah but on a technical side I
need to bit much better with angular 4
I'm almost done with my first angular 4
course the angular 4 front to back by
traversing media so I I will all right I
think I'll actually review that course
it's been somewhat beneficial I would
give it probably at this point in time
although I'm not through about like a
4.25 out of 5 but also I think it
teaches you everything you know to get
started with angular I don't think it
teaches you everything you know to be an
angular developer because I found just
by me working through it on a production
level or ena in a workplace level
there's quite a few things that are
missing from it but it is enough to get
you going so I do some react programming
tourists I have about four react
tutorials up building projects out from
free code camp we have the recipe box we
have the to-do list we are we have the
silly one I forget what the other one is
but I think I have three or four react
projects up there you enjoyed the videos
about the crappy employees stay away
from ya it's just all those things man
worse if you don't talk about it
sometimes people don't know and myself
Florida I relocate no I'm still Florida
I didn't move or anything the role that
I accepted is only a 20 miles away from
where I my apartment currently is it's a
little bit longer than where I went from
four miles to 20 miles so it's about 20
22 minute drive each way so a little bit
more to drive than I would want but
still not an unreasonable Drive so ya
know relocating which is good I didn't
really want to leave Florida Ricky comes
out with the look at the slide for 350
Thank You Ricky if you guys don't know
Ricky Ricky is one of the other coding
channels that I watch out there he's uh
he's a good guy at the end of the day
that's why I like about Ricky more than
his content I just like Ricky so I hope
you don't take that in the wrong way my
friend but a shout out for look at the
slide if you if you don't understand the
reference you should watch today's video
but uh yes so uh life is good man uh I
wanted to make sure that it was able to
do this sort of our live stream it's
it's a bit stressful though because I
know I'm not wearing one I need to be
for angular but I know I will get there
it's just until you you're there you
kind have a little bit of stress and
there's been no pressure really put on
me I am building out I'm basically doing
my first real project at work and that's
exciting right and I'm kind of getting
from my previous work where I could
pretty much architect the front end the
back end wire frame it out build it out
with very little oversight I have a
little bit more now where we have an
architect we have a tech lead and I like
it a lot because that's one of the
things that attracted me the role it's I
want to learn from these people are more
senior than myself and be able to to
gain some knowledge from them
what's the best practices so I ask a lot
of questions and I encourage you to to
to ask a lot of questions it's a bit
intimidating right because no matter how
friendly somebody is you know you're
taking them out of their work even
though it's part of their role right so
I'm trying to ask as many questions as I
can and eventually I'll ask less and
less and less all right you know and
I've basically been jumping between
three developers asking questions and
part of it is just me getting custom
with the tools part of it is not knowing
angular very well or angular four very
well part of it is just kind of seeing
like hey what's okay part of its just
wanting to learn you know one of the
things I said in my interview process
for everything is I really emphasized
I'm trying to learn from people and so
that's kind of uh that's kind of I and
the reason I bring it up is not to talk
about how like there's a limit of how
many questions you should ask or
anything I I think a lot of people
probably don't ask us many times as as
many questions doesn't want because
they're scared that they may they may
bug the developers or anything I'm on
the end where I've rather asked so many
questions that eventually they just tell
me like hey man I got work like I'd
rather push them to the limit because I
do want to learn and I do want to take
this environment to where I can just
like you have these people who are
brilliant and you're like I want to get
to where they're right and it's okay to
ask questions right and also I'm not
saying instantly when you get a issue
ask spend 15 minutes on a situation and
oftentimes you can learn a lot in the
process like I already have a question I
need to ask on Monday on the current
project I'm working on and I I have no
real solution as to why like I know a
bootleg way to make something work to do
what I want it to do I know it's not the
best way so I'm gonna ask about that on
Monday
I'm still working with angular yes
angular 4 is what I am working in I'll
be working in that primarily in terms of
the front end I met I am a front-end dev
and that's part of it what do I need to
do without getting too many details
basically our angular module needs to
import certain parts of angular and you
have different components that some are
nested within the other now my
understanding is those the the package
that I need they the part of angular I
need should be nesting downward into my
component but it's not and one way of
fixing the bootleg way is just to create
another module in that component and
instantiate it put it sync it's not the
best way it's not the best practice and
there's clearly something wrong with my
logic as I'm doing this that I could
probably probably handle I could
probably go in and just talk with one of
the other developers more familiar with
angular 4 and they'd be like oh well you
know this is where you messed up and you
know take five ten minutes of their time
so like a good example of something that
I I asked was this morning actually
where I was injecting data from one
component to another and one of the
issues I was having was that there was
so much there is like five different
ways of doing that and so I don't know
what the best way is for what I'm trying
to do so they have a they have a c-sharp
back-end I'm not sure about the database
but they also have multiple projects so
it could be different on stuff how's
your youtube course coming along
unfortunately not very well my main
priority right now is to get caught up
at work until I feel like I know angular
for like the back of my hand
I probably don't have time for the only
thing that I took a break from studying
after your work was I did some code
sight algorithms and I I that was like
my break I've been doing like code
fights algorithms right before bed
thirty minutes to an hour because I'm
getting a little burnt out I don't like
I'm just watching so many courses and
and tutorials and stuff like that it
does burn me out a little bit I like the
coding aspect more and the watching of
video tutorials it's not always the most
fun for at least for me anyhow should I
look into getting a Mac to be very
versatile I have a Windows desktop
I don't know how Mac makes you more
versatile and a Windows how comfortable
do you feel now with your angular
knowledge I mean I feel very comfortable
thank you lurch a s and and I am now
kind of at the point where where I'm on
angular for I would say I'm not
comfortable I've really only been
working with it for a week I kind of
understand how the component
architecture works I understand the
point of services I understand all that
sorry so because some concepts carry
over kind of syncing it all up is a
little bit different but it's it's the
type of stuff where once or twice then
it's all clicking in so there is
progress being made without a doubt
I'm just not where I need to be that's
all so I'm asked I'm at the point where
it's it's clear that I haven't been
working with it too too long but I'll
get there I'm not I'm not even remotely
worried about that cuz I am putting in
the time after work and I am today's a
little bit of a different day but I
might even after this I might go and
just continue to finish up this this
angular course and go from there so I
think you can use services and that way
have methods and data is available
globally blunting of course Jo not very
well versed angular - yeah services kind
of are basically all your their their
way for you to communicate data to and
from a lot of times you just use it to
set up HTTP calls for
for instance yeah yeah so world's yeah
I'm pretty sure that it's some sort of
dependency injection issue I also it
could be something about I need to pass
a certain parameter down to a child
component it's not really a child that's
nested with them so I I'm I kind of I'm
in the ballpark of where it's at but
instead of spending half a day looking
for that it's probably better to just
kind of ask for some help and say hey
this is where I would check and see what
happens well yeah so I've been loving it
though man I so having worked with the
react and studying react it it felt nice
and fresh and new but like I think I
think when it comes to angular cuz I've
worked in angularjs it feels like I like
the massive architecture of it I really
do and not everyone's for that but uh
maybe I'll do some angular for tutorials
down the road as I I continue to get
better I would say realistically it's
probably gonna take me about six weeks
to get up to speed we're finishing up
the second week right now and it's gonna
take me about six weeks to get to where
I need to be so until I feel until I
feel like like my angular is there cuz
that's the big hold up that's where the
bulk of my work comes and it's not only
angular he needs to hear I need to study
on testing I need to study on bootstrap
for I need to review a little bit CSS
it's not a big deal now because we're
dealing with stuff that doesn't
necessarily need to be pretty right now
but down the road I want to make sure my
CSS is for the more client facing
products or its better so it's been it's
been great though I honestly can say
this is probably no disrespect if
anybody is from my previous workplaces
this is a probably the best company I've
ever worked for hands down and it's
exactly what I was looking for sort of a
group of guys are passionate about code
and you know are using the latest
technologies and
and a place that I could see myself
staying at for a while I say this then
Monday I may get fired so I could be
there forever guys so about that later
yeah the people I work with are very
very interesting and very cool our tech
lead has like it's all way into like 3d
printing he has like his at home foundry
where he smelts things and whatnot and
like that's super dope I kind of without
sounding like strange but I kind of see
a little bit of me in him because like
we like sigh he's very into side
projects I'm like kind of out there in
the side projects and we both kind of
understand the personal branding and
social media aspect and I'm just trying
to kind of getting month started and
he's got on the same path so it's kinda
nice because you don't get to you don't
get to talk to a lot of developers who
get it so that's kind of cool it's one
of the things that I really liked about
my interview process was I could tell
that it happens that he's one of my
superiors and whatnot so that's kind of
cool guys I got nothing but great things
to say be honest if I if I had one
negative aspect to say I'm not as
accustomed to having as many meetings
anymore my two jobs ago when I was a
technology turning I had a lot more
meetings and it's kind of about the same
it's just making me a second transition
I had about ten meetings for the last
year and now I kind of have like 10
meetings a week what in your opinion
gave you the edge over the other
candidates that applied to the job hmm
well I could say that I don't know
anything about the other candidates so I
can't really speak to that specific
point you know why they hired me over
somebody else but I could tell you why I
think I got hired and why I think you
know I had I had multiple offers
I you know without comparing myself to
others I guess so I try because I don't
know I don't know what the other
candidates were at right like maybe I
was just a better developer you know and
that then the person getting hired and
that that's a possibility like I don't
think I'm a great developer but it's a
possibility so um so personally I don't
think that's the case so without putting
myself against somebody else I think I
think it was a couple things I think I
was a good culture fit I so in terms of
culture fit I am a pretty easy
I'd like I I consider myself somebody
who's pretty mellow and like like I
don't mind I don't mind like I can take
it and give it back at the same time all
right like I don't mind if someone puts
me into an uncomfortable situation and
and like I was like okay cool I'll just
put you back in on come true choice
right like today and I'm like so in this
particular company they're really
looking for developers long-term they're
not necessarily looking for someone
who's gonna be there a year and they I
got kind of drilled on that when I when
I got interviewed and because that's
what they're looking for right they
there's plenty of developers who can get
up and go and and you know that's not
what they want they tried to build out
their development department and go from
there
so in my case I think it was a couple
things one was that I I really am NOT
looking to relocate and I think that was
pretty apparent from my interview
questions I'm looking to my goals
aligned with what they were looking for
which was I want to CRO and I want to be
promoted down the road right so that was
one thing I also think more than
anything else so just sort of a passion
for learning and being able to prove
that I'm always studying is something
that's very attractive when hiring
junior developers and it's not like a
lie either like you can clearly see that
I am passionate about development I put
out
five videos this week I also solved ten
code five algorithms not that you guys
have seen that but ant but on top of
that I've also been working through I
think I've worked through eight hours of
a angular tutorial at this point and not
to mention the bootstrap for crash
course and the CSS crash horse and the
jQuery crash course and the two angular
for crash courses that I I've done on
YouTube to prepare in last two weeks and
just kind of get up to date and make
sure everything's clicking so I think in
terms of just being an eager hungry and
always working always learning developer
that was probably something that that
made it but I think also on top of that
looking for a good culture fit and
basically somebody who's gonna work well
with others and I'm going to be able to
be a team player right and when you're
working at with a larger team of
developers you need to be able to you be
able to kind of bond a little bit you
need to be able to have some fun right
so like a good example that would be
today where after work the the guys
played board games I was super stoked
about that I think you know and not that
like I and it kind of coincided with my
friends I was planning on doing this
live stream but I had to do a little bit
later but I wanted to do that right
these are people I enjoy spending my my
time around and people that I'm learning
from and and people that it's like enjoy
playing those dorky board games right so
that's kind of it
now I would say from I would just say
between a culture fit and being eager
and hungry I think I did I think that's
kind of what they're looking for and
somebody who is looking to kind of move
up my goal one of my goals is I've never
been promoted for a job part of that is
I didn't really enter the workforce till
about three or three or four years ago
and in reality like actually a workforce
I've been working since I was like 13
but in terms of a career I haven't
really entered the career working world
till last three or four years
but I in last three or four years I
haven't stayed anywhere long enough
because I've been kind of transitioning
my job and finding the right place I
think I found it and I would say that
one of my goals is to be promoted like
it's not even necessarily about the
money it's about proving to myself that
I can come I can convince somebody else
that they want to keep me around I think
promotions so that's one of my goals
right but um so hey Dylan quick question
are you available to answer some angular
related questions next week if you're
talking about a mentor session it
depends on what part what you're trying
to get at but yeah I think I think
people when they when they want to the
selling point for me as a developer is
that I'm very passionate about stuff and
I'm eager to learn
and it's shown and so I think that's
really what it comes across for me Norma
yes I just did decide you the event
today I just don't want to bother with
all the other stuff do you think a blog
is necessary for a portfolio
no but I think there's other ways that
you I think a side project is if your
portfolio is gonna be a bunch of weather
applications are stuff that isn't too
unique I think you're gonna struggle and
I think if you can show a passion for
whatever it is that you're working on
that's the better situation and in my
case my I have a couple different side
projects YouTube channel being the
biggest one
probably the Facebook group next I'm I'm
working on podcasts that I'll start
promoting on my channel I've started a
book and the coding course and you know
I started working on Chrome extension
app today so it's just one of those
things right I think that there's a lot
of different ways that you can show your
passion about coding I volunteered
through code.org for whenever they call
me for you know talking to kids about
software
so I mean there's a lot of different
things that you can do what places react
having my future not not the well in
terms of professionally very little at
this time as far as I know until unless
for some reason the architecture on
future projects changes or you know I'm
not I'm not privy to those conversations
in terms of personal once I get
up-to-date on my on my to dues for work
I'll be able to start finishing up the
Iraq nano degree so I was in the process
as I was you know kind of accepting
interviews I was like okay i'ma start
studying react because I think if I had
angularjs experience I could get an
angular 4 job well I don't have any
react experience so I may not be able to
get a react off and it ended up working
out just like that coincidentally so
that's kind of what I'll be doing in
react in the future
I enjoyed react I really did buy like
angular also so it's I think that
there's a little bit more of a learning
curve initially to angular but uh I
think I'll uh I think I'll enjoy angular
more than react cuz I already find
myself really just started like I was
like oh yeah I remember this it's like
it it's it's all fun to me though I
actually want to start doing a little
bit more vanilla JavaScript am i
watching the finale of rick and morty
nomina so for those of you don't know I
don't watch any TV one of the few TV
shows that I watched was Game of Thrones
I do watch some anime but besides that
the bulk of my viewing entertainment is
YouTube I usually watch it and throw it
up in the back I listen to some news
when I get home from work and then
before bed
any of ice about learning WordPress so I
can become a freelancer learn something
else WordPress will get you pigeon-holed
and you won't make any money long term
how's the new job going amazing amazing
amazing amazing I guess my only real
stressor with that is just kind of
knowing that I have work to do and I
wouldn't say that they're putting that
pressure on me but they I mean you have
to put that pressure on yourself if you
want to maintain your job so it's just
one of those things where I want to be
where I know I should be right and so
I'm I'm about to finish three sections
I'm 70% through traversing medias
angular for front to back course which
is about ten hours of content and last
three sections are you basically
building projects up you build two
projects out so I'm excited to do that
I'm hoping I pick up a few things to
that and then when I'm done with that
I'll be jumping into Maximilian Max's
angular four course was just like 26
hours of content it's insanely large and
I think when I finish that I'll be where
I need to be so my goal is to finish
both those courses within the next month
although this weekend it's going to be
kind of a wash because I'm taking April
to Universal Studios
that's gonna take all Saturday been too
busy to finish off the angular front to
back from diversity yeah I'm going to
get it knocked out and and finishing
them I'll throw up maybe I'll throw it
if I don't know if you can put a course
like that on your LinkedIn I might do
something like that for fun I think it'd
be pretty cool just to kind of start
like certificate hunting a little bit of
the udemy courses I don't know too much
about the django django market Bobby I'm
sorry I can't I can't really help you
out there yeah I'm just a little
JavaScript lad
well yeah it's interesting working a new
workplace and just kind of trying to
find your voice a little bit everyone's
been really friendly but even even even
with everyone being friendly you have to
kind of you have to kind of get out of
your own head right so like the
architect for instance very nice guy I'm
a little bit intimidated and I have no
reason to be and most of its just
because he's a senior individual at the
company and and I'm just like I know
he's busy I don't wanna step on his toes
so it's not like as like he's like
picking on me or anything but it's it's
a very it's very interesting situation
we have to get out of your shell I mean
even me I'm not like a super introvert
um
but is something that I'm kind of kind
of I attend to in awkward situations
become much more of one than I normally
am what I think of all this digital
marketing I think digital marketing is a
field that is growing very fast and has
the college's haven't caught up to which
why you can get a lot of people who can
be self-taught digital marketers and can
go and get jobs and probably make a
decent salary in a year or two do you
work with any boot camp boot camp grads
now I do and what are your thoughts on
the future of boot camps so one of the
members of my team is a boot camp grad
and my thoughts on the future of boot
camps so I have a video about this I
encourage you to watch it it's called
wire coding boot camps closing down or
something a lot of that line and working
with boot camp gracing a single boot
camp Krab and being very familiar you
know my podcast is with Nicolas Espinosa
is a hacker after grad and you know I've
interviewed numerous I've probably
interviewed ten people from boot camps
at this one time and talked to him about
it and I have kind of Hank
mmm-hmm to be honest my opinion hasn't
changed much you have you have people
who are very good and you have people
who are not and the people who are not
they tend to go to boot camps and they
skate by and they pass because you know
really they don't really don't really
fail anybody at boot camps for the most
part they just let you pass and then you
go and you don't get a job but in terms
of the boot camp industry I think you
what you're seeing is consolidation of
the good boot camps while the bad boot
camps are kind of going out of business
and part of that is is that it's a lot
of investment and people are these these
organizations are now competing with
with colleges who are now having boot
camps which aren't having the best
programs either by the way
but you had they have a better name
because there are established entities
in the education space right and so they
have a better name just by that fact
alone because they're in the traditional
education space even though they're
breaking off into a non-traditional
education space so I think that plays a
part of it too but I also just think I
also think boot camps as a whole aren't
something that you can really have a lot
of different locations it's a
slow-growing process it's a lot of the
ones that have closed are some of the
some of the the ones that are on the
larger scale of things and and those are
the those are I just don't think it's a
business model that really scales very
well I think at times you can have maybe
three four or five locations if you
slowly grow once you get past that I
think there's a lot of overhead and I
think that there is a lot of students
you have to have to have that overhead
right so sometimes there's boot camps
that I only need five students
breakeven and other times there's boot
camps where they need 15 and on that
when they have 20 students that's where
they make their money and so it kind of
depends when you're dealing with okay
especially when you're going to new
market since a lot of the boot camps
that are closing are the larger boot
camps that they expanded too quickly or
something along that line so I mean I I
the the boot camp grads that you will
work with they're brilliant individuals
they were gonna be successful if they
were self-taught or not and you kind of
in my opinion you have a 50/50 result of
boot camp grads you have the people who
are there who they didn't study
they didn't prepare and at the end of
the day what they what they wanted what
they wanted a cheap meal ticket and let
me tell you I love to code I I really do
and I've been I've been pretty much
coding every day for like three years
now and are working on something to
promote my software career if you watch
all like 700 of my videos not once will
you hear me say it is easy and I think a
lot of people go into this and they they
don't know it's challenging but they're
looking for something easy in terms of
in terms of how can I transition from
something else to this and they you know
two weeks before boot camp they say
let's do this it's a good career path
without ever actually really knowing if
they enjoy it right some people can't
handle that that that challenge every
single day and some people don't know
that they enjoy Cody my advice has
always been the same for those who are
looking to go to boot camps on the low
end you need to be studying for three to
six months teaching yourself to code
every single day as many hours a day as
you can and so six months out for you
need to prepare for six months for your
three-month boot camp if you can't study
every day this isn't the thing for you
it really isn't you're gonna find you're
gonna find out in that six months if you
should spend ten thousand dollars in
boot camp because it's not up to the
boot camp to tell you if this is for you
you need to your own research and a lot
of the people
they kind of are transition for our
other careers I don't blame them they're
trying to I'm just saying it's a bad
decision I don't I'm not trying to put
blame on them it's their decision and
they're making a poor one not figuring
out if coding is actually something they
want to do because there's other careers
that you can go you know April studying
project management right now you could
be a be a a business analyst you'd go in
all these different directions UI UX
scrum master all that all that sort of
stuff but a lot of I would say from what
talking with people have attended boot
camps there's a good portion that
there's probably about 20% of the class
and $0.24 like three people by the way
and a lot of these three to four people
20 percent of the class who isn't taking
that seriously and they were kind of
just looking for an easy out another 20%
that they're just not going to stick
with it when they when they graduate
right so when you get in the boot camp
when you get out you're still in the
boot camp you're just not going to the
to the location anymore you still are in
the grind
you're still improving now you're
applying for jobs you're continuing to
build side projects all the search stuff
and about fifty to sixty percent will
probably be successful at the end of the
day there might be a twenty percent ten
twenty four percent of people who burn
out and transition into other other
markets but they can they can also
Kristin Leake is a good example of that
I was talking with her yesterday and she
she went to tech talent south and she
started she did a boot camp there and
but now she got really interested in UX
UI and so they're really in the design
aspects she does very little coding now
and so some people find success that way
and that you know the it helps if they
know some coding and how they can go
from there do you have to pay with
PayPal in your Demi I don't I don't
believe so
do you mention the Amazon course I cook
Adam II know that's gonna be Tuesday's
video Amazon has a create your own Alexa
app on coke Adam II and so what James is
talking about do I seen a success is
starting to happen digital marketing
agency who I I'm a big fan of marketing
and social media and I think there's a
lot of success to be there I do think
it's very hard thing
get going I I wouldn't have any idea how
I would start something like that but I
do think that you can be successful in
about almost anything if you work hard
and you're and you're creative and how
you do these things you're in a boot
camp every day so the Mexican guy says
yeah I'm in a boot camp and every day
after the day I go through the lessons
we did in that day they're just some
people don't give a shit I'm like man
you're playing this yeah they say so
this is the thing guys when there is a
good situation I do consider boot camps
to be a good situation for a relish in
three months and $10,000 will say you
can get the equivalent of a 50 or
$60,000 career which is a lot of money
for most people instead of going through
four years and we'll say $40,000 the
average college graduate graduates with
37 thousand dollars of debt right now
it's going up so we'll say $40,000 so
one-fourth the amount of money and in
terms of time you're going to be
spending roughly one let's see one
sixteenth the amount of time and you're
gonna end up with the same sort of
starting salary give or take now that
sounds like a too good to be true
situation it isn't really that it's not
completely accurate because yeah you're
gonna spend less money but you're also
gonna spend time preparing a pre boot
camp and post boot camp and all that
sort of stuff and you're gonna have to
continue to grind and learn as you would
if you're at a college grad also but um
when you have a good situation like that
where it's less time less money but just
as much work which a lot of people don't
realize they only see the less time less
money and they think I could do that and
I want that that seems like good
situation it's kind of like it's kind of
like any sort of sales thing you have
good sales many of bad salesmen and
sometimes these people they just I'll
just go get my certificate a job just
like that it's not necessarily fully
realistic there's a lot of work that
goes into and there's people are trying
to skip that work and those are the
people are typically are unsuccessful in
the long term
you notice I'm doing more ask a dev type
videos is the new job working test if no
I actually have a very normal 40-hour
workweek but with the new job I'm
working with a lot of new technologies
and things like
I need to get caught up so I don't
really have time to do any build the
tutorials those are the ones that I'd
like to do the most for I build things
because I I mean that's what I enjoy
about coding I will eventually be doing
some tutorials on on on on different
topics that I'm working in testing
angular angular 4 and all that sort of
stuff but so but I have to first get
caught up and make sure that give a
quality tutorial and more important than
that I have to make sure I do quality
work at my at my job right yeah just in
the dev tends to agree with me so let's
talk about that I know he says yeah I
just finished a boot camp I'm still
billing projects good did I go down the
slide yet no I did not I I i meant to
but i mean i'm gonna go I'm gonna do it
on Monday I need to go down it's been
too long yeah I actually think boot
camps are great and I think I think that
it is something that a lot of college
graduates end up going to just to learn
the skills as quickly as possible even
even CSKA is the most impressive
projects I saw the only two people I'd
be willing when I went to view the iron
yards graduation worse CS grads so they
have it they have a different sort of
sort of upbringing
Irina upbringing but background and they
were able to flourish in that
environment so I think boot camp is a
really great thing it's unfortunate
though that you know the CSKA Reds felt
the need to go spend another 10 grand
after i doing that
even fighting to keep yourself working
on projects I feel passionate do
long-term effort required what's your
advice for better for building better
self discipline have you tried being
really poor but that helped me so let's
see um that's not really a complete joke
answer I that was really my situation
where I was just sick of being poor so I
needed to get focused and I did but also
I just started I found a project that I
enjoyed right YouTube is something that
I thoroughly love to do and the second
you can kind of turn one of your side
projects and is something that helps
promote your career or makes you money
that's when it gets real and that's when
you really start to enjoy because now
you're actually getting substantial
returns so if you can turn your if you
could turn your um your side project
that you're gonna start and see a way of
monetizing it even if it's like 20 bucks
a month or 20 bucks a week it will be
something that you'd be like I'm looking
forward to this and even if you make
less than $1 an hour when you work on it
is it's gonna be something that's gonna
motivate you so if you could find a way
to monetize what you're doing or he'll
have it help promote your career I think
I would be something that will they'll
make you really enjoy it what's my stand
on the whole NFL kneeling controversy if
you want to you don't have to if it's
too controversial I don't really have an
opinion about this I will say that I
don't find I find it a bit distasteful
that that we have the president saying
that these players should be fired and
and and the reason for that is I don't
like the fact I don't like government
putting pressure on a public entity a
public company and when you have the
government and that I mean Donald Trump
is the president el jéfe if you will
and he he's essentially saying fire
these people for practicing freedom of
speech whether you agree with it or not
a lot of look a big thing about freedom
of speech is the freedom to say what you
want
within within limits right now like oh
I'm gonna you know fire and a plane or
something it's a bet it's one of those
things where okay well we can't let that
because it's gonna cause people to get
hurt in this case you could say whether
you agree or not that they're they're
disrespecting America and I you you it
should be a fair statement to say that
they are practicing their First
Amendment's rights and whether you agree
with how their practice or not I don't
think that the government should be
putting pressure on an organization
saying that they should fire these
people that's kind of what on my sand
song of it on besides that I don't I
don't really care I watch the Super Bowl
every other year and that's about the
only cable I care about I'm not super
worried about it I'm just trying to
learn angular would you choose a boot
camp or Udacity courses put in your
education field I didn't go to college
or taking a course this but I want
something fill those empty education
space in my resume I would say that
either is fine I I kind of felt the same
way so I put free code camp on there as
well as my Udacity Rack nano gray I put
it in progress I would say if you can
build up express a extensive resume an
extensive projects that's also okay but
if you want something on there I took
the react nano degree is there I would
say that when you do put something on
there like that when it comes up in
conversation whether in your interview
be ready to explain what it is a lot of
people don't even know what a Udacity
nano degree is or what free code camp is
so you know that the example I've given
so many times is how I have it on my
LinkedIn and I say it's estimated 500
hours of coursework it covered you know
40 algorithms 10 projects and included
HTML CSS bootstrap JavaScript jQuery and
eventually I went on to teach these
other frameworks to myself and so on and
so forth so just be prepared when you do
put that on there
to be ready to answer questions for when
that happens
where was the Alexis skill of course is
on code Kadim e
uh is it bad for an 18 year old to go to
a boot camp say I go and complete one
would it be hard for me to find a job
because my age no you get an internship
or anything like that everyone's so
worried about what age they work it
you're worried about am I too old am I
too young it's it's like at what age are
you right am I just right am i the
Goldilocks zone of 29 going on 30 I
would say Brian that um I don't think
there's anything wrong with you going to
boot camp but I also think that you're
you're young enough in your life that if
you can there's nothing wrong with you
so studying as well and ain't going that
route and trying to gain internships and
you know projects and just building out
your side projects right you're probably
still living at home and you're if you
have that luxury and you're not paying
any rent take that time self-study if
you're going to do it and I say that
because a lot of people want to do it
and then they go and they play League of
Legends for eight hours a day and they
study for 30 minutes a day so it just
kind of depends where you're at
get some sleep I look tired I don't want
that tired I get lost sleep man
yeah I get I get my eight to nine a day
I'm just it's right it's Friday so it's
you know it is man it's Friday you uh
you've been working all week and you're
kind of getting get them drained a
little bit all right Milo come on buddy
come on
well yeah so uh yeah I get I get play
say I don't even have that dark circles
under my eyes I'm looking pretty good
man oh no you guys talking about a - the
hair but it it's growing back man it's
growing back yeah I think I have a whole
half an inch now I got I got a whole
half an inch at this point um but yeah
so uh I would say that uh
so I also my I have started exercising
again if you see right over here I got
the I got the book I got the curl bar in
here I'm trying to start a workout again
not not like super heavy workouts those
will start in a little bit I'm but I
started lifting again I feel I'm feeling
pretty good
so I've been waking up early and working
a little on here on YouTube and whatnot
and I also go and been lifting so I kind
of just kind of have my schedule has
been where I wake up about an hour
before I take off I've about I have
about an hour to work on things I've
about 15 minutes get ready hour to work
on stuff and
and you ain't ready for the gun show
baby look at oh yeah oh yeah so I've
been working about an hour in the
morning on YouTube and then when I get
home I I kind of I kind of have been
working on I'm just studying and stuff
like that kind of taking a day off
tonight because I I did the the games
and it's Friday and tomorrow I'm going
with the missus to Universal Studios and
Sunday I'm gonna hit the books hard
though
but um when I when I feel like I'm
caught up I'm going to actually start
putting in like to our workouts like I
used to and hello I've been looking like
fucking simple programmer up in this
bitch all right
oh yeah so it's uh staying healthy is
very important and whatnot and I just
haven't I'll be going on in on a couple
of supplements to help out and whatnot
and I've done before so those you don't
know I weigh about 180 right now like
five years ago I weighed 140 and I was
able to put on about like 140 145 so
they've put on about 25 30 pounds of
muscle on about a year I was actually
part of the best shape best shape of my
life and then I started coding and then
it kind of all went downhill those
ladies gonna be on you like flies on
honey yeah yeah the second they say eh
tell me a little about yourself well I
have a coding channel I have a coding
youtube I have a coding podcast and for
my fun I like to look into how I can
save money on taxes and how I can invest
my money and that's when I say no I
liked guys in bands and whoo oh and I
also don't drink you know what's a good
time for me
playing some board games with a bunch of
other developers that's a great time I
also like to study software okay so we
have nothing in common so I'm going to
pass on you Dylan that's how it goes
that's how it goes I so I don't think
she has anything to worry about
how do you go about solving programming
problems such as the free code camp Chen
challenges it's it's difficult for you
what whiteboarding is a great thing if
you haven't done that so I started
drawing out with diagrams and arrows
sort of the pseudocode if you will and I
think you'll have a lot more success
with it also understand the
documentation better understand what
methods are there what are what array
methods with string methods all that now
what's going on I am still in the Tampa
area yes I did not move greetings to
shout out to our fans or not fan I feel
weird calling you guys friends shout
outs to the to the homies to the homies
from Albuquerque New Mexico
I hope it's kind of nice it's kind of
strange right so I'm in this position in
life now where if I go somewhere it's
not unrealistic for somebody in the area
to be there like I went to I did a live
stream when I was in Belgium and
somebody sent me a message on the
Facebook group say hey let me buy you a
beer and I just have it happened that
was in from in Belgium and I was just
like that never occurred to me but now
there's I bet there's probably some
people in here from the Florida area
that if I wanted to do a meet-up or at
some point in time or we could all grab
a beer or something we could do that or
if I was going to New Mexico for
instance so it's always cool to see
where people are from so it's
interesting thing but it's also kind of
strange for me and the Real Steel
double-oh-seven says I'm a fan you offer
good shit for beginner programmers I'm
glad
it's just it's just strange to say fan
right I don't know I I don't know it's
it's very humbling I guess because I
never I guess we're gonna internet
famous Boise sun's out guns out baby
let's see once you start showing off the
guns that shit gets real alright yeah
also the braces probably aren't a
another good thing for the ladies I'm
like a I'm a good fixed me upper so I'm
a good fixed me up or so um the thing
about me is April's fixing me up for a
while right so April and I have been
dating for seven years right and there's
been times where April and I were
sleeping on the couch together there's
been times where I was barely able to
hold it together there's been good but
many many a bad times where she's been
waiting for me to get my shit together
and I finally have in the last two three
years and so like the stuff that you
know stuff that I needed to get through
emotionally and physically and whatnot
and just taking care of things like
braces and having making sure that we're
saving money and that we're gonna be
buying a house pretty soon all that sort
of stuff so uh it's uh yeah she ain't
gonna let me go that easily voice is
what I'm trying to say April's been
fixing me up for a good long while right
so yeah and I'm not trying to go
anywhere so uh it's a it's interesting
world because uh you never really know
right so like like you can always count
on on the woman that when you weren't
shit was there for you right when you
were like you know a college dropout
delivering pizzas sleeping on a couch
and she was like hey you'll get there I
got faith right it's a lot you you know
that when things are going much better
when things are going much better
that she's you're getting out of
sweating man you've you've already been
in the ditches right you've already been
there you've already done that right
you've already lived that awful life and
so if we went back to that you know they
would be there to help carry you carry
you back right when it would help they
would help with that and so I always
wonder just from like a very pragmatic
standpoint of if I ever was single again
would that you know how would you know
I'm in a much better spot than I was you
know three years ago it was just in that
long of a time and things are things are
only getting better granny I've been
working very hard and I continue will
continue I will continue to but you know
I can only imagine people have real
success like real success or making six
figures seven figures where they would
be at I I really I really could only
imagine but it would be it'll be
interesting to find out where can we get
your autograph when I finished writing
my hundred inspirational stories of
becoming a developer book I will sign
every copy that goes out so if you guys
want to buy a hard copy I'll releases a
ebook but if you want to sign copy I
sell for like the same price plus
shipping but all uh when I get that done
I'll sign I'll sign a copy for anybody
who wants to order it if anyone's
interested in that yeah I mean you guys
want to see me
you guys won't see me back when I was in
shape I'll show you guys so if you guys
aren't even gonna believe this is me man
so um a lot of you guys aren't even
gonna recognize me from back when I was
in shape I go ahead and I'm on my
Facebook page real quick so I'm just
trying to show you an old picture of
when your boy was looking looking large
and in charge let's see here
one second guys cuz nothing you got no
you guys actually believe that I was
ever in shape
I'll show you right now that this is me
you guys sing even though I had tattoos
did you you know this is this was your
boy 3 4 years back when it was on the
diet looking swole as fuck that was me
right there don't question it just go
with it
yeah um have I used freelance sites like
up work no not really
fought the gun show you guys and I bet
thought about getting the new associate
Android developer certificate from
Google no I'm not really too interested
in app development if I wanted to learn
app development there's web apps web
frameworks I can use now to to learn
that so actually so there's this one
photo that April has this photo of me
when I was like when we first started
dating I probably got into shape like
two years within when we were started
dating and that was the best shape I was
in I sent her this one like very
douche-baggy photo where I'm like in
jeans I got no shirt on I'm like taking
a photo in the mirror but I have like a
six-pack I'm looking further the best
like body I ever had in my life
to this day she has that photo as my
picture like when I called her and like
sure this is my boyfriend and then
they'll see me and let me tell you I
don't like anything like that anymore
and they're like is this your new
boyfriend
so uh which makes it even worse this
your new boyfriend like oh man yeah yeah
the new the new improved boyfriend the
boyfriend traded in 20 pounds of muscle
for 20k in salary so is a working
working his way up oh man what are your
thoughts on why fly I really am not too
familiar with it to be honest um just a
little research on let's see what what's
going on with the web flow by the way
Casey I know you're the Casey's the
super fan okay Casey's one of the rigs
but um thank you for sharing your your
tips for how to avoid a bad employer
design and develop at the same time huh
so this is like a website design
tutorial like a drag-and-drop so it's
just another drag-and-drop sort of
website creator might without diving
into it my whole thing is they're all
kind of the same right they're all kind
of kind of the same where you're
basically dealing with a drag-and-drop
interface that's gonna have limited
functionality and that isn't going to
really fulfill the the real world
sites like that are good for like
private sites like maybe my coding
tutorials 360 site maybe my my site
maybe building like a site for your
family or friends or a small business or
a freelancer something like that's not
going to be used for large corporations
there's just too much stuff that they
need and it provides provides no value
those are web design sites at the end of
the day do you use Windows or Mac also
there's much a different is there much
of a difference for any I use Windows a
lot of front-end guys like Mac I just
happen to like Windows I mean you say
all my life did your early videos get a
lot of views the Koch Adam II ones uh
some got more than others I think the
Python ones did the best so I think like
if we were to look at my Python so some
of them have twenty thirty thousand
views so yeah I've been thinking about
doing that so code Academy hasn't
released any rule any good content in a
while I kind of miss it I have a video
coming out about code kademan Monday or
Tuesday I also have a top five of my
favorite coding channels coming out and
should you go to a coding bootcamp which
I think you guys will like as well I
forgot what I recorded this morning
oh I saw I also have a to enter to I I
was trying to break up so like three
months back I did an interview with
Christian leak and I've been meaning to
edit it up but it's two hours long and
so you guys are just getting the full
two hours we talked about a whole bunch
of stuff we talked about coding we
talked about her coding boot camp
protect about our UI UX internship it's
been so long that her UI UX internship
is like ended and they extend to
extended it since I put it up I feel bad
shed me on her channel also yeah so
I'm just gonna throw the whole - we're
talking about dating in there so it was
one of those interviews that flowed very
well but was very hard to break up and
I'd have to watch two hours of it to
break it up so you guys are just gonna
whole thing so look forward to that if
you like those long some people like the
long winded ones but don't did I get the
classics nest not yet but that is on the
agenda let me tell you what is on the
agenda 100% money's a little tight right
now
I invested a little bit too much money
and April's kind of pissed at me so
about it so I actually have to borrow
money from her to pay right your boys
investing too much of his income and I'm
like a hundred or three hundred dollars
shy of what I need to without moving
money around so I can't buy it quite yet
nor do I want to because there are so
many good games on it that I'm okay
holding off until I caught up with work
and so free code camp or coke added me
free code camp every time they're free
cocaine my videos when I first vote so
no not really they just kind of slowly
gained views over time I know you're
trying to steal my views to dev material
trying to steal my views me know it's
good luck with your gentlemen if you
guys aren't a fan of dev material he has
uh he has a great thing the
cryptocurrency crash take my money now
I'm doing pretty good with
cryptocurrencies yeah I can't wait to
replay Super Mario RPG man that's gonna
be one I'm actually gonna blow through I
actually had a emulator of it on here
maybe two years ago but I couldn't
infinite it always would crash at a
certain point after like three hours in
but yeah I'm looking forward I'm looking
forward to the Super Mario RPG the
starfox Jew that never got released
there's a couple good ones Final Fantasy
3 like a lot of these games I feel like
I've bought all the
a couple times on the multiple platform
so it'd be nice just having on one
console
I hope they released more man I really
do hope they released a second one with
another 22 games or whatever is coming
out on it I have the Ness classical that
was fun like I played like two games on
me but the Super Nintendo classic I'm
ready
like like let's take a year of
productivity out of my uh out of my work
but yeah so it's just one those things
where I don't want to get in till I'm
ready to I don't actually think I'm
gonna sit down and play for like eight
hours but I could see myself playing it
for like two hours here or there which
is a lot longer than I normally do I
recently started enjoying I've been
played it in about three weeks but I
restarted playing um
Dragon Quest builders that was kind of
fun what do you think of the courses on
udemy I think I think that's the future
education I think that if you're you're
you're going to be in software you get
better get used to video tutorials and
you dummies a great resource for that
going to my first hackathon in two weeks
any advice yes so if you don't already
have a team try and get one it's usually
more fun when you have some friends
going with you also if they have prizes
and topics gear your project towards one
of the lows and go from there
so like that would be my main advice and
just try to have fun man I know I know
when I go I get kind of overwhelmed I
enjoy them but like if I don't have a
clear project idea or I'm struggling
like this hackathon was the datasize one
I was depressed for two days after cuz i
iost only there for like four hours but
it was clear that was beyond my
capabilities and really upset me don't
do that
don't don't don't do that but definitely
go have fun take it as a learning
experience like I don't know where your
skill set is and if they have if they
have prizes I would say go
and try and target towards one of the
prices that you think you can have
basically using their technologies so so
do I have any course suggestions I'm a
big fan of if you just want like a good
entry-level angular 4 tutorial I'm going
through I'm going through that's gonna
get me in trouble
I'm going through I'm going through I'm
going through I'm going through I'm
going through traversing medias angular
for course thoughts on latest art for
MHA what is MHA oh my hero academia
um the principles quark was kind of
stranger uh yeah you had me stuttering
over here dude making up these lies um
so uh no so the principles my interact
name is really I I've been loving it I'm
excited to see what happens next with it
but it sounds like we're going to be
introduced a little bit more to the
league of villains which is exciting
they had one or two sort of snore
episodes during the during the training
during the the fights and whatnot but
but I've been I've been enjoying been
enjoying it I usually watch it every
Saturday morning when I get there by the
way guys if you're if you're not
subscribed already to engineer truth I
highly suggest you do one of the few
people on YouTube will tell you like it
is
but yeah so I've been liking it it's
April still doing a hundred days ago no
she's but she's not studying for a
project mm-hmm for some project
management certifications so yeah
April's hundred days ago would have been
up by now we might come back and circle
back around to be honest I just don't
have the time to do it it's kind of its
kind of on me more and she wanted to do
something else how would you want to
progress as a developer focused off
running back in something else kinda
fends at where you're at in your career
but if you're just getting started to
kind of understand what you want to do
I'm assuming web development but there
are other things you could be a native
mobile developer you could build desktop
applications but in this case for web
development it's kind of your best bet
is to use just go full stack JavaScript
because you'll accelerate the fastest in
my opinion and from there learn front
end to the back end and then start
building things and working the latest
frameworks that would probably be the
best advice I could give you for me I'm
not too interested in mobile development
but there are a lot of frameworks now
that you can go and build those things
and they'll be fun
but it just depends what you're
interested in
JavaScript's unique because you can do
everything in JavaScript now you can
build web apps you can build mobile apps
you build desktop apps you can build
back in front-end databases so what's up
with code fights I've been doing him
again man I'm hooked again I've been
doing him every night before bed for
like thirty minutes to an hour I I've
every day for like five days this week
it's kind of like it's so strange i
watch the tutorials and then i want to
code but a lot of times you aren't
coding during shorts are kind of
following until you it's the project
section and I go and I start solving the
algorithms
so I did it I did about ten of them this
week and I've been loving it and so I'll
probably have more code fights videos I
love a man I really do and sometimes
they get super hard and sometimes they
get a little wonky and you have to you
have to use some gold to cheat a little
bit but okay do you know if someone does
have a job or go to school how fast can
you think one could become a web dev
that's a hard thing to answer because
everyone kind of it depends on how how
much of an effort you put in how much
you know how how much time you're
putting in what your previous experience
is how good you are at math how logical
you are honestly there's been people
who've been got up and running in three
months and there's been people who've
done in a month and there's been people
who've done in a year it took me even
with previous experience bests 7 to 9
months before I landed my first web dev
job and I had spent three years
finishing up as doing a siesta green
right so it just kind of depends of
where you're at in your career and where
you're at in your experience right
all right good mmm this past my bedtime
I appreciate all of you and I thank you
again for showing up don't forget to go
suberino and engineered truth as well
it's been a pleasure I like to end my
live streams on on a little bit of a
final thought and we'll do it on this we
talked a little bit about me
preparing and and continuing to try and
grow as a developer and starting a new
role and go and and and transition into
a transitioning from one role to another
and it's a scary thing a lot of times
because you're in a role you know my
previous job there is no you know I knew
everything I knew I knew peope I knew
everybody there and I knew the situation
I knew that my job is safe and all that
sort of stuff for the most part and the
point I'm trying to get across I guess
is what I'm trying to say is that I'm
now in a position where I don't know
everybody I like everybody I don't know
everybody and I'm in a position where I
need to learn new things which means
that I'm not prepared for what I need to
do but I'm in a much better position for
where I want to be so even though that
you may go into an unfamiliar situation
in life and you may go into something
that's going to take more work than what
you're doing before and it's going to be
harder in the short term a lot of times
when that that struggle and that
bettering of oneself if you really are
bettering yourself it is going to be a
struggle there are going to be times
where you're gonna oh you know I'm a
little behind where I need to be because
where I need to be is much farther than
where I'm at and that's gonna make me
much better in the long term so don't be
afraid of those times when you are going
into uncomfortable situations because
when you go into uncomfortable
situations
that's when you grow right that's when
you say oh look I'm no longer where I
need to be I need to evolve and that's
how you become a better developer that's
how you make sure that you continue stay
up to date you know it's a great thing
to happen so I would say next time
you're in an uncomfortable situation
uncomfortable situation try and realize
why and if it's because maybe you're not
as prepared as you need to be prepare
yourself and become a better coder a
better person whatever it is and
hopefully that will make you better in
life so that's my that's my final
thought for today embrace the
uncomfortable situations in every aspect
of your life and see if you can come out
the other end as a better individual
individual so thank you guys so much for
watching this has been the Saturday
early livestream what I was feeling
Friday because like I should do tomorrow
I wish you all a wonderful weekend hope
you're all coding hard don't forget to
watch my video today which was I thought
a pretty good video about three tips to
become a to make sure that you don't get
hired by awful employer because there
are a lot of awful employers out there
and I try to share some of my tips and
so the comment section has been full of
tips for what they use to avoid awful
employers as well and I know a lot of
you just like look man I don't care if
they're poking me with a pitchfork they
give me some job experience I'll take it
but you might want to be careful so I
wish you all the best of luck have a
wonderful night see you guys next time
