code Kadim II they released a new course
we're gonna be talking about what it is
and why I really think it's really cool
and then we're also going to talk about
just a little bit of a personal opinion
about some of the shortcomings of code
Academy and how I hope they change
because I'm big fan of hilarious but
unfortunately I think they're doing a
lot of things wrong it's gonna be a
little bit more opinionated I'd love to
hear your guys thoughts about it in the
comments below
so recently cook Adam II partnered with
Amazon and they built a Alexa course
which is really cool it's estimated to
take about two hours if you're not
familiar with Amazon Alexa is basically
their speaker home portal connection
system and you talk to say hey Alexa
what's the weather today hey Alexa place
modify hey Alexa turn my lights off and
you're able to actually build tools for
Alexa during this not only do you build
tools or build I guess after that that's
is what they are you build apps but you
also have the ability to build your own
once you have the skill set so you're
gonna build some during here and as a
prereq they kind of recommend that you
have a basic understanding of JavaScript
I wasn't aware that JavaScript built
Alexa apps now that I know that or I'm
making any assumption based off this
statement that they do I might be
picking up some jumpy billions of Alexa
apps just for around the house so I'm
not hey Alexa how many YouTube
subscribers do I have and just have a
good kit the YouTube API or something
like that I just something fun again
it's gonna take about two hours so you
see syllabus here you're gonna build
your first one here and as a free form
project and then another one here where
you're kind of building your project two
hours pretty short if you just want to
build a cool portfolio project I think
it's really neat I also think it's
something that not a lot of people are
doing so there's still a lot of good
ideas left if you like sometimes a lot
of people have such a hard time and then
one
build something I started been built I
feel like there's a lot of untapped
territory there one cool thing about the
Analects app for personal story
storytime is when I went to the
hackathon in angel hack Los Angeles
there was a girl who was on team by
herself she built a AIRC what she caught
I believe she was calling it the Airbnb
Butler and what it basically did was it
allowed where's my green screen I'll
messed up it allowed a user to go ahead
and a lot of user to go to the basically
when you've ran an Airbnb there's a list
of house rules as she built an app say
hey what are the house rules and it was
really good and what's the what's the
host contact information all the sort of
basic questions that you would want to
know and I thought it was a great idea
and that since then I've been very
intrigued by the Alexa platform and
building so it's Google home as well I
don't really have a preference one way
or the other I don't have either one
right now I probably will get a Amazon
Alexa at some point or Google home maybe
when I purchase a house but any up so
that's the cool thing I want to talk
about something that I'm a little
concerned about with with code Academy
and I say this not to come off as a
hater or not to come off is someone
who's trying to be negative but someone
that's actually really concerned about
the future code Academy code cat I've
had this opinion for a while probably
about last year or year plus and I've
just been hoping that the direction
would change and it hasn't and what I'm
talking about specifically is that code
cad amis not really keeping up to date
with not only what development but
they're not keeping up to date with
education and they're more focused on
making money and I don't fault them for
that and and you have things like code
Academy Pro coming out you have things
like the intensive program programs
coming out I'll do a video talking about
this one thing I'll just say it's in the
video anything that
you're gonna pay over $25 for if there
is not a rating for it don't buy it
until there is and that's just one thing
I'll say about that I'm looking certain
in this build websites from scratch it
used to be called it's essentially the
same thing become a freelance web
developer and it was super misleading
and the that for what they were trying
to present wasn't the the best but yeah
I'll do a separate video about that
they've actually done a slight rework of
the the way their site works but my main
issue with code CAD me is that they're
not evolving and what do I mean by that
well they're they're not first off
they're not still creating their bread
and butter which is tutorials that
Amazon Alexis the first one in a very
long time it's a two-hour one it's a
partnership Amazon for all I know reach
out to them and they said all right sure
because they've been so focused on these
intensive programs in the and the Koch
Adam II Pro that I don't think it's all
that great for $20 a month and there are
other courses they've done some updates
and whatnot here there but they really
haven't gone out of their way to create
new content in their existing platform
being educational base being the
interactive tutorials so what what where
could they where could they fix that
well for one start getting a social
media presence if we were to go to
youtube we type in youtube code cad me
let's see what they have here what's
going on with my keyboard right now all
some of my keyboard wants to die right
now if we go to youtube on coke atom II
and you'll see that here we go the
channel then we really have one that
like they're not active with it they
don't maintain it they have started
working on blocks I in fact have more
subscribers than them and if you were to
compare if you were to compare like okay
well three days ago months ago one one
month
before the month ago they was a year ago
and these are basically just
advertisements that they put on their
site that's all it is so they don't have
a presence on YouTube which is obscene
I've seen you have things like treehouse
50-plus thousand and people are putting
up tutorials non-stop you have free code
camp which has over two hundred thousand
is one of their direct competitors so
you're telling me an open-source project
kind of can't afford to have people put
stuff out and manage the time and you
with one hundred million dollars worth
of funding can't hire someone to do
tutorials it's it's a strange thing
where I was hoping that they would pick
up and start doing video tutorials and
you you could make the argument and say
Dylan well that's not really their bread
and butter their bread and butters
interactive tutorials and I would I
would say that they're their bread and
butter is educating people and software
and that is the clearest cut way of
doing it and it's not in it's not like
we're saying hey you teach people
through through tutorials in this
platform teach them in this platform
also it's not unrealistic thing and
promote your site that way also they
just haven't been adding new stuff yeah
we talked about the alexa course but
there's so much more especially just a
web development going on they have a
react.js part one part two it's probably
very hard to keep that updated but
where's the angular four where's the
Redux where's the react native
where is view for that matter if you
want the review up there
where are the the larger frameworks
where is the Dom manipulation for
vanilla J's this is just web development
programming data science programming
itself there's a million different
programming languages root Python
JavaScript Java Ruby where's the sea
where's the sea where's the C++ where's
the c-sharp if you're gonna go down that
route and it's it's so strange to me you
know data science what about MongoDB
what about all the other databases out
there so you have this weird world where
there's their focus so solely on making
money that they're not still creating
content that says hey you know what this
not even new but this up this very
popular library language whatever it is
here's a great platform where we can
learn it for free and then down the road
maybe you buy that one of their
intensive programs once they add a
rating and they've worked out the kinks
God knows their first attempt at this
was they jumbled it all up and maybe
they start creating tutorials they're in
the position where they have so much
money through funding being such a large
company that they could go and hire some
of the best content creators they could
hire at Reversi media if they pay them
enough to make courses they could hire
Maximillian to go out there and build
courses and in projects and sort of walk
it through and help build up their
YouTube channel and their brand I don't
know why they don't do social media they
have started doing blogs because I get
emails on them and I'm glad that they're
starting to do something with it I just
don't understand how a company in
software couldn't understand the value
of social media and also not continue to
create content not continue this
angularjs course it's probably not a 1.6
it's it's one point X right so it's not
updated you're gonna learning the basics
fine some of the basics I did this
course there's a lot that's not in there
and so are we gonna accept the fact that
okay well this is what it is and it's
not going to get much better I don't
like that I don't like that all I don't
like that I don't like that they're
teaching these intensive programs and
some of the concepts some of the
languages they're not making tutorials
or I don't like that at all I think
these should be supplemental things that
are part of their platform and not not
things that are not cup not covered
right so this is a this is going to be
in the node and specifically the Express
JS package and that's not there's
nothing on here for node node would be
an amazing thing to have on here node
would be fantastic it'd be the only real
node training center I know
free code capture I'd do it I didn't
think it was very good as much as I love
free cocaine so I'm very concerned with
code CAD me just because as someone who
loves the platform in life
is one of the one of the premier
resources I use I've done almost every
course on this site and I have videos on
my channel for the bulk of it but for me
it was one of those things where I've
been waiting for them to evolve and
they've been doing it in all the wrong
ways right some of the stuff that they
charge in their cook add me Pro like
they basically give you project ideas
and charge and add it as a perk that's
not a perk a google search is not a perk
I guess so it's um it's very strange and
they've botched this I've my real doubts
about it and they just not aren't doing
what made him so great add new content
maybe innovate with some video tutorials
start building a social media presence
so people start falling on coke and say
you know what what I want to watch an
hour-long tutorial I have you know get
into the conversation free code camp has
two hundred thousand YouTube subscribers
and coke Adam II has many more and many
more users and also has so much more
money behind them that it's so strange
that they're not focusing on maybe
adding video tutorials of some type even
if they don't want to add it to their
main type it would have made a lot of
sense to me if you sign up for code
Academy Pro and not only did you get the
the sort of help but you also got the
video tutorials I don't know I'm very
concerned maybe maybe you guys think I'm
being too harsh I've been someone who's
liked it liked code CAD me for a long
time and for the last year so I'm just
kind of waiting and seen and hoping that
they they innovate and they get their
their game together and I I'm just under
the impression that whoever is kind of
managing them from above doesn't
necessarily get the direction of web
development specifically you know they
have other things but web development is
kind of their main course and I get that
it changes fast and all that but I get
that maybe something make that maybe
it's very hard to actually make one
these and I would imagine it would be
right to make a make a to make it to
make a course where you can code it and
it passes the code or doesn't and it's
compiles all that is
very complicated I have no doubt that's
where the video tutorials come in you
want to somebody web pack awesome you
want to somebody Bower
maybe not Bower NPM node express MongoDB
Mongoose start making tutorials and if
you can get around and it is feasible
and a reasonable amount of time to build
that that's what you do but it's it's
very concerning I wish they would figure
something out I don't know I I just
don't know what they're doing I guess
and it kind of concerns me because what
they are doing I don't really like that
Amazon Alexa thing is probably the first
shining bit of gold in Codecademy I've
seen in a while so I hope they get it
together maybe you guys think I I'm
being too harsh let me know in the
comments below what your thoughts are
but you know guys I appreciate you
