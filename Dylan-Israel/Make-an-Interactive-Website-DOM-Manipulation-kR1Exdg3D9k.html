interactive website unit for dlm
manipulation so let's get started here
we're about sixty percent of the way
through so deal Dom manipulation refers
to event handlers that modify HTML
elements so this h1 creates a new h1
element alright let's see here select
all P elements on the page so to select
all p this would be it like that so
select all the paragraph elements rather
so text ads you know these are just some
more methods and to pen to ads like ads
it on to what's already there this
selects all the list items dot tex new
item and to dot items UL class items UL
so this is on button click for the list
objects add the new item two items items
is a div I so pretend to and methods at
HTML so cool Li Ling pretend to prepend
for friend to excuse me so we also have
delete so click delete so that will
remove it click an item delete fine and
click function selected remove not too
bad so what are we doing next create a
new p element so if we want to select a
p element
believe it's like that there you go so
you're going to need to know a little
bit of HTML some JavaScript some CSS
most likely so there's hi display show
at class remove class toggle clasp
toggle clasp this refers to the current
item that you're clicking in the event
handler below add read to this this dot
add class read
excuse me all right sorry but I gotta
get iced tea Dinah thirst all right so
in the event handler at hi to da rede so
let's see I don't think last time we
showed how to do this so now we want to
hide this one we're going to hide this
one I this one hide this one cool so in
the event handler blow toggle so if
you're familiar with toggle it's going
to toggle on the description or toggle
it off so
alright so select the you LM in add the
class attribution so here's UL add
contribution attribution oops no excuse
me we need to add class there we go I
don't I click to add text Sam document
object model Dom so this kinda is a nice
little resource HTML then you have the
body and then you have the div dot
article here's our article and then it
goes down to h2 title you'll ul and
paragraph just shows you a little bit
more parent-child sort of stuff
you can also use next and previous to
get elements and then all the children
of so that's kind of like so you wanna
just everything in div you can do with
the children so inhale select all
children there we go and bam are we
moving on are we actually building
something here we go so that was our
warm up warm up is done it looks like
we're making a twitter feed just so
sorry all right status update bitch
bitch being male or female you'll need
to be sexist all right so save us a
minute looks like everything is working
cool so start by setting up some bait
the basic skeleton for JavaScript
programs so here we are we're going to
say document already this involves I so
they want to steal like this so our main
equals function and then we have
document oops document dot ready and
then we want to run mean and I think
that's if I remember correctly I believe
this how we set it up there we go so
what else access the post button by
selecting beauty in class so all right
so we want to select the post button
which is BTN and add a dot click
function
alright so create a variable named posts
on the stores notice of our post our
post equals
status Josh box after status box is
selected alright so add a dot click
function this function is called a click
event handler I so this is good so
create a variable called post so say
it's probably going to be strings so far
post equals that will just set it as an
empty string for now how select the
class status box alright so here we go
we're selecting the class status finish
box this dot Val is like use Val after
status box is selected
what goes inside Val
oh I think this is what they want
they're saying they're asking us to set
this so we'll do like that so we're
sending the post equal to the status box
then we want to use we want to create a
new ally soups
oops don't forget your quotes so
creating a new Li object
the Li element does have any text
so all right so I think because we want
I think what they want us to do is a
pendant no for pen too okay that makes
more sense I was thinking oh we have
what we don't append to li I saw it look
right here so we're printing a new one
dot txt we won't all right so dot txt is
going to get our post and then add it to
the posts our variable posts and then
add it to the post index so if you look
right here this is where it's going to
add to the gall class posts so looks
like there's a line don't forget that
so since there's a line on air on line
three and it's because that's the wrong
way oh my god what's going
well our BTN also oops bad habit of mine
don't pick that up alright uh recall
that status locks off out contained the
content that was typed in the status box
okay so this is the content that's in
our box and if you if you look we should
see what's on your mind placeholder so
right here this sounds like this is
status box
yes it we're going to actually name it
form control status box service all
right sorry under all the code where you
prepend list on in 2 posts we need to
line the code to clear out the box all
right so let's select it our status box
dumps it is Nash box and now we want to
clear it and the way we do that is we
just set it equal to an empty string
remember to add code duh status Fox pal
oh and don't put a space Oh dad put his
face single quotes oh all right i'm
fixing this i'm sick of typing double
codes what's going on I should be
working so let's see what we perhaps did
wrong here so it appears that it should
work
so when in doubt refresh your page
it seems to work
alright so let's go to the forum because
I'm almost positive we're doing
everything right here but before we do
that we are going sorry guys we are
going to look line by line at this goes
this is where our mistake is somewhere
in here so our main equals function
brackets are good but click function so
that's one thing that's different sorry
so
let's try and run that so apparently
it's something to do with their
quotations there all right so note to
myself as I need to do single quotes so
outside the click event handler so we're
still in the main function but we don't
want to be on click so we want to select
the key up method function inside the
key of methicillin turkey for this which
is called a cube event handler so
alright so start off by selecting the
status dot status gasps ah dash box and
from here we want to dot key up single
quotes and what do you want to key up Oh
a function rather so we're doing our own
function now and so that's that so
create a variable called post length and
we want to store the length of the
message so we want store this dot Wow
this way so we're going to say this dot
Val so whatever the word is whatever the
text is this is dot Val and then on that
we want to call dot length all right and
then we want to say we want to create in
there another variable called characters
length our characters left excuse me set
a equal to 1 40
alright and then we want to say posts
length equals select the counter
classies nice so far excuse me
characters left equals characters left
alright so I'm doing this backwards I
apologize for that so we want to select
dot counter I was thinking was a method
and then I realized there wasn't any of
these babies Thanks Oh doc County so we
select it and we want to dot
text
all right why why am i starting with us
so update the DA counter show me
characters are left update the counter
class select the counter class he's not
text updates text dot txt and I believe
we do
alright so let's take a let's take a
look I so we have 2 minus posts oh I
forgot about posts length there we go
le- post length oh my god this is going
to be awful video I apologize will do
better though mice puzzling and then we
output characters left ok codecademy has
done me down I can't think for myself
anymore that's like no man because they
don't tell me to remove it I was
thinking they were going to play another
thing another in the next slide yeah
runners reset the counter 140 have to
post this click so pawn click this is
what we do we set oh hi they wants use
jquery to select CSS class counter
alright counter counter excuse me
not text and the the other way I was
going to do it 140 so the other way I
was thinking about doing it was just
resetting dot counter here one time but
I guess this is the same way I was
talking about characters left so I'd
reset characters left rather to 140 but
that also works at the end of the key up
event handler so here where it is our
key up event handler and an if-else
statement if else so
so we'll say if characters left are less
than zero so if it's less than zero
select the so now we want to select our
button again and we want to add the
class dot add class disabled so that's
going to remove our own class all right
I know if we gotta do else so if
characters left is less than 100 right
else if excuse me it's an else if
else if select r dot button
hooked up on an ad the class disabled
not add class disabled so essentially we
want it to not people not be able to
submit it if there's nothing submit its
some at least one character else
select the button again
guys I got a new client and they're
sending over a contract and stuff for me
so had to answer that but I let's get
back to it that was a nice little
breather for me my brain is dead today
because I'm drinking pure relief to kill
a caffeine caving caffeine craving that
can only be cured by a monster or
rockstar energy drink Little Red Bull
stuff BAM so else select the button dot
dot removeclass disabled so we added the
class we added the class then we remove
it and lastly let's disable post once
the empty messages can't be posts did so
here's what they want us to do outside
of everything but still within this
function oops first habit train safe so
let's see what's going on here so try to
add the line doesn't and class outside
your key up
BTW teanna class disabled necklace so
let's see what we did around here first
thing I'm gonna do I like working
backwards so those are removed class
okay so this is what it looks like looks
like we've want it still in our main
function but if we have it within the
key up function it's not going to it's
not going to ever go back to the way it
needs to be not be 10 remove cloths
disabled not BTN add class disabled oh
forgot to else if that makes sense
characters is equal to equal to 1 40 so
we forgot that part there we go and now
it should work i will do status oh we're
not actually able to post it yet so
Slick's BTW in class at the end to do
this post is only enable and at least
one character is typed so at the end of
your click event handler so here is our
click event handler you want to select
our disables and add the class not
BTW n dot
so it's not working it says we finished
but it's not working completely so I
want to go back to the preview and I'm
going to go through line by line feel
free to ignore the rest of this video if
you're not interested in this but for me
I always like to see like why the
is the code saying it's working and it's
not so of our function BTN click so
let's just go ahead and compare we'll
just break it down a little piece by
piece so of our main equals function
good select the button and the click
event handler the post is equal status
box we add a list text supposed to
pretend prepend to so oops no that text
140
and retain your class disabled all right
so everything is good there now what we
wanted I wanted to see if all right so
this still isn't changing so why not so
next thing we want to work through is
our key up function alright so kia
status box here function this dot Val o
dot length is not a method apparently
it's a parameter
it's still not posting this novel is not
a function
and here we go that is why that isn't
chain that it never got our our full
value that's why the integer wasn't
changing that's why it wasn't
recognizing that is because characters
is not defined oh my god what else
little thing did we mess up on along the
way so we fix this to solve out that
lance and I get 140 character selling it
equals 1 40 minus posts length counter
dot Tex characters left if characters
left is less than zero dot B tnite class
disabled necklace disabled and I class
disabled not be tiene let's disable all
right well I'm sorry but for whatever
reason our code isn't fully working for
us to post it so hopefully that's such a
famous event ISIL it's a ver code real
quick and let's see if this fixes it so
we want to go all the way back to
congratulations oh my god so there's
something wrong with our code alright
guy so I'm in the video here if you're
curious what the last one is I'll save
it in here this is it right here this
one works mine doesn't so the post at
class
huh they have something called
characters left or idea so there we go
all right so that that's where it was
pairing lightfoot characters
unfortunately they tell me I don't have
anything called characters but a part of
part of its making mistakes see you guys
in the next video questions comments
concerns all that stuff is appreciated
