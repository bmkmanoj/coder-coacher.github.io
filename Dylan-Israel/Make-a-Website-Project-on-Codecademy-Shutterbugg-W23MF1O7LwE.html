but we're back in make a website project
we're going to do shutterbug you can see
I already did this normally what i would
do is I'd work through it together and
but I just felt like for these what I
I'm going to do it myself first and then
we're going to go ahead and redo this so
that way at least I have my notes and
all that sort of stuff so as you can see
we have a HTML file and a style sheets
CSS so what are we going to be making
we're going to be making this basically
and we want to make the bulk of it as
quickly as possible so what does ours
look like so if you want to see what
ours is look looks like we go localhost
colon 8080 of class main so we'll go to
main we want to add a background so
we'll say background background dash
image and then we're going to set it to
the URL don't forget your quotes in here
and bam so that is going we're going to
save that and now when we go to our
local host 8000 you can see now we have
a background image so it's looking a
little bit more like that cool so let's
go ahead and check that off so also in
the main section we want to add a text
heading and a subheading so let's go
back to our main so here's main again we
want to add text heading so let's see
what there's looks like so we know we're
in what heading we're putting in so
introducing shutterbug so let's put it
looks big so we're going to go with h1
will put in tro do seen shutter bug
/h one and a subheading they used a
paragraph I was i looked it up to see
what they were using so let's go ahead
and use paragraph as well and that says
capture the moments that matter and when
I CSS to style it into a button so I so
I don't link that says download still
the way we're going to do this is pretty
simple we're just going to do a href
equals download shutterbug oops what am
i doing so just put a pound so this is
out our URL and then here we put
download shutter bug /a all right um but
that's not a button so far but we should
still have some text I'll go host 8,000
so oh don't forget to save as well there
we go so you can see it's kind of
looking like it and we're only we're
going to try and speed through this and
only be in sort of the idea that okay
well CSS is something you can do on your
own but for the sake of making this look
more like a button we're going to go
down to the main section and you can see
they don't have a dot main a anchor
anchor tag so what do we want to do for
that so they told you already that they
want you to have this background color
so we're going to give it a background
color and it's going to be of the type
to 380 6895 and that's 0.9 so and don't
forget the RGBA in front of it rgba all
right save this so now it's going to
have a background color
cool I'm still not looking too great so
what else can we do we also want to give
it some padding so the padding this will
make it so it's not this doesn't look
like it's getting so can condense so
this is what I gave it last time so 10px
20 PX 10px 20 X and we're just going to
save it and refresh it and see what it
looks like every time we do it alright
cool so I it's still looking a little II
like we want that we want the curt we
wanted to have a little bit of curves to
it so what we need to do is call border
radius and there's really for me no
solid way of how to say like what border
radius is good or bad so I just kind of
go with 5px always and that usually is
good enough that you can also use
percent and so anyhow so but it's also a
little bit too much to the side here so
there's a couple things we can do here
in this case I want to actually add the
position and shift this over a little
bit so what so what do we need to do so
we need to declare the position relative
so that we can shift it relative to
where it's at so and then we want to
shift it left by 50 pixels so let's go
ahead and save that and now this should
we move over by 50 cool and we could
probably do the same thing for our P tag
save that fresh this cool maybe a little
less for that since are a little more
for this rather so let's do let's start
a tag of 70 and then maybe we'll do the
we'll do a dot main h1 and we'll do a
position relative left 50 all right so
let's go ahead and refresh this okay so
it's not looking too bad it's not
perfect but for the sake of being for
what it is right now we'll just leave it
alone oh and also real quick we can
change the color of the font so that
it's white instead of blue like a
normally
back in there so that looks a lot better
so cool so I think we finished the
second one pretty good so it's going to
check that off and now it's saying in
the diff class section here we are use
bootstraps grid system if you're not
familiar with bootstrap it's a CSS
Twitter developed so it's pretty cool I
use it on my own site just their grid
system so going to check it out all next
slide it's pretty self intuitive but you
see don't forget they already have it in
here that you have to link to it though
so just follow along and I'll try and
make it as clear as possible so it works
off a basically think of you have rows
and columns like a table and the way
bootstrap works is you have 12 columns
and even if you just have two items
maybe it six columns and six columns and
it kind of makes your site responsive in
that fashion so we're going to create a
div called row div class and set it
equal to Rho don't forget to close your
div and again if you're forgetting what
what the next step is let's go ahead
this is what we're going to be doing and
so when we strike you see how that move
is this because of the grade system so
cool so the next thing we're going to
have a picture on the left and a subtext
and heading on the right so div class
section and we're gonna have a row so
what do we what do we put in here so
we're going to need two column classes
so columns are denoted like this and
then you can have small medium or large
or I think there's even an extra large
but for this case we're just going to
small and we're going to set it equal to
6 and then we need close to that /div
and here we'll just it's just an image
with the image SRC equals and then add
this image so go ahead and copy that put
it in here close it cool I'm going to
save that so that's our first our first
container our first column so next we
want to do it another because remember
the six so that's awesome tastic so that
adds up
12 cool so it knows what it needs to do
/div and then in here let's go back and
see what it was that it said so there
was a share so we'll have an h1 h1 that
says share so I'll show you each one and
then we'll have like maybe a P tag and
we'll just go ahead and copy and put
that in there and /p save that and then
this is write CSS to adjust the text
size so we are in the c section so let's
go to section dot Rho okay so they've
already added a little bit of padding
here so main section so what we'll do is
we'll just create a section paragraph at
the top racer dot section p and we'll
just say font size and we'll put it at
two hundred percent so let's go ahead
and save it and see what that looks like
now so here is this this is what it
needs to look like this first top part
so again we're not going for exact we're
going for similar so cool so there it is
this needs to be shifted over a bit but
all in all not too bad so maybe we might
what would we do here we probably do
what we did with the earlier earlier
thing and we would say oops also this is
where we messed up this needs to be in
we put this in the wrong div so let's go
ahead and fix that so I know so this
needs to be in its own column save that
and let's see how this looks so it looks
a little bit better spacing but this
needs to be you know floated to the left
a bit so let's see so maybe we'll do
section
dot image so let's find our section r
dot section I am G section OMG and we'll
say position relative and we'll say left
50px save it let's see if that fixed it
alright cool so it's a little more out
to the side let's bump that up to 100 DX
really throw it out there alright so
cool now let's it's looking a lot more
like what we were messing with so nice
so it's kind of what we might want to do
I'm not sure this will work but what we
could do here is I'm working with it and
thinking about it is left fifty percent
let's see if that will do it that way
this will change along
oh no because I think that's let's try
left twenty-five percent I was thinking
it would just work for that row and
column but I think it may be overriding
I think it may be doing the whole thing
split it at twenty-five percent cool all
right so 25 per cents the magic number
because remember each one of these is
taking up fifty percent of the space so
nice let's let's go ahead and close this
up a little bit so it looks like we
finished step 3 so what's next inside
div class section chief class section
create two more rosy chef two
equal-sized so what do we what are we
creating again something very similar to
what we just did so in this case it's
going to be left right image and then
right left damage cool so it wants us to
do that in div class sections on your
section so this is our first row so we
want to create another one right here
and in it same thing actually what we
could even do is just go ahead and
select this
copy that let's go ahead and cut out
everything and so create a row that's
two equal-sized column so we got that
inside the first column add this image
so I do we myself here oh I'm looking at
this wrong one so inside div class
sections create two more rows that each
have two columns alright cool so we're
actually creating two of these so we're
going to two so we can do this one more
time so where is our div class row
so let's just ctrl-c ctrl-v control V
and gut it take out everything that's
not a clot a div right now so first one
right here alright cool so it says add
the first thing that we're adding right
now is explore let's go ahead and copy
this text we're going to do the same
thing we're just going to use a heading
yeah alright so here's the first one we
have h1 this says explore close that h1
then we have a paragraph this says
explore some stuff cool and now we need
to add the image so we're going to image
sr c is equal to slash close what's our
image
Chelsea cool and now we're going to do
we have another image so if this one's
going to come first on the left hand
side so here we are we're going to say
image' SRC is equal to those and then we
we have another heading here this is
save so this is going to be our h1 and
it's going to say save and then just go
ahead and copy this in there so it's
going to save that so that's the fourth
section let's make sure we did
everything properly so so far so good
it's looking pretty it's looking very
similar so grand maiden there's a lot of
white space but that's kind of how their
site is it looks like to me so let's go
ahead and check this off the fourth one
so again we're just look going for
similar we're not going for exact so
feel free to style it perfectly if
that's what you'd like to do so now
we're says in the footer so where's the
footer here's our footer if you like me
you don't really like any empty spaces
like this
go so in the footer create a row with
three equal size column so remember div
class equals Rho so you always start it
off like this and don't forget to close
it and so for three equal size row that
would be four and we're going to use
small again that's just typically what I
use those if class equals call dash
small dash for okay and we're going to
have three of those so let's go ahead
and just copy pastas this cool so we
have four equally sized or three equals
two equally sized two rows so first out
of heading so we're just going to give
it like an age five it's not the same so
if you're confused about what we're what
we're making we are making this bottom
part right here so it's vertical right
now but I believe it will go across you
so cool the reason it does that is
because the bootstrap so we want to have
two equal-sized columns are exceeding so
company careers in terms so let's go
ahead and just add this like so it's
like so and then we'll say company
oh and then here we actually want to
create a noel unordered list / excuse me
at UL so UL and we're going to have
three list items and this is going to
say careers terms help excuse me why
drink my pure leaf unsweetened tea is
delicious by the way oh not that I'm
sponsored by them because I'm not or
anything like that but um so it's no
sugar in its it's got that nice bitter
tea taste if you like better so golden
leaf maybe a little better for people
who aren't don't like bitter buddy now
so let's save this and let's just go
ahead and take a look before we continue
on about what it is we're looking to
localhost 8002 some of the other ones do
so you can see right here oh that's
looking cool so it's looking pretty much
identical at this point yeah so granted
we'd want to do a little bit of CSS with
that and some padding so let's go ahead
and just finish up what we're doing so
we have another age five here that would
say products and then we'll do another
you will so you know we have this item
assess shutterbug Sasha and I will have
a speaker box and they lie speaker box
Sasha a lie all right save that and
finally we need news this is going to be
a little bit longer so we have a news
and we have a UL
sasha l and a lye solution line and
there's five of these so I let's just go
ahead and copy this over four times so
that five those I'm gonna quit sure why
they indent into themselves so first one
is blog second one is Twitter third one
is YouTube fourth one is google plus
anyone uses it for time is facebook all
right write CSS suggests text size and
the color 2555 found 555 all right so if
we go to this wasn't footer so let's
find footer we have Li and we can change
the color of our Li right here just a
pound 55555 inside the second third
columns add headings and lists as shown
in the redesign oh I think we're done
though so let's check that let's save
and let's go to so let's take a quick
analysis so this is what they have here
very nice now let's go to ours again
we're just going for similar or not you
know we're not going for perfection this
is we've only been working on this about
22 minutes so similar is good enough
right now alright cool so what we would
probably want to do to make this a
little bit better is these are off a
little bit so maybe part of our code we
accidentally messed with that so we'd
want to fix that so wherever it says the
google and apple play i believe that
maybe this is supposed to get stopped so
we'd want to fix that and we'd want to
do maybe a little bit more CSS for all
this sort of stuff and turn these all
into links but all in i say we did a
pretty good job for what
24 minutes right about now so as always
questions comments concerns are always
appreciated and if you guys don't know
I'm starting to blog on my website pizza
poker guide com and I have some good any
of any code that I personally do like
jQuery code will be up there that you
can mess around with too so anyhow I
appreciate the time thumbs up the video
