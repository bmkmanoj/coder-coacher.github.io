day I did one on the Facebook page today
yeah I thought your meeting till you hit
like twenty thousand no mm I do it I do
it so on the YouTube channel I do a live
stream every every thousand and then I
go if I I'm doing on the Facebook member
group now although the Facebook thing
kind of buggy so I don't know if I'll do
it yeah I've had a lot of I've watched a
lot of youtubers who do it on Facebook
and it's just like I mean I will cuz I
have 2,000 people to do two and three
thousand and so on and so forth I want
to I want to let people know vice-versa
hey my youtube channel is here oh but it
they definitely need to take it up a
notch okay so uh yesterday we started
solving algorithms which is exciting
um as exciting as algorithms can be I
think it was somewhat exciting it was
exciting because I got like a fraction
of the way through it wonderboy
all right so a new scientist so maybe uh
since we since we since we stream last
what have you been able to work on when
it comes to the coding since their last
year last night have you been able to
code today I know we were running
errands for a bit I didn't cut anything
today right now I was actually looking
at my code um trying to figure out what
the hell happened to my divs watch okay
Jordan I told you to not worry about
that Jemma right now weird you don't
that you're worried about JavaScript
right now need to you need to transition
100% the JavaScript okay fine I'll go
back to my JavaScript because for the
most part my page is pretty much how
it's gonna be for right now until
obviously I develop more like projects
hey welcome back
um so my projects pretty much just looks
like cute anyways uh yeah so I'll just
go back to the JavaScript and it's
pretty much where it's gonna be until I
learned some better stuff so I mean I'm
okay with that I just there's just you
know few things that are working me
about it and I'm trying to see what it
is I just don't think I know enough to
see what my issue is story of my life
so I'm also thinking of starting to
record myself doing what um just kind of
like a vlog like you've been telling me
to do getting serious on that aspect I
was thinking about it that's all okay so
um did we want to jump back into an
Alabama where did you do let's do review
today that's what I want to do I want to
do review um I want honestly I probably
need a reveal if you wanted to review
that's great
I'm going to so I've actually started
working on my course list here and
there's a lot of stuff on it and I'll
use this as a guideline for review um so
we're gonna get this guy off my lap okay
he's just like hey mom what's going on
so hey guys I'm part of the last room -
oh yeah all right um so what we're gonna
do is yeah sorry I'm thinking I'm just
thinking I am literally okay because
that's how it starts it takes a bit of
me to think about it before I actually
start moving on it so but just just like
a vlog just you know little blurbs here
and there
nothing uh nothing like this channel hi
bra I bra Ali welcome my friend
all right so if you would be so kind as
to stand my love oh this is how we're
doing a review you have to write it up
yeah okay that sounds good
all right so I'm like just go ahead and
stand it up
all right is it okay all the way well
you don't know how to put that up yeah
exactly
James just kind of
because you know memory is subjective so
having some type of recording would
prove to be helpful I think all the way
up is too much no I'm gonna get down
don't worry okay so um what we're going
to do today is I'm going to it's too
early bit good sorry bit code I am going
to start throwing up terms and see if
April can one draw them out or draw an
example of it out and what's basically
we're in to review and
let's
credit variable any type of variable you
want let's start there so one second I'm
going to training her just like I would
train the cats oh hell no hell no you
know what your actions are going to have
repercussions I am NOT doing negative
enforcement
if he thinks he's gonna squirt water at
me he's got another thing coming
that's bleach moron well is the more
negative the more enforcement it is
that's how it works no no it's gonna get
real nasty real quick look at
was I able to find the water bottle all
right so uh all right so what's wrong
with what you've written up here you've
created a variable and you are we like
the actual yes we're doing it there's no
pseudocode in this example okay
I brought a li what do you need help
with man I offer tutoring need a digital
whiteboard yes maybe coming soon all
right all right
so in correct all right why is
this incorrect cuz I don't remember how
to write a variable so let's review
variables variables has three parts all
right
it has the keyword var this is the
keyword this defines that you're
creating a variable a new variable Q it
has the name in this case you put I
that's the name
technically has for that section it has
an assignment operator what's the
assignment operator do people yes an
assigns a value to you and then it has a
value in this case we'll say 1 and then
it also has a semicolon to end the
statement that's how we create variable
I'm not going to finish that sentence
you know like I have to negative
reinforcement
I'll be nicer if you do the shot man
yes'm
alright so um I was like dude where's
attitude all right uh all right so why
are we why do we create variables to
store values the store data right so
what are our data types in Java Script
the start with the one that we just
stored it was a one what is that time oh
okay numbers symbols characters no not
characters yeah no that's not the name
for it oh it's strings strings okay
can you help her no not yet
I'll throw a goddamn delay on this if I
have to okay so use numbers strings
symbols symbols now what are the cheer
false ones boolean all right and what uh
what do we call this
what do we call with list the brackets
really yeah
what is the name for that was the type
of that remember the brackets with the
values starts with an A and an R a are
ah right ah so and then there is
ah Lavar Ali it would I would have to
sit down with you man
and talk to you it's I can't really give
you an answer just off of 60 words like
that we'd have to sit down and sub
mentoring session everyone's situation
is unique but letting out oh okay
what is uh we talked about this a little
bit you're right yeah I don't know why I
can't remember this it's because
you haven't use it enough so um you give
me a number value I'm gonna have you
actually write out the values string
value
first off I was wrong so yeah I
made clothes so for some quotes
example boolean value
good
a example of Ray
keep it numbers all right yes you put
objects in the numbers you can put
volumes
fix a time window get along
brackets use brackets for that's all
eyes
alright now here's the hard one Ali will
be thoroughly impressed if you can't
show me an object with a key-value print
as a hint
I'd be impressed - okay so what
this guy I think it's kind of equal sign
in well all of these are the values on
the other side of an equal sign ah
so we're assuming that I'm just asking
you to give an example of such a value
okay uh yeah I don't recall a object
thing so good key value pair so objects
of that are the curly braces need your
benefit I was like what's an M and then
you have key value pairs this case we
have name and then we have do ah
those are called key values yeah so this
is our key oh this is our value
that's right I remember you're saying
that to an over okay that's called an
object key value this is an object okay
name name Dylan is a key value pair all
right good
where's my big eraser I don't know you
never put anything that you know what I
think you threw it at me the
other day is what happened violence yeah
that's exactly what happened if one of
these red have I started with API call
she's nowhere near ready for API calls
can't do for loops and if statements
cleanly
she's not doing API calls all right
let's try it let's try it blue don't
like registering up tool
okay so set up an if statement now what
is statements do again
they run a parameter
no they evaluate a statement and they
check out if it's true or false
what you're wrong all right
I'm not telling what part you're wrong
some of those right so what is wrong so
in our in those parentheses were
evaluating something we're not assigning
something
were you evaluating if something is true
so we have to make a comparison
no semicolon
next and that that is the end of the
statement
statements contained within the
parentheses so what's happening here
we're saying if our statement what's the
statement is zero equals zero
yes zero is the value of zero is equal
to the value of zero if it's true what
are we doing all right we're running the
code in the a statement okay so let's
let's just put some brackets
okay so in between there's where we're
running our code right now say say that
we wanted to have an else statement how
do we do an else statement what is an
else statement let's start there yeah
we're reviewing right now we've gone
over this
she doesn't retained it quite yet so I'm
trying to review um funniness I haven't
used it in a project yet maybe you gotta
get sent you have to understand what
letters do before you can write who's
not that guy that's of course guys I
figured out how to do anything else with
the woman um besides I say we're
all day all right I know you do
maybe so write an else statement
what's that else statement that's what
I'm trying to remember the exact
well don't I don't worry about the
exact terminology just else runs if the
statement is false good alright and how
do we how do we set that up credibly say
nothing else
come here
okay so let me explain something to you
because I you're not understanding what
the difference between these parentheses
and these brackets are so when when you
use in parentheses we use them in two
spots one for statements like an if and
what that's doing its evaluating this
this is getting evaluated so it's either
going to return true or false
always always always always true or
false is what this is going to come to
and so we use that with these
parentheses the other place that we use
that is when we are have a function and
parameters go into it that is when we
use these parentheses now our curly
braces are to create our scope like so
what that's doing is it saying hey our
code runs here if this is true so when
we do an else statement what we're doing
is saying else we need to run our else
code here
pick one three three four good for you
that the all the all the algorithms all
the all the code is on the other videos
well I'm try say it's on the YouTube
channel good night
all right so um maybe
suddenly the time
no like my look I'm not looking
I don't even know what popped up
okay okay okay we're going next
youtube.com slash current Orioles 360 ie
Rea a right and else if statement
what's all right let's start what is an
LSAT statement
it's the end of the I'm listening at the
end of this school no
so in this statement checks if
something's true
always always always always as long as
you get to there it will evaluate this
an else--if statement an else--if
statement says else if now what do you
what are we evaluating a statement so
we're using our parentheses and we're
saying if this is false which in this
case it never would be but so let's go
ahead and change our logic and we're
saying look if zero is zero equal to one
so that's false so we don't run this
this doesn't run so what happens next is
it evaluates the else if only if this
fails understand just like the else
except there's a statement with this one
so this one will say this one equal
equal to one
and then how do we create how do we
create the scope for it
or the curly braces okay so do it
okay now what if we wanted to add a else
on to this
good
okay
so explain to me what all this does this
checks if this is true or false so it
right now what is it it is this checking
what would you call that yes
Wilson it's evaluating what it's
evaluating in a true or false statement
Oya close
yes it's valuing a statement that is
going to evaluate to William now what is
the elsif doing and how does it work
in conjunction with the if statement
okay so if the if statement is true and
it runs its own but if the if statement
is false then it doesn't run its own
code and it goes to the l-sit if the
elves if statement is true then it runs
its code if it's not true then it runs
the else okay and say we wanted to have
the if and the else if always both run
how would we change our code so that
they would run regardless of what each
statement evaluates to could you do a
return no return exits out of the
functional sense of value back so what
I'm saying is this this runs you put it
in the same school
without changing scope or anything what
I'm saying is between our if-elsif and
else
how do we get both of these to run
regardless if this is true or false what
do we change in our code we say
um
and they all said that
this is true or false
yes if it's true or false how do we make
sure this runs every single time how do
we change this whole thing what do we
have to change so that this runs
regardless if this evaluates to true or
false to true right and elsif is only
running if this it fails okay and the
else is only running at peace both fail
so just turn this into another statement
yes I thought you wanted to keep the
Alice's now you turn into a semi what
you should have said was what if you
wanted two of these to run what would
you change
all right Grayson
all right so what does a function do
I'm getting it mixed up with frack
making up oh all right so what does
the function do stymie don't don't just
say what you say I'll tell you if you're
right you're wrong Oh cuz I feel stupid
when I say it wrong cuz he looked at me
like you're moron model if you do I can
see it all right so what is stop looking
at that
what is a function how do we define a
function
okay okay so a function is a way to
store some code and then we can call
that function do you remember how to
create a function using the function
keyword take some parameters can't take
in frame rate doesn't have to know okay
not sure okay that's fine so I'll give
you an example so when we create a
function we use the function keyword so
a function has three or four parts three
main parts first you have the keyword to
define that you're creating a function
next you have the name in this case
we'll just call it e^x and then you have
remember our parentheses and then as
well as the curly braces to define where
that function is running now it may have
a parameter on on here and we'll call it
a that can be or it remember how is num
the other day so remember our function
fact for all eyes so what is this
okay what is this part of the function
what is this part of the function okay
what goes in here know something we're
passing in to a function no we are
keyword keyword we're passing in
arguments but the name of what these are
if this was numb that would be a
parameter arguments are the actual
values that are getting passed in when
you call the function and they what you
store them in our parameters okay
so num here would be a parameter and
then in here our function code runs so
rhesus
how you felt
supposin
so I want you to create a function that
will add any two numbers together and
return the value
and then I want you to call that
function so that's the keyword what's
the next part the name okay what would
be a good name for adding numbers
together good and I said I want you to
add two numbers together so what do you
think we how would we hit those two
numbers without hard coding it okay
now what are you expecting them to be
that's not good enough what do you
expect me down to be okay I'm asking you
because you can pass in one parameter
you can also pass in two
so we're trying to add two numbers that
the users input the users giving us two
numbers how are we going to put that
into our sum function here are we going
to have one parameter are we going to
have two now you can't have one because
but you can also have two
no no
so we're not doing any logic in there
all we're doing is creating placeholders
our parameters are placeholders for the
numbers that we're going to to
you do not have to have the numbers
stored anywhere yet all right so what
are we missing from our function set up
here that's what I'm always busy um
before I can move set it better
we're setting up our function so we have
these brackets and we have this because
we only want this function around the
code that's between here and here right
so if I were to call this function
remember how we call it is by just
calling the name and passing in a
parameter so if I were to passing let's
say 2 &amp;amp; 3 but the sum of 2 &amp;amp; 3 is 5 what
do I need for my code in here to return
that value to me
where do you get the some variable from
that's not that's not a variable that's
the name of a function I thought I had
to return the name wait I don't want you
to return the name I want you to return
so let's all right let's see it ought to
do this so if I have this variable
called total and I set it equal to this
what the way that this works is it's
calling this function and it's going to
return it and we're going to set total
to that value so the return statements
right that's good so how do we using
this how do we connect this two and
three so that it adds it then together
and returns five that's what I'm trying
to do okay go ahead all the chicken - I
know that's the thought process mhm
sorry I'm excited
now remember look at your function and
make sure that you understand that this
argument is being transferred to num1
and this argument is you in transferring
them to okay I'm trying to remember how
it's supposed to go
you're in look the logic now you're
gonna have to use your operators and now
I'm trying to remember how it goes okay
but I was returned
like
good all right so all right so let's go
over that um so here what's going on is
what are we returning when we call the
function at 2 &amp;amp; 3 what do you mean
what's the value that total what's value
total when we say sum with with argument
2 3 cool and so if we change that to 3
and 3 okay so essentially what's
happening is when we call our function
no one has a value of 3 and 2 has a
value of 3 which is and so we say
instead of caring what the value is we
know that these are going to be
placeholders it could be 2 it could be 4
say no that's why I'm trying to think
without the hard code good and so what
you really need to think about is this
and this and knowing that you're going
to get inputs elsewhere and you can have
the ability to do things with them how
cool cannot also be a string
we're gonna have to write the string wit
me a string here there are your
parameters they give you streams that
can be objects they can be boolean so
they can be erased so we're going to
take up take it up a notch right now I'm
going to change your code
and what I'm going to say
is
we have one variable we want to add two
numbers we have a sum that was getting
called with an array of three two and
we're in this case we'll set it to our
VAR total again do the logic
so how do we with our list return the
values of adding them together with just
our one parameter which is in the ring
how do we access each one of these
values let's start that there if you
have an array how do we access it I know
sources 0 whoo I um so okay so each one
of these have an index spot right yeah 0
&amp;amp; 1
how do we if I wanted you to give me
just the number 3 I had an array with a
3 and a 2 in it how would I get the
first index I forget how to write it
it's like a zero
do you write zero so this is zero index
this is the one index and so if we
wanted this array 0 here and whatever
the rain on would be that's right you
return 3 yes so based off of that how
would we solve this problem so you
wouldn't need this one I'm sorry you
wouldn't need any perimeter
I got good good could do it what good
couldn't continue how else are you gonna
get the array in there as a parameter
you you have one a right here you have
one parameter your parameter is a is a
list so you can name the parameter
whatever you want yeah as long as it's
not a keyword like function so num1 num2
are good naming conventions but you
could have it not being num1 or you can
have it called number a 1 if you want
what okay do you mean whatever you want
it's always it's not keyword hey big man
are you calling us no remember those are
just placeholders okay so this is your
placeholder
what is numb one right now when we call
some which an array of three two what is
the value of this it's alright
of three into good so we know that this
is all we need willing into one
parameter what are we doing here to add
those two numbers together
close but you notice how you're not
using your parameter your input
damnit alright let me show you something
so I'll give you an example right so
here we have a
XCX array we're going to set this equal
to an array with 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 and I want that
last one the way that I get that last
one is not by just putting 3 in brackets
I have to call the name of the array
which is e^x array and using bracket
notation to make this would be 2 because
this is 0 2 and so the value of this is
equal to 3 so knowing that and applying
the same logic using no one how would we
add index 0 and index 1 are two numbers
together
whoops
I'm pretty sure this is wrong
and what are we missing in there so why
do we use a semicolon cuz it ends it yes
it's like a period so what is no one
index zero based off of here sorry
what's known to paradigm one index 103
to good so we've passed in an array and
we've added the two numbers in the array
nice
let's review for loops take it up a
notch so
so for loose why do we use for loops
um to run things multiple times
good now draw for Lou
so what's the first thing that we put in
there
we initialize something
the iterator can initialize the iterator
yeah okay so initialize it okay in this
case we're going to start off with it
being equal to zero so what is the next
part that comes
the statement alright I'm going to do
the for look because you're going to
have to use it because what we're going
to do next if we're going to do that
same ad function taking in an array
except you know how we hard-coded into
the two numbers we hard-coded numsy row
num1 zero and then plus num that's not
hard coding is a need because what
happens if we have three values to add
together so so that's what we're going
to do next is we're going to UM I give
you an array three values for values and
five values the same sum function and
you're going to use a for loop so let's
say I is less than five so this is how
many times this will run why this is
true the for loop runs right and then
for each iteration we increase I by one
and then within our for loop our code
runs explain me every part of this for
loop right so this is our variable which
is pulling our eye area that equals to
zero
okay and of that statement now I'm
taking your eye which equals to zero is
less than five is statement
it's also saying that the I plus pots is
adding two zero one basket
yeah so every time it runs it's adding
one to I and then the next iteration
would be eyes one is that one lesson
five true yes so it runs again and then
it goes is to is to less than five yes
okay three less than five yes for less
than five yes five less than five is it
no five years old I said fine so so what
happens is once five once this is false
because five is equal to five
a five is in less than five they're
identical so once this is false the for
loop it's done it moves on to whatever
is below it alright so I'm going to set
up our add function one time for it so
this is your algorithm for the day here
this will be the hardest one and then
we'll end it after that you may end it
shortly so we create a function called
some exactly like we've been doing we're
just not hard coding things anymore okay
so create a function called sum and we
take in a number ray
run our code between here and here now
I'm going to give you three tests test
one what happens and there's no hard
coding is it we have an array I'll
actually write the function out so so we
call some and we have an array it has 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 2 it has some and then it
has 1 comma 2
three has some
with an array that just has one in it
for it has an array with nothing
[Laughter]
okay it's gonna work with all this yeah
yes so why did so how would we set up
our for loop in this case that's what
each one of these this is our parameter
gamma ray we have to use it in our logic
here and I'm going to add all those
within itself yeah you have to set up
your logic
now I'm going to give you I'm going to
remind you that array has a function
called dot length so in our case we
could use number R a dot length to find
out how long the length of the array is
for how many times we have to run our
for loop
I have this ain't going to make this
your homework and you're going to come
back with the answer tomorrow so what
you have to know is you're going to have
to store a value you're going to have to
add to the value and you're going to
iterate through a for loop for how many
items are in an array and you're going
to need dot length for that all right if
you don't come back with the right
answer I'm a shame you everyone in chats
going to shame shame I uh hi guys so if
you're new here what we try and do is
after about 50 minutes we'd like to make
you feel stupid here that's what we like
to do someone's love set uh so um
so one thought nightbot was a person has
to a question yeah someone donates I
like that idea
let's see um alright now no real
questions um so let's how how was today
for you because this is going to be how
it's generally going to go you're going
to study on your off hours and then this
is essentially going to be homework in
testing pop quiz essentially it sounds
nice because that's what I like I'm
really sure how the dynamic between us
is going to go over well in that
structure but we'll find out um just
constantly feeling inadequate and just
being able to remember things like my
opinion even as a salary developer I
feel bad sometimes like yesterday so
don't think it's only you one thing is
is that this is all new we're
reprogramming your brain at the end of
the day to solve problems logically you
no longer you no longer
my apps actually jump into my last year
to do this but you're no longer you're
no longer hard-coding things okay
is that what you have huh
yeah someone please ban him for being
inappropriate please yeah um some
reasons only we do to my chat but but
essentially you see what's going on is
we are reprogrammed like you just want
to add two numbers as you can you see
why like with the example test I gave
you here sometimes we have zero values
one value two values seven values and in
a right yeah is that you even
considering an array with no value yes
what would the length of an array with
no values be zero because there's
nothing in it
you think of me it's good review day um
alright guys so that was today's a study
session yeah right it's hard I get it
but I want to do it that's hard yeah
this if it wasn't hard everybody we're
doing it story of my life so don't sweat
it you'll get there
hey Jake um yeah guys if you haven't
already joined our join the Facebook
group yeah George I'm crossing my
fingers that that is true the the link
is in the description code tech and
caffeine I encourage you to join the
group every thousand members there I do
a livestream similar to what I do on my
channel here where every thousand
members I will do AMAs and I try review
portfolios sometimes and things like
that I know some people not everybody
can afford to book an um a cup not
everyone can afford to book an hour of
my time or a developers time to review
their portfolio and stuff like I so that
s one of the ways that I try to help
people out
I can't review everybody's stuff all the
time otherwise I would never get paid so
like I'd never be good I would have
never become a developer if a developer
right but I encourage you to join the
Facebook group and you can support me on
patreon you can does it start at 3:00
every day and mount time Jake Nielson no
there's not really a set time it
fluctuates between 5:00 and 7:00 Eastern
closer to 6:00 usually somewhere between
five and six um yeah I don't know too
much about Android with Google I know
that if you look at in general like the
Android jobs are a little because of all
the Java developers in school I think
it's kind of flooded the market
with the Android developers and it's a
little harder good job that's been my
interpretation and there's usually when
you build a a Android app and this is
generally what happens is usually build
it for a company that built in then you
don't necessarily touch it again a lot
of times you don't necessarily update
features like you would with a web
application all the time so it's just
been my experience but everything is
different but it does seem that that
that trend is going down now Java is
very high in language you make a lot of
money because a lot of international
corporations use that but it's the
mobile markets interesting in that
fashion anything you want to say maybe
before we we kind of say goodbye you
just thank you to everyone for the
encouragement appreciate it and thank
you Jake I appreciate that man I try to
do the best I can if you guys want to
get alerted when we start if you go to
my channel or one of my videos because a
lot of people are like oh when you start
what do you do and or you know how can I
make sure that I'm here when we get
going because I you know maybe you do
have questions or you want to follow
along live right it's always that's kind
of the fun part about Twitch's you're
there you're part of the experiencer
you're kind of enjoying it you can do
that by trying to pull it up on here
it's my like dog speed internet okay I
got some dogs running in the shed but
what you can do is if you want to follow
along there's a little bell here that
you can click to say subscribe I'm go to
somebody else's channel I hope you
subscribe I show you some arena so I see
this Bell here if you click it it'll
send you notifications about the
channels when we go live and what we do
so just something to keep in mind if you
definitely want to be here and follow
along and be part of the process
um let's see am I going to resume the
backend projects for free Co camps so I
built out all of the API micro services
uh at this time I think I will resume
then water water in wharoo ah but I'll
probably part of my courses are full
stack applications I'm building a course
going over the basics intermediate
advanced it's going to be all web
development base eventually maybe down
the road if I ever dive into a different
field I'll expand it out so I'll
probably be on there if anything and
yeah I mean that that's the gist of it
though the the back-end projects are way
too time-consuming to put up on YouTube
in reality so I'll probably go up on my
course and yeah and that's all I really
have to say about so we'll be on your
YouTube channel - no it will not
I don't have any plans to the micro
services around there um but at this
time I don't have any plans to put it up
there I originally did but I with I
finished I'm basically finished with the
first one I still have about a third of
it to go but more or less it's there and
it was so time consuming that the idea
of me putting it up and getting 300
views and not using in my course was
disgustingly sickening and so that's
kind of counting
what website will he hosted on I haven't
thought of a name yet um I've been
looking at names for a while and I
haven't fully decided on what I want to
do thank you maxxium psych psych oh I
appreciate it
yeah nice it's always nice to know that
I think it's always cool when I people
tell me I sucked at like 1,000 like yell
man you're an OG ah all right baby
uh would you like to thank you me like
yeah thank you guys
I think is you going to be free website
or a paid subscription there will be
free stuff and it will be paid stuff but
the idea is to make some money and
provide additional content so that will
be the idea ah a mixture yeah you did
good though yeah me no I want to stick
to it guys um I just hard that's it she
wants somebody hell yeah I want the
money so our guys are taking this guy's
money feels awkward
there will be free there'll be tons of
free sections where you are so you'll be
able to see maybe we can talk them out
to giving free subscriptions for every
like thousand subscribers well there is
a rumor that a certain gentleman is
starting a certain coating box that may
or may not be coming out with certain
courses included in them for subscribers
there is that rumor so as well as those
who are patreon subscribers definitely
need to get something and in return so
yeah guys ah that's just a rumor though
oh so I appreciate y'all being here you
know you're 37 I'm turning 27 tomorrow
on Mother's Day happy Mother's Day and
all you mothers out there um anyhow guys
