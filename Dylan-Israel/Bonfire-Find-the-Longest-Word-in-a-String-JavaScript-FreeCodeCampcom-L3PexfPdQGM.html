worker at working on that free web
developer certificate we're in our basic
algorithm scripting the bonfire find the
longest word in a string so this one
should be a little familiar with what we
did beforehand so if you remember they
give you some hints here so dot split
will split up your string based on
whatever separator you put in it in this
case we want the longest word so our
separator would be the space so that's a
good place to start so why don't we save
our and we'll say we'll say if our we
want to name it well called it right
because it's going to become an array so
I'll call it array of strings is equal
to the string that we get split up with
spaces so we just created an array of
string so the zero zero one would be the
one would be the one index would be
quick and so on and so forth so what do
we need to do now so we want to create a
empty string called longest string and
set it to the most basic value of a
string like that so it's just an empty
string and from there because we have we
now have an array string so we need to
compare to see if this longest string is
less than anything in the array we need
to swap them so this is what we'll do
here we'll do a for loop and we'll say
for create a I counter to keep track of
things start at zero and it'll say why I
is less than array of strings dot length
so the length of the strings the length
of the array excuse me increment by one
and now what do we want to do so we're
going to run a for loop here and from
here we want to run an if statement that
says if
longest string dot length is less than
our array of strings and don't forget
the I less than the array of strings on
our current index value dot length less
than the length of that we then are
going to swap the words so we're gonna
say longest string is equal to so if
it's smaller in size we are gonna set it
equal to array of strings and whatever
the value is here now what else do we
need to do it looks like we just need to
reset STR here so we're gonna set STR is
equal to our longest string so and then
it's going to run this and it's gonna
find the longest one oh and make sure
you spell everything correctly our
strings array and make sure you spell it
correctly right here there we go so
let's go ahead and put some comments in
here real quick so that we you know it's
fully explained so create an array of
strings breaking the words strings
breaking up every space temporary
placeholder for a longest string
iterate through the array and compare
longest string with current string cool
so run it go ahead and tweet it out if
you're like me I like to tweet it helps
them out probably helps me out submit go
on to the next challenge
and we can submit our solution as a
github gist buddy now guys I'll see you
in the next video titled case of
sentence so I don't remember what it
means the title case so I gotta look
that up but as always thanks for
watching I'll see you in the next video
thanks for watching the video don't
forget to Like and subscribe that helps
me out a ton and I appreciate all the
comments that I get and all the
questions I get in the comments and I'm
happy to answer them so keep them coming
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
