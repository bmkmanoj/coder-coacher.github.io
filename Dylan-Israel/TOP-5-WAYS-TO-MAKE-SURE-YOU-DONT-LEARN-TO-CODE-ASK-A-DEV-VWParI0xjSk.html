that you do not learn to code that's
right you are the type of person who
wants to make all the wrong decisions
and we today are gonna tell you how to
do it how to make sure despite your best
efforts that you still don't learn how
to code let's dive into it well you're
out there spending all that time not
learning the code might I recommend
something to fill the time we have the
humble monthly bundle every month you
get over a hundred dollars worth of
games and they'll give you some right
away when you order in this case is
quake champions Elder scores online and
the legends of heroes of Skyrim if
you're interested in that use my link
down below and you help me out in the
process thanks guys before we get
started some of you may be wondering is
this guy wearing a rope it's questions
like that that make you not learn to
code alright stop asking stupid stupid
questions PIPP decisions don't worry
about it alright so let's dive into
number one right now so number one you
don't code just straight it you're the
type of guy who likes to put a picture
of his laptop
probably a Mac at a coffee shop that he
goes to once a week and writes about one
line of code and puts hashtag grind at
11 a.m. in the morning thinking he's
doing something that's you
yeah that's up guy who doesn't code
every day that that you're killing it
you're a special kind of stupid alright
you're the type of guy who just coats
every two weeks and doesn't understand
why he can't seem to grasp it why he
can't seem to land an entry-level job
that's you you're killing it man if you
can do that you can make sure today you
don't learn to code alright so number
two number two when you do code you know
when you do codes a few times you do you
do to do apps baby you're your to doing
this out of the world write your
JavaScript to-do app jQuery to-do app
that's all you do if you can't find a
tutorial that walks you through every
aspect of the world's simplest app you
don't do it forget all that
you don't ever build anything custom I
need a blog post I need a video and then
I'm gonna follow it and copy the code
might even rip it off the repo and just
change the title that's you you build
these simplest things I've been built
tenfold with zero originality no
originality at all and and you're
killing it keep it keep on doing it and
if you really want to get spicy you
might just do like a calculator to spice
it up a little bit cuz that's never been
done before but the to do apps is your
 right that's that's how you roll
right and you never get better use you
you never get better you start with the
to do apps and you keep doing the to do
apps right you never progress you always
start at those simple projects and keep
doing the simple projects with zero
ingenuity you're killing it all right
just keep it going so the next one it's
the the this is a cryptocurrency term as
far as I know this first time I heard it
but I think it I think it describes you
and you're stupid and how you can
continue to make sure that you don't
learn to code you have what is called
FUD fear uncertainty and doubt and what
I mean by that is that you are always
worried about Java Kinney outsource jobs
getting replaced jobs doing this jobs
doing that you say you know what I don't
care about the stats about the job
growth being in the positive grown
faster than the average job I don't care
about how everyone is salaries are very
high right now and even if they drop
you'd still be making more than not I
don't care about that I don't care that
there's a ton of jobs no no no I'm
worried about just other stuff that
doesn't really make sense I'm worried
about oh my god the WordPress jobs the
WordPress gonna take over the the oh my
god they're gonna outsource all our jobs
now that's what I'm worried about all
the time so much so then I talk about
that all the time
I don't really do that much research
about it and I make sure on top of it to
worry so much that I don't even code my
to my two hours every two weeks that's
you you got the Fudd down man you are
worried you are fearful and you have
doubts so much so that you never get
started when you do it's just hash tag
grind every every two weeks in the
Starbucks right so number four you go
solo baby you don't know you don't
need anybody else's help cuz you already
know how not to code you don't need to
get a mentor you don't need to watch
courses and videos by some know-it-alls
you know it all you know it all baby
and you tell everyone get out of here I
don't need any of your help I don't need
your advice I am a coding god I started
a coding god and I will continue to be a
coding god I don't care if nobody's
gonna hire me cuz you don't need to know
how to code because you're trying not to
learn to code so you already know you
already have all the answers for that
you don't need any help you don't need
to join facebook groups and listen to
people share stuff News and stay up to
date on the community no no no you don't
need to you don't need to go to meetups
where qualified speakers who should be
charging decent amounts of money will
devote their time for free and help you
you need to you don't need to go and
build your own projects no no no you
already know it you're gonna go solo
into this you don't need any help
alright you don't need that stop with
that
wasting your time we're trying not to
learn to code today baby and you're
killing it alright number five number
five this is this is crucial this is
really really crucial occasionally
you'll hit that rock bottom right you'll
hit that holy
maybe I actually do want to learn to
code and you'll say to yourself what am
i doing something wrong am I am i and is
it is it not enough that I code one hour
every two weeks
I'm putting hash tag work hash tag grind
hash tag sweat code on there right hash
tag mother effing code and god that's
what you're throwing out on there and
you're saying but it ain't working right
I'm doing to do apps I got to do I have
it to do app to do to to do apps right
you're killing it right you see you
you're worried beyond belief you got the
thud going strong you're saying I've
been doing this solo this whole time I'm
killing I don't need anyone elses advice
but you get you get worried and this is
when the number five top thing you start
making excuses baby it ain't me it's
them it's this entire come
coding community it's rigged against us
people who try not to learn to code it
ain't fair right it ain't fair I'm
learning Pascal man where are the past
scheduled jobs what's going on man you
start making excuses because it can't be
you
we've already said that right you're
you're you're working two hours every
two weeks you're killing it baby but you
ain't got to worry about that right cuz
you're making excuses for yourself it's
not it's everybody's else's it's
everyone else's fault we already know
this you know this I know this right
it's everyone else's fault so that
you're not working hard enough it's not
that you're you're building to do apps
and never anything else you know we all
gotta start somewhere and if you stay at
the to do you're always going to have
something to do you know what I'm saying
so so that's you baby you're making
excuses you ain't got to worry about
nothing else so these are my five ways
to make sure that you don't learn to
code all right and if you're doing these
keep on doing them and you'll keep on
not learning to code and you'll keep on
getting nowhere
number six bonus six learn yourself some
WordPress Lords of Squarespace learn
some Wix and we can make sure that on
top of it you don't learn to code on
that so uh what that means that guys a
little bit fun today I appreciate you
all
I hope this maybe rang true for some of
you to get it together if you don't know
how to code that's okay if you're trying
to learn to code that is admirable and
it's gonna be hard what I want to say to
you is if it's something you want is
achievable but you have to work hard and
I know a lot of people don't and if
you'll notice nine out of ten people are
really grinding ain't got the time to
tell you that they're grinding they're
too busy grinding they're not worried
about showing the world that they're
grinding because they're out there
grinding you know I'm in a robe right
now because I'm sick and I'm filming
this video because it's part of my
schedule you know and other people are
grinding out their day jobs with their
kids and everything else so I hope
whatever your grind is
whatever your grind is I hope that you
are actually doing it so best of luck to
you and your coding an adventure as
always guys I appreciate you don't
