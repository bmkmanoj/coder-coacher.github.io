dynamic HTML modifying HTML elements
were about forty percent done already
it's a short little jquery course but it
is appreciated and it's for you I mean
what right do we have to complain about
free man alright so in scripting j/s
create a variable called h1 so remember
all our variables are start off with
like that and I believe we have to nope
we don't do it like that because we're
creating image s very well set it equal
to jQuery object containing an h1 with
the text alone so if we look at the
example here we want it did we want this
object and inside there it says hello
and then /h won the tag should be a
string so okay so it's a little little
odd at first but we're saying select
this HTML element
one second when I close this door
because they're doing some tree trimming
alright so next we are in script yes to
have go ahead and append a paragraph to
the body of your HTML document so you
can see right here this kind of shows us
what we want to do scope we want to do a
few things what do we want to do so
we're looking for body
in the scriptures go ahead and dot
append at paragraph to the body of your
HTML element okay so it's kind of
reverse of how I would think of it and
we're going to put i'm a paragraph in
there and then it's dot append to the
body think that's right nope looks like
you can add a P to the page
you
check the hint if you need help oh okay
so we have to get everything started
right document dot ready and then we
need our function here
we also need a semicolon then we need to
put this inside of there and now let's
see if we did it right
so fairly or to put a slash like that
oh we had it the wrong way and then it
goes into the body and we also have to
put the slash because apparently it's
apostrophes it gets a little confused go
ahead and add a P tag to the dot after
the div so this is an example that's
good you can place any text you like in
your tech so let's go ahead and get this
ready again document document dot ready
and inside here we have our function it
does some stuff alright so we got that
set up next we need to add P tag to the
dot after so where does this P tag want
to go for the ID 1 so I need to go to
neo and the one sorry watch the trailer
for the matrix for andam lee now I've
been thinking about watching today i dot
after so after that we want to add some
stuff what do we want to add we want to
add a paragraph I no excuse me a div I
know we want to add a paragraph to the
div and we want it to say working with
jquery and you can see it got added
their coat so in script j/s add a new
line below your code to move your P tag
after the dip with ID 1 Kerner jQuery
selector exited to right
in the scriptures on your line below
your code and put some icon there to
move your P tag after the dip with ID 1
so we want to change this to this is
what we had this is what we have this is
what they want
I'm a little confused about what they're
asking so we're going to go to the forum
and see what's going on here but I think
once i see the example it should all
make sense this is number four moving
elements around necessarily confusing
isn't that all your dish sorry am lost I
am too don't feel bad there's a
disconnect between 0 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 2 where
they should all actually beat the scenes
so this is what we have people until
like a blow would be
so it sounds like they just want to if I
understand this correctly they just
wanted us to move it to the end of our
two so in this case they just want to
switch it to the bottom of here but they
still want us to leave this first line
up so they say move anything that's a
paragraph to the end so what's going on
here I think that's what's I think
that's what's going on go ahead and dot
remove your P tag from your HTML
document okay so you can see right here
we want to remove so we're looking for
the P and we want to dot remove
and it removes the few tag so now that
we think of it that highlighted class
seems like a great idea we supply the
HTML and CSS and the script GS tab add
the jQuery code next to make your
context if highlighted then clicked make
sure to click Submit and then click
highlight me to to see the results all
right so it looks like we have to get
all this going so we have document
already function okay just look at the
hint so dot click then we have another
function and then this don't phunk
so I'm highlighted we have text we have
class highlighted and ID alright so we
want to select an element in this case
it's the text pound text and where it's
a dot click perform a function and then
we want to say whichever item that we're
clicking is this current item is getting
clicked
so apparently that funk is the way that
we can just say what class to use in
this case we want to use highlighted so
when we click this funk is not a
function
huh
da Island
so let's see here so saying on our text
so we're doing one of our one of our
classes i think is wrong so let's go
ahead and take a look at the form
because we're probably almost there this
is six or 14 specifically model nope it
was adding removing classes so let's see
what's going on here
so we have our good on the dot click and
oh so they use an ad class function to
call this so apparently this funk is a
jquery function use you should use to
add the class but that's not working so
let's try add class
well it's not working either so maybe
where our paragraphs are off somewhere
all right so document ready function
text don't click function this dot add
class
there it is
you see how it's highlight now it's it
was our dot right there um apparently
when we're calling the stylesheet it
doesn't work that way when we use the
add class I'm not sure why they're funk
doesn't work but hey I mean it is what
it is so add class is how we're going to
be able to add the stylesheet to that on
the click so change your ad class to
toggle clasp so this is probably going
to let us on click toggle to see how it
turns on and off so you can see right
here on off on off on so let's get some
practicing change the dip in your HTML
document so that is a height of 200
pixels oh not in here Andale with 200
pics online of order raised tempest to
let's mix this happen immediately
without the need of click so just set
everything up document not ready
function
and then we'll just have a run it
immediately so we don't need to say it
we don't need to do anything else we're
just going to say that for a div dot
height we wanted to have 200 pixels and
then comma div with we want it to have
200 pixels and then for div
of dot order ash radius we want it to
have 10 pixels
cyclone so icon silicon
oh yes so let's see if that's it border
radius is not a function order dash
radius radius is not defined
this is what defined all right oh so
let's see how people called change
border-radius 8 of 14 changing your
style
div CSS border-radius so
alright so apparently the way they do it
oh you know what we didn't do everything
we need to do so zero actually they
declare it like this
border radius I think has a couple
different parameters and that's probably
why we can't do it like that
did you give your do a border radius it
looks like radius is not defined to all
right I don't remember what all the
parameters are but apparently we can do
it like this as well so we can just set
say use the dot CSS border radius
function with 10 10 pixels and you can
see our corners are curved now excuse me
we've added a paragraph to our HTML
document use the dot HTML function set
its text to jQuery magic in action
don't forget too ! all right so we have
to get our jquery ready so document and
then this is dot ready function and in
here we want to say that for i'm about
to change for the P tag dot HTML
jquery magic in action you know the
drill get your document already at this
point we should write so document
already function dot
alright so our shits ready to go excuse
me let's create a dot click event
handler for the button element let's
create a dot click event handler for the
button element alright so on our button
click we want a function that does some
 make sure you pass it to the dot
function inside your function create the
variable to add so we want to say to add
and set it equal to the contents of your
input field and see how they do that so
to add and then if you look here check
list item we want to add this so we're
saying when we click our button add we
want to use the input of the name and
get set the name equal to the checklist
item and if you check here our checklist
item is our name so that that makes
sense and now when we run it did you
create a variable to add yes Alvar
how do we not need do not need our
JavaScript apparently we don't need this
on there I'm sick don't forget your
variable alright go ahead and append a
div with your class item equal to item
to the list so then make sure to click
your button to add the item the exercise
so append to do
go ahead and dot append a div with your
class is equal to item you'll need to
alternate question marks here since HTML
string you're using pens these for your
quote so does your class name
alright so in our dot list div so when
we add that we want to say for this for
the dot list dot append
go ahead and append a div with your
class item
dot item
I think that's right so whenever let's
let's test it out make sure we can see
it so we want to add cheese I don't know
why Oh something happen but uh
apparently says it's right but it's not
displaying properly or maybe we haven't
had it displayed yet complete your
programming by adding the dot on event
handler as described above it should it
should go inside your document ready but
after and outside your pound button
click so let's look at the dot on so
we're saying document dot on event
selector function do something in this
case if I'm will be click selector will
be item and remove collar move on this
so
document dot on so those do so they just
wanted us to change that be familiar
with it and here we are you did it
gratulations we're giving this right
here uncle sit syntax error unexpected
number I'm not sure what that means but
hey we finished this section modifying
HTML elements not too bad jquery stuff a
lot i have a feeling there's a lot of
stuff you can do with jquery and up next
we'll be doing a review of jquery events
and going from there but so far so good
i really like this and it's a great
skill to kind of get familiar with a lot
of job apps i I've been applying for
they want you to know jquery and i'm
just not familiar with it at all so at
least i can be like look I've taken an
online course on it a brief one at that
but hey but as always questions comments
concerns anything like that just go
ahead and shoot me a comment or message
and I'll get back to you when I can
