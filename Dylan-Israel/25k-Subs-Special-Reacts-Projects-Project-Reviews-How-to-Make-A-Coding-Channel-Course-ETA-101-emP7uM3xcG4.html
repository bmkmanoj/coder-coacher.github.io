going it I'll be good to go here I
should be going any moment now
you know what I hope I didn't start this
as a private event yeah what's up buddy
what is it yeah what's up yeah all right
how is everybody see all right cool work
we're live from the studio just the
office nothing I felt like I wanted to
do a big introduction there we're live
from New York this is Thursday night
code all right so now that we're done
with the cringy introductions I
appreciate everyone tuning in for those
who are new to the channel what I like
to do is every thousand subscribers I
like to to have a live stream where I
essentially say welcome thank you for
deciding to to join the channel to
subscribe and like to answer your
questions and and help out in any way
that I can in my when I was studying
code I always wished I had somebody I
could kind of pop questions off back and
forth and just kind of ping say hey how
is how am i how is this what what are
your thoughts about this and what your
thoughts about that and sometimes I'll
tell you
this is a good choice sometimes I'll say
that is bad choice and sometimes I will
tell you I don't know and that's okay so
it's okay guys in software it's okay not
to know there's so much to know that
you're better off just saying I don't
know and going from there so thank you
guys the to the first 24,000 of you who
is who is uh who have been here and
thank you to the new thousand of you who
are who are the the newbies so welcome
now Amelio welcome mark we are at 25,000
subscribers this is exciting right so
I'll have a video coming out in the near
future called a bit basically talking
about goals and and three of my goals
and might what am i one of those three
goals is to get to a hundred thousand
subscribers by 2020 we're fourth of the
way there we just need to pick up our
pace a little bit to get there but I'm
very happy with the channel and I'm
putting a lot of time into it and I've
got a couple things going on in the
pipeline that I'm excited to announce
one thing if you noticed that I mean I
will my goal is to launch the how to
create a coding course it's gonna be a
YouTube course as well like how to do a
YouTube and what I've learned along the
way but specifically coding related
course my goal is to launch that the
first of October which is about five
weeks away I wrote up the the rough
draft of myself sorry the syllabus if
you will of what I what I'm planning to
do for that and that's gonna change
slowly but surely I'm going to start
working on that this weekend as well as
the the now degree program and so
personal things going on in my in my
work life and business life and all that
stuff so hopefully I got some good news
to announce and yeah I mean I'm excited
about that I've wanted to make a course
for
and I've I've been a bit intimidated to
you it's a it's a bit intimidating I
feel like at least for my experience on
YouTube I what one thing I've always
sort of cherished in terms of a
personality trait is honesty right and
there's a lot of people out there who
are gonna sell you some that they
really have no business making or no
business selling and I try to only sell
I try only promote things that I use so
like you'll notice recently I've been
talking about the Humble Bundle so stuff
like that's all stuff I use I love it
I recommend it I started putting
affiliate links into my descriptions of
my videos all stuff I use everything
single thing on there our products I use
or have used and standby and when I was
making I saw I originally started making
a very detailed like I wanted to make
like a cult web developers bootcamp
course that was my goal right it was
really just the all all including
massive course and and I got really
overwhelmed because at the end of the
day I didn't think I could live up to
the standards that I wanted to live up
to so I I had to step back I say okay
what is something that I think I can
deliver and that will be good quality
and that I think people will want and I
I if you're not a member of the Facebook
group this is how I discovered not
discovered but decided on which one I
was going to do but I basically created
a pool about two items that I want to
make I'm gonna make both just in life
you can only separate your your mental
energy and your time so much right so
between work YouTube setting up a
podcast I don't have time for two more
projects but just though right so
between all that I could squeeze in one
more I felt like I had this time of
squeezing it in right around when I'm
wrapping up this reduction track made of
course and that was I posted a poll on
the Facebook group Kotak and caffeine
check it out if you if you guys aren't
already members and on there I said do
you want me to write a book
because I love writing is a passion of
mine do you want me to write a book
saying hey here are 50 developer stories
to motivate you write to inspire you
essentially 55 page inspirational
stories from developers I'd get to
interview all these interesting people
and write their story that was Michael
that was one thing that I want to do and
I will do or do you want me to go ahead
and create a course about gradient
coding channel and what it can do for
your career in and how to utilize things
and what to avoid and to my surprise it
was like 95% coding channel and 5% book
but I plan on doing both but definitely
the coding channels gotta go first
thought you were working today I was so
I actually got in I woke up at 5:00 this
morning normally I work at wake up at
6:00 and I don't know about you but I
just can't go back to sleep after I wake
up for the most part if it's like an
hour or two hours before I'm supposed to
be up so I just got up and went to work
at 6 a.m. and I got off around 2:30 so
that's basically why I'm a little early
today is uh is I um I just started work
early so I left early that's the gist of
it at the other day oh yeah so that
that's exciting for that um so let's see
am i looking to polymer or firebase yet
I haven't had a chance right now my in
terms of what I'm studying is react
focus react Redux so I did the react
course I'm doing the rack now degree and
I basically finished the first one of
three sections which is the react
section and Nexus redux and when I
finished that section the way that I
like to learn when I do like a let's
just say a video tutorial that I watch
you know watch Derek's bonus for
instance when I when I first heard with
angularjs I watched his I watched his um
his videos there's four part videos and
then I went and I built my
website coding tutorials 360 calm I
built that to kind of cement it in and I
did the same thing with this react
course so not only did I follow this
react portion of the Iraq nano degree
but I also I also went in and I I went
to the free code camp beta and I checked
out what projects I have not the beta
excuse me I went to the free code camp
react section and I checked out their
what projects they have and I built
three of them so that's what I spent
this last weekend doing was I built a
markdown previewer I've got the markdown
previewer project I built the recipe box
one and I built the camper leaderboard
so now I have four projects in react
that are I think I have to push two of
them to my github still but that was to
help cement react for me that that's one
thing is okay cool I've learned react
through the course now let's see that
one project it's beautiful project great
now let's see what if it I retained and
if there's things that aren't
necessarily connecting I'm gonna hammer
those in through these three projects
that's why I did this weekend about
three projects and I got already
recorded all of them one came out I have
another one coming out this Saturday I
think I have the the markdown preview of
this Saturday and then the following
Saturday I will have the recipe box
which is an hour twenty minute video
that recipe box was a lot a lot more
time intensive in terms of recording
then then anticipated so I'm excited to
release that and that's one of the
things that I wanted to I wanted to do
and I was talking with Brad at
traversing media a little while back and
I he had commented hey I wish I could
see more projects and this is something
I'd like to see and you know I know I
think the soaps are like see too and
it's always intimidating throwing
projects out there because I like to
build things and stuff that I'm new with
and I don't said I'm intimidated but I I
don't say them to me but there's
something where I even say it once or
twice like hey I know I'm building this
it all works but there may be some stuff
that I'm doing slightly wrong or
slightly different
it's because I've only been working with
reacts for two weeks at that point right
but I I built the project and we filled
the user stores and things like that so
but I never throw out a tutorial and say
like I'm the end-all be-all so I don't
feel too bad about it if it's some
things are a little wonky traversing
media is one of the best channels on
YouTube and it definitely in the coding
space can you talk about the second half
a reduction Jamal Taylor I definitely
will so my plan is for the the Udacity
now degree program I did what I was
expecting video which is kind of like
the prequel if you will then we got
chapter one which is the react section I
showcased that project when I get done
with the reduc so I'm going to talk a
little review that and then react native
our review that and at the end of it all
I'll do a overall review of essentially
a noun degree program what I learned
what I liked why I didn't like one of
the cool things about that is I've
actually reached out to Tyler McGinnis
who is one of the one of the authors of
the course from I believe he's from
react training calm so I'm actually
going to be interviewing him sometime
after the first or second week of
September he I reached out to him and he
said yeah I would love to be interviewed
and yes I would love to be interview say
yeah interview with you it's not like it
was died at the bit like oh please don't
 about me but he said yes and he's
gonna be a little bit he's gonna be out
of town for a bit and then September
10th which isn't that far away it's
about two three weeks after that I'm
going to be interviewing them so look
forward to that one thing that I'll be
doing today sometime is interviewing I
want to get more interviews under the
belt it's been pretty hectic in the
background of my life lately and
interviews are a very time-consuming
thing and you have to meet people and
reach out to people and you gotta you
got a set of meetings and stuff like
that but it's something that I want to
put back out there cuz I think there's a
lot of value in it especially as prep
for setting up the podcast as well so
I've reached out to to Brian it let's
build that out one supposed to be
interviewing him today we're supposed to
just have a casual conversation you guys
can see that coming
in the in the future can you talk about
what happened to your the interview will
be live right not this time
not this time no I'm gonna I'm gonna put
it out for a video can you talk about
your ninja 650 motorcycle and how it got
stolen so III like I can't even remember
I told you I told you that that happened
um I'll tell you about it I'll tell you
about it um let me see let me see real
quick if I can show I think I have that
I'm gonna pull up in the archives a
picture of it
why is Amy not participating Martha you
schooler well arts of ones and zeroes I
think you mean April I think you're
referring to my girlfriend that's what I
think you mean you see if I can log in
give me a second here nice let's see if
I can log into myspace still and get the
picture of the old motorcycle and I'll
tell you this story why do you love
programming I like the challenge man um
I mean it's it's something that if
you've ever worked any sort of job
before you will know that there is
something to be said about the sort of
day-in day-out same old same old and
every day I get to build something new I
get to
all right so no picture the bike um the
old MySpace page that's how long ago it
was when I have a bike man there's a
picture of it on MySpace but um why -
look programming at the end of the day
man I really just like building stuff
things are constantly changing I like
the problem-solving I feel like it keeps
me sharp I don't I mean I I would say
that when I really fell in love with it
was when I started building stuff and so
that that to me is like the defining
thing is being able to build something
step back and then look at it it's kind
of the same about YouTube is Here I am
working on on YouTube and what I'm
basically doing is building something
everyday I'm hammering it down nails and
hammers and screws something in a
digital world right I'm building
something that I could be proud of and I
can look back and say look at my hard
work paid off and look what I can do
with it
and that's I mean that's really it at
the end of the day is I'm building
something I'm proud of and that I enjoy
doing it's easy to see it easy to to see
why I do not use code pens for the
recipe box know I did everything on my
local machine I didn't want to bother
with with all that so I just I just sit
on my local okay so somebody asked me
about how my motorcycle got stolen so
this is kind of an interest it wasn't
funny at the time it wasn't funny at the
time but now we can laugh now we are
adults so I'm gonna get my age wrong but
I must say this is around the time I'm
20 at this time in my life I am a
college student
going to Community College I'm kind of
figuring out what I want to do now I
take it back I am actually I believe at
this time I am a I am studying to be a
firefighter so I'm going through an EMT
program for those who don't know I've
jumped all around right until I stuck
with CS after I kind of fell in love
with it and
decided that it was a great thing to
learn and great opportunity whatnot but
before that I'm just kind of bouncing
around I didn't really know what to
commit to and that's where I was at
right so I really at that time I was
going through an EMT certification
program I had this I had this wonderful
little janky-ass ninja 650 bike and it
was like in 1990 it was like 20 years
old at that time right I think at this
time nowadays it's probably thirty right
it was like born a year before me or
year after me that's all I remember
so I paid like $700 for it but it was it
ran great the guy who had it the guy who
had it was a mechanic he kept great care
of it so I uh I always knew that my dad
really didn't like motorcycles right he
he thought am I at this time mind you
I'm living with I believe my buddy Eric
him and I have an apartment together I'm
working at a pizza place and I am I'm I
am going to school and at that time my
father the reason I was able to do this
was my father was giving me $500 for
rank which covered my ring and then
basically I worked to pay for all my
food the utilities life all that sort of
stuff so he was helping me out with that
when it came to school now my my mother
my mother has like five brothers I've
like five uncles and so they all have
motorcycles so she's cooler with it
right so it's like it's like Christmas
or around there and I decided to ride my
bike instead of my car I mind you my car
in my my but don't think I'm bombing out
my car's worth like $2,000 and my
motorcycles worth like $600 I said I I'm
riding my bike down to my mom's house to
go visit her for Christmas or something
like that
and and I'm talking with her and so it
ends up she goes she goes I'm thinking
my mom doesn't care she's like oh cool
nice you know be safe where Jackie you
know I have my helmet I got my jacket on
I got my gloves up I'm I'm you know I'm
suited and booted for the road so I'm
thinking like everything is cool and my
mom's like hey why don't I go buy you
some tires for your car I know you need
new tires
be my Christmas present to you I haven't
had a chance to get you anything I say
cool so I Drive back she drives back a
little time now mind you we we parked my
bike we go drop my car off at like the
mechanic get new tires and we're going
out to dinner we're chatting it up and
just shooting the about life and
whatnot this whole time she had been
setting me up so my dad could go steal
my bike cuz she didn't
like that I was driving a motorcycle so
what ends up happening is the whole time
my mom and I are chillin hanging out
having a good like Christmas Christmas
Eve er it was like the day after two
days after and we're having dinner at
like or lunch at like an Olive Garden my
dad who's at work and my DS working at
like Fox Studios he's on a set filming
this is how crazy he is about motorcycle
is he's on a set they're filming they're
doing the thing and he's like he gets a
call from my mom so if you guys don't
know anything about divorced parents at
least in my case they never talk unless
like one of us is hooked on drugs or
like we're just up in life right
so so that that is that is the extent of
how much my my mother and my father
talking money none of us are art on
drugs or ever happened but we have
 up in life a couple times as his
life so she's she's chatting up and she
like hey let's go get dessert right and
we're just drawing it out I'm like cool
whatever hang out with my mom and my dad
goes and he rents a u-haul cuz he has
like a little Mustang how's he gonna
still motorcycle Mustang and so so he he
goes and he rents a u-haul lease this
work rent a u-haul drives to my
apartment and and he sees my motorcycle
my mom described it to him and goes and
runs up the ramp of the u-haul I guess
and then steals my motorcycle so that is
how at the time I was super pissed and
by the way by the way he then text me
when I get back I'm like looking for my
motorcycles because I'm gonna go to the
store or something and I didn't check my
phone cuz I put on silent cuz I'm with
my mom he then he think text me a

it literally said a I'm not
even
exaggerating about that she said a
 I got your bike and I
 flipped man um so that is the
story that is the story of how my
motorcycle got stolen
now it wasn't funny at the time and I'm
still a little upset about it ten years
later but that is that is the story that
you wanted to know somewhat um alright
so Tracy media thank you Congrats on the
25k I appreciate that man we're grinding
we're uh we're one fourth to that to
that silver play button have you got
yours yet by the light trip Brad you got
yours yet um so let's see here I mostly
program in angular at work I'm
programming react on the side note
expressed MongoDB Mongoose all that sort
of stuff
one thing I could advise you guys as a
junior developer someone who's just
getting started
is that if you are if you are uh if you
are starting in your first year to as a
developer once you have a good handle on
what it is that you're working with
there do study other things study other
things and start other side projects and
things like that oh oh oh
Brad I think you have to apply for it so
so um for those of you don't know at a
hundred thousand YouTube officially
recognizes you as a youtuber and they'll
send you a silver play button plaque for
me it's a goal it's a it's one of my
goals by 2020 I want to have a silver
play button that's what I that's what I
want to to to accomplish I think we're
going to 2020 is a long time away it's
about what two years and and four months
three months but yeah so I think so Brad
I think you have to go and like there's
like a if you check in like your
settings so it's probably notification
somewhere saying that once you pass a
hundred thousand you can they'll send it
to you just have to request it or
something nothing says Merry Christmas
like a stolen bike uh oh yeah I was a
girl
man at that time now mind you mind you
you can make the argument you make the
argument that I wasn't because I was
getting $500 a month for rent
now you can make that argument but um
because I I do think that I do think
that if you are accepting money from
your parents you're not necessarily an
adult yet and and that's not to say that
there's anything wrong with it but there
is something childlike about it where
you are you are you are um you're not
you're not necessarily completely
independent and thus you are still
you're maintaining some of the older
stuff again nothing wrong with it but it
does have that sort of thing so I could
understand that argument where even
though you're not living under his house
if he's paying for your house you're
living under his house and that was kind
of the deal uh you know it's funny it's
every time I see him and when he kids he
loves telling that story at every family
gathering about how he stole my
motorcycle you imagine this this man
stole my motorcycle and then tells me
 I got your bike so anyhow
to summarize that my father ended up
paying me the money that I paid for the
bike and that's one of the reasons that
it's easier to laugh at it at the time
at now at the time I superfish he
eventually eventually wrote me a check
for for it and we caught we called it a
wash and I just drove cars um so um
let's see I got this pushing on awesome
Karma thank you man I'm trying I uh I
just try I'm trying man we got some good
things coming up I have last I mentioned
I'm interviewing two very notable people
which is exciting the podcast this
weekend dick and I are we're setting up
a call so that we can test out the
software editing you want to make sure
that there's no sort of technical
glitches when we when we launched this
the course always sort of stuff
but uh yeah mint so my girlfriend every
time she sees my dad because we all see
them very often when he was down here
visiting she's like tell me about that
time you stole a Billings bike just
cause she thinks it's funny
do I want a bike again you know what man
um as much as as much as I I do want a
motorcycle I wouldn't get one it was
just too unsafe if I was gonna skate and
I wouldn't get it because it's too much
money but there's like the three-wheeled
Raptors have you seen lease or
two-seaters and they're like a two in
the front one wheel in the back if I was
gonna get something kind of feel like a
badass that's probably what I would get
I'm a badass who's too worried about
dying so I'm not ready to be on a
motorcycle nickel coating projects you
done recently well I'm doing the Udacity
had a degree program which is really fun
I did so as I mentioned earlier I did
the three this week and I did three
small react projects from the free code
camp react project curriculum and what
I'm looking forward to making is I
bought a URL I think I bought it I have
to log into my GoDaddy I don't remember
if I bought it or not but I'm pretty
sure I did but I bought a URL to develop
two tools for YouTube and that's gonna
be my my my own independent project
that's going to be going up um pretty
soon so I'm gonna be building them some
tools for using the YouTube API
there's gonna be a website they're
laying out there are some ads on it to
try and make a little bit of money but
um I'm also going to build saw I've
gotten so Chris I've gotten really into
investing right now so that's like my
new passion I know my new passion is
something that's so I do a lot of
self-education with code on YouTube and
now I'm doing so a lot of self-education
with the investment on YouTube so I'm
learning a lot about crypto currencies
I'm learning a lot about stocks more so
into peer-to-peer so one thing I want to
do is I want to build my own
customizable dashboard and everything
that I'm interested in keep track of and
I'll probably build that to a site and I
don't want this only to be for for like
investments it's actually probably going
to be a dashboard for your life that's
how I see it
and
which uh it keeps track of maybe your
facebook notifications it keeps track
your Instagram notifications where
you're able to customize daily build
dashboard one of the ways that this came
about is I already built one at work not
necessarily necessarily that detailed
but I've been working on a dashboard
system for our application at work and
I'm just thinking thinking about all the
great things that I could do with it and
how I would benefit from it that's
something that I've been thinking about
as well my newest thing is the podcast
though we haven't launched that yet
building the coding course these are all
things that uh that I'm working on so
never anyone say never heard anybody
saying saving money is his fashion well
um I don't want say saving money it's my
passion what I what I consider money is
saving money or having money available
is for me it's just a peace of mind i I
just like knowing that if something
happens in life I have a nest egg and I
want to get that nest egg to about a
hundred hundred thousand dollars that's
basically my goal and then I'll relax
it's the dashboard going to be open
source yes everything that's on there
I'll probably have I'll have a website
so you guys can log in and you know I'll
probably offer premium features if I
ever get so that's one thing I want to
build that's after the YouTuber tools
just after I get the podcast initializes
after I finished the coding course all
these things are you the thing I think
when you're a passionate person when you
are excited and you always like side
projects like my biggest side project
will be my youtube channel because it
will give me a platform for my other
side projects so the thing is is when I
have my youtube channel I can only have
one to two you wanted to 1 to 2 1 to 2
side projects I had time
up of that because I also work right put
in 40 40 45 hours a week at my job
so uh when you first started practicing
algorithm challenges how long did it
take you to solve them it takes me about
two days to solve simple algorithms is
it normal it's normal when you get
started don't don't worry about that
things get easier and then it's it's
kind of like I kind of compare just
coding the math in which at a point in
time subtraction and addition was hard
and then it became easy and then you
moved on to the next heart subject which
was division of multiplication and then
that became easy and then you moved on
to the next thing which might have might
be fractions or or or geometry or trig
or calculus and then all these things
slowly become easier and easier and
easier and then you look back and you
say wow man that was really that was
really kind of kind of crazy what you
what you did there so uh computer
science for software engineering it
doesn't matter man it's gonna be if you
get either one of those you'll be fine
and it's always you're a passionate
individual constantly learning side
projects all this sort of stuff that's
what's going to matter more than as long
as you have one of the two you're gonna
be great um the idea I don't worry about
that too much
possible merchandise I don't know man I
so I have some stuff but I usually give
it away to subscribers let me show you
so like I have some stickers that I send
to people who uh whose who sign up on
the on the for my patreon and I send
them so much if they want them now I I
don't think I don't think for possible
merchandise I just don't think I'm I
have a large enough base for that like I
don't know um this may be a personal
question but what's the ballpark really
income you making your job uh that's
kind of interesting cuz I'm about to get
a raise on my one-year mark I'll tell
you I'll give you this I'll tell you how
much I make with YouTube and how much I
make with my my yearly salary I will be
around
$90,000 that's how much I'll be around
with that I don't necessarily mind
saying how much I make it's just it's
just that I've been told by other
developers that I shouldn't say and
these are developers I respect I talk
very openly about money most of the time
but when when people I respect tell me
that hey I don't think you should answer
these questions I think I don't think
it's an appropriate thing I if it wasn't
someone I respect I would probably not
answer that so I give you that you can
try figure out how much you think I make
from YouTube how much I make for my job
uh so uh do I use webpack only when I
use to create racked up right now
let's see here I'm money investing in
stocks yes so I um
I invest in stocks I invest in a couple
a couple different a couple different so
I invest through Robin Hood which
essentially are me choosing my own
stocks I also have a weekly a weekly
amount that goes into the acorns
investment app which you essentially
choose a portfolio and then the
betterment investment at which we choose
portfolio and also have a weekly amount
that goes in to prosper which is a
peer-to-peer lending application if
you're not familiar with peer-to-peer
lending I will give you a brief summary
of it but essentially you lend money and
$25 increments so someone's borrowing
$5,000 and they're gonna pay a fifteen
percent interest rate i buy i buy twenty
five dollars at a time shares a bit
difficult one per loan for me to spread
out my risk and i I make interest based
off that over a three or five-year
period all my loans are three three
three years and so every every month I
get a portion of my principal payment as
well as interest back which at this time
I'm reinvesting and then I'm also
started diving into the world of crypto
currencies so as of right now for the
last three months I've been lucky enough
to to save about fifty percent of my
income part of that is I have no debt
I've kept all my expenses very low yeah
I've worked hard to be able to get here
and I'm happy I'm able to do these
things so when you guys hear me saying
like hey you know and by the way I don't
have a lot of money saved up I'm saving
I'm getting to a point where I feel
comfortable where the first time in my
life I have a three-month supply of
money if something happens which is
which is not something I've ever had
before
should I
Jeff for free coke a full-stack projects
I'll see why not why use two buddy
instead social blade - buddy comes with
a lot more tools I also got it for free
cuz people want to buddy or dope so am I
better fronted or back in uh I do more
front-end but I don't see a difference
especially when you do the thing is is I
just look at it as one right it's like
what end of the spectrum are you
starting at the front it connects to the
back right and so if you look at it if
you look at the whole application
because as you should when you're
architecting a project is it all it
don't necessarily what you become better
at doing it's more so can you understand
both sides and who cares what you do
more of as long as you're good at all of
it but I would say I probably I don't
know equal
I guess Jeff do you use WordPress at
work no what do you do when your boss
tells you to add a future for the next
day Society you take it off and blames
that you added the future you say sorry
sir and you smile and then if it happens
to couple more a couple more times you
say stop telling me do look man
here's the thing no one's boss is
perfect this is the truth um there's
going to be things that you disagree
with and you have a respectful
conversation about and there's going to
be things that you you agree with the
thing the thing to the thing is is that
when something like that happens you
need to have a respectful two-sided
conversation or or maybe not even the
first time instead sound like that big
of a deal but the second time you say it
you know I was told to do this and then
how am I supposed to not know not to or
you just it's all about it's all about
trying to understand where the other
person's coming from and having having a
respectful conversation that's really it
is that the other day most people are
nice people they have rough days here or
there and on those rough days you just
smile say hey you know sorry about that
and then maybe happens again you say
look man
all right most of the time is not you
man most of the time it's just that
whatever is going on in their life and
like so when that happens you just have
said you just explained your situation
say oh I thought I was supposed to build
this what would you like me to do with
this do you like me to take it out of
the take it out of the master branch and
save it in case we change our mind again
or whatever so it happens in different
aspects where especially on when you're
on the lower end of the totem pole
because it's their job to mold you and
to help influence you and to connect
with you and so that's just part of the
process of Bunz
what back age and languages do I work
with I work with PHP cakephp my sequel
for the database in my side projects I
do note Express MongoDB and Mongoose
knowing what you know right now what
would you have done differently after
high school graduation I would started
to say I would have started investing
money I would have started eating
healthier exercising I would have
started I would never have gone to
college
and I probably would consider going to a
boot camp but I definitely would start
self-taught that's exactly what I would
do um so I'm a big believer in the
self-taught route but then again guys
not everyone can do it I have literally
almost I just only say almost because I
go out of town very seldomly but if you
were to line up the last three years of
my life line by line say this is my
github right MiG I don't ever push to
github I work on YouTube say so my
github there might be a total of 15 days
in those three years in which a line of
code wasn't written and what in which a
meet-up wasn't gone to aura a hackathon
was an attended aura of YouTube video
wasn't made so not everyone can the
secret to success that I've learned is
working hard for extended periods of
time it's easy to work hard for a
weekend it's hard to work hard hard for
a long period of time and not everyone
can do that and if it's a different type
of hard when it's unstructured and self
taught is is unstructured when you go to
a call
program there's a lot of benefits that
go along with it right um for instance a
lot of companies will consider you above
other applicants that's okay but there's
also companies that will consider you if
yourself talk so you have that aspect
there's also the aspect that you're
going to have a very structured learning
path that that some people thrive in and
and in my case I don't it's not that I
can't learn stuff that's assigned to me
I just don't it's just not my thing man
and so one of the things I struggled
with and I I don't know what I'm gonna
do I
I in a previous I think in like the 23k
I talked about going back so I'm still
deciding to be honest with you I my mind
tells me it's best for me my heart tells
me I don't want to do it and I don't
know what to do man so I it's I don't
know um so I'm still deciding
uh at what point of life were you zero
and CS and how long did it take you to
become a programmer well I believe the
first programming class I had was about
five years ago
let me a couple water guys real quick so
the first programming class I had was
five years ago in college and you know
code as much as you think in a CS
program I really don't consider myself
really have learned to code or like from
the zero point if you will until about
two and a half three years ago when I
when I about three or four months before
I started my coding channel was when I
decided I was going to start this path
of I'm gonna study every day and I
started doing coke Academy and stuff
that's really when I think I started
learning to code what is after reactor
active so that is the end of the
nanodegree program they have an
extracurricular section in which they go
over get es6 asynchronous calls and then
they also have a in the final section
something for portfolio help and resume
help so that will be what's after
although I'm probably jumping straight
into a side project and I'll slowly tick
away at that how many hours a day did
you learn and create well it depends at
what point in time when I dropped out of
school I told myself okay now we are nap
game time if you will so game time when
I dropped out of school at my previous
job I started working a you know 40 45
hour week standard job and then I I came
home everyday and I studied for four
hours so I got home around 5:00 from
about 5:00 to 9:00 or 6:00 to 10:00 I
put in about 4 hours Monday through
Friday
Friday was a little bit more because it
was the weekend so usually 6 to 8 so I'd
stay up till about 10 11 and I would
code code code and then Saturday and
sudden I'd put in 8 to 14
our days and I did that for about seven
months and I felt confident enough that
I asked my boss at the time said hey I'm
not really happy with my position I
mentioned that I want I took this role
to move myself into a developer or QA
role
unfortunately that that didn't work out
on their timetable and then I took my
current role um so next time me Quincy
uh a I know we all have to thank Quincy
man um are things that Florida walking
distance or do you need a car to get
around I I live I guess my brother calls
with the suburbs I guess I don't know
what suburbs are I just you need a car
but if you lived in downtown which you
could on developer salary so I could
probably live downtown for twice what
I'm paying maybe 50% more but I live
instead four miles away and it's eight
minute drive so if you lived in downtown
you could walk around a bright hmm what
was the demographics of that class in
college well I went to Cal State Los
Angeles I'm IRA member from a newspaper
article I think I was the only one that
reads the college newspapers that it the
pop that at least in terms of ethnic
breakdown it was fifty percent Hispanic
25 percent a Caucasian or 20 percent
Caucasian it was like five percent black
and then like 15 percent Asian was the
the demographic there in terms of age
just from the everyone was between you
know 18 to 24 for the most part so I was
I was 24 I think when I started um what
would you choose $43,000 job working
remote plus stock options or 55,000 no
stock options and after me in the office
well I'd have to know about the company
I don't value remote whom I actually
think that especially as getting started
as a junior developer as a as a
developer just
there's a lot of value of you being able
to go in person and be around that it's
going to not only help you get your
salary up quicker you're going to learn
a lot more I mean think about your
surrounding yourself with other
developers some of our senior developers
who are probably going to charge $200
for an hour their time outside of work
so um that's that's for me what I would
advise but you have to really know about
what I mean what if stock you want stock
options in my youtube channel
I'll pay you like it if you do it
like how much it how much like what are
the stock options you know in yeah what
are you know what if what percent are
you getting and what's the company so
that that's a that's a big a big
question after cooking what's the becks
best move uh well I hope you built
you're building things that's like big
move in terms of where to go next
if you're learning what they'll now I
can't recommend free code camp hire as
an interactive learning gun should
junior developers been given deadlines
so soon after starting a job with little
as a no supervision that's a hard thing
to take out of context cuz
it depends um I get deadlines that get
moved up all the time um you just for me
hey we need this by this date
alright yeah let's get it done baby you
know I'll drop what I'm doing and go
there so it's uh so it just depends you
know I it's all so the thing is this
guys there's a lot of gray not
everything's black and white so like
everything we're talking about you know
go Snowden in your case is we need
context right not everything there very
little things in life are black and
white so you need context us to what
does that actually mean um you know is
it is there little of no supervision
because you're not asking for help
because you're not saying hey I'm not
really quite sure how to get started on
this could you maybe give me some
guidance because it's just as important
speak up I've had this call for a week
you know I don't know what's causing it
um at what age did you get your official
programming job
28 I'm 29 about to turn 30 at 27 I
worked as a technology trainer at a
software company and then at 26 I
started I started a internship and
started freelancing that is the extent
of my entire of any relevant experience
from the internship on I use Coke add me
Pro would you still recommend free coke
game after that yeah I would recommend
that you don't pay money for Coke ad
Amin fro as well how does it feel to be
turning 30 I'll tell you man some of the
 that I'm going to tell you on that
I am interested in you're gonna say this
guy's gonna oldest you know what I
spend my time doing honestly I spend my
time saving money I spend my time
working when I get off work right doing
all this stuff and I spend my time
improving my credit like like if I'm not
ready to turn uh if I'm not ready to
turn 30 I don't know what I'm doing I've
spent the last year systematically
improving my credit score from the bad
mistakes I seem like I'm 23 are you
saying I'm immature I'm not I'm just
telling you I'm just giving you me man
um have I done the voting out of the
first I started it and then it just
became a lot of work and I started
learning other things that's basically
do you think someone's over 800,000 subs
on YouTube can move their own platform
card to users five dollars a month to be
successful they also have outside
resources us I don't know what Stokes
are in a state well I would say that
you'd probably be doing yourself a
disservice moving to another platform I
think using your platform where your
audience is and then make you money
through that audience is probably the
better plan hmm Thank You Anthony
um by the way by the way so I messed up
my credit when I was 20 so good for you
anthem that you're not so I my credit a
year ago was five eighty five eighty if
you don't know what that is
it basically means that you cannot be
trusted with a credit card that's
basically telling me so um I haven't had
a credit card up until about a year ago
um just up until about a year ago I
haven't had a credit card all I've had
but a year before that I got my car loan
payment stupid interest rate on it um
but it's building my credit up and with
the crate so now a year later of me
actively I guess two years you count my
loan that I've been paying stupid
interest on a year later I am now up to
seven ten and climbing so I've been
putting in as much work as I can
learning about how to improve my credit
a lot of that's come in last six months
so this is uh this is it's I'm happy
about it what I'm trying to say it's
hard improving your credit I'm training
my brother talks uh my brother talks all
this cuz his credit scores 825 825
I didn't even know it went up a hundred
all right so this was my son right
my brother has has never he up until
he's traveling right now whatnot he's
got a he has a credit limit on
his credit cards for $10,000 I think he
made 15 last year how does that happen
how does that happen
that's good credit problems man I got
bad credit problems and actually I've
been mid to your credit now mid to your
credit so I've been working at it
building it up I actually have to go
this is what's crazy about credit now it
goes up to 850
it goes up 850 so this is a crazy thing
about credit is I actually have to find
things to buy and put on credit to
continue building my credit it'll make a
sense right now he's just traveling he's
just traveling he's had the same credit
card to credit cards forever and always
made it pay it online yeah man my
brother before that he worked at um he
graduated about a year and a half ago
and he he worked at AmeriCorps doing
like a internship sort of thing where
they basically so if you're not familiar
Tamara Corp it's basically a bootleg
Peace Corp Peace Corps that's so that's
really the way of thinking about it so
we did that and you basically volunteer
volunteer through the community and they
they pay you below minimum wage but they
they if you have student loans so
they'll pay off some of that and
eventually you make like a dollar less
than minimum wage if you do it right so
he did that this last year and you know
you're not you know you're getting paid
poorly we're not when they when they
hand you when they hand you your you're
like job app and they're like oh hey
here's this for food stamps right so
like they literally do that and how like
how you can get from government programs
because you are getting paid a stipend
which legally can be below minimum wage
because legally you're a volunteer but
I'm I'm happy you did it and right now
so the whole time he was in school he
saved up like 20 grand delivering pizzas
right and uh for nine months he went and
traveled East Asia with his girlfriend
and then they broke up and now he's down
in South America traveling solo so he's
a he's
addition that up in the next five months
or so maybe three months and then he's
going back to Portland to to allegedly
start working I don't believe it I think
it's just gonna be couchsurfing for a
while that's what I think uh yeah they
don't pay your student loans they pay
five thousand of your student loans
which in today's day and age is about
fifteen percent of your total student
loans what am I going to marry in April
tell you to ask that cuz God knows she
asked me that all the time man
I'm going to marry when three things are
accomplished three youtubes had a
hundred thousand subscribers salaries
had a hundred thousand net worth is that
a hundred thousand when those three
things are accomplished I'll put a ring
on that's it so I I've stood by this
statement JJ Smith no I hear you about
the 5k what I'm saying though is what
I'm saying about the 5k is that based
off the money that you are getting paid
even with that 5k
over the year you will get you'll get um
you'll get a you'll still make less than
minimum wage that's what that's all I'm
saying I'm gonna say there's not valuing
of course you're saving five thousand
dollars the hundred case uh yeah I mean
I just want to take for me everything's
going well right like everything's going
well the YouTube channels growing the
salaries are growing the money being
saved is growing and like I'm planning
the next stage of our life like that
that's it is I want to have the
foundation before we build the house
that is that is how I look at it and if
I built the house without the foundation
that I need
for us to succeed it's a bad decision so
I mean do you guys really think I'm
going anywhere we're going on almost
seven years I think I'm gonna send
Dipset all of a sudden you're like later
come on man that's like a year three
move yummy
so we're past that so I mean you talking
to someone who just told you that his
his idea of fun is improving his credit
and saving money for the future and you
don't think I'm gonna plan for the
future with you know the love of my life
come on I got I got it flagged out in
this case so yeah later nerd yeah so I
mean that's just me man and part part of
that is just not having those three
things at the other day not and knowing
what they can provide and just getting a
taste of success and working hard for
that success and so on and so forth well
I tell you what man is just a hot tip
pointer for those of you who move across
country for a job your girlfriend joins
you there might be some expectations
that weren't discussed that's all I'm
saying
so my current work has a that's a pretty
poor 401k so I just I just take the
money I invest and I put it into other
things that's all so I don't like my
works 401k also in tech so and I don't
know so I've been doing a ton of
research about 401k I did have my last
work and I ended up losing money because
I had to withdraw it and part of the
reason for that is for this move and to
withdraw that money so I can move and
second is I didn't get any benefit of it
because I'm
was at the company for a year in
software you're usually not a job for
more than 18 months especially when
you're getting your career started
you're trying to find that right fit so
I'm not going to start a 401k unless
it's a good 401k and it's a lot of
there's um I can see myself being there
for many years I'd like to have 401k or
a Roth IRA are you for me as long as I'm
investing money saving money it's all
going towards the future right so it
doesn't necessarily matter what platform
it is oftentimes just not having debt
and saving a little bit of money you're
already ahead all right you just gotta
get in get into the position in which
you're hustling your grind in you're
putting yourself out there you're
getting different revenue streams most
people will only ever have one sadly um
and I would like to do more videos about
investing um I would like two more
videos on that but it I I know what I
know I just I typically just like to
talk about what I'm doing when I give
advice and I don't want to send anyone
down that do you think any pay equity is
BS no I think that there are certain
companies if you're only getting paid in
equity it's usually BS but there are
company companies that will pay you you
know let's say everyone in the company
makes 50 grand regardless of the
position and I interviewed for a couple
of these companies so that's why I'm
giving this as you as this example that
that you'll get a piece of equity based
on that role and it'll be like a tenth
of a percent or a quarter percent just
defense right so and then usually you
have to work every year to get a larger
piece of that equity shooting so all
right am i watching the MacGregor
Mayweather
like this Saturday I am indeed I'm not
sure where though so I don't watch a lot
of TV or events but I will be watching
that I'm a big UFC Fan for those of you
don't know it's one of my only hobbies
outside of code am i planning are you
planning for startup so you like to work
at startups have I applied for a job at
Google I have I haven't knew once that
guys were water
do I do any MMA bro who needs to do MMA
when you go into the gun show alright I
know man I don't have time for it
one time I Wayne Lee rolled around on
some mats first of jiu-jitsu and um when
I was hanging out with mat a little bit
who do you have winning the fight I
guess you have to give it to mayweather
by decision um should I learn off a free
code Kevin how long will it take that
depends on you man
they asked me 500 hours I think it's
pretty fair for the front end cert if
you've never read a line of code but
again it all depends it probably took me
around 200 but I had written code before
right so kind of Pence
huh I'll tell you what though and the
McGregor Mayweather fight is that if
McGregor does knock Mayweather out I
think the sport of boxing just sees our
time you can't have it you just done you
can't do it anymore like you just lost
the MMA that's what it is
like everyone expects MMA to lose right
this is me if you lost a MMA verse
boxing if you don't want to say that
right if McGregor beats Floyd Mayweather
I think you just gotta roll up the
carpet boxing is done it's illegal now
we Trump gotta sign some executive order
said hey some happen over the
weekend we can't let this disrespectful
sport happen anymore this MMA guy you
beat the 49 and oh like six division
champ we have anymore um so
oh my mouse died so for those of you who
were on the livestream the other day
remember when I told you I ordered a
mouse that like glowed in the dark and
 and they sent me they sent me this
razor Mamba mouse instead of my mouse
pad which is like $100 mouse so I'm
keeping it I just already know the mouse
pad but I have to charge it it's not too
shabby though man like this it goes with
a little comes with a little case right
so that it's charging right now damning
swag I love you two men where's my
favorite programming language JavaScript
man I love JavaScript I had a I had a
recruiter today tell me that hey we're
looking for someone with Java and
JavaScript I said well I've only done
job
in a Scholastic environment sure that's
enough I'm like that's too bad because I
really don't want to work in a job of
Java lately
so please don't let's do like a top like
a like a big for company that's the only
way you're getting me into Java again
what's wrong with cook add me Pro I just
think your money spilt spent better
elsewhere
that's all dots on pre-act pre-act i
don't know what pre-act is can you sorry
I upgrade my laptop Mac or PC I happen
to like PC
I think Mac's are overrated I also think
it's easier to upgrade your PC
can you explain a bit of progressive web
application that's a big question man
you're after you have narrowed down a
little bit
Java is usually going to be enterprise
right stick a PS environment
yeah Java Java as a whole is a pain in
the ass um but there's big money in Java
because it's mainly ass I know a lot of
people all the people that I went to
school with works in Java it all Sto I
would work in Java if the if the company
was writing the price was right um I
would have to I'd have to read I'm into
it I haven't touched jamun so long
although Java Script with typescript and
everything is slowly becoming a little
well something-something um
so please make a video progressive web
application I'm I would love to man but
what do you what do you want
specifically on a progressive web
application um I'm gonna need a little
bit more I'll see what I can do man I'll
pull something together
what back-end does my company is a PHP
cakephp in my sequel I can't wait to get
these braces off can you please name
some projects build with JavaScript off
the top of your head three will be great
well luckily if you're just looking for
a substandard project supressed practice
free code camp has a list of 12 on the
front end you could build what I built
into react this weekend a markdown
previewer you can build a recipe box you
could build a um huh leader you can
build an API leader camp I suggest you
check out those projects there's also
the Simon game a a weather application
you can also build a random quote
machine what else do we got uh those are
a few that come to mind luckily there's
somebody who put videos up building all
that so if you get stuck you can at
least find someone who did once
what program should I use for a
five-page website whichever one that you
think program you mean like framework
do I use any app to organize your work
schedule no I just work all the time mi
might that's good enough
my buddy tells me react will be too much
to learn I don't know I thought react is
pretty intuitive reactor angular if
you're looking to pick something up you
can do view if you want it's just on us
in demand in comparison can I just say
for a second how happy I am that we are
at 25,000 subscribers like the thing
about YouTube is it's epic it is much
like coding where it it's a slow
momentum at first where you want to be
so much farther than you are and then
when you get to where you want to be you
want to be so much farther than there
and it is it's it's a good feeling to be
at 25,000 I want that hundred I want
that hundred I want it day 1 of 100 km
requesting my play button
I want it
have I ever got burnt out it's there's
been times in life yes and by the way
I'm still sticking to my I'm gonna give
away two 4k monitors when I need 100k so
two of you guys are gonna win some 4k
monitors get shipped to you um so look
forward to that in a year to maybe 3 now
I've got burnt out I usually don't get
burnt out by coding it's more so
lack of sleep from the coding also I
know I know that uh I can feel coming on
so I'll give you an example this I'm
gonna sit down now um about two weeks
ago I felt like I was starting to hit
that point we're slowly getting burnt
out and the thing about burnout is it's
okay
you just have to notice it you just have
to notice when it's happening to make
adjustments so that's one thing is I've
noticed myself feeling overwhelmed it's
that that's what it is for me I feel
overwhelmed and so I I'm able to
recognize I feel you know what I do is I
I go and I play video games that's it my
girlfriend notices it too and she tells
me I need to play more video games she
wants me to actually work less than I do
I just enjoyed this so much that it's
hard to now so I played the campaign of
and I only played for like twenty or
thirty minutes at a time in a day but
that is enough for me not to get burnt
out and then I kind of calmed down the
things in the life stressing me out
it's pretty pretty good who Mac or
Windows I like Windows um high five baby
um any advice on coding I gave up like
three days ago it just seems I can't do
anything myself unless I place the exact
same link the task requested just sucks
well how long have you been at it
yeah we're growing by about we're
growing by about two thousand subs a
month right now I think it's like 1900
so the the 24k probably is two weeks ago
why don't you work out I'm trying to the
problem is that I so I swim every day
almost in the pool to help out so that
helps me out with but um there's
something so I've talked about this
before but there's something wrong with
my hand it's constantly inflamed and
it's hard for me to lift with it and
I've gone to the doctor and they've
given me pills and they knocked me out
for a week it took me out of my grind
for a week so it's hard for me to lift
that's what I enjoyed about working out
so I got some gloves recently and I'm
gonna go back for some more medication
to get a handle basically it just
extends from overuse that solved the
local storage issue with the rest three
blocks I did I actually already recorded
the video that's coming out in two weeks
as well how about tried Linux no who's
your idol I don't say I want to say
idols I have people that I see are
successful and I have people that I see
are unsuccessful and they're as much an
idol in terms of of recognizing what
they are doing wrong and making note not
to do that so I have two types of people
both of which I look up to to a degree
because I see somebody who's I try not
to judge but I see somebody who's who I
could see that their actions have not
paid off in the same way that I would
now that doesn't mean that they're bad
necessarily some are but it does mean
that what they want is different than
what I want and if I make that choices
I'll probably have that same result and
then I see that people are successful
and I say what did they do to get to
where what I consider success and what
can I learn from them and how can I
surround myself with people like that so
one of the reasons I like interviewing
developers and interviewing these people
of who I consider of no it's because I
can pick their brain and I can learn
what they think is a good decision and a
bad decision and I can try to - I would
say any late but take what they have to
offer and see if I can apply bits and
pieces to my own domain of a brain and
see how I can improve myself
um if I did name some people I don't
wanna name any people because it I think
it feels kind of weird cuz I know some
of these people yeah I mean I like I
don't want to come off as a fanboy like
me or my mentor and I gotta go see them
and hang out with them one of these
times yeah uh I look up to you I don't
know it feels yeah I don't but there are
there are other youtubers there are
other developers out there there are
other people that fall into those
categories that I value their opinion
and and I try to take away what what I
can't uh hey know what technologies do
you think are most expressive of self
talk junior developers that depends man
you really just gotta look at the market
and see what's out there I mean what
they teach in school and boot camp I
would say if you just want some if you
want to emulate a curriculum look at a
successful boot camp and see what they
are teaching that's what I would say if
you want if that to answer that question
because they usually won the straits of
boot camps they can change their
curriculum very rapidly to the market
and that that's a good sign
I suck at solving algorithms I can't
solve them without watching your
tutorial should I even continue
programming if I can't solve the basic
algorithms for you come camp yes every
day
every day you should continue it's gonna
be hard man I sucked at it too for a
long time I still suck at it I just
sucked less than I sucked a week before
so I'll give you a perfect example
everyone those Algar so I've been
putting out for algorithms for about two
months now and going on for another
three weeks a for algorithms a week from
code fights I did 98 algorithms on their
site 98 I spent six weeks strength doing
algorithms on code five six weeks that
was all I did all my all my Creek
I spent six weeks doing nothing but
codified ogron's the four hours I've
come home after day the weekends
algorithms algorithms algorithms it's
hard
it sucked I didn't I got tested for a
recruiter through code fights because I
noticed so I was filling out algorithms
and then I bummed the out of that
algorithm interview so don't think that
it other people don't suck at all and
that you just don't get the payoff when
you want it you work hard and you get it
eventually
right I wanted to pass that I wanted
them to want to look to hire me at all
these great in amazing companies and I
worked hard man I worked hard six weeks
nothing but algorithms day after day
after day and I what I got was failure
but that's okay because I learned in the
process when you're struggling through
those things you're gonna learn man
you're gonna pick up a few things but
you have to struggle you have to grind
and you may not get it when you want it
but you will get it as long as you keep
going so it's I understand being
frustrated with algorithms because it's
hard man I understand it I understand
because you know I you know I I'm used
to failing more than I am a succeeding
boom I'm used to family more than I am
succeeding now I'm used I'm okay I am
able to succeed because I fail because
the first time I failed wasn't the last
time I tried the second time I failed
wasn't the last time I tried the third
time I felt wasn't last time I kept on
trying you just think I had my first
interview and I got a job no I failed
time and time again a study worked
harder
you know it's it's none of this stuff
comes easy
I'm not once ever said this stuff is
easy you can look through all my videos
and you'll never see me say it's easy
it's not easy it gets easier but it's
not easy there's the reason you're well
compensated and there's a reason that
it's that there's some math involved
other things it's difficult you have to
reprogram your brain you have to think
differently if think extremely logical
it's hard but it's also worth it and
it's fun I love it all that's our stuff
now things will get easier but when you
get when you get started it's like
anything else right you've got to learn
the basics and somehow you have to
figure out how to put those basics
together so anybody would you know it's
it's like it's and that's why compared
to YouTube sometimes it's because it's
like I wasn't always gaining you know
2,000 subscribers a month that that to
some people may seem like nothing to me
it's a lot do you know in the first six
months I did YouTube the first six
months I got 250 subscribers or like 500
subscribers and I put up about a hundred
videos that's the first six months of me
doing YouTube so I remember putting up a
video and seeing no views and stuff like
be okay failing because you have to fail
to succeed most of the time so when
you're struggling through it and you're
getting frustrated it's okay it's okay
I get frustrated every day and I'm okay
with it because if I just take it in
take it in and move past it instead of
just being stuck and frustrated about
being frustrated you'll do better how am
i doing today I'm doing excellent oh
yeah man don't give up keep grinding
oh I understand your frustration man
yeah man it's what's the first language
you learned I did one programming class
when I was like 20 and visual basic it
was awful and I really learn anything
and so I would say Java a couple years
later when I started in my computer
science program so mmm I understand it
being rough though man I do it's hard
right cuz and that goes back to I've
said this a couple times now with that
it's easy to work hard everyone can work
hard how long can you work hard right
can you can you work hard for a year can
you work hard for a month can you work
hard for a weekend so it all it all
depends man you sometimes it's a matter
of sticking with it getting better
improving right you're gonna look back
at at algorithms and be like yo man I
can't believe I couldn't reverse the
string oh it's okay so don't sweat it
move forward don't be afraid to fail it
sucks it sucks I'm not gonna tell you
that doesn't suck to fail it sucks a lot
I could tell you I felt like when I
when I failed when I when I failed that
that technical interview that the
recruiter was gonna either basically
throw me to all these great companies
I've built relationships with I can tell
you that I got that yeah it sucks but am
I not gonna keep going and we're not
gonna keep trying I'm
not going to you know take down the
situation no man you gotta keep pushing
forward
you got a study you say I can get it
this time I wanted to sucked still sucks
uh what was the problem it was just a do
Co problem it was like you got it you
got a three-dimensional array passed in
and you had to figure out if it was a
proper Sudoku problem like basically
they passed in all the values and you
had to write an algorithm that that
checked if it passed all two if it pass
all the criteria to be a correct answer
for an entire Sudoku puzzle that was it
I got like two-thirds of the way through
it
it is pretty nerve-wracking you know
they have the person on skype who you're
they can see you clicking and typing and
you're supposed to decide your thought
process she was very nice by the way
first enjoy the soup super nice time
nothing bad to say about about the about
the company and the person and whatnot
and mind you by the way
that was just one of three that was just
one of three algorithms I'd expect to
solve in the hour I didn't solve the
first one it wasn't like I barely failed
I take that so hard baby oh my
goodness is went down so fast uh so
it's so you just gotta look back on it
at fun and you know I uh I hate
interviews man and that's basically what
it is and it's stressful and especially
the white board interviews man get ready
to fail at a few white board interviews
because if you're like me and that's not
everyone is but I freeze up on these
white board interviews man let me tell
you um so it's
I mean you can get a million knows in
life sometimes you only need that one
yes right and it gets hard and don't
think that I'm like this impervious guy
who doesn't have those moments where he
wants to give up and and just scream and
yell and and you know curl up into a
ball and cry you know I definitely have
those moments I've had a couple I talked
about it in the past where I talk in one
thing I uh
one thing I talk about in the how I
became a developer video is when April
and I broke up I was in one of those
moments where even though I was giving
it my all as questioning myself and I
was just ready to fall apart and all it
takes is one person to tell you you know
that you're not a loser and that you
will get there it just takes that one
person to believe in you if that has to
be me I will do it just keep growing man
and grow keep growing as a developer ask
the person you'll get there so I
understand man I've been there it sucks
no was it wasn't too long ago that there
was I was in a different situation so I
understand how's the deaf job market in
Tampa I mean I can only speak for myself
but I can tell you that I get emails and
phone calls every day
oh yeah everyday multiple so um so I'd
say pretty good
I'm also an interesting candy for a lot
of people I've come to realize so I
don't know if that makes me more
attractive or not I guess I guess it
does I would say it does I mean you you
have somebody and it's okay to be
objective about this because I'm so
passionate about coding because I'm
always learning because I'm I'm always
going to meetups and doing all these
things that I am constantly getting I'm
very I'm it naturally I'm the type of
person a company who wants to build an
employee up which if you're you know I
have one year of real experience that a
little before that it's kind of shady
when when how you kind of group that an
internship and then working a software
company doing documentation and stuff
that you put yourself you know I in
terms of years of experience I don't
have that much in terms of being the
right qualities of a candidate
objectively I probably have that have
ever contributed Oken source projects a
couple in terms of reporting bugs and
and creating tickets and say hey feature
request things like that for the most
part man I if you say have I ever
contributed open source projects I put
all my videos out on YouTube and I have
the source code for all of it on my
stuff for people to watch and code pins
for it so I don't know if that counts
you know at the end of the day if you
kind of take what a the money you make
on YouTube you're probably making like
three dollars an hour at the time you
hit the tiny foot so I feel like that's
open source to degree right
all right guys um it's it's time for me
to wrap this up I appreciate you all
2,000 new subscribers here I hope I hope
if you're watching this I hope you
learned something about me I hope you
learned something about software I hope
you learn something about yourself at
the other day what I like to end these
live streams other than thanking the
25,000 plus now for being here I'd like
to leave on a I like to leave on a final
thought in honor of the greatest
developer of them all Jerry Springer all
right so whoo
I think it's only appropriate since
we've talked about it that we talk about
failure and not giving up so let's let's
talk about that for about five minutes
here the the goal of a developer is to
solve problems that's the goal and what
your salt what you're building something
to solve a problem and innately that
involves failure the reason for that is
a problem is something failing and you
need to build a solution for success and
you're building your you are essentially
are blazing a path that most of the time
has not yet been built there's resources
out there to help you define that path
more like tools and it gets easier as
you go along but it'll never not you
will never not fail at everything if you
think that you're gonna get a junior
developer job or you're gonna become a
senior developer and there's going to be
things in your life you're not going to
fail at that is a very dangerous mindset
to have as you become more successful
about whatever you want in life and
whatever you want to get out of life
that could be money it could be dating
it could be whatever it is there are
going to be times you
success because you have trained
yourself because you have worked hard
and you've earned that success and
you've got that success because of how
hard you work and there's going to be
times that you fail regardless of how
hard you've worked and it's as important
to be ready for the times that you are
successful to keep yourself in check so
that when you get that success that you
don't just stagnant maintain the same
and you you you open your horizons and
you say okay well Dylan what I what now
that was my only goal and I you'll find
out that when you get closer and that
goal is really achievable you start
thinking about what can I do next
because now you know what good success
and when you do that you're looking for
loftier goals and sometimes you won't
hit them that's okay
maybe you'll get it next time but if
you're not prepared to accept failure
and you and you're just going to give up
that's a dangerous thing to happen the
second you start giving up in life is
the second that you're giving yourself
excuses so that when things don't go
your way you just give up again and
again and again and I know it's cliche
but it's really is true right and I
could go for anything you could say
something worth saving money right maybe
you maybe you're like me maybe you hate
the fact that you don't have more than
two hundred dollars in your bank account
maybe that causes you stress beyond
belief so now you say I'm gonna say five
percent of my check ten percent I don't
care what I have to do change my
lifestyle but every check that five or
ten percent it's going into an acorns
account it's going into and then you
start making excuses as to why you can't
do it and then you start going back in
the wrong direction I hope that you guys
are ass prepared for success as you are
for sale yer because as the great Al
Bundy said love and marriage goes
together like a horse and carriage and
the same is true for success and failure
you got to fail to succeed and when you
succeed sometimes it causes other
aspects of your life to fail thank you
so much for watching thank you guys for
twenty five thousand subscribers
there's nothing better than leaving it
on
marriage with children it's only you
know what some of you may not even
understand that quote because I'm third
I'm almost 30 and some of you like 14
and loving loving marriage with Al Bundy
what's off like 12 years ago
thank you for watching shout out to our
fans in India Iran Nigeria and
everywhere else in the world I
appreciate you guys all it is a pleasure
doing this and I can't wait to see you
guys hopefully in two weeks for 26,000
subscriber AMA I do these every thousand
