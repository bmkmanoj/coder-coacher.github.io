we're in unit 5 effects a use jQuery 2%
your site's content with fancy effects
so it's been an interesting course so
far definitely it's a beginner level and
I have to agree however the fact that
you need to know a little bit of jQuery
and and JavaScript just makes it what I
think anytime a prerequisite for someone
like that it should be a little higher
but doesn't really matter so we're gonna
be messing around with some effects so
let's see what we got here so we have
the slide down effect so you can see an
example how will you do that all right
so slide out in fact I mean it's in
milliseconds and so one slide down let's
click slide the container down to make
this happen I'd all right so we now want
the container after it hides the
previous one to then dot slide down with
800 milliseconds feel a bit so and slide
down slide down slide down cool
there's also slide up which slides up as
you could imagine
so after we show the image here we want
to then call call the slide up on the
container and we want to give it that
amount of time
there's also fade in cool fade ends one
that would be kind of cool to use so
let's see here we see how it works we'll
probably test it out in a second here so
after we hide it
we also want to fade it in and we're
gonna give it a seven hundred weight
also fade out
so how do you want to fade out here so
same same similar thing we're gonna call
it on the container the container class
rather and we're gonna call it fade-out
and what do you want
my seventh working
oh we forgot to run main so document
read document so this is why it's not
working
see there goes cool so there's also
animate looks pretty complicated let's
see here
so animate the width to 193 so you doing
like a little bit of CSS here takes two
parameters to set a CSS property so
that's what this first parameter is and
a time duration okay I can get down with
that cool so let's get started here
so it looks like we write a little hefty
amount of code so we can see the fade in
fade out all that sort of stuff
so at top of the write a flip board page
click on more drop down menu appears oh
there's there's two more and some other
stuff so let's just get started
so it looks like they just want us to
set up document dot ready let's check I
don't know they always get confused cuz
I've been doing with jQuery but this is
basically create the main method or main
function then you load it up easy enough
so use jQuery to select more link this
involves drop-down toggle class add a
click alright so we want to the more
link it's like the more link alright so
we have to select it
dot more
this involves of the drop-down - toggle
excuse me toggle and then we want to add
a dot click function our event handler
rather and in here we want to select the
drop down talk drop down menu class so
here we go with this
and we're going to dot toggle when it's
clicked so let's go ahead and say mr.
Matt C that's right so what are we doing
wrong so let's look at our code here we
have drop down - toggle dot click and
then our function and in there we want
to drop down - menu toggle our main
function is enough let's see what's
going on compare and contrast so there
this first line seems to be good so
there's I mean we have our oh there's no
dot oh excuse me there's no drop in ours
rather
remember the single quotes not the class
dot you know so use jQuery to select
arrow - next class season the click
event handler so we're in here and we
want to also select arrow - next
now what do I want to do the hair
so we select arrow dot next oh excuse me
we are setting this up for another
different click function because we're
clicking something else so dot click and
then function
and make sure your brackets are right
cool alright so inside this event
handler we're gonna create two variables
so they're current slide and the next
slide current slide shoots like the
active slide next slide should restore
this so current that's that and let's
just get this set up there next close
that so what do we want current slide to
be your current slide fade out at 600
milliseconds remove that active slide
though so it's active slide a class C
equal so current slide is equal to and
this could be wrong but we're going to
find out we're going to test it first so
this is going to be equal to the active
slide and next slide
nice let's take a look what's going on
here
so far currents light is equal to active
slide and then next slide is equal to
current slide next okay cool
that makes sense so we want to call the
dot next on it define it so we have all
right slide dot next now we want to fade
in at 600 milliseconds so if you
remember it takes in a fade out and a
fade in so let's take a look at this
real quick and it's going to be within
the same thing here so current slide
fade out this is the time parameter and
then we want to remove the active -
slide and then we want to fade in active
our add class active - like for next
slide so let's do that right now
so we have our current slide and we want
to fade fade that one out and that takes
600 milliseconds or whatever we want and
then we want to dot remove class so
we're removing the image the slider
image active - slide and let's fix this
we have a dot here and we also have a
dot here so first thing first we have to
slowly remove the active slide next we
want next slide dot fade in to be 600
and we want to add the class add it to
the class dot active - slide I believe
that should work add code for a dot
arrow - next
nope make sure you defined all the
variables so let's take a look at the
example here says our variables might be
wrong so we have active - like current
slide is equal to active slide that
seems good then we have currents all
right here's our air cool so we faded it
out an image and then we fade it in an
image so let's handle this case using an
if statement inside the click event
handler when current slide is the last
slide next slide will be empty all right
so right here will say if next slide
okay so the way they want to do is do
dot length is equal equal to zero we
want it to do some now what do
we want it to do therefore after
creating the variables current slide the
next slide write an if statement that
checks if next slide length is equal to
zero cool
so if next slide is empty you want to go
back to the first slide so we want to
say that therefore and so this to me set
next time equal to the first slide
alright so we'll say next slide is equal
to the variable dot slide single quotes
dot first
so that will reset it apparently to the
first one save us tonight very nice so
let's go ahead and test out our code
next slide fade in it's not a function
you'll see her this is really bad that
they let that go through because it is
case sensitive so what seems to be
partially working a see fade-out
hopefully it'll fix that cuz that messed
me up on in our earlier video to we're
like oh all of a sudden my code worked
for one side and not the other and then
we had to work our way through it all
again so you know so I said a few more
lines code inside the click event
handler for arrow - knacks alright so
what are we adding in here use jQuery to
select the active - dot class all right
so let's select let's break this up a
little bit and we want to select
active - dot
and what do we going to do save it to a
new variable named Kirino so we'll save
our current dot equals that all right
select the next dot using next I save in
a variable next dot so of our next dot
equals current dot dot next remove the
active dot class from current dot remove
active dot class and add it to a so
current dot is equal to next dot know if
it's right click to sees the arrow moves
two dots
now remember to remove active desktop
sorry so current
I think we have to do removeclass so
okay let's see
we'll stay current dot dot or move class
dot active dash dot all right so let's
take a look at example here so
all right just like current slide - next
current dot active dot next time okay so
this is why I made my mistake we also
want to right here when we did current
dot dot remove class active thought we
forgot to add next dot dot add class
active - dot
apparently they don't use this just not
class cool so just we have to remove it
and we have to add it we can implement
this in the same money that we went back
to the first slide in the if statement
under the existing code add a line that
says next dot equal to dot dot buffers
in the if statement under the existing
code okay Adeline that's this next dot
alright so we're gonna actually throw
this up top so it makes a little more
sense with the rest of our variables and
we're gonna say next dot is equal to dot
dot dot first so it's gonna move it back
to the first next not equals oh and
don't forget the cash money all right
that wasn't it
I saw dot dot first shouldn't matter
right here should work still huh so not
only is equal to zero judge it of our
current dot next dot let's throw this
back up at top so we threw it in there
next dot equals cash money dot dot first
alright so I believe we are doing okay
here let's go ahead and take a look
huh so it doesn't remove it so let's go
yeah let's go to the forum real quick
and we are on next dot - I think I click
glossary let's go the forum we're on
next dot - what do you why this code
works if statement not possible so this
is B right
we slide
so actually luckily oops sorry guess
they gave us an example back in the
first step of this so that's what I want
the house going on right now
it's a view course overview Oh
so look as I saying luckily if we go
back to the first step we actually can
preview what it was we were trying to do
here so this is next time synchronous
this is where we're at I believe so
let's go ahead and copy this copy
everything above it and compare and
contrast so jot down that clicked up
function this could just be one looks
weird things drop down menu single
quotes single closed dot toggle alright
cool so we're good here we have arrow -
next I click function we haven't had a
problem with that this whole time so
we're probably good their current slide
dot active slide sound like : next slide
equals current slide cool
current dot should go to active dot next
not equals current dot dot next this
slides out Lance is equal to equal to
zero that's good next slide
seagulls dot first then current slide
oh is this it
let's see if this is having an effect on
it current slide I remove class slide
add class so it looks to me like
everything's identical so for the time
being we are going to copy this in here
and if anyone happens to catch it in the
video by all means leave a comment and
let me know what the issue was
oops okay I messed up there
what the hell it's gonna end up in foot
all right so still not 100% sure oh
did I have one too many so it looks like
I might had one too many of these there
we go
so is it was a syntax thing so select
arrow - previous element
all right we're still on the main here
now we're doing so again is another
syntax thing so it's just part of
programming and we want to call dot
click and then we want to assign this
function to do some stuff for it
so when it gets clicked what do we want
it to do select the active slime
and saving a new variable called current
slide
alright so select the previous slide so
we're gonna save our oh hey buddy ha ha
our brief slide and we want to select
the previously alright so pre slide is
equal to current current slide current
slide dot preval right fade-out current
slide in 600 milliseconds and remove
back to psych class from it so let's see
here
so we want to do something similar so we
have current slide
I weighed out 600 and then let's say
that it's good to go all right inside
the click event handler for a reprieve
running up stay going to handle this
case so if we're gonna say if priests
lied dot length is equal equal to 0
set pretty slight equal last slide all
right so free slide is equal to dot
slide last so we're st. to the very last
slide try it out save submit
remember to fade out the currents let
him remove the active slide so I just
did know
okay so maybe they wanted this outside
the F statement
and no semicolon there
I was supposed to be pre slide
croissant a fade-out not add class so
current slide is equal to active slide
bar pre slide is equal to current slide
not prove you know if proof site length
dot length is equal exactly to zero
running this thing this is pre slide and
here it is pre slide is equal to not
slide last and then to compare this you
know
hmm
so this all seems to be correct see what
happens when you paste this in here okay
so that's the right and it's not working
so there's probably something wrong with
another part of our code so what we're
gonna do is go back to this previous one
because I don't I don't want make a
45-minute video for the syntax and let's
see if proof dot your slide you'll see
that was this kind of cheating per se
but for the sake of the video I don't I
don't want to make it too too long so
now this should work what
let's see what happens when you put this
in
okay that works why does this extra
bracket for mom - that goes there
that goes there I mean I've had a I'm
missing bracket oh that looks that looks
like what it might have been so this
goes here this is here
and let's remove that oops
let's go back
okay all right so our code is fixed this
is another another error on my part from
way a couple of other slides
hopefully they'll they'll make it a
little more a little harder to go on to
the next stage
I am so let's add a few more lines of
code inside the click event handler
arrow josh approve or uh yesterday a
little more lines of code inside the
click event now I am like Erin up for
you use jQuery just select active dot
element and save it's a new variable
name current dot where you did that
just like the previous stop it's like
alright done is equal to active dot
select the previous dot using pre
approved on remove the active all right
so the same thing here current dot
removed class pre at class and we're
gonna put it below everything else this
is gonna take care of our dots that's
all we need to do here in the if
statement under the existing code out a
line that says prove dot equal to dot
dot last an if statement under the
existing code so I'm gonna say if
not dot
so if proved dot seagull equal to
last what we wanted to do
I think that you just wants to write
that if statement
they what
all right I was like they just want to
write an if statement so okay so in our
if statement I thought we were gonna
write the rest of this we're gonna set
pre-fly so the previous slide is equal
to this dot slide - last so the last
slide and prove dot is equal to so
basically what's going on right here is
it's I don't know if it's technically
changing but if it is it's changing back
to the exact one every time and there we
go we finished it a little bit of a
hiccup here there with minor syntax
errors so I'm sorry if you know you have
to go and and check check the the code
yourself but uh as always I'm learning
this at the same time everyone else's so
thanks for watching the make an
interactive website development course
and I will see you guys along with Milo
here he was innovated in my lap in the
next video questions comments concerns
all that sort of stuff it's really
appreciated guys and it keeps me going
I'll see you guys next next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
