the day turay section what we try and do
is this next task where we want to take
a two dates that are in separate years
it looks like and then we also or the
year is just a one gap i believe is
what's going on here and we want to go
ahead and just put the month and then
the date so let's see I think that's the
condition we're doing here so we did our
statement where if the dates are equal
we'd return this so we can we can just
go ahead and do an else statement here
and we'll slow we'll set a date array
dot push and we may have to change this
later but we're just going to try and
check off one or two out of time and see
what we can do so data rate up push and
then where we have our month names that
takes and 81
and then we want to plus out the day
chain and in here we're going to put
date 12 let's see that should return the
first as well so let's go ahead and say
let's go ahead and put this in here and
then let's make sure our first part is
working return date are a run that so
cool these are December first and then
we just have to output the next aspect
of it so date over a push month names
day 2 and X 1 plus a space plus de
change and then that looks like a third
we don't have a statement set up for
that so we'll do another statement right
now
so we'll do an if statement here or else
if that says if day is equal equal equal
strictly equals to 3 return day plus rd
now when we run it I should give us the
check mark very cool so we got this case
set up what's the next case so if
there's a larger gaps than two so it's
their larger gap in one return the full
dates okay we can do that so let's do an
if statement here or else if and we're
going to say we're also going to reset
the the year at this point so we're
going to say date 10 is equal to number
date 10 and then we'll do the same thing
for day to day 20 is equal to number day
20 and all we're going to do here say if
date 20 minus date
one day 10 so if 20 18-20 16 in our
example here let's go ahead and throw
this in here because we want to test it
as we go so if this is greater than one
we want to return the data right here
and then we want to push date array dot
push how does it come out it comes out
the month so we're going to month names
date 11 so let's go to make sure that
this is working so far if statement it
should return December very nice so it
returns the summer nothing's broken so
far and then we want to as always the
good sign with nothing's broken then we
just want to go ahead and return to
space we want to call our day change
function if we already have first set up
so we're good on that so date one second
in box we're going to go ahead and oops
what did I do there we go sorry I did
that in the wrong line plus it Jane you
know why don't we just save yourself a
headache because i keep on messing this
up we'll just go ahead and copy paste
this in it's the same exact code
so let's go and run that we get December
first for halfway there but now what we
need to do is put a space put a comma
really was a comma space and then we
have to output the year so we're just
going to go ahead and call and 80 here
date 10 and this should be our kind of
our formation for the first part is
number first 2016 perfect now we just
have to return something similar and
change the index value so instead of
date one we're going to be getting date
to date too oops day two and then date
too let's go and run that BAM there's
our third check off alright guys so uh
next video we'll just keep knocking
these out I hope you're finding them
helpful again just saw a lot of if
statements else statements and functions
and I just keep with it solve it piece
by piece that's my advice when solving
these algorithms go with piece by piece
don't get overwhelmed go piece by piece
