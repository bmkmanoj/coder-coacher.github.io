back in solo learn we're gonna do be
doing the variable basic concepts here
it's a little bit of a long section but
uh let's go ahead and dive right in
so we have variables variables are
basically stuff that stores data which
keyword is too
you
that you've worked with before in terms
of if this is not
you
we can also output the audio is cutting
it out hmm
we can also output the value using a
document dot write X so if we wanted to
declare the variable which is var and
then the name of the variable and then
the assignment operator variable names
are also case sensitive so if you have
you typically want to start with a
letter in your Oh actually I believe we
can do this mathematical operators I
don't think so and I don't believe
numbers so you can start with the
underscore or letters as it there's also
this is a good thing I'd like to do this
where I save these and come back to it
I'll go ahead and just save this image
here and I'll come back and look back
back at it and some of the rules will
follow you'll see all this sort of stuff
reserved words in JavaScript these are
basically words you cannot use in
JavaScript because they already do
something in JavaScript which characters
cannot be used in variable names special
symbols cannot be used all right cool
pretty straightforward now we're gonna
talk about datatype so we were talking
about variables where you store data and
when you store the data it gives you
different types of data you don't assign
the variable type but it inherits it by
what the value of the data is so in this
case we have our age we passed in 18 the
illegal adult age of a American citizen
it then takes on the type of number
because it's in there as an integer
continue on a floating-point number
there's still a number but it has a
decimal place that's all it is it has
decimals with it it's not a whole
integer in order to create a string we
just need quotation marks that means
it's a basically a word or a character
or a series of characters rather now you
can do single quotes double quotes a
newline backslash tab slash T backs for
these are all inserts that you can do to
your to your string here so you'll see
right here we're adding in single quotes
and the escape characters that the
backslash just kind of referred to as
and so in this case we want to do
backslash backslash to get the double
quotes on going on in there
another thing that you could do is just
use single quotes on the outside and
double quotes on the inside and we'll
work just as well or vice versa you just
have to use the opposite
all right so boolean values are true or
false
it's one or the other always that's what
it means to be a boolean I also have the
math operators which are pretty cool as
well
these are gonna be similar the only
thing that may be confusing to people
who are new you should know
multiplication division subtraction
addition modulus is when you divide so
if we have five modulo 3 it's gonna have
a remainder 2 it's basically the
remainder so if you have 10 modulo 9 and
be a remainder of 1 it's always the
remainder and then increment basically
just takes that number and adds 1 to it
and same thing with decrement except in
the opposite direction so in our example
a is equal to 10 a plus plus now a is
equal to 11 what will the display be in
the result is following statements so we
have 5 plus 7 was just 12 and what goes
out we're gonna go ahead and write out
the because our variable is storing this
value the multiplication operator works
just as you would expect the asterisk is
a multiplication operator and the
division operator is the backslash
and let's see here the modulo operator
is the % which may also be the modulo
name so in this case 35 divides into 38
seven times evenly into equal 35 so our
modulo remainder would be three go on
and then you have increment plus plus
decrement - - and then var you can do
the same thing for the bar so this pre
increment means that if we do a is equal
plus plus B a is equal 11 B is equal to
a is equal to this is interesting a is
equal 11 B is equal to 11 and then a is
equal to B plus plus so B gets added but
a doesn't okay that makes sense so
increment and decrement are used for
adding or subtracting one from a number
cool so you also have the assignment
operators the equal plus equals so X
plus equals would be that value plus or
equals to y is equivalent to X is equal
to X plus y same thing with the - it's
that value and then you minus something
and the same thing with the
multiplication and the modulo and
everything else so please calculate can
type the resulting value of the
following expression the result is 20 so
the result result is 20 it would be a
result times 5 so 20 times 5 is a
hundred comparison operators the
comparison operators are used in logical
statements to determine whether or not
so you have double equals checks if the
value is equal but not the type and what
I mean by that
you know it'll return true or false the
comparison operators always return true
or false now double equals is equal to
now triple equals is identical to
meaning it's the same value and the same
type and then you have not equals 2
which is again the value not equals
equals 2 which is not identical and then
greater than or equal to it less than or
equal to pretty much just know that the
value so if this 5 was equal equal to 10
this
turned false now as five was equal equal
equal quotation five quotation that
would also return false because this is
the wrong type as well it's gone please
enter the corresponding operators to
make all the values correct so these are
equal these are not equal and then Val
one is less than and then valve two is
strictly equals or exactly equal to type
and value let's see here and then we
have logical and boolean operators
logical operators also knows Blaine you
have and which basically takes one
statement and says is this true and is
this true if so return true and if that
one's false alert turn false and you
have or which returns true if either or
are true or false if all are false it's
going to return false and then returns
true if the operand is false and false
is this basically gone do the opposite
logical returns true if both operands
are true logical operators you can
combine statements to get different
bullying's for instance ten is less than
five is a true statement
fourth greater than two is true so
that's true and true you can also do a
ternary operator which basically will
save you some time this is something I
always forget how to do just because I
don't ever do it
but it's actually a great skill set to
do some shorthand so it's basically the
condition and then if it's true return
this else return this that's basically I
was saying so if the age is less than
eighteen that and that's true you're too
young if it's greater than eighteen old
enough right which is kind of a creepy
way of saying like dating wise like I
felt like that was a dating statement I
don't know maybe I'm just a dirty old
man logical not returns true if the
operand is false I believe that's
correct there we go
string operators and if it takes you a
second just to say these things and read
through them don't don't sweat it
definitely let it sink in its string
operators so the most useful operators
for Strings is concatenation
so you can concatenate strings by using
the plus sign so what is the output of
the following code var X is equal to 54
y is equal to 100 and this will actually
add them together because it will go
ahead and assume that this is 150
because they're both numbers no oh
excuse me there's strings I my mistake I
didn't see that so because these are
strings are gonna concatenate them
together you can get 50,000 100 they're
not gonna actually do any math operators
they're just gonna add them as if they
were two words so we have the modulo 2
quiz so choose names that are
exceptional for JavaScript variables
that and that can't start can't have
these weird numbers and can't start like
weird symbols and can't have it start
with a number please fill in the
datatypes show in the field below so
some text is a string and then true is a
boolean and of course 12 is the number
there to tell us that and then finally
what is the result is expression of r1
and var 2 if r1 is true if r2 is false
that's gonna be false because both of
these have to equate to true it's gonna
put false it's always going to be when
you're doing these comparisons it's
never gonna be undefined it's gonna
return a boolean BAM all right that's
