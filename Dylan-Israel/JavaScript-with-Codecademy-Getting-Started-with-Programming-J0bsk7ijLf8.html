JavaScript according this about 10 hours
beginner level salt almost anyone can do
it and the first section is getting
started with programming of the
introduction of JavaScript I personally
have a interview tomorrow that uses
JavaScript potentially so I need a
refresher courses spent quite some time
so in this case
write your name within quotes like this
and then click Save my name is Dylan
save and submit
alright it goes to Dylan okay discover
the length so in this case it's fine
we're gonna be using the dot length and
you can see it's five characters okay
simple enough add two numbers like this
so three plus four and our result should
be seven very nice you use most
efficient and so a lot of this is going
to be two times four divided by 2 should
be four there we go
well this is gonna be stuff we can just
kind of look at and do right on trying
to use interpreter by using a word like
eggplant eggplant it's not defined okay
editor in comments so so on you can see
on line 1 and line 2 double slash
similar to Java is a one-line comment on
line 3 we're going to find the length of
cake let's see to confirm
this is an example of using yes so you
see how pop-up happened and pop up but
uh one of the reasons JavaScript just
fell out but even though it's kind of
making a comeback is it has to work on
so client-side so it's kind of risky
meaning that most web languages work on
the server-side so there's no risk to
the user most of the time write your own
message that you want the user to
confirm so let's say confirm billing
question confirm it's not defined oh
semicolon forget the semicolon
Oh Co firm is not fine I confirm it
there we go down this cool question mark
yeah buddy
I what is programming let's see here use
the prompt command to ask the user where
they are from check out their examples
about how to do this
alright so prompt semicolon let's not
worry we're trying to be we need fixer
code Brooklyn where you from originally
that's really easy so far I like that
write a string with that with at least
three words so as always we call it
Lance so it says right here that it
counts all the empty spaces as well so
14 the same thing coding like a champ
all right just actually have this then
we're gonna find the length of it again
and say
all right there's one greater than temp
I think we might have to put a if
statement in but I guess this will work
so it returns true and just goes we're
interested I want to make sure this
working should return false if we do
this false okay we got to change it back
though because that wasn't the goal here
all right make the computers to using
console dot log so let's see what this
does console dot log few times 5 and
then console dot log hello let's see
what it is so that's 10 and this is just
hello
so if we wanted to print out everything
console dot log is how we do it commonly
called printing out all right
this is a comparison operators equal
equal equals so one extra Equalists 4
equal to not equal to same same thing
alright so we need to evaluate all these
so now that length is less than 122 yeah
length is not equal is equal equal equal
that should all return to your true true
easy enough next section it looks like
we're using if statements in JavaScript
and it looks to be quite similar to
regular Java and regards to its setup if
1 is less than 2 right 1 is less than 2
and that should work just fine
this one we want to put a condition
that's also one that's greater than to
fill in some code to run in the else
portion house hi guys
our browser crashed a third time I think
it might have been because we put the
console in the wrong spot even so it
should just give us an air and not do
that but I hear we got one is greater
than 2 so I should print out one is
greater than 2 is false all right
remember the order of punctuation mentor
if you get in there check carefully line
by line if you're really stuck click
stuck good hint
and in this case write an if-else
statement so if one is equally Rosen one
console is the condition rather
wants us to evaluate to false and bam
the condition is false cool computers
aren't that smart
there are many mistakes and codified
then fix them all you're doing is called
debugging a germ popularized by grace
Hooper which you literally removed a
moth from her computer I did not know
that
so if 10 is equal to 10 we need to be to
be equal equal equal you've got true
else he's got false oh we also need to
remove the semicolon BAM there we go we
can make pop-up boxes appear using
confirm and prompt data types numbers
strings billions conditionals will this
run the first block 1204 3 which is
exactly equal to our dumb lead yes so
cool we've learned math order of
operations to evaluate complete the
missing Mistico to construct the if-else
statement if
okay make the conditions out here true
so if John Donne Lane three times 2/3 so
it's equal to 2 because 6 divided by 3
is equal to okay all right print this
else just answer Maxwell school math and
modulo
so console dot log carry the string rock
14 to 32 cool next section let's get the
if-else statement to explain the first
number is even and it line 5 by adding
the present value is true - as you can -
in the Kherson use a modulo ok so we'll
say 2 modulo 2 should be correct
find the fourth up to include seventh
later letter of the string wonderful day
so let's see how they do this okay
so we are using something called
substring so we're calling wonderful
space today and we want to find the
fourth up to
all right so remember everything always
starts at zero for most parts and we
want to start on the fourths so that
would be the third index up to the
seventh to the six
see
I guess uh we do two two zero one two
and that will to include the force we do
the one before it
so let's see here
when I go zero to two
all right so we want to start at the
fourth so we start the fourth we should
start with a D so this was right and
then if we go up to seventh there we go
a little bit of a break right there so
there's our dirt floor you're looking
for all right use console dot log on
three separate lines
I'm turning out so strings in the
following and then we want to call
substring and let's see start at zero
all right count the letters 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 11 12 12 well that's right may
have been off by 1 and then we're
looking for
burgers substrate we want to start apps
three and we want to go to
oh okay that makes more sense so we're
trying to call it on the console you
need to call it on the actual string
all right so we need to actually
apparently it does include the last
letter you chopped off so you have to go
one more there we go
good variable called my agent type in
your image
Eclair very well line three called
America
just say you Musa use console.log to
pronounce all right so my country dot
length I should print out three sound so
long pronounce first three letters in my
country in this case we do United States
so you alright following instructions
online to declare variable filled my
name my name equals dialogue or Dylan
also dot log and we're going to print it
out my seven change the value of my name
to be just the first two letters so
they're still in and do I we're good to
go
all I want to create a variable to my
color and give it a string value my
color is equal to let's go red and then
on line two prints a link to my color
my color equals red what's not long my
colleague not oh man there we go and
three cool right here on if else
statement only instructions are involved
of the evaluate statement is a log to
the console I finish our first course if
this five three three I don't think I've
been putting in my semicolons so then
maybe option I'm not quite sure
BAM there we go so we finish our first
course of Java circle of course we're
going to share coke add me our coke Adam
achievement and next part we're going on
to is called choose-your-own-adventure
and it looks like we're gonna be doing a
little bit of user input and output so
look forward to that next time yes see
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
