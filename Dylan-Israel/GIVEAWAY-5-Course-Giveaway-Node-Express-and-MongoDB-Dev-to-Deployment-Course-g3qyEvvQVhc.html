around a little bit of the salt for some
of the people who are are neat little
bits on their life their sodium is not
high enough oh you have some fun here
Josh Chris christ-centered EV a mongoose
ESA I apologize I tried my best to
pronounce that but how is everybody
doing today so uh exciting stuff give me
a second just try and get nightbot up
and running if you've been in part of
these live giveaways a couple things
happens when we give out a lot of salt
in the process and - Oh awesome it's
actually working the live chats not but
it is seeming to remember who is in here
on here let's refresh this to happen so
we might actually be able to get this
giveaway started up fairly quickly so
two things um
awesome it's actually working nightbot
is doing its goddamn job freaking night
but I don't care if you're in beta
you're ready for you're ready for
production ready for the limelight baby
all right so uh how is everybody doing
today happy Sunday we're gonna let
people we're gonna let people cruise in
here for a little bit
so one of the things I want to want to
do is in about 5 10 15 minutes we'll get
started it's about 9:15 by 9:30 we'll do
our first giveaway let people show up
here and then of course will for the
people who weren't able to make it live
we also will be we also will be let will
be giving away one with a keyword at the
end of the video I'm not quite sure what
it's going to be yet but let's go over
what we're actually going to be playing
for today I guess you're not really
playing you're just participating but
it's it sounds a little bit better right
it sounds more it sounds more
professional so we log out of my account
and then we can show you what we're
going out and a quick shout out probably
do a couple of them today but I
definitely want to take a second to
thank traversing media travursel media
not only do I use his free courses but
we've been lucky enough that he has sent
us courses to give away for the channel
so if you guys haven't already
subscribed to traverse media 1 what are
you doing with your life it's probably
the best tutorial site on YouTube and
two he's very good guy and I'm I enjoy
following him so I encourage you to do
the same just bring up the course here
so I can show you guys what we're
playing for so diversity media so far
whenever he releases his courses he he
sends your boy ten of them I keep one I
give one or two to some of the patreon
subscribers and then we give the rest
out on the channel
I'm currently 90% of the way through his
angular front-to-back course is very
very nice but here let me show you what
we're what we're well we're what let me
show you what very few of you are going
to get and you guys already know what
salt looks like so we don't need to show
you that so today
what will be giving away is five of
these plus a bonus one for the people
who aren't able to make the livestream
and that is going to be the nodejs
Express MongoDB dev to deployment so
basically you're going to be building
full stack applications you're gonna be
covering a lot right and you can see
you're gonna be using MongoDB mongoose
which is a it's a node package that you
use a lot of times Google OAuth strategy
so this is really cool and he's also
gonna help you deploy a lot of times
there's two main things I've noticed
that there aren't a lot of courses for
or the courses that are out there kind
of skip over it and that is one
deployment into testing and so I'm glad
to see that he's including deployment on
here as he did in his angular 4
front-to-back course as well nine hours
of videos 55 supplemental resources and
of course a certificate of completion
which I encourage you to put on like
your your LinkedIn or something like
that as you go through and by the end of
it you'll have to complete not only will
you get introduced to a bunch of
concepts but by the end of it you'll
have to to portfolio items one which is
vigil where you can jot down and manage
ideas for future videos this is a
project that I need I think you made
this for me this is a YouTube project
right here I like this speaking of which
if you guys have any ideas for things
you want me to work on or talk about
definitely let me know and then the
second one story books is a social
network which is really really cool and
if you're not sure if you're gonna like
Brad's teaching style I I suggest that
you just catch one of his youtube videos
because they're pretty much identical in
that fashion of you knows Brad teaching
you and he does a very good job of a
huge fan and it's kind of my go-to place
now for so one question I know HTML CSS
JavaScript should I learn PHP my sequel
or nodejs in MongoDB I would say it's
probably going to if you're asking that
question you're probably a very very
entry level person and I encourage you
to probably go the full JavaScript stack
and go from there meaning the node in
the MongoDB I think will be an easier
transition from the front end to the
back end so all right uh about ten
minutes we'll do our first giveaway and
then every ten minutes after that or so
we'll do another giveaway so what do I
want to talk about say well other than
Brad hooking me up with a course thank
you for that and about nine other of you
got a couple cool videos coming out this
week we are going to be having I'm going
to give you my opinion about should you
go to who should go to a boot camp and
who should not go to boot camp that's
going to be Monday's video I also then
have a top five of my favorite coding
channels so I just want to share that
with you most these channels are much
larger than I am but it is good I you
know to promote other channels that
you're a fan of and you like their
content that you think that your
audience would appreciate right it does
me it only helps me if you go and watch
Chris Hawkes for instance some of the
topics that he talks about you say hey
what's dealing think about what is it
Dylan you know what is what I talked
about and Chris talks about you know
sometimes there's overlap and stuff like
that you say oh it's cool to get you
know you care to talk about the topic
and not necessarily like I'm only
watching one creator so these are these
are the types of the that's why I want
to show some love for the channels that
are coming out I also have a code Kadim
e video coming out where I talk a little
bit about code CAD amis new course as
well as kind of the rise and fall of
code Kadim e in my opinion and how I
hope they turn it around so look that's
that's this week's videos and I released
five videos last week normally I'm
trying to stick to about three plus a
live stream but last week I had a
sponsored video so that's off for seems
kind of like an odd let's just you
Monday through Friday sort of thing and
the live stream so you you guys would
see a lot of me I mean I know I know I
got this fantastic haircut and I'm
looking much better and you guys just
keep on tuning in for the eye candy but
I just get so uh we
I just had a lot to talk about for the
last week or so but if you guys have any
if you guys have any suggestions on what
you would like me to talk about because
I tend to just talk about what's on my
mind and and things that I see in the
news that I find very important
regarding software right I a man it
wasn't supposed to come out like this
man I know I'm it grows back though
that's that's the good thing is it does
indeed grow back and I swear I think
I've gained half an inch in the last two
weeks been so sweaty I'll have more hair
I might even just grow it like a hippie
length just like shoulder length and
just let you all deal with that ponytail
instead but um yeah so I want to I want
to interview some developers in the
future it's been a while since I've been
able to do that I have a couple coming
out that will be happening weren't one
of the the more notable ones I just
followed up I got shoot an email with
him in the in the few I shoot an email
back to him today
but I should be having an interview with
why am I forgetting his name Trevor
Trevor McGuinness if I I think I forget
I think I'm messing up his last name
your boys memory of names has never been
the best the barber hooked you up with
that yeah man I said I said I said I
have a job and I have a job tomorrow
I just need a little off the top a
little off the top I think he heard a
little on the top is what he heard and
that's what happened so a little bit
about me and what uh yes the the react
gentleman so he's on if you've if you've
been taking the rack now degree he's
also written part of the rack library
and stuff like that so
so yeah little on the top this lady
hurried so we're gonna be we're gonna
start in about six minutes here for the
first giveaway it's gonna be fun guys if
you've never been in the giveaways make
sure you listen to the rules or you'll
get extra salt so we'd like to give away
the salt here we give away extra salt
for people who don't listen to the rules
so it's gonna be fun just letting
everybody fill in here for the next five
or six minutes for the first giveaway a
little bit about what I've been up to
just so you guys got know where I've
been working my way through traversing
medias angular for course I'll probably
finish it up today after this livestream
I also have a podcast that I've been
working on although I've been running
into some issues with the YouTube I
started a new job two weeks ago and now
I am just been kind of getting up to
date with that and and getting caught up
and doing a lesser stuff of course
there's YouTube also and once I'm caught
up on basically the main things that I
need to focus on as a developer are are
um angular for right now so although I
have angularjs experience I don't have
angular for extreme so there's a lot of
things that it's just so how do I do
this how do I inject data from one
component to another and going on that
I've also started doing code fights
again so for those of you who are fans
of the code fights videos I have I
knocked out 10 this weekend there's kind
of like some little bit of fun before
bed I'd go to bed about thirty minutes
to an hour before before my before I
would normally go sleep I pull out the
laptop and start solving code fights and
I'd knocked out about ten this week so I
might have some more coming out I don't
know though cuz I think it's I think
it's I think it's a a lark I think it
lowers my lowers my my mic analytics
so don't get too many views but I like
to have them
it's coffee free and my workplace yes
most companies that you work at will
provide soda or coffee or anything like
that
is it a way a web agency you're working
for no I I've never actually wanted to
work at a web agency to me that just
means like hey hey you're gonna be
building websites I want to be building
web applications so I work for a company
I don't really I work for a company that
is in the health skin and and beauty
industry that involves marketing I guess
that that's that see if you can figure
it out from there but uh that is I work
for a very large company compared to my
other company so like my previous
workplace was doing like twenty five to
fifty million dollars in sales this
workplace now was at least from the
article I read public articles so I feel
okay saying this uh that that uh drawing
cuber what was your email if eating
receive your bootstrap course so I said
I sent out all the emails right after
but they did about a billion dollars in
in sales to see recording this public
article it sound like some insider
information anything like that so I feel
okay saying that but uh they're doing
very well so don't sweat it guys if
you're here you'll hear all the rules to
the good ways but yeah so I've never
alright we'll see if now was this from a
giveaway Andrew did you get the
bootstrap course through a giveaway so I
have to check my my email see what I
sent out or was it from some video that
I forgot to send a course
it's from one of these lifes okay cool
so we'll check I'll check my logs and if
everything's on the up-and-up I'll
follow up with you it could be that
maybe something got lost in in
connection we'll figure something out
though
no sweat it from the comments of the
stream okay that sounds like something I
would have might have forgotten about
but I'll take care of it man we'll get
you uh of course

I don't like it
shout out to our Portugal Europe friends
and family going on out there so we're
gonna do four more giveaways and then a
bonus giveaway in the comment section of
the video so uh a little bit about me as
I mentioned I'm about to start my third
week at a new job I get my first
paycheck I've been loving it been loving
it it's great workplace we have a hack
hacker period for two hours every Friday
where we can work on side projects and
things like that in a demo day where
people present what they've been working
on at work or outside of work so uh
that's really cool um a lot more
meetings that's something that I'm
accustomed to from previous roles but
not my last role I got I got I got lucky
in that fact I don't really mind the
meetings sometimes it's nice to take a
break and as long as you're a like 30
minutes or less which most of them are
it doesn't really matter to me too much
shout out to our Philippines the South
African family out there
the
so my the company I work for is in
marketing of health and beauty products
that's really that's really what they do
so uh I this any out so this this Sunday
I extreme this Friday I've been working
on a Chrome extension that basically
whenever I hit a bug in my JavaScript
console like you know it's a little red
stuff it's going to inject a coding meme
into there I've been struggling with it
I basically got it to say hello world
the main issue I'm having is for those
who don't know in in JavaScript there's
this thing called you can say window dot
one air and that one air or on air
excuse me on air and on air what that
basically does is it runs a callback
function that says hey when an error
occurs run this event so the issue with
that is the on air I'm having trouble
actually it's actually detecting errors
in the Chrome extension which there
aren't any because I'm a coding
god and and what I wanted to what I
wanted to do is actually target the
window for or the tab that I'm currently
on and so that's a little bit of the
issue that I've been having right now as
well as more so the the main issue is
just not being familiar with the API
course giveaway all right the API um a
chrome API I guess so there's a lot of
documentation whoo that goes along with
building a Chrome extension so although
you can write JavaScript a lot of times
the things that you're targeting our tab
or a button or an extension or a window
or a browser that's where a lot of the
lot of the frustration comes in a lot of
the the knowledge that I I lack it's
really just a tester app for fun I want
to build a Chrome extension and so
that's kind of what I'm doing for a side
project right now what courses the guy
when he he one traversing media's new
node
MongoDB and Express dev to deployment
course dua program in other languages
not lately and not really ever I mean I
have code in Java C sharp C++ C++ what
else Ruby at one time Visual Basic so I
hate complainers who wants to be a mod
in a band this guy James Lawrence
because I don't like complainers man
the thing about complaining is I think
I've been very forward about what's
going on with how we're going to be
doing this and I don't like people who
complain because complaining gets you
nowhere and there's nothing to complain
about right now what are you complaining
about bro I'm here giving five courses
away and a sixth one to you guys what
what is what is so so upset what what
are you so upset about man what is it in
your life that is getting you so upset
that I I'm taking my time for us to have
a nice little giveaway traversÃ©e Media
has donated courses so that we can give
to you guys and what is it what is what
is what is going on James what is going
on mr. James Lawrence in your life that
you are so upset and I've answered every
question that's come up in chat so I
don't I don't understand I I answer
almost every question it comes up in
shot even if it's stupid question so
that you don't remain stupid I ask I ask
stupid questions all the time the reason
you ask them is so that you stop being
stupid
why take him on just ignore because
there's other people out there who just
just are out there i I guess I'm trying
to make a point I'm not really it
doesn't really bother me so much
I mean what's there to bother with you
can just block somebody I guess what I'm
trying to trying to point out is that is
that at the end of the day people who
are complaining oftentimes there's other
things in life that's really upsetting
them as well as it doesn't accomplish
anything so Ivan you're you're always
allowed talking um will you do more code
fights videos maybe I'm doing more code
fights and I don't think I can help
myself but to put out more code five
videos um what am i reading the chat I'm
reading the chat
all right guys uh we're gonna do one
more giveaway right now so let me see
what the key word is gonna be so the key
word will be um let's see it let's see
we'll make it we'll make it complicated
and see how many of you enter in the
wrong word no no we won't do this
we'll say Express dot J s let's see how
many of you can get back Express J s is
the key word of the day make sure you
enter it like that you're not going to
be entered this will be our second
giveaway Express is a a node package
Ivan you cannot participate again you
portray but you're just gonna be getting
some extra salt once a winner get the
 out of here you don't need to the
same course you know saying get that
 out of here Ivan don't be that
don't be greedy don't be greedy
so express jss key word just like the
first one we are going to be rolling for
now two people the first two people you
get nothing but salt last time we gave
out rock salt this time it's going to be
that that garlic and that Lowery's
special seasoning salt
I personally like Lowery's but my blood
pressure has been going up in April's
been Yellin at me so now we use salt
earners the seasonings and let me tell
you they are so much worse than salt
seasonings okay but that's besides the
point so express Jas nospace express dot
Jas is the the key word thank you again
traverse' media donated this course I'm
gonna give everybody I don't know
everyone give everybody will give
everybody it's 944 will give everyone
till nine someone say something in chat
at nine what what time should we go 948
948 you got four minutes to say
express digest if you don't I can't help
you
1042 948 so guys uh love school things
kind of want to hear the rest of that
rant about so huh hey if this was a rant
channel I could rant for days man let me
tell you a true gar
to combat your cold is that a real thing
I feel like that's some shifts from like
you ever see the My Big Fat Greek
Wedding where they were like joking
about how you would like spray Windex on
your face and it would help solve like
your acne problems how many idiots do
you think actually did that and so I
feel like the garlic thing might be
something that was like in a movie
and God you got caught up in the hype of
it yeah yeah I worked in the movies I
don't know is that a real thing and it
sounds like it could be so yeah
so uh let's talk about express real
quick why we have I think I said 9:48 we
got three minutes for people enter into
the giveaway and you don't know about
the Chrome extensions I've got installed
uh yeah I mean I'll probably do I will
actually have a that's a good idea for a
video I thought I had this one down
right that so some of the some of the
cool Chrome extensions is I actually
have this as a desktop extension and so
this this is light shot light shot
allows me to I'm not sure if you'll be
able to see it but basically what it
allows me to do is screenshot and save
images and I can also like let's say I
want to like circle okay look live chat
and so this is good for quick like hey
look at this random number thing that's
working the one not so you can
screenshot and take stuff out the JSON
for matter is for if you have a JSON
object basically it just prettify zit in
your browser this honey app is great
because it also I'm gonna say this one
more time
since we're running that time in two
minutes here you got to say Express dot
js2 enter the giveaway
honey basically is an automatic coupon
and promo code so if I was buying pizza
basically I would click this honey tab
it would pop up with like a low link
here it would run through 10 or 12
different promo codes that were current
and it would get me the cheapest price I
don't know what these are these came
with it uh here I forget what this is
for course this will
issues for when doing development where
you have cross-origin requests which
basically sometimes happens so we have
Ajax calls with the server's deny it
and so this overrides it this is for
your Chrome this basically lets me know
when I shop if Amazon has a cheaper
price too buddy is a YouTube tool the

next giveaway uh it's uh
happy Sunday guys I didn't know I didn't
know I was gonna be doing this today I
uh I uh I woke up and I I was surprised
with the pleasantly surprised by Brad
from Traverse e-media if you guys aren't
familiar with him I highly suggest you
go check out his channel especially if
you're interested in web development and
at the end of the day I know yeah point
Billy don't don't worry even though you
got dumped on you're still eligible to
win from there so don't sweat it boy
below hang around you're you still you
still can win the only people who can't
win or people who get technical courses
so um we got three more chances plus a
bonus one are Brad and my friends uh I
mean I wouldn't say we're friends no I
would say that we're colleagues to
degree and we we enjoy each other's
content and respect each other I think
I'd probably be the the best explanation
I've never been like on a phone call
with Brad or anything like that
but he's definitely somebody I look up
to and I wish I could be half the
developer he is and he's you know he's
grinding it out to the the best of his
ability and doing his thing and I'm uh
I'm happy to see see how successful he's
doing it's nice to see channels grow
that you're a fan of right so like in my
case I've been watching I've been
watching what's going on here let's go
ahead and I've been watching traversing
medias issues that like 30,000
subscribers and I think he's on at like
150 now and it's been like maybe six
months or something he's so he's
skyrocketing
here's an app clean off the poop don't
take the napkin from Javier he already
wiped his face with the poop on it so uh
yeah Brad is Brad is doing amazing he's
uh for someone who is looking to put out
some more detailed tutorials one thing I
haven't done too many of is like you
know learn JavaScript in 60 minutes
learn jQuery in 60 minutes or learn this
like you know a sort of detailed
tutorial going over a framework or a
library or a language and he's kind of
inspired me to to take that to actually
go and do that and I'll probably follow
a little little bit of his uh his
PowerPoint swag I like that it's
something that I like when I go through
and it has sort of a five to ten minute
build up depending on the tutorial and
so you know I'm gonna I'm gonna imitate
some of that still put my own Flair on
it and whatnot and at the end of the day
will be my own content but I do like I
you know I watched I said you know I
like that PowerPoint thing that he's
doing is like I like the sort of
breaking down in the history or the
background of what you're going to be
learning so yeah I'm just a big fan be
honest um yeah I I use his his sort of
crash courses to get up and running for
roles and stuff like that Freight
favorite coding snack caffeine so uh
caffeine or whatever is free yeah have
you thought about collaborations with
him or other creators I've collaborated
with a few creators where I've had them
on my channel the interview because I
like interviewing developers in terms of
collaborating it's kind of it's kind of
hard I I know that's a lot uh by and
large a lot of even though it's got it
sounds kind of counterintuitive right so
even though a lot of us are like like
right now like I'm on the internet I'm
live I'm you know we got 47 people
watching me talk about whatever and
pooping on people and so you would think
that most of us
aren't introverts but the case is that
we are introverts there's just certain
aspects that that we feel more
comfortable interacting with right I'm
probably one of the more social coding
channels out there so but not
everybody's like that so Chris Hawkes is
one of those one of those developers who
who aren't about you know collaborating
and he kind of he kind of is a little
bit of an introvert and he you know he
expresses it through his channel his his
points of usually doesn't necessarily
want to be aligned with others there's
other people like John salon mez who are
like the exact opposite of introvert I
think but I think he probably has
introvert parts of them I think that a
lot of developers are alright yeah I
mean truth Aska is a female developer in
a male-dominated field are there any
female developers on your team not
directly on my team but on other teams
yes I do I like my new haircut I've had
my hair this short before it's kind of
nice because Florida is kind of hot but
from like an appearance thing it's not
really me I kind of like having a lot
more hair so I'm growing it back out it
just ended up being a miscommunication
with the barber I guess it would be the
nice way I was just saying that this guy
didn't just mess up my hair but yeah I
like collaborating which I was my thing
is I like having people on my channel so
I can pick their brain and no one has
asked me to be on their channel for the
most part I've been on like to other
people's channels I want people to ask
me I don't want to sort of force myself
on two peoples channel like so if like
Brad wanted me on his channel I'll be
happy if Chris Hawks won't manage trying
to be happy - if a simple programmer
wanted me on their channel be happy to
like I enjoy YouTube and so I would love
that
who is your first shooter or youtuber
you learn to code my first tutor I'm not
really had any tutors when I sort of
learning to code
but I did hire some after I already had
a role when I wanted to to learn
something quicker if you go to a quick
shout out to the homie Steven my you if
you're familiar with some of his
tutorials on free code camp you might
recognize the name but if you go to the
best j/s com
I've hired Steven a couple times in the
past and I've interviewed him a couple
times on the channel and whenever I need
to learn the topic in about an hour I'll
hire him for an hour and have them go
over that so thoughts on asp.net core I
think there's a lot of money in c-sharp
and net and all that I serve stuff so I
don't think it's a bad thing to learn
yeah I can I can throw up traversing
medias channel in the description see
here on your first shooter hey what it
do baby
all right if you refresh the video will
be in the description did you take any
of Brad's udemy courses so yeah I'm 90%
through his angular front to back I also
have his bootstrap and now it's note
course so I'll be finishing up today the
angular for front to back course and
I'll also be starting next to bootstrap
for course cuz we use bootstrap for and
I just need to be more familiar with
this specifically the Flex design so
I'll be doing that I also I'm very
excited because he has one portfolio on
there that looks really great and I
haven't gone out of my way to make my
own custom portfolio Thank You Norah I
try to answer as many questions as I can
so that I can I can help you guys out
and cuz I know I know that when I had
questions I had very little to no one to
ask them to and so a lot of times you
get just a little bit of Direction right
you're going this way and say just go
this way that can make make you 50
percent more effective or motivate you
or whatever it is so I I try to do my
best to help you guys on whatever way I
can

many courses as a form of
procrastination I I'm supposing MC
Ronald you're talking about like udemy

blood lean email por favor please the
emails do i watch the coding train no
I'm subbed to it I I just don't have a
have the time to watch it be honest I
watched so many coding channel so it's
hard to watch them all I'm aware of it
though guys killin it also
alright blood lean thank you for that so
it's 10:17 we'll do the next one at
10:25
alright that's fun we're all everything
patched up with April what do you mean
everything patched up we're good man I
took her to Universal Studios yesterday
we went and saw like the hogwarts area
it's just expensive down here man
so hundred sixty-five dollars a person
not to mention the money you actually
spend getting down there and in the park
and everything huh so yeah that was kind
of uh I've been studying and working for
so long I haven't been able to do much
of anything with April and so I told her
I'd take her work to Universal Studios
that's kind of a thank you for putting
up with me
don't spend that much time together
mm-hmm
and and so it's because I I'm I'm always
working and studying and doing all the
stuff I need to do very career-focused
right now and so like on the weekends
I'm doing this right I'm doing I'm doing
YouTube I'm doing podcasts I'm doing
interviews I'm doing studying I'm doing
projects side projects all that stuff
uh yeah David so I'm kind of in the same
boat it's not as bad but on occasion it
gets it gets frustrating it gets awful I
hate I hate that you know I mean like I
hate being on the side of of life where
here you are getting your together
and you're not doing it like all you're
doing is positive stuff right you're
working towards a better future and
meanwhile it's like you know spend
enough time with me it's like it'll be
plenty of time when we have a mortgage
and we have rental payments and residual
income and my career is steady and all
that stuff so I hate that I hate that
that's even in our conversation but it
is so I I totally get it
wish I were first angular for nodejs uh
well it kind of fence where you're at in
life angular for is great for the front
end node is great for the backbone it's
the only woman in this holster I'd spoil
your woman no matter how much they
give you statistically speaking with 37
viewers there is three women in here so
do you think PHP is still language you
should learn I know a lot of workplaces
have PHP I'm not a fan of it I really do
not like it I think but there are a lot
of jobs in PHP so all right um I mean
that's that's the truth of the matter
yeh highwayman yeah shout out to our
fellow Tampa Bay ones out there so I
know that when I would get recruiters
reaching out to me even though I was
already working in PHP and I'd be easier
to get a role in PHP I would tell them
all the time I don't want PHP role stuff
sending me PHP roles and I'm as
just as the cold honest truth
did I do cs50 I did not I'm familiar
with it
I didn't really see the point of it my
time could be better spent elsewhere to
be honest with you I don't think it's
anything wrong with it just from a
practical standpoint the time it takes
to complete that I can complete three to
four to five courses on udemy and have
it in more practical realistic skill set
although I do encourage people to do it
it's just depends on what you're trying
to get out of it and for me it wasn't
going to accomplish what I wanted do I
use c-sharp not not currently I'm doing
the front-end I've not used CSS great so
oh right now I'm using just the
bootstrap calling grid system but I will
be picking up their own flex boxes
system that they have shout out to our
friends in India should we learn Java
only if you like self-punishment so like
if you really just like beating yourself
up Java is a great language to pick up I
haven't touched CSS grid yet I think I
saw a brad release a little crash course
on it maybe like a little project in it
so uh why don't you like PHP well I've
worked in node and I could tell you that
it's just much better than that PHP is
one of those very wonky languages where
you have to write a lot of code to do
the same thing and there's a lot of
steps along the way to do the same thing
that you could do a node and and at the
end of day get the same result I think
I'm actually going to make a video about
PHP and why I hate it
I would say those people who like PHP or
people have been working in PHP for like
10 years plus and that they've always
been doing in so you have a lot of
projects architected in PHP letter
because because that is what they've
known and they've devoted that time and
energy to that so it's more
understandable why they like PHP because
I've devoted 10 years to PHP now
anybody's trying to pick PHP from
scratch the things and this is just from
a very I mean I've only worked in PHP
for about the last nine months and I
worked with the CakePHP framework I
could tell you even with the cakephp
framework you had to write a lot of code
to do this basic stuff that you should
that you can do and very easily and note
and express
well PHP isn't a database it's just a
back-end so traditionally speaking PHP
goes with my sequel and so PHP is back
in that can connects to the database
which is my sequel and the alternatives
that would be a node Express application
for your your back-end / routing and
then the database would be MongoDB /
Mongoose and I can tell you having built
a couple applications than MongoDB and
Mongoose the same application to be
built in PHP is realistically three to
four times more complex then then a node
expressed MongoDB among this application
so and other than that knows it more
complex it's also it's also a separate
language so one of the cool things about
full section of script is it is in fact
full stack JavaScript you can go from
the front-end JavaScript to the backend
JavaScript to the database JavaScript
you have to learn some conventions and
things like that but it is not a
transition so that I mean that's and by
the way speaking of full sector officer
that's the exact course that we're
giving away right so not only is there a
is it node Express MongoDB mongoose all
the things that you can build full I'm
sure there's a front end of it that's
using I
vanilla Jas jQuery angular react so I
mean that that's the thing and PHP as a
language doesn't do nearly what
JavaScript does so not only can you get
better at JavaScript having a JavaScript
back in a database PHP is just used for
routing it's very I mean for the most
part it's only used to routing sometimes
you can do the front-end with it but not
really
and then I don't believe there's a PHP
database so not not only can you do
front-end back-end database you can also
build build desktop applications you can
build mobile applications all in
JavaScript so you kind of benefit in
that fact I mean unless you guys know
about a PHP mobile hybrid application
I'm not aware of
all right guys uh it is indeed that time
my friends where we need to give you
guys some stuff so our fourth giveaway
now this what do we want to give you
guys for a fourth giveaway I'm gonna
make it easy on you I don't know why the
chat isn't available it's gonna refresh
this real quick huh well that ain't good
hey where is works question mark let's
see if this actually will work it's not
detecting the chat so I'm thinking that
this might not detect the chat if that's
the case I'll just give away three
courses in the comments
oh no that's working okay so as long as
you're saying works question mark yeah
it's adding people cool so works
question mark it will work the chats
just not being displayed excellent
so similar to how our and we're gonna
give everyone until 10:30 for this works
question mark not excellent
apart exclamation-point works question
market will enter you into the giveaway
so yeah I'm not about to start debugging
their site Edward well yes I mean that's
kind of my stance on PHP now people
people tend to disagree and I tend to
think they're wrong and there are people
that I respect like code course you who
does nothing but PHP but I can just tell
you from a very practical standpoint the
learning curve on PHP is significantly
greater then it should be shy learn
angular react both are good choices I
would say definitely if you are going to
learn that don't just go down the fool
I'm just full self studying around and
what I mean by that is just like
watching YouTube chores and trying to
build your own projects I would say
definitely buy a course or a video
tutorial or a nano degree or something
to help with that because the reason for
it is a lot of these a lot of these
libraries or frameworks they they check
they are changing very rapidly right now
and so a lot of the little tools you use
and stuff like that it's uh it's it's
it's changing alright so the key word is
works I'm gonna go use the restroom real
quick and I'll get back we'll do the
giveaway
alright ladies and gentlemen the keyword
is works question mark um what is Brad's
youtube channel he should be in the
description if you if it's not there
just refresh your page you'll be there
alright uh what did I miss
all right guys here we go
so I actually want to get back to
studying can you scroll this to see if
we're there
alright the people who aren't there are
Patrick Hickey Mac dude 2020 Edward
Woolery I think Dan Edward already went
and then crazy programmer um okay so uh
as much as I want to give you guys salt
let me tell you that's about 50% of my
existence on the youtubes get make
people salty
I want to get back to studying so what
we're gonna do right now is we're gonna
do two roles and these are going to be
our last two giveaways and I want to
make sure that that we knock this off so
there won't be any more poop there won't
be any more egg Flint there won't be any
more salt these are gonna be it's the
real deal
right now all right it's game day you
need to channel you need to you know
channel your energy prey to the coding
gods
these next two are you if they're not
don't forget that in the comment below
section below when this video goes up
we'll say the keyword is let's just keep
it as salt I like salt and we haven't
given out enough salt today so the key
word will be salt give us a give us a
comment about something you're salty
about in your life and that'll make you
eligible for to win a course and then
one of the reason I'm doing this also is
is I want to pray to me I am just one
coating God you made praise to the
coding gods above me that the Traverse
the media's of the world the Chris
Hawkes the stack overflows
so one thing I'll do is I'll take about
15 to 20 minutes after these next you
giveaway so for those of you want me to
ask questions there to answer some
questions and and talk about a few
things I will so let's go ahead and see
who our first active ways will give
everyone to one more minute the key word
is works question mark that's the key
word we're giving until 10:35 times up
look if you tilt ed 36 that wasn't
really a full minute but uh by the way
your boy stood in line for about thirty
minutes at a Walmart yesterday and
picked himself up a Super Nintendo
classic it's it's as if the coding gods
answered my prayers
about what I needed to reward myself for
coding all day and and I I can enjoy
Super Mario RPG
once again and I can enjoy Final Fantasy
three once again The Legend of Zelda
once again Secret of Mana once again the
only game that I really wish was on the
Super Nintendo classic that isn't and
there's a lot of great games list Super
Nintendo it's an amazing console but
Chrono Trigger Chrono Trigger should
have been on there and it's sad that's
not but you know I don't play too many

got the PlayStation 4 pro I couldn't
tell you the difference is you're
supposed to run a little faster it's
gonna have a little bit of a better
graphics card but also I mean I have a
PC I just I prefer gaming on a console
because I like stepping away from the PC
and I like sitting down in like the in a
living room and sort of be it's a little
bit more social right in my office I'm
kind of got doors closed and and you
know in the in the living room you're
kind of interacting a little bit you can
pause it right and you're kind of going
about your day slightly different so
it's just one of those things where I
try and go out there and it it's a it's
a different experience for me I have a
PC that's I have a top line PC that can
handle any game I got it with a that I
that I would want to play you know it's
got GT X 1080 TI in it it's got a SSD an
eight-core 4.4 gigahertz processor and
all basically and you know I've I have a
a VR system the HTC vive so I can play
games on the PC I actually prefer to
play on the console though I don't play
play that often I actually prefer
playing older games which is why I like
I was so excited when snez Classic got
announced so basically my PC is really
just for work I have a ton of games
especially now that I've been partnering
up with humble bundle
every time when those humble bundles
come out I get the games because I'm
promoting them and they want me to have
them they want me to play them and so I
have probably 60 games I haven't claimed
coke added me a free cup camp free code
camp every time that should be a good
video I actually get that question a lot
if you guys have any topics I would I
would I would that you want me to talk
about now it's a good time suggest some
yeah link to the past is gonna be fun on
there for me the long game is the chrono
excuse me the Super Mario RPG if you've
never played if you're RPG fan and
you've never played Super Mario RPG I
would say that it goes in one of the top
10 best RPGs of all time and I it's if
you're a fan of Kingdom Hearts
specifically and you like that they've
basically taken characters that you grew
up in your childhood and and made a game
out of it Super Mario RPG kind of did
that right they they took they took a
RPG category and they invested Super
Mario characters it's kind of kind of
interesting why not a Mac I've always
been on Windows I've never had to go on
go get a Mac so how much is this nest
this nest is $90 so for that 90 you get
22 games and you get two controllers the
most stressful thing of working as a
full-time dev I think it depends on your
job I have always been with the
mentality that I don't take on stressful
jobs I I understand that the like there
was a role that I could have taken out
of out of at a very large financial
company that would have paid me $15,000
more um but I could instantly tell that
not only would the job be more stressful
the people there seemed unhappy and then
I'd be working more hours so I decided
to turn it down
that one was also contract to hire so it
wasn't just a money thing but even if it
was a equaled equal salaried role versus
contract to hire I probably I probably
would have turned it down all the same
because I am a believer that you want to
be first off you have to understand
where your goals are at right and what
you're trying to accomplish for me I'm
trying to find a company I want to work
myself up with one of my goals is to be
promoted I've never been promoted I've
never well I've really only entered the
workforce three or four years ago as a
as a career professional before then we
had jobs right but I've never been
promoted
partly because I sort of jumping jobs
and and evolving my career but that's
one of my goals at my current workplaces
I want to be there for five years and I
want to grow within the company and work
my way up and so that's kind of where
where I'm at so most stressful thing is
basically what what it depends on the
workplace so I'm trying to say what is
it what is it cats over here complaining
what code editor serious I use Visual
Studio code I'm a big fan of it buddy
buddy he's trying to work over here come
here
oh how can you keep a girlfriend and be
a dev it's a lot easier when you start
making more money have to sound not to
sound that that that's what it's all
about but uh I think when you're
actually paying the bills with being a
developer and your take and you're able
to you know put food in the fridge and
pay rent which isn't something that we
were able always able to do it becomes a
little bit more understanding why you're
studying and working all the time
am I going to get Kingdom Hearts 3 when
it comes out 2018 I am indeed I
definitely am I'm a big Kingdom Hearts
fan what do I do before you're a
developer I was a very unhappy student
that just basically worked part-time
jobs delivering pizzas I had a really
cool job working for this this company
called my home vineyard and basically
what we did was we installed wine
vineyards for like people's houses and
so it's like a physical labour job and
that's pretty cool
I like that job a lot but mainly it was
just jumping around trying to side what
it is that we're trying to accomplish
and go and go from there at some point
in time I wanted to be a that might be a
good develop what was I doing before I
was a developer video topic but
basically just trying to figure out life
right this is a question I got in a
recent interview where they were like
what were you doing before these last
four years cuz I'm 30 right if I went
straight and I I did for the most part
go straight from from high school to
college and just kind of bounced around
between careers and part-time and took
some semesters off here there I never
really wanted to go to college I thought
I don't know that I thought that there's
a better way but I just didn't want to
go I present really thinking too much
about anything but so for me at some
point in time I wanted to be a poker
dealer at some point in time I want it
to be a a firefighter EMT paramedic at
some point in time I wanted to be an
accountant so and a couple other things
and so my interest varied and eventually
I decided on on software did my youtube
channel did your YouTube channel help
your very course it did I it's something
that shows exactly what a lot of
employers are looking for which is
somebody who's
he's learning and somebody who's
passionate about software I tell you
guys all the time to get a side project
get a side project get a side project I
repeat it over and over and over again
and it will help you get job my first
real job
that was ever salary was as technology
Turner's making forty five thousand
dollars in California which is a lot
living in Los Angeles you know my rent
is about a thousand dollars a month and
living paycheck to paycheck and all that
sir stuff but yeah so I that was my
first real role in that role I got hired
because and at that time I only had five
hundred subscribers on YouTube but that
role specifically they were looking for
somebody to come in and do technical
documentation and that could do video
editing and things like that and that
was for a software company and I took
that and they hired me because I had a
YouTube channel I could show that I had
video editing skills and I was
passionate about software I was kind of
the perfect candidate for the role that
helped me to get my role the previous
role I got they saw some of my projects
they you know they could see that I'm
the type of person they get they kind of
get a warm up to me right they get to
see who is this guy that we're
considering interviewing and they're in
the the unique position where they can
actually research me and not they're
gonna get more than a resume and
LinkedIn they're gonna see who I am
right that maybe the he'll maybe a
future employer will watch this video
and see you know how does this guy have
communication skills is he comfortable
assists somebody I can see myself
working with right so yeah it's
definitely helping me would you say Adam
is good for beginners I think I think
you don't need to really worry about
text editors uh to be honest I would say
visual studio code is my favorite I
think it has a great UI and it's not as
buggy as Adam has been for me for larger
projects thoughts on Django I don't
really have one
better solution for clickable custom map
I probably would just use the Google
Google charts API they have a clickable
map on there that you can use John but
it's not customized I mean you can
customize the various options and
attributes but in terms of it being like
Bill from the ground up now you just
sent me to exercise this on free code
camp is that good I would say it's good
that you're coding every day and
hopefully you'll continue to do that I
would also say try not to compare
yourself too much to others people go
down this very weird rabbit hole where
they try to look objectively at where
somebody is and what their quit
it's very easy to be unhappy with your
progress right so like like you did 72
exercises on free cocaine but that's
good for where you're probably at now if
you were to take that and compare
yourself to where I'm at in my in my
life and in my career it would be
probably be very easy for someone just
learning code say oh my god I'm nowhere
near this guy right and it would be very
easy for me to go and say look look at
Brad man Brad knows all these libraries
or frameworks and make such great
details you can pick this stuff up so
quick and I you know I'm just a useless
poop pile right and so be careful when
you start comparing yourself to where
other people are and people did this a
lot with the reason I made the video
about are you too old to code it's
because people often ask me how old I am
and the reason they do that is they want
to sort of figure out where they are in
their life based off where I'm at and
not everyone does it's not a good
practice because when you're straying
that's trying to steamroll through this
to get to where you want to be it's like
I understand not wanting to be where
yeah I'm not where I want to be I'm much
better
then I've ever been but not where I want
to be right so my advice is just to
continue moving forward and and do what
you can did I finish all free cooking
before getting my first job I did not I
was about 75% or 80% of the way through
the front end certificate can I ask you
do you use github in your workplaces
serious question I see on your getup
they haven't made commits in like a
month
so my github is my public get up there
are other repositories that you use via
get get being the language or the tool
github is a specific instance where you
use your tool where you use that for
version control but yet so I'm using it
elsewhere
daemon you missed out on your chance to
win Damon's here Damian where were you
when you won of course oh my god Damon
Damon you must have stepped away did
Damon my man we gave you 90 seconds to
respond back he didn't respond back but
here I see you in chats saying peace out
a town down you know saying and so Damon
Damon Damon Damon
all right guys yeah any last questions
before I take off I got about five more
minutes before I want to go finish up
this angular for front to back course so
I like that I like to end my live
streams on on a on a positive note so
did I get my first job through LinkedIn
indeed com personal connection I got it
through LinkedIn or zip recruit I don't
remember the exact one
it was just applying for jobs like I did
like everybody else I didn't know
anybody in Florida I'm originally from
Los Angeles California and so I applied
to give away so we already gave away
five courses if you want to I'll say
this one last time before I hand on my
final thought if you want to be entered
in four
the bonus giveaway all you gotta do when
this video goes down is comment and with
what you're salty about in life just out
a little bit of fun and go from there
and well we'll give I get give it about
a day for that last one so people can
watch the video and apply or enter I
guess so listen let's end our and our
livestream on a on a nice note and I
think this is important so we had just
talked about how dangerous it is to
compare yourself to others and it's not
that there's anything wrong with
comparing yourself to others you just
have to know you have to be willing to
it to be willing to understand what that
means when you do it and some people
aren't aren't mentally mature enough to
handle that you're not where you want to
be right and I I this is something that
I've struggled with probably up until
three years ago when I started changing
my life to the for the better right
when I wanted to I said look I'm not
happy with school I'm not happy with
being broke all the time how can I
change it and then I eliminated
distractions I stopped gaming I I
focused I stopped watching television I
got rid of my TV I sure focus on other
things and it would've been very easy
for me and other people to look at the
people who are successful and were able
to to do things that I was unable to
accomplish and say you know I'm just a
piece of and I'm an idiot and all
that sort of stuff but it is okay to
compare yourself to others to see what
you can become just don't get down on
yourself when you do that a lot of times
people when they're comparing themselves
to others they're trying oh look how
much progress he's made or she's made
and how little I've made and they give
up and they get frustrated I would say
when you are comparing yourself to
others be inspired by that in a attempt
to overcome that my goal I have a lot of
goals and one of them is to just be the
best developer I can and one of the ways
I do that is I look at how good other
developers are as I mentioned
couple times Brad traversÃ©e given out
the giving us the courses to give away
he's a excellent developer in each spec
he's had many more years experience than
I have and even if we have the same
amount would I be as good of a developer
I'd like to think so
but I don't know my goal is to become
better than him/her and it may be a goal
that never happens but if I keep on
moving and striving in that direction
it's it's it's a good thing and not
necessarily Brad specific I'm not in
this competition with Brad I'm just
trying to use him as an example there's
plenty of developers that I work with
professionally and that I have worked
with professionally where I see how how
how they have mastered a language or a
subset of a language and and from there
they have it inspires me and like it's
like wow you're so good you're so much
better than me it's inspires me to say
wow it's amazing how far I can go and
grow and I'll seen somebody like that so
it's okay to compare yourself to other
people but you have to be careful when
you do and understand that it's not
necessarily a competition and that
you're just where you're at and that's
okay and you're trying to get better and
so as long as you understand that when
you're comparing yourself to other
people I think you'll do much better so
don't fall in the trap of of comparing
yourself and then getting down on
yourself because it's really easy to do
so uh thank you all for watching and we
did give away five courses of the nodejs
from devs deployment including Express
MongoDB Mongoose and for the last time
if you want to be the the bonus giveaway
for the sixth giveaway all you gotta do
when this video ends its comment on the
video tell me what you're salty about in
life you'll be entering in about 24
hours from now you will win of course
alright one quick question before I go
what is it ash
I'm currently in an internship 40 hours
per week so I still study a bit of my
free time or as the 40 hours enough
don't wanna burn out
you should probably study something
different in your free time or go to
meetups or you know anything like that
start a side project if you don't have a
side project that you definitely need to
have one what's your opinion of the best
freelancing website for beginners I
don't think you should be freelancing as
a beginner you can pick up a lot of bad
habits you're not going to grow as fast
as possible my best advice for you is to
try and get a in-house role and learn
from there that's that's my advice when
it comes to freelancing or contract work
like remote contract work for for
beginning developers I think you'd lose
out on a lot of things and I think it's
you're also +5 in uphill battle but yeah
guys thank you so much for watching
don't forget to comment like subscribe
or share and to the five winners you
will be receiving your course in about
the next five to ten minutes I'll see
you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
