student becomes the teacher as you can
see I've started it and I really
struggled with student becomes the
teacher I'm not quite sure why but I'm
going to start fresh I didn't want to
put up a 45 minute video in something
that should have been 15 and so we'll be
resetting a little bit of the code here
I don't know why it took me so long
maybe I was just having an off day and
it's been about five days since I've
messed with it but you know let's get
started with it we're gonna go back to
the beginning alright so if you remember
correctly we're going to be making
dictionaries so they have a good example
here of animal sounds so we're basically
going to be creating a lloyd equals
dictionary and we're going to create a
creating an ALICE dictionary and we're
going to make sure that these were
working with Python now so you can see
my indentation is already dropping the
ball so make sure you do the same thing
here so we have a tiler equals alright
and in there we're going to give them
each a name key homework quizzes and
tests and the name key should be the
name of the students so let's see here
we're going to have name and then this
is going to be : actually I don't think
we need that I think we can just do it
like this so so many quotations that
it's going to be Lloyd and then comma
and then we're going to be doing a
homework
all right and the other ones are going
to be empty lists comma and then we're
going to be doing quizzes and then the
last one is going to be test and in the
interest of time we're going to copy
pasta this into the other dictionaries
and we have Alice and we have Tyler so
let's see if this worked I may need to
put empty spaces cool
so we have a name and then we have lloyd
so something's going on here with our
quotes let's see if that fixes it your
code through a global variable named
Lloyd Lloyd is not defined homework
comma
let's go back to the way we had it and
then do brackets and do brackets let's
see if that fixes it line 5 tests
don't forget our : Oh
all right so to do the empty to keep
them empty make sure you put some
brackets or some spaces or something so
we'll use the brackets because we're
going to have multiple quizzes and tests
and there we go so we've set up our
three dictionaries so now we want to
fill up these empty excuse me these
empty homework quizzes and tests so we
have ninety point Oh ninety-seven point
o 75 point O and 92 point O same thing
with quizzes eighty-eight point oh four
two point forty point O and ninety-four
point O and then our two tests
seventy-five point O and ninety point O
and thankfully they filled out the other
ones good to go
so we now want to create a list called
students that stores the data of let's
see here
Lloyd Alice Tyler so there we go so this
is basically storing we're creating a
list that stores these three
dictionaries alright and now we want to
create a for loop that prints out the
students data as follows so for I and
students
: and I is Lloyd Alison Tyler in this
case we want to say aye aye
Oh we want to print aye
and then name print aye
and then homework and guys quick
household thing alright so we are
printing out the student the individual
student homework and we gotta do the
same thing for quizzes for an eye and
then quizzes and then we have to print
eye tests and I believe this should work
and there you go so it's iterating
through starting with Lloyd than Alice
and Tyler and it's giving us all our
values cool so what are we doing here so
we need to let's make sure cut that out
we need to get class average so we're
going to define a function so remember
def get underscore class underscore
average and it takes one argument
students now what you can expect
students for your list containing three
students first make an empty list called
results so alright so we'll say results
equal and then an empty list for each
them in the class let's calculate get
average student so this is something oh
it looks like we jumped we jump sum here
so I'm sorry about that so I was like
wow this looks a little bit much
okay so we did for the record save
submit and now we go on to number five
it's okay to be average so write a
function called average so def average
that has one argument numbers so this is
going to take in numbers inside the
function called the built in sum
function with the numbers list as a
parameter so if you look above this kind
of shows you what's going on here so
what I meant to do built in some
function with numbers start exalt in a
variable total so we'll say total is
equal to the sum numbers total equals
total plus some numbers like the example
of use float for total and start the
result in total so we will have float
I use this as primitives function like
the example above float total and store
the result in total subtotal equals
slope total and then divide total by the
lengths of numbers total divided by Ln
of total and then return total let's see
if that works
oops Sarah saw average so try an average
through L result in Harry local variable
total reference before assignment all
right so let's see what's going real set
total equal to zero say I'm just uh
object to float has no length
I see what we're doing around here so
total is just equal to some numbers and
we don't need to do it like that
also this I believe is correct but we
forgot to actually set total so total is
equal to the numbers the sum of the
numbers then we're going to float it so
it becomes a decimal properly and then
we are going to say length and that
should be it right there object a float
has no length oh and this needs to be
numbers so because it's not the length
of total total is just one number in
this case add numbers is multiple
numbers okay so let's copy this goes
even now after doing this up study some
I'm struggling with it a little bit so
we want to be able to take a look at it
if we get stuck so define a function
called get underscore average that takes
a student dictionary and its input and
so we'll say student s what it says
there make it make a variable homework
that starts average so we'll say a
homework is equal to our average
function of the student homework so
repeat step two and four quizzes and
tests so we'll have quizzes equal
average student and then in here we have
quizzes and then make sure you spell
things right and then we have tests
multiply the three averages by their
rate and return the sum of those three
all right so it says right here that
these are weighted different so let's do
this we want to multiply that so
homework is 10% by 0.1 zero is is our 30
cent 30 percent so point three zero and
the remainder is 60 percent so time is
one point six and then we want to return
homework plus quizzes plus tests all
right there seems to be something on the
console all right so it looks like we
forgot a bracket here and bam we're good
to go we don't actually we just know
it's working because it's telling us
it's working but we haven't actually
messed with it yet so so let's go ahead
and copy this real quick so that we can
reference back if we need to so def get
letter grade all right so it looks like
now we're going to be taking in a
parameter score and in here we're going
to be writing some if L if and else
statements so there's a couple ways we
can do this earlier when I did this I do
remember that they wanted you to do it
in the order of if I did it I'd slightly
different way with that would have
worked the same results but because
we're using code Kadim II just do it the
way they want otherwise it won't work so
we're going to start with if so we're
going to say if score is greater than or
equal to 90 returned and a grade and
we're going to L if the reason we do LF
and said just if is we just did if it
would and you got a 90 you'd get a a a
BSc ID
but Elif BAM good to go like you don't
you only do it if the one before it
didn't work so now so score is greater
than or equal to 80 and that the reason
that we can do greater than or equal to
80 and not greater than equal to 80 but
less than 90 is because we're using Elif
so that's how I did it before but this
is how they want you to do it so this is
the in theory this this is probably
supposed to be easier and then we're
going to turn to see I seem to be using
a standard grading scale and here we
return D and then this is right no this
is wrong so 60 and then else if it's
anything else for turn F and then
finally it asks us it asks us to call
the function so get underscore a letter
and it's for grade and we're going to
call it on Lloyd it looks like
so syntax error return D looks like I
forgot a bracket let's run it one more
time else forgot a colon
there you go and for whatever reason it
doesn't return a little grade so let's
try that one more time see what's going
on here
so I don't know why doesn't return it I
guess it returns it but doesn't print it
so let's try Wow whatever it works
that's all that matters right now
alright so we are going to get class
average get letter grade what are we
what are we adding here so I can make
sure we don't stumble
oh this is where I started last time
okay cool so we're back to where I was
at so you can see that we have quite a
bit of code here we're going to actually
for the sake of space and convenience
we'll be doing it right here instead of
at the bottom like I normally would so
we're getting we're going to define one
that's called get class average it's
going to take it one argument students
in this students you can expect students
first make an empty list called results
so remember results equal empty for each
student so for I in students for each
student in the class list calculate get
average student get underscore average
underscore student and then remember
that the student in this case is I
because we're getting them from our
students list and then call results that
append with the results finally returns
the result and then so we get that then
we want to the results dot append
actually I think we can throw this in
here so there's no need to do it like
that so that should work and finally we
want to break
oops break out of our for loop here and
in it we want to return the result of
calling average with results then we'll
say results equals average results and
then return results let's see if that
works
all right so we have to call it actually
so let's get rid of the get letter grade
Lloyd
finally returned the results so right so
we want to say def excuse me
so we're going to say students is equal
to Lloyd Alice Tyler and then we want to
call get under start class underscore
average with students
did I spell this wrong get-get class
average good average student is not
defined Oh get average let's see if this
is what our mistake was damn so that's
good to go
it seems to be working just fine and
finally we need to print out the result
of gate class average from your students
list so let's go ahead and print this
your student should be Lloyd Alyson
Tyler and then print also get underscore
letter i underscore grade on students
the front of the result of gate letter
grade okay so what we want to do here is
just kind of loop these functions a
little bit so the first one that we're
going to print here is going to be the
class average and so we want to take
this just go ahead and copy this and we
want to get letter grade so we're going
to call get underscore a letter
underscore grade and it's going to get
its number from our get class average
students function and bam so 83% is the
average and with a B being the average
grade here so pretty good class probably
I'm at I would say 83 almost 84 percent
it's pretty solid so in the next five on
video what we'll be doing is lists and
functions so we'll be working a little
bit with what we did there and just
taking it to the next level probably and
I'll see you guys in the next video and
as always questions and comments are
appreciated and if there's ever anything
even not Python related coding wise that
you're interested in that you need a
question answered go ahead and leave me
a comment below and if I can I'll make a
video about it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
