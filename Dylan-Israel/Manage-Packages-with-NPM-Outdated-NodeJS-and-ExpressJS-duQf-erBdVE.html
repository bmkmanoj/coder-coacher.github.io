in two-man factitious with NPM we are
doing outdated right now let's go ahead
and jump into outdated now that's um now
that we have some dependencies and you
learned that your own packages can be
updated easily the obvious question is
what do you do when someone else updates
their package the first step is to
detect this because of the way we define
our dependencies with a version range so
remember the version is basically
different iterations of our application
that maybe have different features or
change features and each release is
known we can detect compatible releases
programmatically programmatic matically
with NPM outdated so let's go ahead and
do that so you'll see right now that our
Lin Clark package is in current version
1.02 we want it to be 1.0 3 and our
latest is one point zero point three so
let's see here how - to verify and in
the package so our package that we want
to verify is at when Clark slash pkg not
linked Clark
that is how - to - NPM verify at Lynn
Clark
slash pkg and there we go
it is verified that uh that the package
does not have an update that we were
looking for basically short short video
but just keep in mind the command that
we can use is NPM outdated and it will
show us which packages are currently
outdated but as always guys don't forget
to Like subscribe and share and I will
see you in the next video special thanks
to our sponsor dev Mountain if you're
interested in coding bootcamp why don't
you check them out where they include
housing alongside their tuition so you
can get up go and immerse yourself in
the environment if you want to support
me go over to patreon.com slash coding
tutorials 360 so we can put out more
content thanks
