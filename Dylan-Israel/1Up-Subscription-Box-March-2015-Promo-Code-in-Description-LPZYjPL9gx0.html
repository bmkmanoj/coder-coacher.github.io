1up box I'm really excited about I just
took a look inside and I happen to love
it this month's theme is villain if
you're not familiar at the 1up box is
kind of like nerd block or loot crate
except it's cheaper so it's about a
dollar cheaper than loot crate and I
checked out near Black I haven't ordered
one yet I just thought Luke Wright was
better and cheaper and that's why I went
with so one of the things we do for all
my subscription videos now on I'm going
to have promo codes that are current for
that month so if you do like it there
will be a promo code in the video and of
course click the link in there and it'll
use me as a reference so that I can get
a five dollar credit and that way i can
start keep on reviewing boxes even after
I'm done for three months and whatnot so
um it's exactly like Luke rate except
it's a different company basically it
has gaming it and nerd type of
memorabilia so we're going to talk about
what we got and the first thing I saw at
this box and this is just after this
everything is just bonus as far as I'm
concerned t-shirt you know we got I
actually am wearing this month's loot
crate shirt right now um but uh the 1up
box you got joker drinking a coke and
he's just hahaha in a way and he's happy
about it uh like I said this once team
is villains so very joker related next
thing was kind of cool i was a little
bummed out that it was bent and it's
bent just because the box came into buzz
a cool a link poster so it's bent down
the middle i guess i could just have it
like this and just pretend like it was
never been and it'd be all right but um
all on all it's a cool poster but uh cuz
it's bent is kind of I don't know I if
they would have rolled it up maybe it
would have worked out better but who
knows I got a cool little keychain you
put your own key in there this is a it
goes on a key so you can separate it
from your mailbox or your laundry and
house key I think it's a ghost it's like
a little super mario ghost so it took me
a couple times look at it to really see
what was going on it just kind of looked
like a cloud to me but uh they worked
out Mike loot crate you get a
so it's little Joker this is March wand
and uh everyone loves the pop brand once
and this is a key chain one so you get a
Harley Quinn keychain and this is the
type of stuff I like as I could actually
see myself using it some things are over
the top with these things worth they're
really meant for a younger audience and
for the most part they do have a good
balance and they give something for you
a little bit of us older older nerds and
older geeks but one of the items I
wasn't stoked about was the whoopee
cushion so it's nice I mean I get I
guess but I'll never use it like what am
I gonna leave this around the house for
my girlfriend to sit on it and laugh my
ass off and it was i don't know i don't
even have anyone to give this to so but
i'm sure i'm sure if you're like 10-11
this is kind of cool so I see why they
get that and I did a really or take with
this I was trying to figure this out for
the longest time what this was but
apparently this is a wallet so it's kind
of a lightweight like there's cardboard
there and you put your money in there
and I guess there's a little slot here
and I think you can fold it over and
they have your little evil link uh the
legend of greed wallet so it's got cool
and then of course you get the badass
Darth Vader stickers they didn't have
something with Darth Vader in villain
week I was going to be pretty upset so I
was really excited when I saw this and
as far as sticker goes love stickers you
get her for just brands like a volcom
sticker and it's just like your
advertising for him but at least with
this you get a cool a cool little like
alright cool i have a cool sticker that
doesn't say anything other than i'm a
geek that's all I wanted and similarly
look similar loot crate they have their
own type of thing where tells what's on
there what I thought was kind of
interesting is they don't actually have
this wallet on here so I I was like did
they just throw this in here at the end
I thought more value I don't know but uh
I really like this box a lot and I think
I'm going to after I the next two months
is the same i probably will switch over
from Luke rate not that I had any issues
with Luke rate it's just cheaper it's a
dollar cheaper and it's not you know
it's not that big a deal
and they're both kind of the same thing
to me so I have one more month to Luke
rating two more months of this and two
months on the side of front keep it so
we'll go over real quick what we got we
got a t-shirt BAM we got the Harley
Quinn keychain the wonderful whoopee
cushion the wallet we got the Darth
Vader sticker which is one of the cooler
items i think i would love to have a
couple different star wars' stickers
stickers are pretty cheap so hopefully
maybe next time if they get some good
designs like this keep on keep them
coming we got the little ghost key
protector and the pin and then i don't
know if i reset this but we have the
harley quinn keychain so don't forget to
check the link down below that'll be a
reference a referral code so that i can
give five dollar credit so after i get
two or three or whatever it is i can
keep on reviewing these boxes after the
three months and there's a promo code in
the end up in the comments as well promo
code is awesome and it will save you
three dollars off your first box so it's
only going to be 992 plus shipping so I
hope you guys liked our view of the 1up
box I really liked it and I think I'm
gonna keep it going after these three
months I really I really really like
this first box is a great start</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
