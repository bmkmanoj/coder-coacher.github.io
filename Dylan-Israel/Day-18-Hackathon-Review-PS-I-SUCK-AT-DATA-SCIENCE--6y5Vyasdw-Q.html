an eventful day we move this videos
unlisted so I introduced you a while
back a co-worker of mine let's let's get
let's dive into the full story it sounds
like something good of a story but good
oh me too so like a drama or anything um
so a few weeks back a co-worker of mine
got signed up for a hackathon and then
he bailed cuz his mother's Day weekend
and uh even though I've been giving him
 for about three weeks about it
a jet understandably so I was quite okay
with the even though I was going to
the whole time and so what I decided was
that as part of April's you want to say
curriculum that's part of April's
learning processes I wanted her to
experience a hackathon and we went to
this was a data science hackathon to
give you an idea how much data science I
know I know about as much data science
as my cats know like Oh hit me boy ah
yeah so it's not my field to study but I
thought I would show up and see what I
could do and it turned out I couldn't do
anything he was thinking oh I'll learn
data science in like an hour and vein
yeah but at the very least uh besides
Ganesha yeah besides getting some cool
swag and maybe building something and
unfortunately it became very evident
very self evident when I looked at the
three challenges and I had no idea where
to begin right it was
it's that same moment when you're
looking at the JavaScript algorithm and
you're like looking through the
JavaScript algorithm like you're not
even looking at it trying to solve it
you're looking through it that was how
it really reminded me of
when I first learned to code and it was
terrifying and at the same time um
reminded me of a little bit of imposter
syndrome because I felt like an imposter
a web developer amongst a bunch of data
scientists but on the positive side of
things you got to experience a hackathon
yeah
and we basically this is what happened
as we basically crashed a hackathon I
got a shirt and some swag and we both
got dinner and then we left
oh man so all right what was as as
someone who spent this is day 18 by the
way just let you know since we're sorry
we're almost 20% thing um which I'm very
proud of the progress you've made so far
I guess it's just 18 a lot of people
would tell you that you're doing all
right
the fact that you're we're able to build
your portfolio you're still struggling
with it what you're doing okay um and
you're gonna switch now your focus over
to JavaScript entirely after today okay
I am yes all right but you do not you
get a D you get a D I'll take a D I'll
take it I'll give you the B oh yeah say
um all right um so what was as someone
who's 18 days in and and by the way guys
a lot of a lot of hackathons you go to
are for either college students or for
almost anybody this was one that was
pretty much for professionals apparently
there is a giant convention in Tampa
this weekend and this is like the mini
kickoff to the big kickoff which is why
there was over $10,000 in prizes and fur
crabs which is a lot for hackathon right
um but what was so what would you think
what we let's talk about this what were
you expecting a hackathon to be like
beforehand you know you go
- like what - like the fair and in the
fair is this big hall which is tonzura
no time not like a convention hall
yeah okay so like a convention hall I'm
thinking okay we're going to a
convention hall and there's gonna be a
 ton of people like ten thousand you
know something like that I don't even
like 500 um there's gonna be a big
speakers me like shitty speakers you
know um and you know everyone's gonna
know everyone and I'm gonna feel like I
don't know anyone um
I know kind of kind of like that I guess
that's what I was expecting
okay so you were expecting some sort of
Oktoberfest setting - the beer um okay
it's honestly not too far far from it
except we were at a I believe they are a
security boot camp the security end and
quality assurance boot camp which is
unique in itself and so the boot camp
that we went to area to do the hackathon
that we went to had a military setting
it was all military companies are
companies that worked with the military
in some fashion even my company actually
helped sponsor part of it um but you
know it push me you don't push me over
the edge with the hackathon was when I
got the data set I didn't understand any
of the military terms - this I'm
I'm that put like I already knew it I
already knew I was gonna be stressed out
I already knew I wasn't going to succeed
or compete but once I was unable to once
I was unable to sort I'm like for
understand the abbreviations and
acronyms I gave up as it I gave up I was
out of my element uh instead I decided
to promote my time working on my the
skills that I have which love
but what what what so what do you think
now we talked about what you were
expecting what what are your from the we
spent about what two hours there maybe
between food what it what was your
takeaways of the hackathon um everyone's
a lot nicer than I thought they would be
uh yeah everyone did know each other so
I was right about that a lot God
nicknames for each other talking about
each other's like oh did you get that
email and it's like everybody knows
everyone here this is great um so but it
was smaller obviously way smaller than I
expected um and this was a large
hackathon by the way I would say there's
probably about a hundred applicants and
that's large yeah that's large for a
hackathon yeah so there's 100 so I don't
know if that like made it worse or
better um towards the end I was feeling
much more comfortable I didn't think
that I was going to talk to anyone
because I didn't think that I was going
to have anything to say just because I'm
so new but everyone was really
interested they're like are you are you
participating are you like what are you
doing what do you do or where you at you
know they had lots of questions for me
because I was like I'm new I know I have
a CSS like what what are you doing we
working on yeah how do you feel you know
where did where do you plan to go you
know yeah yeah it had nothing to do with
you being a girl what is this I had
everything to do I was like one of three
girls there and two of them worked there
all right like oh by the yes there is
two girls one girl brought a pillow like
I'll like damn this girl is ready to go
like she's she's doing it and the other
girl she is she's like she opened up her
back path she's like look this is my
secret weapon and she had a backpack
full of starbuck double shots I'm like
this girl ain't sleepin so
um but I mean they were they already
knew a couple people there and no one
was like really like chatting them up
like they're chatting me up so it's
funny cuz no one sat at our table when
it was just me and Dylan sitting at the
table but the moment Dylan leaves me I
gotta get food all these guys just sit
down at the table like right I was like
oh hi but um so I mean at least they
weren't like you know creepy that was
and which is one of the things you'll
find out is that the younger generation
of developers are less creepy than the
older ones typically yeah that's not to
say that all older generations are
creepy or anything like that but it well
you have to understand is like just I
don't know software software
developments become more mainstream than
it once was I should say and so you had
back before therefore GUI sir guys doing
code in machine language and
ones and zeros and you had to be a
little special type of dude to do that
um a special type of dude yeah
uh so everyone was really nice um and I
was able to at least kind of understand
what they was saying back to me if they
were talking about code um there was
food there I wasn't expecting that was
just expecting even water excuse me and
energy drinks um the lady who greeted us
who like entered us she was like really
excited I was there she's like oh you're
here okay yeah we're just gonna have to
hang you know she she was like excited
she touched me a few times like not like
you know but she was just like hi you
know like making sure that I felt
comfortable because I think she knew
that I was like one of a few girls here
yeah um so we don't get a lot of women
around these parts okay so all the way
with that like work they're they're
they're they kept asking me though are
you okay you have everything so that was
really nice that uh you know they were
like aware of the idea of what might
have happened or what was going on so
that was really nice of the staff I
appreciate that so it did help overall
for me to feel a little bit more
acclimated I really hope to have Dylan
there just to kind of like lean on have
someone to talk to but I personally
don't really mind being the creepy
person in the corner he doesn't talk to
anyone because that was me in college
like all the time so so I'm kind of used
to that and that was kind of what I was
expecting to do but this actually turned
out to be really cool and I would really
like to go to another hackathon when I
can maybe be more involved why not a
data science one I went to this one to
see what it was about
um and it's too far ahead of where I
needed to be to even compete or get
started I would have had to teach myself
Python or R in that day and a half so
what made the data science art just the
severity of it III I don't know too much
about data science I can query a
database but we're talking about
predictive analysis from five or six
different data sources and and passing
things out with the on a path so we're
talking about geospatial data which
would be with satellite imagery weather
data predictive weather data based off
that weather data predictive sailing
data with that sailing data and a lot of
filtering and that was just one of the
challenges there's three another one was
um sure I don't know it's all right oh
you want to show me stuff but it would
it was yeah so Python isn't assessing
add a slice I'm a web developer by
bitrate so I went there knowing that I
would be I would be at UM not in my
element I didn't realize how far out of
my element I was most good to challenge
yourself where the recruiters they're in
it in effect um you're they're leisurely
be one or two recruiters at these things
especially this was there was there was
a they were obviously looking for data
analysis people yeah but there's a
couple of like older gentleman there
who were like oh yeah I'm looking to see
if there's anyone here they're waiting
for the projects to be completed to see
what potential some of their candidates
that they're looking at yeah there's
there's usually always recruiters or
there's companies there that are looking
to hire and things like that so I always
encourage you to go there and usually
they're like CEOs and stuff like that
like I don't have to answer to anybody
if they're there they're looking to
basically Scout Talent um I was not the
talent today are you so somewhat bit
code asked a very important question of
what is the basic skills to have in a
hackathon and be able to contribute and
not be totally lost so I went today to
find out could I compete and the answer
was no I I don't know anything about
data science and I don't have a I didn't
have a teammate with a background in
data science I went there thinking I
could join a team but everybody was
already like teamed up with their
co-workers and in the past when I've
gone to hackathons there had been a sort
of hey introduce yourself and say what
your skill set is and maybe people will
put you on a team or you'll start your
own team there was nothing like that
everybody there was a professional
opposed to be something like that but it
didn't happen yeah so I knew I was going
to be at a disservice because thank you
so I appreciate that man but um in terms
of what skills
hashtag meeting so in terms of what
skills skills that you need I encourage
you to go and see what the challenges
are but if it's a web development um
hackathon and the also this was a very
specific hackathon for for data sights a
lot of hackathons we'll leave it up to
you to use the there api's or there
endpoints to come up with your own idea
and it has to maybe benefit women or
help children or you know do facilitate
whatever they're trying to do this was a
very specific data sight it's only
hackathon and I couldn't I had nothing
to offer
other than hey I've made your webpage
look pretty yeah yeah so that was the
situation right it's all but in terms of
in terms of what skills that you need I
would if if the challenge uses an API or
it's it's possible to web technology is
the very first one I went to was after I
did the weather API project on free code
camp and I built I can show you my
project actually let me let me pull it
up on LinkedIn I'll show you the exact
project that we made but essentially
what we tried to do what we did was we
made it in jQuery HTML CSS and I think
we use bootstrap in it as well but it's
basically just a standard web
application with the API ah pull my
thing I got I got it on my and by the
way it is on my portfolio portfolio so
projects um C project so this the
project here we built this in a day and
change but essentially what we did was
we took the ESRI API which is a map API
similar to Google Maps and we took the
YouTube API and then we displayed videos
only in the area that matched your
search criteria the idea being that we
are only going to show geo look at
geolocation locally your geo location
your geo locations videos uh and
eventually we would click on a map so
let's say we typed in um I don't know ah
what should we search let's search
hackathon so this in theory is going to
pull up all the videos for a hackathon
based off your geo KITT location locally
and you'll see right here this is where
one video was and show you on the map
where these videos work the idea being
that down the road and you can see that
in Tampa there's a few more we tried to
get cheeky and display on the map using
the angel
icon for bonus points furs for cooking
points but what we this was this is an
example of a project that we made using
jQuery and what the skill set that we
had at that time the end the the pitch
for this was that you want to support
your local content creators for one and
the other one was is imagine that you
actually picked a geolocation you picked
a point on the map and you said Austin
Texas and you wanted only rock music for
videos that were located in Austin Texas
or he only wanted cooking recipes for
enchiladas in in South America so you
click that and it base it off the
selected geolocation we didn't get to
that point cuz all we needed all you
really need is a proof of concept um but
that was that was my hackathon project
that I made last time so if I could have
made something similar this with the
data science I would have stayed and
done it but unfortunately it was way
beyond my capabilities and data science
and I needed to know Python they need to
know our I thought it was going to be
something where I was going to be able
to just put in a database and query it
and display the data in a certain format
it wasn't anything like that it was it
was real-time analytics that constantly
went up and down up and down now I so I
no matter what skill level you're at I
encourage you to go struggle through
maybe you'll meet somebody um and go
from there so um and I wants to know if
she should review a hackathon and I
think you should I think that'd be
really cool um code girl Hannah oh girl
Hannah that sounds like someone's got a
YouTube page let's check out those go
Hannah
it'd be something really interesting to
know
Oh see yeah I don't think there's
anything wrong with it I typically did
you win I we we forfeit
so we got a cookie as about as total in
arias we got umm so I think hacked on
reviews are fun even if you don't win
talked about it gives people an idea I
encourage you all to go to hackathons
even if you don't feel qualified um so J
ginger says hey Dylan Easter boy JH here
I'm kind of stuff out my job hunt could
use some advice for other uh it it
really depends but on what your
situation is and I'd have to look at
your LinkedIn I have to look at your
resume I just spent an hour doing this
with somebody the other day who was
stuck in their job hunt so if you want
to book a session I would be happy to um
to review it but if other than that
other than the stuff I've already put in
my videos its if you too detail-oriented
just to go over right now now Joshua
jokes it's a deal would you do a live
stream where you would review viewers
resumes I know you already gave us yours
to look at but still be nice to have
some live feedback on what we can do to
improve same kind of thing is maybe I'll
do a live stream one day but I what you
could do you could do like a contest
when you reach a certain amount of like
subscribers you know and you can be like
everyone submit their resumes and you
pick five round in one sitting room the
thing is this is more than just your
resume right
it's your resume it's your github it's
your cover letter it's your LinkedIn and
it's your references so there's five
real things that you have to have
looking sharp to be a contender uh but
yeah that that's an idea I would be
happy to um yeah I took I'm not skipping
anything okay that that's really faster
doesn't mean you comprehend anything uh
so do I have anything negative to say
about the hackathon no um the only
negative thing I would have to say is
that they didn't follow their itinerary
which upsets me I don't have anything to
say about that um the only negative
thing ever if you're not gonna do it say
something if you're not gonna do it
didn't even say it they're just like all
right everyone got to know her to tell
her
what's the miss in all my videos extreme
vaping yeah uh it's just an essential
oil diffuser it's something I put on my
desk here you see yeah you you can all
thank me for that
I got him Hut one day when he was really
sick and I said oh this will help you
and he hasn't stopped since yeah um but
yeah so I I just I spent an hour talking
with the individual last week going over
his LinkedIn his cover letter and his
resume and I think if he follows the
advice he'll do alright because he had a
very strong resume but I'll show you
guys this stuff sometimes that they give
away out of hack so yeah yeah so I let's
get back on track on the hackathon talk
so at a hackathon you typically always
get swag you get swag no no this first
one you went to everyone but I've been
excerpt so you get a bag and in this bag
they give you a bunch of actually
there's one good thing that comes with
this bag and it is this awesome textured
textured t-shirt the front and these are
all the companies that max see on their
point out you're coming on all out to so
I'm sorry
so anyways there's all the supporters um
this t-shirt is kind of like a wick away
material so it's it's really nice and
then on top of that look at this get
down with your bad self
they give you a I'm replacing this with
my wood mine I don't even drink notepad
doesn't mean we don't use it we use it
all the time there's coffee we buy that
doesn't come up one time in like six
years I know little sticker it's cute a
lot of wasteful pamphlet things they can
just send you in an email but you know
whatever little hackathon full menu
their little itinerary schedule thing
here that they didn't follow but that's
you know that's alright it's not okay
not my book I'm way to almost some more
stickers from their sponsors what says
secure your future oh so this is what I
was talking about earlier which was a
this is a security boot camp and a
security and what else was it oil baby
oil evade essential oil it's essential
oils um but this is water and essential
oil
what this is is Shakir net is a security
boot camp it's actually pretty long
hairs you wanna it's a 20-week boot camp
full-time wife material oh um and then
let's see open and we're exactly I don't
know what this is mrs. uh more crap they
could have given you into an email
without wasting a tree but hey you know
you think about that alright so we in
card oh oh I don't it is that's kind of
Rin I've never gotten cookies Oreo and
this pen
all right so today we're gonna we've
we're having a short live stream today
because I we we did a field trip today
for staying to the hackathon and and um
just having in the photo yeah there you
go
yeah it is a very Emmet this is this is
a weird this is the weird one did you
show this one off I tried to I want to
see these pens these pens work from like
mm oh I don't know so many of those made
in 2000 but they're like what are
we gonna do with all these pens okay
we'll just load them into giveaway
like let's do that
I'm so sick of seeing these pens I'm
gonna give this to somebody I work the
 for them give it to your friend who
didn't make it to the hack on me like
edge um okay so out there with those
cats why are you in my or you I don't
know it was lemon it's not is it lemon
no you can have it then oh if it's
vanilla I don't wanna do with it yeah
alright so um we're gonna have a short
little session here
where's the smoke it is essential oil
diffuser man we throw things like this
one here Anna data Korea what was the
most common question it would be what is
that smoke Dylan how forward were you
when you first met April Oh extremely
forward so forward it was I wasn't I met
you at Starbucks for a coffee yeah he
deemed me he slid in the DM I did slide
on the dams she was waiting for it
though I was like wait can when he's
messaged me I was like who are you cuz
he wasn't a friend of mine on Facebook
and I didn't talk to anyone that wasn't
a friend slid into the dams and he's
like let's slide in I don't I don't
really go on dates with people cuz that
I
it's really uncomfortable for me so he
he was smart and asking hey let's go get
a coffee you put up so he was miners
like let's go get a cup of coffee I was
like ok I feel comfortable doing coffee
so I did get coffee and you know I he
said to me the first thing that came out
of his mouth when he saw me he's like
I've never had a girl beat me to a place
before and then we just talked from
there and that was our first and last
conversation we've ever had with the
hackathon being military thing what kind
of military thing was it all the data
science was military related and related
to military scenarios yeah that's a good
question though yeah I was it was very
military base but they did leave it open
source so you could technically use any
kind of data that you wanted to so like
the team that was across from us they
decided to do a open source one where
they could find experts and any type of
field that you were looking for for
whether a G and a court case or a
decision-making or anything like that so
what they wanted to do was to be able to
grab data you would like search I'm
looking for an expert in waffles and and
when you search for that that expert
data they would it would circulate
through all the data of the people that
they had queried for and then it would
show you know although it would anyways
it was basically to find people who were
experts in their field yeah we can
David yang I was actually going to do a
video to give an example of a data
science uh axon but if you want to know
what it is right now I'll show you it's
really interesting the data that they
have you and the and the challenges that
they were giving
Oh should I do it again
yeah dad did you be my eyes was into the
DM so we tell the cats um all right so
you guys ask me what the challenges were
for the hackathon um there was three the
one that I thought I had any chance of
doing was the first one that's one we'll
go over and it was at this point I
realized I had no chance um show them
the data here's a scenario of the event
somewhere off the coast of South Korea
is a ship with hostages this will have
to predict where the ship is located
based on off the analysis of incomplete
data AIS satellite imagery but be
careful the weather might throw off your
predictions or block the view of the
satellite you're you'll be provided with
an incomplete set of AIS data of the
target ship location of API for invite
environmental data information wind
currents cloud cover locations of API so
request satellite imagery location of
api's to derive Sabbath satellite
orbital data and so once I went to the
rules to get the data from these five
sources it was at this point that I
realized I don't know how to parse data
like that and I I needed a partner on
how to have one and it's just beyond my
capabilities but that was the easiest
one uh so uh beyond my skill set to to
get there okay so let's uh we've talked
about the hackathon a bit and we are
going to now go back to algorithms so
yesterday stop-stop people are
gonna think you're actually sad I
already think I'm like torturing you're
teaching us to code uh so
yeah it looks like it's going up a bit
code asked do I do lead generation for
lead generation landing pages for your
company I mean for web mental skills to
compliment my pay-per-click skills no I
do not and not that I'm opposed to
learning it but they are opposed to
having it so because of the way the
military industrial complex works you
need to get contracts and you don't want
to you don't want to publicly have your
web applications look like that and we
have we hire marketing companies to
build our corporate websites and things
like that although I've heard it thrown
around that for a future website they
might try and get me to do it
um the loop-the-loop we're talking about
is the for loop that I can't get can
only imagine drill sergeant Dylan I
don't think I was that's the loop we're
talking about I don't think I would know
we haven't finished the loop I don't
think I was a drill sergeant
uh all right so yesterday what we did
was we started reviewing algorithms to
kind of try and get you start thinking
these things out um
 I don't alright I guess we'll do
the first one why can't we just continue
with this long so I can continue to be
totally mystified by the lack of
intelligent knowledge that I have too
friendly for a drill sergeant my nice
guy I don't know a lot you guys know him
better than I do
geez this thing like we never hang out
and we live together I'm living together
doesn't bu hang out I don't have any
friends in Florida you're all right
Christmas maybe I hang out with to you a
little bit that's our buddy all right so
all right enough of this enough we are
going to compendium welcome by the way
congratulations once more on your job
with your 75% pay increase making us
proud your your interview I think is
going up tomorrow the next day I got
shot all right will you why set this up
go fill it up
Kevin welcome welcome tasty
when I left my job and mind you it was
because I wasn't working as a developer
I got a 47% increase in pay and felt
like a baller yeah we maybe you
start fresh you gotta wear this kid just
look at what you got did you put oil in
it
no yeah Manuel sizzling I can't wait to
do it either
that's gonna be so cool I can't wait to
do that one it's my turn hey man yeah
you'll get there uh what's up man great
videos Thank You Manuel Manuel Telly's
uh Kevin Cho sounds like you just jumped
jobs got an eight point eight percent
increase
uh well it's out for my understanding
you've jumped to probably the top of the
ladder thus far so you're doing all
right man um okay thank you - game - bit
code who donated five dollars towards
our 4k goal yeah so compendium it's 47%
increases my understanding if I remember
correctly was you were already somewhat
working into not as a developer but you
were working in technology and so and so
you uh you probably had a higher skills
a higher salary than I did but I when I
interviewed Nick
Nicholas Spinoza he moved from being a
chef to a developer and six times whose
income not 60% six folded his
income
ah tier 2 Adrian although either one are
good um you should have finished as
early as you can you probably don't have
a higher salary than I live in Florida
so I don't live in the most expensive
place in the world uh okay so uh I'm
loving the conversation guys oh when I
lived in LA holy I make any money I
I barely got by man I was making I was
making forty five thousand in LA at my
last job and oh I could barely afford
rent and you tan health insurance all
that ain't safe I save ten percent
of my money though I was proud of myself
for doing that yeah um did you H if you
want to email me I'll type it out in
there and when you talk about the
details okay
so you're making more money than me you
got a 75% increase you're making more
money than me by about $3,000 although
I'll be probably be bonus over that with
the way things have been going at work
so
we'll call it even but I got a little
bit of YouTube money to carry over so
I'm better nah I was like with you
ah how much should I like to make it
depends on your skill set and depends on
your your experience that you currently
have and a whole mess other things but
the easiest thing to do is look up on
Glassdoor it also it depends on where
you live the supply and demand blends on
a whole bunch of things but more than
anything else just get experience and
then the money will come in the jobs
will find a ballpark it your full stack
developer 70,000 60,000 Lowen Louis 10
50,000 front-end developer 45,000 and
above that's that's a slow end as I can
get um that says ballpark as I can get I
should say but again it depends on your
skills senior level senior level
dependent 50 you can get you can get 250
at senior level with five years
experience in the latest technologies
but realistically a hundred to a hundred
and thirty senior level and web
development why do so many developers
hate piano spams how important slash
beneficials of the live in california
software engineer
there's engineering jobs in every
 state and country as far as he
knows in every state maybe not every
country uh so it doesn't matter the
thing is that the the largest companies
are in California the Silicon Valley's
are in California project managers I
think it's just because that's who tells
them what to do at the end of the day uh
they're kind of like a boss yeah
um let's solve this algorithm what we'll
take questions after about fifteen
minutes of of review on here of torture
is what he needs
okay so let me turn AC on here's your
pin
are we doing the same one yeah so so
what is it before you are okay well I
have photographic memory
yeah not good enough so what what is one
what's the difference due to one equals
two equals and three equals signs yeah
so what tell me what's real so one
equals is when you are assigning a value
to a variable assigning a valuable to
them is comparison of what value of
value what's three type and value good
all right
a bit code email me and I may have
something that you can't help with not
my not my tutoring service for something
else
okay so we'll review all that in a bit
okay so I'm actually gonna put the chat
down for a bit guys um I get distracted
she enjoys the attention too much I
don't enjoy it yeah I have anxiety okay
so what's going on here we're evaluating
if our fact or if the number we're
passing in is zero oh this is up
not supposed to see this alright and
what it it stopped cheating I have it up
I'm not cheating ristmas start off where
we left off alright fine we'll start off
where we left off so here if factorials
if the number is zero to any power it's
going to return one so what do we need
to do here we want to return one Oh guys
it's saying that this zero so so we're
checking if it's equal to the num yes
and if it is or it will return one yeah
and then it exits out of the function
because you can only have one returned
ever hit return
and what do we do after returns after
statements semicolon
good all right so when we are
2-factorial eyes a number let's let's
review math we're not here recode the
fact or Eliza number yeah it's world the
number goes 5 times 5 times 5 times 5 5
times 4 or 5 times 3 yes from 1 to the
number that to the num that's passed in
we are multiplying that okay so there's
one to the nut from 1 to the num there
you go
yay unless it's 0 because we already
coded them so so it could be technically
0 to the num yeah but here and we
already wrote the logic to handle that
okay so this is the outside of the
normal right okay now what we're doing
is we're figuring out for the 5 how do
we write it using a I already told you
that the skills that you're going to use
for here Ares we're going to use a for
loop we're going to use a variable we're
going to use the if statement what you
already use you don't need it for what
we're at doing now where they hit their
head statement we already did it I've
statement I'm just saying you're not
going to need to use this statement what
you're going to need here let me let me
write down what you're going to use
you're going to use a if for a loop and
else you're going to have to create a
variable you're going to use a for loop
and you're going to return when the for
loop is done
oh and also there's going to be
multiplication right where you talked
about that because you have to multiply
in a factorial so you might have a
multiplication and you might even have
an equals as a hint so our four loops
how do we set up a for loop search three
parts in it you start up you create a
variable for where you're going to start
off rumor the I you create the I the
iterator where are we starting that's a
variable at the variable R I and what is
that what are we initially setting it to
we're trying to multiply one yet no
Vaart the equals is assigning we're
creating a variable and we're assigning
a value so we're creating the variable I
okay and we're assigning a value and
remember we're trying to go from 1 to
num to multiply it by 1 times 2 times 3
times 4 times 5 until we get to know so
what do you think we start iya what do
we start our for look bad one good
so so we set we use the assignment
operator the equal sign no no you have
to sign the value from this yeah all
right and now you're right assent we
once you create your variable you're
done
you put it and say we're okay we set
that now no there's three parts
next comes the statement the statement
in here that can it's called the
conditional statement and essentially
what that means is keep running this for
loop until this statement is not true
now if we know that we are going to
multiply a number again and again and
again until we until we've multiplied it
by every number in the set what what
might be our statement
I would just say 1 times infinity til
you hit the governor when you
hit it
stop ok so your your till you hit then
known right so you know you're gonna
have to use the num somehow and and the
third part is you I plus plus well times
num yes that would be that one to be
your statement that would be something
else
okay so right now your statement is how
many times are we if we are if the
number is five let's let me show you an
example here okay
so if if if we're our statement is while
I in this case one is less than five
we're hard coding this we don't ever
want to hard code things right yeah so
why are you showing me this because you
need to understand how salmon I would
write a statement right and then here we
have I plus plus which means that every
time this runs we're going to increase I
and let's just say here all we're doing
is we're we're adding to all we're doing
this we're saying hi we're going to
console.log hi
so hi and then we'll put the we'll put
the value I plus I okay remember what
comes along does it prints it out cool
so the first iteration here the first
time this runs what happens is it prints
out and I'm this is we're going to write
down we're going to write down what it's
printing out here so on the first
iteration is going to say hi 1 so now
it's going to once existed last time 5
because it's less than 5 and it's then
going to go I plus plus sign else hi
it's going to be 2 it's 2 less than 5
yes so it runs again so it's gonna be hi
- so our second loop is going to be hi -
okay I get the hard code part hard
coding is what I understand ok now
you're asking you to write a statement
not knowing any of the hard code and
making it still true with anything put
into it so is that I less the numb or
equal or equal less to numb what makes
sense okay so if we're if we're basing
off the amount of time to return 1 and
but what statement are we looking for
right now we're trying all right so in
this case 5 it would we hard code 5 but
it wouldn't work when we through 10 in
there so these are these are our
arguments or our parameters so what how
would we change this for loop so that it
would work with any num that would run
the correct amount of times because
remember what we're doing is 1 times 2
times 3 times 4 times 5 how so we need
to have it run 5 times now if I go 6
that's 1 times 2 times 3 times and then
when it runs 10 it needs to run 10 times
so what's including the num so would be
the num what would be the know this
 yes
all right now let's get let's erase this
I cool despite getting re Raisa
all right so we know we need a for loop
all right now for the I can say we're
increasing by one in this case yeah so
it would be I plus plus which is I plus
1 I is equal to I plus 1 yeah I is equal
that yeah like my writing
okay so now what we need to do is we
have to find a way to store the map that
we want to do which is the factorial
math equation using the for loop how do
we in this loop we need to put the
factorial math into it yes
okay so this is telling me how many
times it's going to run yes
and now we have to figure out how do we
do what we needed to do in our for loop
for each iteration what do you mean each
iteration so every time it runs so every
loop is an iteration so we're right now
we're figuring out what do I do I know
how many your loops are gonna be based
off of no remember that's our parameter
we're passing it no no which could be
five could be twenty could be zero right
so wouldn't this be like now what do we
have to do in a factorial we have to
multiply yes so what am i times i plus
plus
um equals numb
you're you're getting something is you
know you're not there yet yeah I give
you you have to store something in a
variable um you have to use I
though your isn't your getting there so
I need a variable to store something
well what happens is if you try to store
it in num and you're multiplying you're
gonna create an infinite loop right
that's why I keep thinking so you just
call it total what you can call it total
what the number here about great what's
gonna say nothing no you don't want to
rename it that
so bar I is what I'm storing our total
is what I'm sorry our total is what you
want to return eventually you want to
return the result of the factorial I'm
confused by this okay
I thought this these are the same right
both barrels
they're both variables yes and this
variable is that is containing I equals
1 yes but this one is containing a total
that's going to contain your math that
you're going to do for the factorial
right hey you can name whatever you want
except numb or I I don't know why any
total I thought this was supposed to
river my mouth was going it is let me
let me explain some let me remind you of
something let's forget this for a second
um
so the reason you can't create a
variable in here that's not going to
reset remember local scope so if I were
to create a variable because you're
doing something wrong right if I was to
create a variable called count and I set
count equal to count plus one that where
semicolon on the first iteration the
value of and I were to print it out
below I'm not trying to name it the same
name is that I know you're not supposed
to I'm trying to explain to you why
you're creating a variable in the wrong
spot you're the one that said it's a
variable right there I can't just give
you the answer all right I'm trying to
tell you these things you have to solve
it on your own here in there I'm tight
till I know all right
so how does a factorial work look at
look at the screen here let's bring it
up real quick so let's look at the
screen so here you can see what is the
difference every it so each one of these
multiplications right here each one of
these we're multiplying by what one more
yeah and each one is an iteration yeah
and it's equal to this 5 factorial yes
so how do we need what I was saying all
right you know what just go no just go
no yeah come on no no no no miss I got
some attitude let's go ahead you're on
your own now
yeah come on baby you go oh you got this
you see see look at this hey you don't
even need to create a new variable just
use num that's what I was thinking
Brandon you're wrong
first off you're wrong cuz you shall
create an infinite loop that's why
you're wrong
yeah Lackey but now I'm in like yeah
it's like that's why I see you we'd go
on for infinity all right let me show
you you know what let me show know when
I show you what's up you're old
let me show this gentleman why you can't
create a num so here if we go based off
your logic and we create a number we
increment our number so for loop bar I
is equal to one while I is less than num
I plus plus if we set base off the logic
of a factorial num is equal to I times
equal I is essentially what you're
saying our number increases indefinitely
thus changing our statement here so when
we get to five factorial
it is now 120 I so we have to go up to
120 and I have no idea what 120
factorial is but 20 is something in it
early let's see you network no it's
gonna crash the browser it doesn't work
so that's why you can't use num it
creates an infinite loop anyhow I hope
you paid attention because I just solved
it for you there if you could figure out
how to assign it to a different variable
I love uh alright maybe I think I think
we did enough today other you're gonna
you're gonna need to brush up study
talking JavaScript I know I wasn't ready
for this I know I'm just you're never
gonna be ready for algorithms you just
gotta dive into well that we don't know
um anyhow so let's let's jump back we
have some questions here uh uh challenge
April I told her today was going to be I
told her today was going to be an easy
day since we went to the hackathon
I'd see the whiteboard yes hello Neil
Floyd welcome sorry wasn't there
manual if you're still here have a good
one man are you going to cover recursive
algorithms in this session seems like a
good problem too
we're not diving into recursion anytime
soon for her I that would explode her
brain instantly are they doing Python no
we're doing JavaScript you guys need a
new marker we have like 15 different
ones we'll try a different color
tomorrow move the whiteboard closer I'll
try to get a better angle in the future
I know I should not say int javascript
is a type list uh assignment language I
guess would be the technical word well
that basically means is it inherits it's
a site it inherits its type on the
assignment side I use this dynamic
variable so you go um unless you're
doing types rip are we got from hack
phone yes we took we I decided that I
wasn't going to be able to compete it
was a data science hackathon so not my
not my field it's not too bad ah types
cripple dominate 2018 probably he'll
probably make its its debut
we already talked about why we couldn't
used num as our variable counter um
Michael bang I am a very patient man for
a drink right now
me too sorry I don't drink Brandon says
you don't need to create a new variable
just use none
we discussed that ah
uh so that's true I wanted to use and if
you'd have to use an if statement within
the for loop I wanted to separate it out
so she could start working with if
statements and kind of remind her of
what they do and how they work to try
and explain to her an if statement in a
for loop when she clearly doesn't
understand for loops would be uh I just
kind of tried to separate it out as the
gist of it because that one you can hard
code you probably won't get banned for
any memes Joshua
what was that like talking to Hiro
ah about what I don't know what what do
you mean what was what like learning
that right now
you can look guys you can't grow if in
the way that we have our code set up
where we're setting the original num as
the statement here it create an infinite
loop if we stored the factorial value
put to them because it would increase
dramatically every time you never you
never reach your loop or on a side note
if we started at one we'd say 1 is less
than num and then we said num is equal
to 1 times 2 and then you have 2 is less
than 2 we'd never break out of the loop
it'd still be too bad
lady it was I - - yeah we're not going
to start decrementing backwards I think
the easiest way to go is start
incrementing at least they won't know
about the hackathon define hard-code was
that mean well when you're saying hard
code so when he saying hard code he
means that I'm giving you the variables
to work with now he's trying to teach me
how to write a logical statement without
having any variables to work with that
way when any variables plugged in the
statement will always work which I hate
um what what I meant by hard code is
it's kind of what April was saying there
was she wants to write a for loop for
the number five as if the parameter will
always be five yeah guys that's what I
mean by hard code you need to write your
code yes and this is just because she's
she's new and all that but there are
there are situations where developers
will have to hard code things but 99.99%
of the time you won't need to and it's
it won't work in this case it won't you
can't I didn't do that on purpose
let's smack me what's wrong you popped
off no it did it I hit this on top top
ah
beginner's hackathon no this was a
professional data science hackathon
unfortunately I have no background in
data science no Python no PHP as you
know coding what asked if I could review
your portfolio post it again I'll review
it I don't want to go back and find it
so hard code is fixed and flexible code
yes that would be that would be the
definition of hard code what meme is it
I love me
yeah there yeah that's I'll use I'll
tell you what I'll use that in my in my
hackathon video I'm going to talk about
the hackathon and challenging yourself
and all that sort of stuff and maybe
bring in a little bit of imposter
syndrome alright so we'll wrap it up by
reviewing Zeno coding some pay chair
there's 14 good for you man starting
early um good for you uh it looks really
good I like the aesthetic feel to it
yeah I think it's better than mine
congratulations
that's awesome
very nice looks like bootstrap uh
a free code camp I'm kind of in between
spots so I'm I'm still doing the
portfolio I it's kind of done it's just
a some of my devs are a little like out
of it
oh no I'm trying to get everything
organized so it's a little bit more
presentable
definitely yeah um and then for the
JavaScript I'm trying to catch up on
notes so I I'm probably a little bit
more than halfway down with the
JavaScript notes so I should be doing
shortly but I've been folk of entraining
to really sit down and figure out the
bugs in my code for my am portfolio
anyways let's do this okay so um 14
running good for you I would do I'd be
 taking over the world
kill the start at 14 for you um that's
really great I like the movement over
the hover of your picture that's a very
aesthetically pleasing and it makes you
want to pay attention so you're good
animations man and and you can tell that
you've taken some some time to to build
it out and you have these placeholders
everything about this is very nice uh I
wonder if this is CSS or this is a
jQuery well let's look at the code yeah
you got a nice feature my thing is this
man um you're probably too young to have
a LinkedIn but go ahead and make
yourself one but at at some that might
the best advice I could give you Zeno
coding or uh Benjamin is get yourself a
website man I know you probably don't
work or have any money
but it's relatively cheap you can get
with hosting like seven dollars a month
and buy a URL for like fifteen dollars a
month
and make that your personal project man
where instead of linking to code pins
linked to actual websites on your on
your hat for the rest of your life if
you really do want to be a developer man
going by B Benjamin or Benjamin be calm
or whatever you want to buy by your dev
portfolio site now and use it to the
best of your ability and continually
improve it continually go that next mile
and as you as you get better with api's
it looks like you already are fairly
decent with it because I saw your open
weather API worked and I'm assuming the
other ones worked as well go ahead and
add things under your cool if you're
like hey I want to add my most recent
photo on Facebook go find out how the
Facebook API works if you want to add
your most Instagram one go do that one
in my case I did the description and
from there just start trying to
freelance man on the only thing I'd say
is the submit button probably make it to
like right about here because it's
really throwing off your your view from
the top left corner to the right corner
here aesthetically the submit button
should be ending somewhere over here
about this size it's like is it is it
the best portfolio site of all time no
neither is mine oh it totally is the
submit button my only if with this yeah
your color scheme great choices those
are really nice um here let me let me
write and I say this not to discourage
you because yeah I'm very impressed man
I really am but let me show you just
some simple templates and this is what
you should strive to get you I'm gonna
saying copy the templates it's a start
yes start bootstrap comp and this is how
you get better too by the way if you
want to go and you want to you want you
say how do I get better at web design
how do I get better at building sites go
find a template and try to emulate it
and you're like I don't have like I
don't have very good artistic vision
when building websites so what I do is I
go to sites like this that have them I
get ideas and then I apply it to what I
know and how I want to get there and so
you you also have these other sort of
blanked
it's to kind of give you ideas but let's
take a look at two - starter templates
so that you can kind of we'll do a live
preview and then we'll do a grayscale
live preview and and from there what you
can do is you can see how to like here's
that here's an example right
just a simple cool background color a
little bit different right your this
could be CSS this could also be a
background this should be a CSS of
something drawing across or it could be
a background image and a gradient color
scheme across but it'd be up to you to
do it your own way you have you have
some nice button hovering you're already
good with all this ourself a different
sort of menu style go down you have some
icons in here get comfortable with that
but you'll see kind of some general web
patterns and and you'll see more
different different ways that you can
finally turn nightbot settings
down I always have to wrestle yeah like
do night by is on it Halen but you'll
see you'll see that instead of maybe
color you have images as your
backgrounds a little bit more and then
you add filters and and things like that
and here's another one a great one where
I actually use this to build a site for
a buddy of mine and you see that down
here it's not working but they have a
youtube map API but I believe I'll show
you what I did
just to kind of help him out I didn't
want to spend a ton of time making it
but I took that site I just added what
he wanted in it so here we have the
Vance Faro site this is literally using
the same template I just changed it out
I could do a better job on it but it you
know this was a free thing for a homie
added some stuff in here some icons his
store a little bit of a banner here a
button and a little bit more but that
all came from this theme inspiring me
and I actually took some parts of it
completely from it but if you're if
you're trying to get better which it
sounds like you are you want me to
review yourself so that you can get back
her and let's look at the code come on I
encourage you to go and challenge
yourself today I went to a hackathon I
felt like an idiot sometimes you have to
feel like an idiot Oh like an idiot
every time we hit this algorithm so and
and look at this this is great you have
you have jQuery in here which is good
man uh I suspected looking at that that
that was jQuery not CSI perfect if you
want a challenge if you want to continue
challenging yourself try to improve it
save this iteration I'm saying is
perfect that's fine something was it's
it's not perfect per se but it's not
insane objectively he wants to know I
just told him how you can improve from
it this is the skill set he has right
now yeah and that is why it is perfect
he needs to he needs to better his skill
set which is gonna do someone asked for
this opinion not to say oh it's great
and not give them ways to improve it is
great it's great that he can make this
and so anything and he's using html5
with his header tags and nav tags all
that's great um he's asking are you
asking to critique it or asking for
better ways to enhance it those are two
different questions I thought he was
asking the latter and I gave him ways to
enhance that I showed him different
stylings because all that's what that
that's that the main critique is the
Styles outdated right that's the main
critiquing I think he probably already
knows that but he made what he could
with the skills that he has
and but the animations you have on there
that is leagues above most web designers
the most web designers just know HTML
CSS I can barely have at a hover and at
animation very good stuff now you just
gotta sign to be you now you just gotta
step up your design man oh yeah when
you're looking at the designs and
everything since you have such a great
imagination of what you can do with your
layouts I would say not so much maybe
copy the other schemes because you
really want to hone in
your own ability to have that type of
creativity more or less look at the
scheme's look at the black and white
content when I say black for my content
look at all the information that you
have laying out and block it out into
white and black contrasts and kind of
see what aesthetically is pleasing
because part of being a web developer is
knowing where to put things and how to
put them so that the person that you're
working for whatever project you're
working on you can have that capability
while being able to develop the type of
you know but process okay process good
we're about to wrap this up yeah so not
so much is so yeah I mean just kind of
you I want to make sure that you keep
your own creativity don't just you know
use others for inspiration but also
really hone in on your own creativity
because if this is something that you
came and brought out from your own self
this is really great this is this is
great I love it you know just make sure
that you're you're keeping an eye out
for the aesthetic nough sand the
pleasing nough sand kind of really hone
in on yourself because the more that you
can do that the more you can separate
yourself from the crowd of people who
can all make the same type of design
you'll be the new person in it alright
