2018 developer survey results from the
interviewed over a hundred thousand
developers to find out a little bit
about them what their languages of
choice are what they love what they hate
you know how much money they make all
that sort of stuff and we're gonna go
over it I actually have we were talking
about with some co-workers in the car
and I didn't realized that it came out
yet and so I wanted to talk about I
think I did a video last year in 2017
about their results and I'll link that
video in the description below if you
just want to kind of compare and
contrast so let's go ahead and take a
look at it hey guys before we get
started a little shout-out to myself if
you're interested in angular I just
built a new project on udemy it's my
angular 360 part 2 course where we're
using a bunch of cryptocurrency api's to
just to display what what have been up
what has been down as well as some
sorting and filtering and you know a
little bit coin chart so is this fun
project about six hours of content if
you're interested in coupon code coding
gotten in the description for ten
dollars alright so as I mentioned a
hundred thousand developers it's a lot
it's hard to get you know research for a
hundred thousand people thirty minute
survey I'm not doing for free for
30 minutes so to the hundred thousands
of you who did it
I appreciate your justice of the costs
alright so let's see a few trends DevOps
and machine learning
alright only a tiny fraction developers
who said they write unethical code Dolan
we're talking to you alright
developers are overall optimistic about
the possibilities or artificial
intelligence yeah until the new
Terminator movie comes out Python as we
know is uh raising up surpassed PHP god
bless all right so let's continue on
with what actually is going on so you
kind of see where the bulk of the
developers from
as so you'll see India has to be
expected but about 21 percent or so are
from America just so that you can get an
idea of where these hundred thousand
people are going oh this is a visit this
is a survey respondents so 21 percent
monthly Stack Overflow visits we can see
that also is about about pretty similar
so professional developers pretty
similar so yeah so developer roles of
the hundred thousand who committed to it
looks like back and full stack front end
okay
it always makes sense because I just
feel like web developers use the web
more yes I know I know it's kind of a
weird assumption like oh well web
developers gonna answer this more often
than not but a front-end developers
mobile developer student
oh it's type of developers how does
Judah should be on there alright I'm
contributing to open source 44% now I
wonder if that means that you just
submitted you're using someone's
software and then you tell them that
part of its broking submit a bug ticket
because I don't really think that counts
as contributing an open source code neem
is a hobby
twenty percent says no eighty percent
says yes I would bet that this hundred
thousand people is that actually did the
survey Duke Otis a hobby but by and
large I would say the bulk of the
developers I work with don't not anymore
anyhow so I'd be very surprised if
eighty percent of working developers
code as hobby I do
I love it I have this channel I do
courses but I'd be sorry about that so
where do you stack in years since
learning to code right all respondents
twelve percent three to five years so
three to five years this is the biggest
group here in terms of experience which
is a nice to know so but you can see if
you're basically if you make it past
this eight year mark if you
getting into this range you really are
once you make it past 8 years you're in
the you know the very very top you know
it starts getting single digits after
multiple years coding professionally oh
this is just coding as a hobby okay I
got you
so like I would probably land in the six
to eight years at this point or five
years it depends on when you say that
this I started because I started in
college which is like five or six years
ago
so if you count that sweet I'm somewhere
between here weird school coding
professionally I'm about at two years
which is thirty percent of people which
is kind of crazy right
thirty percent of people are zero to two
years coding professionally and then
after three to five if you make it past
five you're you're you're killing it
like I have no other way of saying in
that's six to eight once you make it
here you're pretty much God Tyr and when
it comes to developers and I wonder if
uh I wonder if owner if people change
professions into like becoming a BA or
PM or they no longer code professionally
they burn out this is something I was
talking about with my co-workers but
that's that's pretty pretty crazy that
five years 57% of developers and a full
third of developers have zero to two
years professional experience
alright years of professional code by
developer type friend and developer on
average is five point five years full
stack developer six point three and it
makes sense right
engineer managers should have more
nothing too crazy there how many
developers are students seventy five
percent are twenty percent are not there
either art shooting twenty percent are
full-time and then about six percent or
part-time educational attainment primary
elementary school secondary school some
college universities
degree your boy it's so this is what's
so crazy is that this has now become a
group like this is this kind of crazy
where it's almost like I went to college
wasn't for me but hey we want to track
that or we want to track that you went
and got some credits because it's it's
just a crazy thing that this is a
category nowadays I'm not it's it's
strange to me associate's degree people
asked all the time should you get
associate's degree there's a three point
one percent associate's degree compared
to 46% bachelor's degree and 22 percent
master's degree I think the numbers
really speak for themselves that there
is no value in associate's degree in
terms of what degrees get you based off
of getting you through that HR wall so
that's my answer and I think that the
data here supports that undergraduate
degree so what are people getting in
their bachelors right we see 46% have
bachelor's degrees well
64 percent of the time they're gonna
sort of software engineering computer
science another engineering this is a
I'm not too surprised by this other that
nine percent are also getting the
current engineering information systems
biology chemistry physics mathematics
web developer web design I would like to
see this category bump up I don't think
there's enough good web development
degree programs in schools like this
could be such an amazing thing you could
cover so much imagine a four year
program where you're learning everything
just everything you're gonna come out
the full stack god dev you know I mean
but it's probably not like that which
like other types education taught
yourself a new language framework tool
without taking a formal course eighty
seven percent
welcome to the world of being
self-taught where you can have something
like what was it education on here
something like I know what is that about
ninety percent of people who have gone
to college or got a degree and
unfortunately still have to go and teach
themselves alright
not unfortunately but uh but that's why
every developer even if they go and get
a PhD cuz there's some self self talk
right taking online course programming
software development MOOC
massive online online course I forget
would look exactly stands for but
basically udemy and those things
forty-nine percent I'm surprised that's
not higher but I guess as you get older
you really don't even want to mess with
someone else this course contributor
open source project received on-the-job
training and software develop really 35%
define on-the-job training because I
find that to be a substantially higher
number than I would think participant
hackathon online coding competitions
taking a part-time in-person course of
programming 18 percent huh completely an
industry certification program purchase
their full-time developer training
program or bootcamp so 10 percent
developers have gone to a bootcamp
that's pretty high I think boot camps
are a relatively new thing but they are
they are continuing and it is important
you know 68,000 people submitted that
developers are lifelong learners it's
really a good statement and you should
kind of kind of become familiar with
ways developers learn on their own
official documentation and/or standards
of technology we got 83 percent of
people lying because I'll tell you right
now there's no good documentation in
this world it does not exist there needs
to be a new role where I know there's a
technical documentation guy with that
guy needs to get fired and they need to
write they need to create new role says
actual good technical documentary but
that should be the the new role here um
questions on Stack Overflow questions
and answers on stack over there we go
that's more appropriate a book I must be
the only one that doesn't like books I
find books to be absolutely useless
college university yeah alright why
developers participate in hackathons
because I finally enjoy what I go I like
to go to improve yeah maybe
network is also a good reason new job
opportunity is also a good reason to win
cash and awards also a good reason but I
think they are enjoyable so everything
kind of hackathon
go to like angel hak-do or just Google
hackathons near me and see what pops up
finding a job after a bootcamp right
this is something you're all very
interested in I already had a full-time
job as a developer when I'd be grand the
program 45% of people I would I would
like to know if this was there Eddie had
a full-time job in software before the
server I think that's what that means
16% immediately fat a job after
graduating so less than a month seven
and a half percent one to three months
10% so what is this number right here so
26 so about 34 percent and three months
found a job so one in three found a job
four to six months six months long range
I've got a developer job yet I wonder
what this is I want I want to know if
this is I already had a software job
that's really what I want to know
demographics who 92.7% male I think this
is worse than it was last year in
fairness I don't remember if transgender
or nine but not non-binary or on there
so that might have taken away from the
female to male ratio but I thought we
were making progress I thought more
we're going into stem but apparently not
uh all right race ethnicity of white or
of European descent seventy four point
two percent this is interesting because
a large portion of the survey like this
isn't twenty percent is from America and
probably another twenty to thirty
percent is from Europe so I was
expecting these categories to be larger
I wonder I I think I said this last year
I wonder if the the you know
traditionally those of white or European
descent have had easier upbringings
because they've had more money in their
in their sort of social structure and I
feel like to own a computer or laptop to
have the time to you know monitors all
that sort of upfront cost I wonder if
that's part of why certain ethnicities
are
involved in it more so than the other
it's just a social economic reason I
don't know I just something I think
about sexual orientation straight
bisexual or queer gay or lesbian asexual
okay moving on okay I really had no good
to say about that other than okay
let's roll with that parents education
levels so my parents my father is a
bachelor's degree and I think a minor in
something but uh by the way you notice
there's nothing here for minors so
pretty pretty much shows you how
important those are my mother is a nurse
I'm not sure where that falls in an RN
disability status I have a mood or
emotional disorder depression bipolar
disorder I have an exam anxiety I sorta
have a concentration or memory disorder
identify as autistic person or a person
with autism huh
so is that about 25% of people or so 23%
of people have some sort of disability
status interesting experience and gender
men have on average is just I wish I
would say this first professionally when
they break it down they break down the
experience by the gender I wonder it
let's look at women so women you can see
that women are a little bit more
front-loaded in the 0 to 2 years
experience as well as 3 to 5 and that
the men tend to have that's probably
just because women are getting more so
in to stem and coding in recent years
there's been a big push to be more
inclusive so age all right so I just did
a video about ageism and some people
thought I was overly overly relaxed
about it
but I think that you can see here I
don't think it's a huge huge issue but
maybe I'm wrong
3/4 of developers who took our survey
are younger than 35 ok
so 30 so 3/4 of developers or 35 years
or younger I might have been wrong about
age though I know but that is that is a
troubling stat because 35 to 44 I mean
this says here's the thing this is why
I'm not too worried about the status in
terms of market demographics it's like
usually you want that like 18 to like 35
range because those are the people most
engaged and I kind of feel like this
might be something that's playing into
here as well but that's just my gut
experience on my gut feeling on it I
really have no idea but I would say that
uh let's do professional developers so
that's about the same thing oh yeah this
25:34 is the largest category of
developer and you know the next group is
up to 44 I don't see I don't know I
don't know it's a hard subject we'll
leave it at that
we're not gonna learn too much from a
voluntary survey about ageism in the
workplace I should I already shared my
thoughts that's a separate video go
watch that one if you want to yell at me
average age by country and experience so
28.7 in the United States brazil's 25
india's 22 i wonder why so young in
india kinship competition
self-evaluation i feel a sense of
kinship whatever life outside of work
children and other dependents no
interesting 71% developers do not have
kids this year we asked respondents they
have children other defendants that they
care for about a quarter respondents
said that they do so this goes back to
my point in the video as well so i don't
like the people part of developers is it
is a growing space and i think the
younger generation got more involved in
coding and software and i think this is
kind of supporting this as well is that
most people
who are younger have no children as
they're getting started because they're
focused on their career or whatever but
so this is I see and think it was gonna
be 71% though that is a lot all right
now what time developers wake up I wake
up somewhere between five and six thirty
depending on the day seems about the
same for the bulk of people and you can
see here four contract employees for the
remote desk how much time do developers
spend on the computer this is about what
I spend somewhere between this and this
about right cool
how much time do belfry spend outside
somewhere around here uh three to four
hours ten percent really I don't believe
any of you have ten one in ten people
spend ten percent how often developers
skip meals to be productive never I
never never never skipped meals I do
have I do have some co-workers who
recently did this I tried to tell not to
I'm able talk a little bit about that in
the in a future video
all right technology this is a fun stuff
number one JavaScript video over that's
all we needed to know um Script team
markup so HTML Javascript CSS damn and
that's all for some pretty important
stuff is PHP why are you so high in the
list PHP you need to die already you
need to die and go to hell alright so
PHP let's see and then at the bottom
Perl groovy Scala Kotlin alright cool
frameworks libraries and tools node
angular react so react is popping up in
terms of jobs and everything I recommend
people learning react because there's
really on a hiring frenzy but even still
they're still below angular dotnet core
c-sharp this is what I'll be building a
backing of a project of mine in so my
work uses as well it's a pretty excited
about that
databases my sequel 59% are used my
sequel sequel server MongoDB though and
post post great
SQL these are our JSON databases pretty
exciting stuff and then a bunch of other
ones platforms Linux Windows Android
don't really care about that there's a
link to this in the description as well
if you're interested most loved dreaded
and wanted language are most loved Rus
very surprised
typescript I actually do love typescript
I'm on I'm on the typescript type train
so I can see that JavaScript where did
PHP make the list PHP second to last for
muscle of language we got a bunch of
people in denial I dreaded Visual Basic
6 MATLAB VV net PHP you know it didn't
make the list here javascript typescript
but PHP made the list just saying just
say not not thrown any shade just saying
most people want to work with Python
most people want to work with JavaScript
4 percent of people on workers creation
what's wrong with you people
what's wrong with you most loved dreaded
and wanted frameworks love tensorflow
people love react angular dreaded it's
so funny loved angular 54% dreaded
angular 45 frames like people don't want
just the the JavaScript frameworks
wanted you know one man's trash is
another man's treasure most loved it and
wanted databases wanted platforms
development and tools and environments
all right
Visual Studio code is by far the most
popular tool text editor cool Windows
Mac Linux I think we can all pretty much
have assumed that was gonna be it for
the operating system how many monitors
you have oh 31 percent of you developers
are using one monitor you need to get
your together and get a second
monitor that is unacceptable you use
just so much more productive on at least
two monitors 51 percent have two
monitors 14 percent have have 14 and I
guess I'm in the minority with the 1.2
percent with form on
so all right top pain technologies so
this guy gives you an idea of well the
United States what I care about what the
the highest paying ones are and
typescript 100 mm and ain't too shabby
for a typescript which basically
javascript at the end of the day her
Lynx fella Objective C pearl Kotlin rust
JavaScript is also on the list
damn no no PHP didn't make the list on
PHP didn't make the list okay correlated
languages oh this is this is interesting
so I bet so this will tell you really
what you need to learn you can see you
can see by what's going on here what you
really need go for JavaScript so you got
nobody got react got angular you got
typescript Visual Studio code MongoDB
CSS HTML SQL even there's a connection
with PHP which then has these
connections so it can go on and on and
on dangerous and exciting about açai
algorithms make important decisions 28%
believe it is going to surpass human
intelligence
evolving definitions of fairness
increasing automation of jobs or
whatever how developers feel about the
future AI excited AI concerns by
developer type
all right work in employed full time 75%
people ask this are employed full time
10% are contractors
6% are looking for work this will break
it down by geography I don't want to go
over the plumbing status for
professional and developers just
checking the time I'm gonna have to go
to work this has been a long video
company type wedge development or design
this is one thing I've never actually
really worked at a company where we
built products for other people I've
always worked in a software company or a
company that was a tech company or a
company that had a software department
information technology software as a
service but apparently 16% of people
work specifically in a web dev industry
company sighs mines around three to four
hundred I think maybe five hundred so
I'm somewhere around here it might be
more than that we're in like we have
multiple offices around the world and we
have about 300 and in headquarters so
it's probably closer to this but the
bulk of people are working in somewhere
between 20 to 100 and 100 to 500 person
companies curve career values
what do developers hope to be doing in
five years working in different and more
specialized technical role than one I am
now so people want to progress in their
careers imagine that so for the hiring
managers who are looking to keep Talent
the average developer staying a job for
one and a half years something like that
well why don't you start promoting them
if you want to keep them because that
will work for 34% of people 20% doing
the same work what's wrong with you does
you always want to be evolving how do we
develop first feel about their crews
extremely dissatisfied so 3.5% of people
hate their job and let me tell you I
would be the first one til you quit go
find a job where you are going to be
extremely satisfied
moderately dissatisfied slightly
dissatisfied another satisfied
dissatisfied I feel like if you're
neither satisfied or dissatisfied you're
dissatisfied so go ahead and be willing
to jump and make that so what is this
about 25% of developers are unhappy as
far as I consider it or you could if you
just want take their standard about 16%
of developers are so 17% but for the
most part we this it's slightly
satisfied moderately satisfied extremely
satisfied it was about 75% developers
are happy it's a good job being if
that's the case ethics
no depends on what it is so most people
most developers are not willing to be
shady reporting shady businesses that's
I don't know I just think most
developers don't want to go to jail so
that's probably why they're trying to be
looking looking for a job
I'm not actively looking by and open to
new opportunities I think this is a good
category which is why you need to as
hiring managers as management make sure
that you keep your developers by keeping
them happy how do you keep them happy
well turns out money so raises
promotions pretty simple you gotta cut
the check though because not actively
looking but open new opportunities 60%
60% of your developers are open to hey
knock knock knock we got a great
opportunity for you okay well I have a
good opportunity well this is a great
one it's like oh great one I'll take a
great one that's basically what that's
saying about 16% are actively looking
for new jobs so one in four are not
interested in new job opportunities uh
job search by categories and this will
break it down by country who's actively
looking for a job
educator academic researcher mobile
developer designer front-end developer
full stack developer how long ago did
developers last changed jobs less than a
year ago 35 percent so 35 percent of
people less than a year ago switched
jobs between one to year two years ago
twenty two percent so more than 50
percent have swapped jobs in two years
which falls into that
one-and-a-half-year category which we
were discussing cool job changes by time
by geography what words do developers
use this to describe searching for a job
that's kind of a strange thing how do
you develop assess potential jobs
conversations and benefits offer at all
imagine that money being number one
language frameworks and technologies
like be working with that's awesome
opportunity for professional development
Oh being able to advance your career a
good company culture oh my god my mind
is blown opportunity work at home a
remote oh my god not having to drive to
the office that's very strange pretty
much everything that I would think that
most people would find valuable
differences in sussing jobs by gender
all right what developers value in
conversation salary and or bonuses
health insurance computer offers
equipment allowance conference or
education budgets this is something that
wish was included more often than I
would love to go to conferences and I
have to pay $600 out of pocket to go
break down the values by by competition
development practice stay comfortable by
working
ergonomic keyboard or mouse standing
desk I would like one at my work if
you're watching in bossman just throw
nothing wrist or hands for their braces
fatigue relieving floormat I have one in
my office underneath here and I have
standing desk at home by do not have
these things that work unfortunately
everyone uses agile everyone uses scrum
Kanban is a form of agile pair
programming is also extreme programming
not familiar with what these are and
just because they say they use these
things doesn't mean they use them
correctly but that is you'll see that
85% of work places you're gonna be going
into it's going to be agile so keep that
in mind which is why I suggest that you
just sort of become familiar with the
concept how long do developers expect
new work new co-workers to be to take to
be productive I usually say it's about
three month period so less than a month
you're an asshole
so it takes if you're if you hire
someone and expect them to be up and
running at a hundred percent in less
than a month you're wrong in your
jackass because people software is
complicated and so are people's
environments but 44% have reasonable
expectations of about three months I
think so that's where I fought 5/5 I'm
okay with that the majority people said
I think it's three months version
control get slapping pulls around zip
file backups Jesus Christ I don't use
version control
okay so get by far 87% how often
developers check in code multiple times
per day that's usually what I'm doing I
think that's just committing code that's
not actually pushing out new code right
how are jobs job satisfaction and
committing code related so if you're
come if you're writing more code you're
happier interesting I could get behind
that salary by developer type of school
United States engineering manager very
high DevOps back in developer 102 data
scientists full stack developer around
the same time front-end developer
slightly lower pretty much what we
expected QA test developer cool at the
bottom and then you can see this sort of
correlation here what's here salary and
experience by language you can kind of
see what the salaries are higher than
others and community who uses Stack
Overflow multiple 31% multiple times per
day daily or almost daily 32% a few
times a week so basically we all use
Stack Overflow Stack Overflow just want
to let you know that you all would be
nothing without them that's really it at
the end of the day sharing your
developers sharing what you've been on
your developer story I don't know what
that is I don't know what that is but uh
you create your own developer story show
what you've built here I'll have to take
a look at that later and how often
developers participant Stack Overflow
I don't really participate developer
opinions on ads uh I don't mind the ads
add priorities for developers don't care
about that engaging together don't care
interest hypothetically a new tools in
Stack Overflow doke
sorry second I don't really care about
what you got going on it's nothing
personal but I'm sharing this article so
people will check it out alright uh
methodology how we plan to analyze our
survey all right we'll leave it there
because I'm actually going to be late to
work hopefully they'll understand
I works pretty cool so that was kind of
a quick rundown of a very detailed
survey again there'll be a link in the
description kind of kind you can kind of
run over it play around with it house
phone with it I found it pretty
interesting and some of it was to be
expected and some of it was a little bit
stunning and I don't know what to think
about it and I'm gonna probably take
another look at it just sort of analyze
it in my own and this would be actually
something excellent to go and take the
data of people are like oh how can I
make a good project might I suggest you
just go and take the data I don't know
how long they've been doing the Stack
Overflow survey take all this data build
a back-end forward build a API and then
chart the data and compare the last 10
years to Stack Overflow survey results
do something so a little project idea
people are always asking for one that's
