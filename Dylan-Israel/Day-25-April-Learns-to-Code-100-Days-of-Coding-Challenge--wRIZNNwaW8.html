we're 1/4 of the way there how let's do
let's start off by on this momentous
occasion first congratulating you on 25
days 25 percent their 100 days is a long
time to commit to anything
secondly what what would you say have
been your biggest takeaways and in 25
days in now um what what have you
learned what would you if somebody was
three weeks in and four weeks in about
coding what would you be able to relate
to them about what would you what would
be your advice for somebody maybe
getting started on day one and year on
day 25 um I relate to the dumbness of
anyone trying to just learn code I
instantly just feel dumb but at the same
time when I would say the benefit of is
is you start understanding how things I
use daily like any type of program a
software or anything like that you kind
of kind of start to understand like how
everything starts to work together to
build what it is that you're using how
the interface like why the interface
works the way that it does and how it
works the way that it does and on top of
that I'd say the biggest thing to
getting to a point where you can
actually start using and doing things
terms understand your terms understand
your terms
I could not stress that enough and
that's something that only because I
really struggle with and because you
can't apply your terms if you don't
actually know what the they mean so
a lot understanding your terms
really helps you to apply the terms
because if you underst I understand the
logic just will come naturally to you
just because as a human race you you can
tinker you know tinkering is kind of
like the human being things so I think
that eventually will come to you
naturally not that we may not come like
right away but it will come after you
start to understand what it is that
you're working with and I think that
goes for anything so I really think that
starting your web development starting
your career in that really starts with
your terminology understanding it and
after you understand the basics of your
terminology being able to apply that
into your coding so I still want to do
flashcards I haven't been able to get to
it because I just haven't been to the
store yet haven't been able to get there
yet hopefully this weekend I will I want
to start memorizing my terminology but
for anyone who may be struggling or
feeling dumb I'd say 100% focus
terms no you should feel dumb you should
feel challenged it's hard to though not
to because I know that bad I was crying
I felt dumb okay it's a it's it's kind
of like saying to me I look at it it's
like look at it as you know trying to
learn a new language like Spanish if you
don't know Spanish you're like oh well I
can speak languages or I have a brain
that processes this how hard could it be
and you realize like oh it's actually a
brand new skill set so it's hard not to
a time so I can relate to that and
terminology is I like that you said that
because that's something I've been
trying to stress trying to break down
each problems that's why we do our a
little bit of review in the beginning of
the day yeah and that's one thing that I
recognize that you did and which helps
later on when you're describing how to
use it in a if statement or else--if
statement or anything like that when you
use it I go okay okay okay so just
knowing the term then seeing it being
applied and explained to you as to why
you're applying it I can't tell you the
light bulbs that go off when that
happens so if you can do that if you can
structure the way that you're going to
learn your code in that type of
structure I feel that you're going to
have a significant amount of increase in
being able to continue to apply into Amy
algorithms or any kind of problem that
you're going to have to solve in your
code because you have the basics down
and you have every step to cover it
okay good so um why don't we jump in you
said you did another section on
codecademy yeah and this section I
really would like to go through it just
because there were a lot of questions
that I've had and then go through two
different sections I had to get traffic
all right yes this is Milo we have three
cats
Milo C orange one Achilles is the black
one and the sort of striped brownish one
is Tito or as I like to call them HTML
CSS and JavaScript I don't actually call
everybody just kidding
alright so did you finish this section
um I may have no this looks like I
haven't finished six okay but I would
really like to start from the beginning
sigh okay I think I have questions kind
of from all the way through it
oh cool a big boy we have to get you
down go away
like I know you talking alright see you
okay cool so let's uh review for loops
that's what this one's basically doing
here
for loops well we're going piece by
piece I want to show guys what's going
on well what is your question about this
section my thing is is it has it lined
up as you can see there are the core
loop variable equals variable I equals
vacation spots dot length negative one
which I thought put it at zero which
apparently that is not the case because
putting it at zero zero I thought that
maybe that was a different way of
putting on zero but so what really that
runs the code backwards yes so so what
is what is the difference between
running and code forwards and running a
code backwards with a negative 1 and
zero because I thought that a negative
one puts it at a zero how does it run
backwards if it's starting at negative
one okay
so let's break it down all right so the
confusion here result saying we've only
been going forward essentially with our
four loops and we're just showing how we
can better utilize yeah so in this first
one they don't actually have you go
backwards
they have you go forward and then the
next one they have you reset it up so
that you go backwards again okay so
we'll pull this up a little bit just to
the side so
let's talk about four groups for a
second a traditional for a traditional
for loop you usually have your iterator
you're usually sending this eye to zero
because you're starting from the
beginning and going to the end and then
you iterate for the statement now if
it's an array usually you want to check
the whole array so you'll do a rade of
length so you'll say something like I is
less than array dot length so what what
is this statement right here mean is
less than the length of the array and
while that is less than the length of
the array keep running good now this
last part I plus plus is adding one to I
now we could also do I plus 2 I plus 3
we could all do I - - if we wanted now
what would happen if it's of adding 1 in
this case we did I - - where we are - in
one from I we started at zero one
iteration is negative 1 is negative 1
less than let's say for negative 2 we
create an infinite loop so that would it
makes sense for here but this
affects the variable I which we will use
in in our statement to be able to say
how many times we run this for loop now
well it may be confusing for you here is
that say we wanted to go the reverse way
you still create a variable because
remember there's three parts they just
have different values now yeah you still
have an inner inner the statement and
the increment and what happens is in
this case vacation spots which let's say
I'm going to write it off to the side
over here so people know we're talking
about it's an array with the values of
one two and three all right so that's
what we're going to we'll just call this
a for array so and what we're doing is
we're actually going to start I here at
the end of the array
so we say a dot that's 0 a.length minus
1
now why do we - one because our indexes
are always one small so if we did do
what's the length of that array sorry
what's the last index of that tail so we
have 2 minus 1 right right cool
now next thing is we said we wanted to
say while I is greater than Archana
well yeah while I is greater than equal
great greater than or equal to 0 what do
we want to do I - - so first iteration
what's the value of I length minus 1
which is what Tim cool so if we wanted
to print out let's just say we wanted to
print our array in reverse order
well we'd use what console console dot
log and we say a so what's the first
value is printing out good now we say I
- - what's the value of I met okay and
what are we printing out and then we do
I - - are 0
okay and now what are we printing it on
so all we did was instead of going up we
then came down now let me give you an
example to make a little bit more sense
as to as to how to say we only say set
of 1 2 &amp;amp; 3
I've mentioned on one the media maps as
well they go to youtube channels dope
it's actually having twice something to
brag nah I wonder if you're someone the
ones that I know about so here let's say
we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
now knowing what we know about about how
this is set up we initialize we have a
statement and we have an incrementer how
do we and I see you April I only want us
to print out the odd numbers using just
a 4th and console dot log so if I say
console dot log and remember this is a a
I and I want it to be only the odd
numbers how would we set up our photos
of you
do you have any idea
now what's our statement and the white
shirt okay so I'm going to do it like
setting it equal to like odds sort of
incrementing odd numbers so index 0 what
is index 0 line
what's indexed to our index 1 rather 0
now indexed one indexed 102 is that even
number yes so it is odd even odd even
odd even now we could do this with a for
loop with the if statement but we don't
want to we want to do it in here hello
Cody buddy
look
who's this
 go down at volume where you hit
up all these Indian web developers huh
it's like the sites called coders course
I'm a coder I can build my own
 yeah so let me give you an example
how we might do this so we have a I why
this is great less than the length right
so we want to iterate through the whole
array I'm going to do it like this
now so I would be - no one could be wait
no it would be plus 2 so we'd run every
other one exactly so we do I is equal to
I plus 2 or plus equal to and what would
happen is what's the first iteration of
a vie yeah zero so it goes one what's
the second iteration of I was I HB this
is 0 so what is here so - so here's to
do we ever is I ever one now so we skip
it and we say what's the third iteration
by then we say what's the sixth
iteration on 7 &amp;amp; 8 so here you would
then go ahead and print out all the odd
numbers of the array
okay so um let's move on with let's see
what other things you covered in the now
okay here's a question for you if I if I
increase this by one instead of two so
as we've been doing with an if statement
how do we print out just the odd number
within up Stephen yeah and that's why I
got to work with yep so it's running
through this whole array every single
index you're going to use an if
statement so if I want us through the
whole index somehow it's going to check
one it's going to check two three four
five six and you only want to print a
value that is on using the if statements
so what's the point of an if-statement
value and statement but that's why I
want it struggling on its when I'm
struggling eyes is how do I write but I
say it variable I is or joys a so how it
is a dot length like I don't know which
one to call how do we check how do and a
for loop do we check an index for each
iteration using the race so remember how
we added each index how we targeted that
okay so how would you use that to fruit
so first thing first you have to get the
value right that's why I'm trying to
decide which one of these is going to
get is printing out my value first you
have to see if it's such the console.log
will print it out right now you have to
find out is it even or is it also does
my if statement call the console.log it
checks the value but in the end of the
law it would call it if it's true right
so we're checking if it's odd if it's
all we wanted to print if it's even we
don't care so no so this for loop is
printing out all those numbers it's
going to iterate through all the numbers
and I'm going to print it out so why
isn't it printing out nothing till
you've written it the one is the
estimate fourth is operating on anything
because you only want it to print out do
you need to use an if statement to only
print out the odd numbers
so I was checking it everything but it's
not printing anything correct because my
if Sam is going to print it you gets so
it's only going to print it so what do I
call from my for loop because it's not
being printed so I don't call that
that's giving me my numbers let's check
again so you can see the value let me
remind you what's going on so in this
statement we need you somehow check if a
value is odd I know if that's true then
within here we want to console dot log
log a I
so the only way that this isn't going to
print out that the all of the values
because it's running to the whole thing
is this if statement this if statements
protecting this only the odds get
through
so what are we right in here so that
only the odds get through yeah I get
that what I'm asking is what here is
running through there that I can call
here to say look if it's odd right this
if it's false than whatever well you
have you have to use your math operators
you have to use plus minus not equals x
divided muggle oh what the hell are you
saying okay um
so what I'm saying is using these
operators this might be a little beyond
you so don't be afraid if you can't put
it all together let me remind you what
what all this does okay so this adds a
number right this subtracts a number
this says not the opposite this x
divides what is the modulus okay so with
that we are going to check every value
how do we check a value in it in our
array using brackets right and I is 0 1
2 3 so each iteration I increases so we
don't have to print out every value
right if this if wasn't here this would
print I'm printing out any values that
is just checking them right in the if
statements check so how do we how do we
do that
maybe Han modulo yeah I thought that
when you wrote it down okay that's the
you yeah no I just that's what I'm
saying I know what everything means and
does I just don't know how to put it
together to get what it is that I need
to print out okay so how do we know if
it not item is an even number
it gives a reminder now I guess we're
made of zero and how do we do that what
do we divide it by lengthen if I if I
gave you the number six and I said can
you tell me if this is an even number do
you know do you know how mathematicians
would define that so it's when you okay
so the way that six is an even number
isn't because five is an odd and seven
thought it's because when you divide it
by the number two in any even number
when divided by two is zero
yeah sure why I said two okay so I
thought it there was a trick question
I know okay so knowing that knowing that
every even number community by my
channel andrew has a remainder of zero
so you would say two so you would say
take this number and divide it by two
and if I get a remainder of zero it's
even that would be false so what would
the remainder be to make it a true state
a couple other things in here naught
equals minus plus times divided to make
that a true say yeah but what do I write
from here that I say you don't need to
write anything other than this thing
okay let me show you
so if yeah I don't know how to call that
like how would you so how do we get the
value out of our index right what value
are we checking we're checking the array
index so if we want to check the array
index we just say a I first iteration
was this where's the value one good
now how do we find out if one is if one
is even or odd you divide it by two
or remainder - yes we find the remainder
remainder
fire number fence in there okay
so this is modulo two okay
and so we're checking is what is that
equal to zero that would be an even
number we want the odds so what's the
opposite of equal nine good so now every
number that is not equal to zero
when divided by two is a odd number
that's what our logic here is saying and
now it's only going to print the odd
numbers and we can check it real quick
so one divided by two equals zero no
cool so it prints out one two divided by
two equals zero doesn't print it out
just runs through the rest of the code
three divided by two equals zero so
prints out three four divided by two
good
all right let's continue on with the
loops
do you want a harder problem based off
of what was just it okay
all right so think you're good on the
for loops
poor Luke backwards already talked about
that so negative now do you understand
why you had to do the minus one there no
see that's where I'm confused because
then minus one I thought flooded at zero
no no - is one from the lane so what if
we minus one from a yeah I forgot that I
didn't realize I was thinking that I was
taking away from the eyes equals because
they said I equals a dot length and I
was thinking okay so it takes size
because remember the length is equal to
do you know why this isn't a top length
minus 1 why it's less than if we did
less than or equal to we'd have 2 minus
1 because this doesn't run it runs all
the way up to but a dot length remember
there's no in this case the length is
what 9 there is only index 8 so it hits
8 and it doesn't run again now if we did
less than or equal to it would hit 8 and
it would run one more time for 9 because
8 is equal to 8 so it runs more to one
time so we have 2 minus 1 here
and that would just be sloppy good no
softly coded break it would good break
cuz there there's no index knife or turn
on to find and if they're off all your
logic alright so let's take more looks
at these loops for loops inside of for
loops yeah that was fun fun isn't you
understood it um it took me a second to
understand that if statement that was
attached to it but I'm not necessarily
going to have you start thinking out for
loops and for loops quite yet just know
that if you have a for loop nested in
here say we have a for loop nested
inside of our for loop every time this
would work one runs you would take what
it printed no forget about what it's
doing let's just think about the logic
for a second and how nested for loops
work so say we have a variable I here on
the first run if there's a second for
loop in it what happens is it runs
through all 20 values of that second for
loop and then when that's done it goes
to the second iteration here then run
through it again yeah okay good all
right while loops says review while
loops while loops are kind of similar
for loops you don't use them all that
often at least I haven't
they are think one of the foundations of
web development there's basic syntax now
do you get to all oops
Emily doesn't looks like it cool so I'm
going to show you another way of doing a
loop now again you probably use this too
often but it is a thing
all right so one way of doing a while
loop is you have this Wow and then you
have a statement in here that says we'll
say one is we'll say
creative are I assignment but basically
equals zero okay so we'll say while I is
less than five why that's the case
run everything that's in here run run
run run run now if we don't change the
value of I to be true by putting maybe
an i plus plus at the end we just create
an infinite loop this will never break
no why would you do that ever breaks you
don't that's it's I'm saying that's what
you need to avoid if you have a loop
that doesn't break ever it goes on to
infinity it never runs anything else so
it doesn't do anything it just crashes
your program so another thing is let's
let's say let's say this is a variable
instead of I being zero I is equal to
true and so we just are checking I is I
true yeah and maybe we have an if
statement that says look if whatever
we're checking finally hits go ahead and
set I equal to false and then we break
out of our loop now if we make our write
our code in which this never evaluates
that you're also an infinite loop what
we can do infinite loops like I showed
just in our for loop right so this is
another way of creating a loop that
continues until you break out
so this one you happy man when we break
Gotham
well you're manually breaking out of the
other one as well remember because we
set it up we have our incrementer we
have our there are we have our statement
and then we have our aerator statement
increment so that the point of the
incrementer and the statement is to
break out so we set that up at the top
same thing here we just have a little
bit more flexibility on how we set this
up
um maybe maybe we're not iterating
through an array or there's a very
unique case where a while loop works a
little bit better logistically it just
depends you don't really use mod loops
all that much but they are something I
can't even remember the last time you
saw Wally
we're swallows
I'm the most complicated thing in the
world but prone for people who are new
to software to get infinitely because
they are a little bit harder to
understand so
let's talk about we want to talk about
because that's about what you covered
today yeah um
it's not a long week okay so let me take
this down we'll sit down for a second
and
use links lists or arrays in your
JavaScript practices during work I do a
lot of front-end development and I use a
raise a lot in objects more than
anything else
iterating through arrays of objects and
objects of reasonable yeah what do you
mean Ivan how about we gone over using
objects were you hmm we did do an
introduction to it um I would say not to
worry about it till you can start
writing until you get started solving
basic algorithms
do you want to go on freako camp we'll
attempt one of the easier ones
easier on what algorithms okay
all right
all right so let's hop on to beta got
free cocaine calm
your drop of deuce
oh my god the stinks are coming boys all
right what's a good algorithm to get
started with
we get start reverse a string maybe
actually will do the Celsius to
Fahrenheit all right let's see let's see
if April is ready for thee the next
level here boys
this one humbles you the the Fahrenheit
yeah we're 1 or 1/4 lay there minutes
it's been a journey it has been a
journey
Oh to be honest are we sure with the 30
day challenge I wish it was the 300 day
challenge so I was saying yeah that's
right all right so let's look at this
problem real quick I'm gonna explain
make it 300 no no let's let's I don't
want to put that pressure on you uh okay
so uh it's just like oh let's uh let me
explain to you what this algorithms
supposed to do this algorithm is
supposed to taking a Celsius a number in
Celsius it turns it into Fahrenheit so
you have to divide it by like
so the algorithm to convert from Celsius
to Fahrenheit is the temperature in
Celsius times nine point five plus 32 so
knowing that knowing that how would we
return Fahrenheit I'll switch your spots
are you telling me what to write then so
we have to take Celsius and we need to
somehow return Fahrenheit with this
formula
okay well
function convert
alright okay so
they're not so we're not hard coding
this well to a degree we're taking in a
parameter that we have to use there's no
for loops there's no if statements to
over associative array is to the truth
okay so return fare variable
that's weird I would not start it like
that
you're given a
and temperature and cells
use a variable
so maybe it'll console.log print well we
don't need to print anything all we want
to do is return it with the return steam
again I use console.log as a form of
applying a 9.5 plus 32 to give me what I
want you to see it print out to check
your values yes so I have to do another
return with it getting the well the
console.log is in a return all this is
printing
okay so okay's return
and we're looking at that screen
that's far away
okay
I wasn't able to be out
um so so can I can I do like return
Fahrenheit times as long as use times no
so can I do return Celsius times nine
point five plus 32 9 divided by five and
then do like a string attachment where
Fahrenheit equals whatever print out
that is we don't we don't need print
anything up we're just trying to return
a number so let's remember we can assign
values to Fahrenheit so instead of being
this equal to zero
maybe we would throw in that equation
into Fahrenheit and then down below we
would console dot log if you really want
to print it out we could console dot log
Fahrenheit so where might we put our
equation what our key equation can I
equal Celsius okay
then you would put in 9 / no Celsius is
it so let's use x 9 0 v + R keys so your
final answer
I feel like it shouldn't be this easy
yeah good job you pass your first out
[Laughter]
yeah I printed that vision yeah you want
to love and be on all right um cuz it's
Friday and you solve the algorithm
you're making progress we can I'll give
you the option of either you can talk
with chat for the next 15 minutes and so
the normal ten that we do or we can do
another I'll do another one alright so
here we are trying to give me what how
do you do Jeff ready known as a jeopardy
or is it family family feud no no no
will fortune you're thinking give me a G
all right so let me explain what dishes
are you saying good girl looking a dog
[Laughter]
all right so um let me explain what
we're supposed to do here okay this
one's not this one's going to test you
with documentation so what you need to
do is take that string hello and reverse
it I also like
that would be one way of doing it okay
that could work so what do what are we
doing here so we have this string hello
and we wanted to be a ello oh well okay
so we would set up our function
differently our function or for loop or
what so how are we changing this
function to return o ll eh I always told
you just set it up like we set up the
array just now okay but is there like
another way of doing it there's that a
lot of these there's like 50 ways to do
that oh so how do you start to learn
other ways going through the
documentation just becoming a better
developer after years of practice things
like that but you were on the right path
for the for the for loop so if that's my
suggestion you use to work through the
way that feels most natural at first
well obviously it's going to be what I'm
introduced to first okay so you said the
negative for loop so how are we setting
that up so what is a function yeah so I
just do for a loop alright so for what's
our iterator our iterator is where I
equals
we were string dot like wait is that
it's that's the name of the function
takes in the parameter STR which in this
case is hello
okay so STR dot length minus one then I
is is it greater than equal to greater
than equal to
well what are what are we trying to do
we're starting at what the high end of
the string right that's what your eye
says so that I is an O and we're saying
for the length and length last one so
where are we trying to go we're trying
to go to the H yeah and at that point we
want to stop all right
so what is it I'm not getting what
you're saying so let's see so Mar I
equals string dot length minus one left
puts us at 4 1 2 4 and we wanted to you
said you want his eye is greater equal
to string not length this isn't correct
okay
because is I ever greater than or equal
to string Nutley if one is this is five
and we're starting off at four is
forever greater than five no so
obviously there's something wrong with
your logic here yeah now we're trying
we're trying to go from the end of the
string which has a higher index to the
beginning of the string which has the
smallest index sure now what everything
all right now how do we grab each letter
add it to a chef
Str bracket I
in this case James you can yes you can
iterate through a string because each
character has a has a let's do that
before we do anything else has a bracket
so call us about log SCR hi so let me
show you real quick ask you get out of
here man we're not doing Elsie
I wouldn't ask so if we run our string
super turn hello but
see how it's returned eol e o ll that's
what the two stands for okay o ll eh so
you're on the right path now the
question is how do we saw how do we
store that data and return it as a
single stream oh yeah variable okay
where are we creating that variable at
the top above the function yeah
oh no Roger even though last time who
are a total at the top
so okay so the reason you don't put it
there is because we need to reset total
every time so here we're sending it to
an empty string and the reason for that
is because remember we plan on reusing
our code so we have to set it here to
get reset the next time that the
function is called if we set it outside
here what would actually happen is total
would just keep on growing okay so based
off what we know with total what do we
do next
we we put our string into we put our
values that's good okay so you're saying
I do something with total here what do
we do
all equals
Str brackets i okay and then we want to
return toll okay
so when we run it what do we actually
get here so it's actually getting
returned is so doesn't show you a good
error message here but this is incorrect
so we're not getting hello what's
actually getting returned what's
happening every time we set this locally
in this scope so total is equal to on
str 0 what is their str for was oh oh it
has me uh str
would you write that like negative like
- no no no we're resetting the total
value every time instead of if this was
a number and I was saying total is equal
to five and then I want to say total is
equal to six
but I was supposed to add total is equal
to 5 plus 6 what is incorrect with Tiger
setting up your variable I need to put
an ad in there okay now what is the ad
plus STR I where's the plus going
you see you
it's going
between the stra line right there all
right no it's not
that's this will actually break
your code yeah
no it's inside then
nope that's not it either well then it's
that Plus as to your I again no we're
resetting the value of total every time
so when let's let's walk through this
real quick don't want to reset the value
total yeah so how do we not reset the
value of total totals not to keep it how
do we tell total to keep it how do we
keep total while still adding the new
value to it what is that what is that
well how do we take five and add six to
it to make eleven
I don't know how to write that okay well
I'll show you three different ways plus
equals what is plus equals mean it means
so little is equal to total Fassett we
could do total is is equal to that but
are see if I said told equals a total I
was thinking of the opposite but what
you should be doing is using the string
function can cat concatenate strings
together so JavaScript's little funky
and the fact that that it will allow you
to can't really not in you wanna string
with this alright so I'm going to show
you this real quick and what we may do
now is as you can continue going through
your code we'll start going back to w3
schools in the JavaScript section so
that you can know that these things
exist so see how says hello world here
it takes text one text to this text 3 is
equal to text one.com cat forget that
this is there because we don't want to
concatenate B hello world next to each
other but all you can all you have to do
is kind of cat that to your value so in
our case here I'll put this up over here
as as documentation so on the right hand
side we have our example on our left
hand side how do we set up total
so tall equals just taught those tall
out to be of are a variable yes it's a
string variable well we set that up up
here with our quotations right sokka cat
is a string method meaning all these
works with strings in this case so we
want to add the two strings together all
right
so total equals
now we want to use we want to keep the
same values
so total equals total hot pink at what a
Rican County the STR I string good job
um arrays also have concat if you have
two arrays you want to add them together
you can do it with concat so arrays and
strings yes nothing else oh all right
that was good uh progress is being made
remember how hard these these algorithms
Jizzle know I've reached my limit
remember idea I'm gonna get super
frustrated with the next one good
feelings remember how hard these
algorithms for when we're getting
started
Caesar hi it's good sign of progress
also a good reason to get yourself some
tutoring sessions the low price no but
should you use cacao for streets you can
I just on with it so progress is being
made we are now moving on to more
advanced stuff um I didn't have to help
you too much with these algorithms I
would be fairly confident that if I left
you here tomorrow you could solve them
again and I think what we will do is
have you do exactly that when we get
started tomorrow we will continue
through and we will start reviewing
JavaScript methods and things like that
and that will be really helpful as you
continue on trying to understand what
tools are available for you as well as
trying to think like a programmer which
is the hardest part
today was good happy Friday everybody
was all inside
is anything you wanna say before I I
send this up to my schpeel
yes why you code long and prosper yes no
syntax errors today so thank you guys as
always we are one-fourth of the way
there I hope you take this as
inspiration that in 25 days you can go
from being completely in mind you we've
only spent less I would say probably the
last maybe 14 days of the 25 stunning
JavaScript and here we are two weeks
later solving two algorithms together in
relative quick secession going over the
basics kind of reiterating things until
they're they're pounded into your head
and we're going to continue doing that
so I hope you you guys see that you can
make quite a bit of progress and we're
only a fourth of the way there
solve two basic algorithms I'm pretty
impressed by that and we'll continue
moving forward and right when these
sharp feeling easy there'll be a nice
hard section moving forward and that's
kind of programming in a nutshell is you
get good at the stuff that you practice
and then when you get good at that you
move on to the hard stuff again but uh
thank you for watching as always don't
forget to join our Facebook group if you
want to support me
you can at patreon.com slash code new
tutorials 360 in the meantime make sure
that you join our Facebook group I have
some big giveaways coming out soon for
Facebook members big big big big lots of
announcements in the next two weeks
so um I highly encourage you guys to be
on there and it'll be good stuff so
thank you for watching I will see you in
the next video and I guess that's
tomorrow
as April says code long and prosper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
