camp we're working on that free
developer certificate and we're in basic
algorithm scripting the bonfire title
case of sentence so first thing I did
when I look through here is I look at
these helpful links so what does char at
do char at will select a character of a
string so if char at 0 will give us in
this case we started just with this
whole string it would say I if we said
char at wine it would give us this so
we're going to need to be able to use
what we did in the previous section
spawn fires and work with that so and
somehow integrate char at with it so so
far what's been pretty successful is
breaking up the big string into little
strings so we do that by creating an
array of strings and we split up our
strings with a space so um but uh I
guess what go over these exercises
basically we just want to capitalize
every single word and we also want to
lowercase the rest of the word so in
this case it's you can see it's going to
return here is my handle with just one
letter capitalized per word alright cool
so the first thing we did is we created
an array of strings next thing we're
gonna need to do is to iterate through
that string so we're gonna do a for a
for loop far I it's just a kind of our
placeholder we start at 0 we're gonna
say Y is less than the words in our
array of strings dot length so the words
that are left in our array of string so
what length we want to increment it by 1
so a couple two there's probably
numerous ways you can do this how I did
it was I created a placeholder here and
just set it equal to the original word
because
what I wanted to do was I wanted to
change the first letter and then
concatenate it with the rest of the word
in the lowercase form so how do we do
that
this goes back to our char at so we have
our placeholder we're going to create a
var and this one's just going to be the
all we want in a letter here is the
first letter of the word and then we
want to uppercase it so we go to our
placeholder and when we say dot char at
a assure you it's all right
tense char at 0.2 uppercase so if you
remember uppercase will uppercase the
whole word so that's why we have to
select only the first character so what
next so I was trying to find a way to do
this without bringing in any other
functions and methods string functions
but this is kind of the best solution I
found so we're gonna take our
placeholder remember our placeholder is
our original string and what do we want
to do is we want to slice that string
meaning that we're gonna use the slice
we'll take away part of the string so in
this case we just want to take away the
first letter of the word and then we
want to lowercase it and then after that
we're gonna concatenate it with our
Ridge with our up letter and then it
will return the array of strings at the
end so first thing first we we want to
slice our string up so we're going to
take the original string that's being
used as placeholder we want to slice it
at the one position so starts at zero so
we're saying skip the the very first
zero index position and start at 1 and
go all the way to placeholder dot length
so however long our word is and then
while you're at it
go ahead and lowercase that because we
need
because it's not the first letter we
need it to be lowercase so cool so from
here all we have to do is concatenate
our strings back into the array so array
of strings is equal to extra strings I
so because this so it needs to iterate
through each one is equal to up letter
so the first letter that's capitalized
dot can cat with our new string
placeholder okay so we're still
returning STR here so what we have to do
now is join it all back into one string
so we have to say STR is equal to array
of strings dot join and every time we
join it we want to put a space in
between it like I originally was and
then when we run it oops
let's see array of strings one of these
is wrong set it placeholder is not
defined
oops
so there we go so let's go ahead and put
our comments in here so we know we're
talking about so again this splits one
strict one string into in an array of
strings separate separated by spaces for
loop placeholder for original string
selects first letter and uppercase is it
selects second letter to two and of the
word and lowercase is it concatenates
uppercase first letter and a rest of
lower case word takes array and sets
this yard to a single string so now you
can see when we run it we're good to go
here if you like me you should shout
from mountain top top that you finish
this up submit and go on to the next
challenge and up next it looks like
we're going to be returning the largest
number in the array okay so that
shouldn't be too bad we just have to
iterate through some numbers and use the
comparison operators and then we just
store is this if this number is bigger
than this changed the value of this
number and keep going through it so I'll
see you guys in the next video and if
you obviously so this video is only
about eight minutes I work through these
beforehand and so realistically doing a
little bit of research and looking up
the slice function this probably took me
about 45 minutes so if that's what it
takes you without the video it's all
good guys and if it takes you longer I
don't care if it takes you all the day
every day just keep it up man it's it's
a it's some it's so easy to get down on
yourself when you're getting started in
programming it's very easy to get
confused just keep watching the videos
and keep doing what you can
and as always constructive criticism is
appreciated and I'll see you guys in the
next thanks for watching the video don't
forget to Like and subscribe that helps
me out a ton and I appreciate all the
comments that I get and all the
questions I get in the comments and I'm
happy to answer them so keep them coming
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
