code camp we're doing angularjs so what
it's asking us right now is to open up
our app info j/s so let's go ahead and
follow that so jess direct is app info
Jas and then in here we're going to
create our directive so just save a
little bit time we're going to copy
pasta this into here and you're in it
there you go so we've added our
directive to the app info jas now we
want to include a new new script tag
here
to index on hmm so we're going to create
our script tag we're going to set the
source equal to and then whatever our
app info de jss should be this
gonna close this up a little bit so
then we want to close our script tag all
right now it's going to run that so that
should add the script in our directives
here so did you include us track this
app info as a script element in the view
this is the view
oh excuse me we're adding it in the
wrong place I think let me try running
out one more time no no we're heading in
the right place
so you don't do anything with that you
don't do anything with that eventually
do something with that
that's resurfaced
alright guys I'm just going to add this
directive here did you make a directive
no we haven't so it's going to have this
here
alright so we're going to create are
directed here and we're going to add
that to happen fo touch is so let's go
ahead and open that up
cool so we've added that trap in photo/j
s now we want to create a script element
here 948
is
should be this fam bam thank you ma'am
so we're going to call our directives
cool so we're calling our directive here
basically just saying hey we're going to
use this directive now in our app info
dot HTML we're essentially going to
create some stuff what are we going to
create first we're going to create an
image we're going to name it class is
equal to icon now we're going to then
get the source using angular so ng
source is equal to because it's a string
will put in quotes and then in here
we're going to put info icon so that's
our image cool then we're also going to
create at each to class we're going to
call it title and that is going to
include
that is going to include our info title
pretty good so far and then we're going
to create a class called a paragraph
class we're gonna set that equal a
developer and then we're going to go
ahead and suck info dot developer and
then we're going to have to close our
paragraph tag as well finally one more
we're going to create another paragraph
class is equal to price from here in our
paragraph might as well close it while
we're at it we're going to go ahead and
close that and in here we're going to
get info price so get the price of it
essentially and then filter it so that
it comes out looking like currency so
assuming I to make any mistakes there
and typing it out in which last icon and
GF source equals I don't know if that
matters do you just lay absent from
dresser
which sister so let's see what's going
on here so that first line seems to be
right the
to display an appt sinful NJ services
they did
so h2 class title info title just put
some spaces here or just want to make it
look identical and then same thing for
info developer p class equals developer
and then like so we'll also put a little
bit space here this here this here place
here and I think that's right so p class
equals surprise yeah so I'll definitely
make sure you have the spaces correctly
I don't know if that's part of angular
or not but uh definitely something i'll
be looking up and kind of seeing if
maybe it interprets it just as string if
we don't have those spaces there
something like that so something keep an
eye out for so an index 1.html replace
the contents of the first card div just
pull this up so with the new app info
element so we have diff class card so
what we want to do is get rid of all
this crap that we're using here and then
we just want to simply apply app dash
info and then the info is equal to move
and then we want to go ahead and close
our app info now I'm guessing our app
info and our controller somewhere that's
what we haven't named so many files now
let's see so this is our app info right
here so that's what we're calling right
here essentially we're saying a app info
in film move so let's go let's go ahead
and go back to place the contents of
that information do the same for the
second and third card alright cool so we
have our first card or card here I guess
we did it once we want to go ahead and
do the same copy that
oh so they want us to replace it like so
so we're basically just going to set it
to a different version of card if I
understand correctly I think I do so we
have this oops excuse me and then we
want to go ahead and do the same here
with our game board
better run that
cool so that's our first part I took a
minute
so our app infos letting us target each
one of these things sure sure
oh cool
now it's getting that from somewhere I'm
just not quite sure yeah where I'm sure
we set it somewhere let's go ahead and
move on and probably be more apparent
just so in our prop in our controller
all right so this is where was our main
controller that's we're targeting them
and that's how with each one of these
are objects and with these objects were
just calling the values of it so and
this is using the app info that it's
basically knowing where to get these
values because we've already
predetermined it in another file
essentially so you know in the
controller's new property called
forecast so we have a new image display
this property in view by creating
another div class card alright cool so
we now have a new object forecast you
want to display play it so we will then
create a div we're going to say class is
equal to card sorry I give it's the same
let's close that div and then within
here we're then going to create app dash
info and we're going to give it a class
excuse me info equal to
forecast yeah forecast and then all we
want to do is close app dash info and
now when we run it it should display
everything for forecast cool everything
is working out nicely so we're going to
create a new property scope apps set it
equal to an array of objects so let's
see here in the controller we're in main
controller create a new property so
within each one of our array objects
here we are then going to add like on
the move scope done apps
see here if I understand correctly so so
scope dot apps and then we want to set
it equal to this
oops alright let's see if that works I
think that's what they're asking I'm not
one hundred percent sure i'm still
learning angular this is my first time
doing this course so let's see that is
not what they want us to do so we have
moved
bigger scope did you create scoped out
apps and set it equal to an array so
let's see maybe that's what we did wrong
here is they still want to do within its
own array
oh that is what they wanted cool so we
have an array that takes in 11 it has
one index right now so at two more
objects to the right describing your
favorite apps now Jesus all right so you
excuse me uh so we have two x's we
actually have two things in here so
let's go ahead and add two more just to
save a little bit time I'm gonna copy
this format here and then we'll go ahead
and copy pasta that anything so icon
will leave that loan title we will call
it call it something different test 1
and then developer but cody tutorials 60
and we'll go ahead and just copy this
over and do it one more time now when we
run it we should be good
cool so we've then we've created scoped
out apps which is going to store these
all in an array and they in this in the
view so let's go back to our index HTML
that's our view you in the view use
ng-repeat to loop through each element
to do this use a noodle tree to cluster
all right so what we want to do here in
the view outside I'm just laying it on
to do this f ing p to the clinic are so
we're going to take will take this first
one ng dash or p equals then we're
supposed to put something here
then use the customary
in g dash okay so a pin apps I think
it's app in apps I think that's what
they want so you'll see right here it
worked it's basically for this one it's
going to go through and do the four so
if not it doesn't do the one that we
chose but in this one it looks like
everything is a saying we're repeating
four times I guess it doesn't matter
that it won't do that so we're going to
repeat through the app in apps four
times so I think think we're good there
so it's still apt at jas create a new
directive named install app so let's
kind of try and remember how to do this
again you're like me and you forget all
this crap the good thing is you can kind
of usually pull most of it up and
remember just go ahead and pull up app
info you know app info is so we can kind
of base it off this template we're just
app dot directive a name and a function
alright so we're just going to say app
dot div and then from here we're going
to pass in a name
it wants us to name it install the app
and then create a function here that's
going to do some stuff
alright use after extracranial directive
called install app use the restrict
option to create a new element so I
don't fully remember we have restrict
okay and apparently the e is going to
allow us to create a new element and we
want to return something okay so we need
to let's try restrict be first let's see
what happens so restrict e so the scope
to an empty object
this is temple your eyes so they really
want us to use all of this ok I'll see
what's going on now so we're going to
return restrict e and we're going to set
scope equal to an empty object so we can
take out this info here there's nothing
in there for now excuse me bad habit of
mine so we're just going to set it to an
empty object kind of close this one and
then we want the template URL to go to
to go to oh my goodness please open up
right here Jess directors install out
dot HTML so this is where to display
more or less and we have our empty scope
and we set restrict to a element leaf
because we're just going on here app
that directive install app let's see if
that fixes our mistake here
nope alright so we have install app
refer to the app info directive create a
function and return something did you
create a new directive named install app
yes I did I gave it a function I return
some stuff
let's see if that fixes
having some issues oh there goes nice
little space all right so include this
new javascript file index dot HTML as a
script element so we are going to pull
up our index HTML file and in here we're
gonna include this and this was a
directive so we're going to put it under
our directive thing here so that's good
convention so script SRC equals and then
within here we'll just go ahead and we
have our stall fjs so
we can just go ahead and copy this and
then put it in here so this is where our
file is located so you know what to do
essentially just go ahead and run that
make sure we're synced up
very nice and then in the install app
directive we need to add a fourth option
a link and type in the following
function oh my goodness alright so
install app directive and a fourth
option named link and then type in the
following equation so here's our
directive and we want to add this
craziness that's going on here let's
just go ahead and just add it and see
cuz there is a whole mess of nonsense
going on here
think that's what we need to do there
yeah let's let's get the code on this
and see what they wanted I cool so it
still needs to be within our return okay
that's where our mistake was because
otherwise we're not returning anything
and so it doesn't matter if this works
or not because we need to see it work
because it's going to be displayed in
the view so I think that's why has to be
in the return that makes a little sense
but in class equals 0 in the new file J
is so we created this new file this
looks like it's going to be a new view
because it's a dot HTML file so big
usually let's see here any HTML file is
really going to be a view types of
button button dash active and then we're
also going to apply the angular
directive ng-click is equal to the
download function so when you do that go
ahead and download it and we want to
close the modem / button then right here
we want to call button text and when we
run it it should display a button if
it's been linked already well I button
class BTN btn-primary
should be identical I'm not sure where
my syntax is wrong but it's just that's
not important as long as we understand
that creating some HTML that will be
displayed eventually so finally in this
new directive what we want to do is in
our original index we want to add the
new install app element inside card to
have under app info so we have app info
under app info we want to install here I
will say its soul dash app
inside the crew
so we created all right let's just run
that see what what air gives us oh
that's all we need to do very nice so
now our install adesh app comes so if
you go back here to our was an art was
our controllers know where do we start
anyhow so we created this in our install
thing and now it we linked it using the
install app very nice oh I know for me
personally I might have to work on my
terminology and fully understanding how
to link these but all in all I really am
enjoying angular and how it splits it
all up once I once I more fully
understand how you split things up and
eventually i'll learn more of these
directives such as ng-repeat ng-click
and ng SRC are pretty much the only ones
that i kind of fully understand i would
say so i hope you guys found this
helpful i'm really enjoying it and in
the future i'll be doing some free code
camp projects in angular so try and get
better all right let's see what's up
next your services to start
communicating with a server pretty cool
definitely what going to be one of the
harder things from what I've been told
so if you're not familiar with databases
and servers and all that sort of stuff
get ready get ready to understand JSON
objects and I'll try and break down as
easy as possible thanks for watching
