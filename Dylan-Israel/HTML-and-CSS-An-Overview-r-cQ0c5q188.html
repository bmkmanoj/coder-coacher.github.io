introduction to CSS CSS cascading style
sheets and overview so let's get started
here we're just gonna be taking a look
at this and this is basically probably
what we're gonna be making here okay
let's get started
oh what's this sir oh okay so this is
what it looks like without the style
sheets and when we remove the comments
this is what it looks like now so you
can see how that can drastically change
everything we just did so pretty big
difference all right click on style she
does CSS
all right so only put spam we want to
change the color to blue I guess so this
is our style sheet doing style sheet
things much of this is regular text but
some of it is fancy we can use our newly
fancified font to add some flair to our
website I'd be a real plane to make each
of these span tags fancy individually
but it's a cinch with CSS okay go to the
style sheet oCSS to have until the span
selector that you want the font family
to be cursive check and if you need help
all right so if you remember fog -
family I guess let's see here alright so
we can change the font family that makes
sense
I look C P style color purple check it
out on purple this is a less awesome way
to style your website for reasons we
just mentioned okay so this is called
him how to do in my style it's a h-sama
well like we did before but now we're
able to do it from style sheet so don't
have to redo it again and again and
again so but in order to do that we have
to link it so where do we do it okay I
guess as long as we do it within HTML
I'm guessing Bill works over in our link
then type equals all right we need text
slash cascading style sheets Allen RL is
equal to style sheets CSS and there's
one more bleep aah aah aah no style
sheet and then Oh accidentally delete it
all right so this is us and what was the
last part of it href I want to see size
44 fonts all right oh no not too bad so
oh we did forget this make sure to close
it okay
not too bad let's let's do some syntax
stuff with CSI okay time for a some CSS
all and got enough color as a few
selectors ink
alright so if I remember correctly it
goes a little something like this
oh there there we go so simple as that
so all our paragraphs are gonna be green
alright now underneath the color green
property value pair but before the final
closing sit the color green family I
think called Garamond and then size 24
yes so before we are rewriting this
again and again and again for each
paragraph in each heading now we could
just change the style sheet to use those
we want alright so make all h3 heading
to read set all the paragraphs career
alright so number h3 we want to color
them red and then we want the paragraphs
to make the font and my courier and we
want a second paragraph contains text
between Spanish mystics its background
color is fabulous I know we want to
expand
and set it to background color to the
yellow cool so you can see all our
changes are taking place we haven't done
anything to the actual index on HTML
page
all right so sir semicolons and brackets
out of whack here so let's just go ahead
and fix that so that our styling she
fixes itself and that should be what
we're trying to do there oh this one
right here easy enough just checking to
make sure we know what you're talking
about here
set the CSS we've added for the piece
lectern stylesheet
okay so it wants us I think it just
wants us to comment out or come here
so just standard cup goes similar to
Java almost all right add a link to the
style sheet between your head okay so if
you remember we have a link link equals
God I forgot how to do this already
and then there's href so share worker
try remember here link equals text slash
CSS then we have rail equals style
sheets and then we have a try equals a
dress people style.css alright so yes
one second alright guys let's get back
to it apologize for the disruption its
fourth of July dogs parking at the
so we were able to take the style sheet
we set up the link for it next we're
going to change H ones header font
family so remember to declare what we're
trying to change here and we are going
to change that to verdana all right at
all we also want to make a change to h3
happy fourth of july by the way although
this video will probably be up after the
fourth but it is the buck ounce
alright so fun family career alright and
then what else we need to make paragraph
text
purple and then how to comment alright
so let's see where we potentially went
wrong here
let's see what this type equals text CSS
okay so it looks like we just need a
space there well stylesheet hate riffs
let's go ahead and we'll just go back a
page and see so link oh it's a link type
okay so
link type and there we go this is a few
syntax issues so here it looks like all
the H ones issues if you want to check
out the stylesheet just to see what's
going on here these are the hexadecimal
values for colors I'm sure there's some
website you can get any color you want
if you just want a specific red or in
case marine make the h3 color alright so
you want to make color town CC six six
six six it's the same way just a
different way of calling it it's just a
very very specific color so found eight
a to be paid to alright so in this case
we've done quite a bit so we've done P
style one M two M point five nine and
would seem to be so relative measure yes
all right so one I'm is the default
default font this is half the default
and this is two times default so let's
see here sets font family the h1 alright
some
h3 well I'm going to be in cursive
we're gonna hang of it the style sheet
up at times is an option for a while or
Seraph okay so apparently we can add
options here
for Sarah you want there to be a time
and then very Donald and Baldy
so painless changes it a little bit
I said time for a little free
PlayStation yes also crying practice
what you learned go bananas we'll just
go ahead and continue on feel free to
test everything out but will be plenty
of tests ahead of us out feeling okay
sift the background color to this okay
so set the width
are we doing background so make sure
you're using background color for your
gif not color okay so it literally
setting and we're with I'm just setting
that to 100 px as well you can see right
there we have our it's for cool nice so
in our style sheet set your TD tables
have a high difference alright so
alright guys sorry for the disruptions
so in this case our table data cells we
want to give them a height a default
height of 53 X and then we also want to
give them a border of 1 px
- to blue I guess so
yes so there you can see it's kind of
working right there and then we want to
give our table a table as default a
border:1px solid black you can see
around there our whole table and bam so
we can augment the table and the table
components as well so give your selector
a color of Pouncy see alright so
gonna say a and equal to and then we are
also in a text-decoration:none surely
text picture oh maybe it's the
underlining of it so it's changing the
direct
not too bad okay now without looking at
a are thing we're gonna remember how
does our link work Oh
apparently it's just for the headaches
after the header there's another word
link type there we go link type equals
text slash this s rel equals stylesheet
and then we have link type where l8r ax
equals stylesheet dot CSS per shift end
it so there's that save and submit I'm
good to go
and from there we want to add a pair of
h1 h1 not tags in the body element
there's a h1 slashes one which won't say
anything you what my dog my dog is a lot
I'm on the CSS that make font family
room
alright so we're gonna reset h1 or units
on special parameters of aunt family
rajamma
and we don't wanna set its color to 4
and so it changes the color and next we
want to add a pair of paragraphs down
the body so we have paragraph tags and
in here pretexted like because fireworks
here now we're going to change it and in
this case I set the font size and color
to pound for a for 9:40 so it gives it a
kind of a grayish color and save this
right good all right now you want to set
the paragraph font family to everyone
and give each one a backup on ancestor
and backup ponch
love syrup for paragraph alright add an
image series channel docket so we're
talking about dogs let's type in just go
to cartoon dog damage Yara go back to
what we're doing here and we want to put
it a little right actually let's put a
bub
so if you're in our image us star seed
equals stairs that miserable dog and
you're going to work and we're gonna set
the height equal to 100 px now we're
going to set the width both 300 px and
you see it distorts the picture they
were hard coding the values in here and
then we want to give a border to it so
we'll do border:1px solid found four six
eight two equals so you get a little
thin border you can see if we change
this to like 20 it's a massive border
saw one four six eight to be more I said
dude let's just gonna copy this and
we're gonna reset the code see if that
helps you remember to add an image oh we
forgot the image those we reset the code
so let's do this
oops ctrl 0 see if that might help there
we go
sometimes the when were to zoom in a
little bit
it messes it up we found that earlier
when it's changing the font so you ever
come across any issues just trying to
hit ctrl 0 and it will hurt
yeah ctrl 0 I'll take you to where you
go alright so I want to add a link to
our HTML page edit this so say change
your text decoration to none all right
so
No so you see it's not underlined
anymore now we're gonna change the color
from blue to whatever pounds you see
zero the reserve yours and now in this
case it's red so you can see that the
importance of stylesheets there's a lot
of good ones out there like bootstrap is
a popular one that it's kind of help you
design a nice little site for yourself
and let's see what we're doing next so
firstly as always we're gonna share and
it looks like we're going to be
designing a button for our site so maybe
something like this so this looks pretty
cool and we're getting more and more
into it and it's I'm enjoying style
sheets I've always really liked style
sheets especially if you're doing a lot
of web pages it'll work out really well
for you there's a lot of free great ones
out there already so bootstrap is one
that a lot of people years I believe
that people from Twitter designed it and
a good percentage of websites use it so
check it out if you're looking for a
good style sheet yeah I'll see you guys
next video when we design our own
buttons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
