fights doing alternating sums this one
is kind of a gimme in typical codified
fashion they give you a hard one at the
end and then the beginning of the next
section they're typically a little bit
easier in this case all we're trying to
do is we have one team and two teams so
we want to find out what the scores are
by alternating sums what that means is
one gets the even numbers and one gets
the odd numbers pretty pretty
straightforward when you think about so
we're going to go ahead along with the
convention that they've provided and
create team one team two initialize
those zero after that we're going to go
ahead and create for each loop and we're
going to we are going to create a for
each loop and pass in our callback
function and in here we'll take an
element which will be the value as well
as whatever index wrong we're gonna need
that index attribute so that we can find
out if the index is even or odd so that
we know what team to add to and then we
can we can say the certain if statement
so if I should index modulo two equal
equal to zero means it could mean it's
it meaning it's even go ahead and add
5151 plus equals element else go ahead
and do the opposite right go ahead and
say team two
let's equals the elements and then at
the end here we just need to return an
array with those two values and a team
one comma two to drop our semicolon I
don't really need it there but should be
all the same and that should be it
so again let's go over the logic real
quick a little bit of an easier one but
we have two variables that were storing
the even and odd values in and we're
doing that with the a for each the
element is the value in the array the
index is the current index number that
it's there we use the index number find
out if it's even if it's even we add
that that index value to that else we're
adding the other one finally we're just
returning an array with the two values
in the form that the algorithm is asking
for but as always guys thank you so much
for watching the video this was a little
bit of a quicker one I originally didn't
use a for each loop I just use a for
loop and use I but I wanted to change
this to part of the fun of do of redoing
these is saying hey I think I can maybe
make an improvement here and even though
it runs with the same amount of
iterations and all that sort of stuff
for me I need to be more comfortable
using the documentation to the fullest
right so current value and then index
stuff like that and that allows me to
become a better developer so when you're
solving these algorithms try to
especially in the easier ones go back
and say hey what is one thing that I
know I can do but I don't necessarily do
it even if it's just the same thing
you're saying you know what I don't ever
use a for each loop and so in the
situation where I can start using for
each loops it looks a little bit more
sophisticated I would say maybe just
having additional skills it's not like
you're going to forget a for loop or
anything like that you probably won't
forget it for each loop but this is just
a simple example of how maybe you can
write a little bit better code when
you're solving these
but again as always guys thank you for
watching join the Facebook group code
