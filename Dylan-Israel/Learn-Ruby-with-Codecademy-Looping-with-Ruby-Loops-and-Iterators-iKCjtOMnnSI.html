user input so we print a regular
statement then we declare our variable
user I'm just going input and get stop
now we're gonna save and submit it
this is user input we'll just put my
name Dylan
so alright cool let's see next we want
to call it down case method on user
input so make sure that include
explanation places use a string of small
items like this all right so just save
all the time copy and pasting this in
here so we're gonna say user input dot
down is exclamation point user input is
Dylan and you can see that it got
lowercase time do I have a little
control flow say stream to check
includes substring so this is gonna
evaluate if it includes something and
let's see here
seriously if user comes for a foot dot
includes include rather question mark
now we're gonna say D
oh if it finds an S
okay so directions say find s now pretty
string of your choice grants their
chains
MS alright let's see here
so line five
let's see strings included so it's
saying oh okay
yeah don't forget the end statement
alright so we'll say we'll do my middle
name because there's an asset
see I'm identified method up include
okay and also make sure you put in that
in there so little things there we go
this contains an S and then a good old
nil all right so we want to remove the
print statement we're now going to use
the G sub and here we are going to put
when I say user underscore input and put
we're gonna look at the example real
quick G sub and takes two parameters
that be slipped exclamation point
slash a slash that's gonna replace s and
there and then we want to replace it
with a string of th so we're gonna put
Christopher in here again
and you can see it for play see us know
like Tanna also down case if one
previous example sorry next quick thing
here send me up the else branch we got
print rather are no this is
there is a single s and that sounds a
little bitter sound a little weird
alright so we're just going to do Dylan
this time and you can see there's no s
so that was a pretty nice all right
returning the final string the earth tht
ring all right out of puts statement
that this is a name space and comma oops
actually there's a pound user say back
pound user underscore put too much Java
lately messing it up for period here and
that should do it I believe this here
Dylan my name this there are there's not
a single s in here so princess this is
my name Dylan cool congratulations it's
gonna make me have a list but again if
I'm not careful and ischl if statement
sorry prompt the user I enough pondering
for now click Save to complete this
project okay so in here just go over
real quick a week got a refresher real
quick gets a chomp down case how to find
out if there's a letter in the string
probably use that for integers as well L
statements and and only puts it print it
out so we'll do it again do Dylan and
then we're gonna share again to
encourage people to go this great free
site and next up what do we have to look
forward to it's going to be a new
section loops an iterator so we're going
to be using the while loop that should
pretty pretty cool so a little bit of a
longer section so now we're going to
slowly just be integrating everything
really so I'll cover that next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
