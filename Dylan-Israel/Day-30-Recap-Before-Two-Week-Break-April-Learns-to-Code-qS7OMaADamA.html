earlier
sometimes do
really cool out
No stop it
I hope in a new place in fairness
or so it's good it's just skipping about
one in four frames ah so it's gonna be a
little choppy it looks like maybe it's
even in now right now okay so this is
day 30 we're going to a nice recap today
we are going to be taking a two-week
break for for myself I have requested
this at the end of the day I need some
time I'm getting sick and we're moving
in about 8 days so we're gonna be taking
about 2 weeks off it'll give me time to
heal and to work on my side projects a
bit and during the 2 weeks
April is going to continue her study
they say that it takes about 30 days to
build a habit so I think we're at a good
place where if we were going to take a
break
30 days is a good place to do it so now
you've kind of built the habit of
studying every day and go from there so
let's talk a little bit about what you
learned in your first 30 days so of
coding like what what would you would
you expect and what what did you expect
I kind of expected it all to be honest
um I was um maybe there's like one thing
that I didn't expect was how good I was
at CSS which I was like super happy
about like think because I thought I was
gonna have issues with it like I have
with JavaScript it's like I'm gonna get
caught up on the first thing I don't
know but HTML I pretty much have had a
history with so that was pretty easy for
me
I I keep thinking back to like when I
was coding as a kid and like you know
the blue screen and the white writing or
the black screen and the green writing
you don't remember that not I think
you're talking about like the Oregon
Trail games listen no no that's how you
used to call like you would like call
the system and then you would type in
what you wanted it to do and then you
click you know run and then I would run
it whatever a Luverne was high-tech I
guess um so hmm I mean JavaScript didn't
really scare me just because I was
already kind of expecting what was gonna
go um so I was happy with this yes
obviously to say it got through that
pretty quickly and I feel really
comfortable using it um I expected
having trouble at some point I knew that
I was gonna be frustrated and tired and
I was gonna have my own downs and I was
gonna have my apps pretty much know
myself pretty well so anytime I come
across anything that's gonna be I was a
difficult but I just had the word my
head there sorta did but I can't
remember challenged my um no just
something that means like learning
something new taking something new on um
new endeavor get it so I'm doing
something similar with my course and my
business I'm once earned all that so
yeah thank you really
oh I'm mad I'm like really
sidenote I'm like really excited for you
though for us well we're still like oh
jesus anyways Thank You Joshua I
appreciate it so yeah so um Dylan how
his feel about prior to that which is
really cool for me because the next like
time that we're up I'm going to be
playing catch up
so catch up as in like I'm gonna catch
up on my JavaScript notes I'm going to
review JavaScript I have the book that
godless monkey bought me which I really
want to get through I was reading some
of the author's notes and looking at
reviews and I'm just really excited to
start that as well and then I really uh
if what isn't like when I finish a book
I really like to get back to algorithms
so I'm really excited to have this
chance to kind of catch up on everything
because I just feel like we're going so
fast and I it's funny because it's only
an hour day on the computer with Dylan
and I'm starting on my own but I still
feel like we're going to show fast and
it's just like oh man I gotta play
catch-up and I was starting to feel like
it sit down and study and be like I'm
never gonna catch up and it was just
like it's ready to be it is starting to
come with a little bit disheartening to
sit down and study and know that I'm
probably so far behind
I don't know if I'm going to catch up to
where we are um you know as we're online
so a lot of people who were like I
noticed you were saying on chat we're
like oh my gosh you guys are so far
ahead of me or like oh you guys are
already there or something like that
right Joshua died no um no but a lot of
people were saying things like that so
not okay not a lot just you know the
noobs like me
ah um and then all the non news were
like hey you've got it you can do this
really helpful by the way so keep up the
great cheering guys appreciate it
hey I think regardless of whether you're
at a good place or a bad place I think
what Dutton the best skill that we've
got app that you've gotten out of this
is again the discipline to know that you
can study software every day I know
that's a really important factor for you
and that's where you're coming from with
this and I think it's really important
to coming out as well yeah and having
done that for now thirty days and really
longer than that because you're studying
HTML and CSS for about two weeks before
this way before that three weeks so
you've been going for about 45 weeks
yeah so um Jesus
so we already definitely going to be
taking the next two weeks off but I plan
on us doing a full hundred days it's
giving me time to finish up my side not
finish up but heal up I'm not feeling
too hot I also give April some study
time on her she's going to continue
studying daily as she has been and I'm
going to help her when she needs it but
uh I need that extra hour for me to move
get our stuff situated so we're taking a
little two-week break but we'll be back
I plan on us fully doing the hundred
days oh yeah for sure
do the hundred days that's not something
that neither him are I want to step away
from I just I'm not able to I'm not able
to make it into the isolate Network yeah
so we're moving into another apartment
but it's gonna be one room bigger yeah
so he finally will have his office all
to himself because it's so hard sharing
with April
yes so I'll have my office set up with
the green screen the lights my four
monitors I just picked up my other two
today actually um but yeah so we're
moving in apartment I'd like to buy a
house um we're just not sure where yeah
I don't know I think software's one of
those things where you can't at
depending on the company it is possible
to make a lot more money moving around
the pit it all depends right and so I
don't know what's up happening with my
job we'll just start working here is a
week ago
so we maybe one day is stressful is
having to tell your landlord hey I just
blew up the cage are you kami I'm afraid
of breaking because I'm like ah
it's gonna come out of my
deposit a damn it
I like break something on house I'm like
I know how to fix it I'll fix it but
this time it's like I have to pay
someone to fix it because I have to and
it's just like I hate that
I hate it no seriously my dad taught me
how to like lay my own piping and you
know all this stuff sells I know how to
lay the pipe also uh but yeah I'm
excited for the move are we're in about
a 1070 square foot apartment right now
we're going up to about a 14-under
square foot apartment so it's going to
be a little bit bigger a little bit more
space um I'll have my office and then
we'll have like a workout slash desk and
a room for me yeah so uh how did I love
the kitchen no I just you know scared to
well we kind of destroyed the top of the
oven I think there's no way to come back
from those you know the dishes that sit
inside of like the electrical stove well
there's been a lot of boiling over
so the drip pans are just okay was just
by new trip ends yeah we can but I don't
know how to put them in and and I don't
want to touch the stove look at them I
don't break it yeah thank thank you
Laura
it's it's more for me and then April I
need I need a break us a hundred days is
a long time for me to commit to it our
last room every I'm just really odd the
bonus of it is I get to catch up so I'm
excited I'm like oh I'm gonna get home
and I'm gonna study in code and what's
really great is the new workplace that
I'm at I tell people I'm like hey uh
first off I told them that I'm trying to
eat healthy and so everyone's like super
supportive of that which is like really
awesome making awesome play so like yeah
sure eat healthy and then they put cake
right on your desk um and then the next
thing is I tell them that like I work
out in the morning and then I come back
home you know I'll do what I can
the house not much uh I try but lately
I'm exhausted
and then I which is why I got the robot
vacuum she doesn't believe in the Robo
that she'll ever believe in the Roomba
boys I bought I bought the euphy which
is a robot vacuum it's not the room but
rumbas main brand we can't afford a
Roomba
got the euphy it's do you filter that's
the best puppy Big Ear you got oh just
put some vegetables in it you'd be good
kind of you know negative positive high
Neutron is it I still have to show you
that Roomba video where you do a dog oh
my god you have to show me that after
this ring watch that um no and then
afterwards guys I come home and we do an
hour of this or I but it kind of gives
me back that hour so I can finally sit
down and get my full three hours in
because after this hour like I don't
know what we do but honestly after this
one hour and then going and studying for
and more is just like well it's very
it's I'm used to it because I do it all
the time but it's very draining to have
to entertain and communicate for an hour
straight yeah as well as we got a couple
days for I aunts Dylan to turn off the
camera because I couldn't I couldn't do
it anymore I was like I don't know if I
can do this um by what was close I told
everyone today that I code after work
like I told them basically well I just
want to further my skills as an
individual and this is what I'm doing
and they're like oh my god that's so
great good for you and like when I left
they're like hey I hope you like you
know they were all super supportive and
it was weird because I went from like
zero energy to like a ton of energy and
I was just like super excited to come
home and you know get this done it's our
starting and everything
that's all I do you think that you were
super excited to come home because I was
here no because you're sick
you just couldn't wait to see me my
charming sir he's such a baby when he
said okay now he's he's been good this
time but lately before he landed and he
doesn't do anything and it's like mods
are sleeping post cheesy pizza
hahaha okay so um let's talk about what
you're going to do over the next two
weeks what is your game plan how are you
going to implement it because I would
like you to actually try the algorithms
from day one just try power through from
day one and that's what I would like
well what I can do like if you say if
you devote three hours a day I'd like
you spend one hour on an algorithm
because I want you to start applying
JavaScript that's SQL thing
so what I can do is spend one hour and
algorithms and two hours studying and
learning because you're not really good
ever learn to code your first language
until you start to use it so that's
that's the problems you really have to
start using it which is why I'm trying
to get you to jump in algorithms
otherwise you're just going to be
learning words and definitions and not
really cases of how it's used
realistically yeah that's true that's a
really good point but at the same time I
really am lacking in understand
ending of all the terms that we were
going over so I just really need to hit
it hard from both sides and that's
something for the next two weeks I
really do plan on catching up on notes
really getting the definitions of things
down for myself specifically mostly on
Java just because I do feel so
comfortable with HTML and CSS so I'm
just really going to jump on JavaScript
so hopefully what's today Wednesday yeah
maybe I think oh the store I don't know
it's been like really rainy down here
you guys part of them oh wow so I guess
like two counties today we're on like
something what is that but not
thunderstorm wash by like tornado watch
like how scary is that
Thank You Joshua I appreciate that
why is Josh always giving me a
trouble
there
I am taking care of myself man that's
why I'm going on this hiatus for two
weeks I need I need a little bit of my
mojo back
uh maximilian is a good instructor
one of course on udemy course do you
want to follow the book man
I'm gonna do the book no matter what so
I mean we gonna wait for me to do this
but I mean I already have a resource why
am i adding okay well bookmark this
what's up Kevin what do you like sick or
something
I just stress about his house
by the way guys even though people like
Joshua Jarek is giving me for
working so much and not taking a break
I'll have you know that I just signed a
new sponsorship to get you guys free
courses from several different locations
and so when I do move I will be giving
away a free course every video for the
next hundred videos oh yeah no no no
kitchens blew up well I don't know I
think I got burnt out I just think
there's a lot going on with work right
now and me getting sick and moving was a
little bit too much um because I mean I
was even when I got home today did you
drink
yeah don't lie to me I drink ice are you
doing it yeah where's the wrapper since
Josh can't work cuz I drink it but um I
think once I want once I launch my
course in about a month and I could kind
of relax a little bit
I've been a little stressed and whatnot
so
but positive that like I said you guys
get free courses every video once I
start launching it yeah we are supposed
to get like the what's that mine on ADIZ
or something
what's that half you're supposed to do
John gig says hey Dylan have you ever
looked into meditation and mindfulness
sounds like BS but I try to during
finals to help clear my mind a bit and
focus um so here's the thing guys I have
done yoga I did yoga for about a year
straight and I took a course at school
and I loved it and he's never been so
like focused and healthy very nice so
we've talked before on the channel about
me getting back in shape and for those
you who have uh who don't know April
shows a picture of me from like six
years ago
but um can I show them if you would like
to it is kind of uncomfortable
does show that what April shows when
people asked like who's your boyfriend
she shows a picture of me when I'm like
20 - mind you out there like 23 and I'm
like actually in shape and so I told her
I'm getting back in shape for health and
mine purposes and yoga is going to be
part of that so I may even do yoga
videos on the channel at some point at
the end of which I I answered questions
hi dear
um yeah Laurie it's hard this is what I
show them but uh so I'll be going on a
special diet exercise regime and also
I'll probably be doing yoga I'm gonna
make a do you even so this is I've been
trying to think of a way to do
livestream and gym where perhaps I would
lift and then answer questions
and then I don't know I've been trying
to think of a way to hold myself
accountable for 30 days while I try to
build that habit so I might do something
where for 30 days five days a week I do
the I do the the list live streams I
don't I don't know I don't know yet
though it's a little too much out of the
realm but maybe after each set I'll
answer questions
go back lift answer questions talk about
software or whatever I don't know what
I'm going to do but I've been for those
of you don't know also I've I've been I
gave up energy drinks as a way to be
healthier as you've probably seen in
every video I've had I'm usually sipping
on an energy drink I've been drinking
energy drinks for like 11 or 12 years
since high school um and 29 so I guess
probably about 12 years and so we're
between one to three a day and so I've
given them up not caffeine entirely um
you know I have a coffee or sometimes
I'll have a focus plus if I really need
some help coating which is a 100
milligrams to one of those but
the X effect ought to look into that um
it was hard for me too when uh so I kind
of slowly declined myself off of it
where I was drinking three energy drinks
a day and then I went to - next week I
went to one and then until then I drank
a I drink a week all those things five
at five hour energy every day until I
drank all of them in the house and I
drink some soda now some coke zero as a
little bit caffeine but my plan
eventually is stop drinking that also
but yeah so I'll definitely be doing
some yoga meditation it's hard I'll be
on it's just hard for me to sit still up
ever so like I have an issue if I'm not
constantly doing something or focus on
something I have issues sitting still
and so I I'll walk around I'll do
something I'll clean up I don't know
so it may be hard at first for me to get
back into the yoga and meditation but I
plan to it's definitely on our radar of
things to do which is why I'm really
happy about getting a third bedroom
because we can kind of really like
dedicated space to just being able to
get that chill tone I need for yoga and
still feel relaxed and okay good it up
baby I'm gettin swoll you're gonna see
me are you really as well last time I
know but I'm being slow this time so
what's gonna happen was your boys gonna
look like he got out of the coding
penitentiary where they send all the
hackers gotta come out yoke baby okay
okay
so yeah I mean everyone deals as
struggles and it's okay to have them but
and it's okay to sit with them for as
long as you need to but just realize
that the moment you complain you have a
choice
um no her my so I probably won't throw
my back out or something yeah
and then I'll have this for the next
three weeks trying to fix it for him um
so okay so you're going to continue
doing your book and doing the algorithms
on free code camp yes good that's the
game plan and I will help you answer all
your questions and whatnot over the next
two weeks now what will I do with this
free time you ask yes Dylan yetsko - god
what will you do if your extra time um
uh well I will continue to select today
I live stream for about 40 minutes and I
did two algorithms for content and stuff
like that I am in the process of of
building my course I'm also in the
process of getting you guys courses for
free I have about a hundred lined up
right now so we got plenty of stuff
coming out and I also have a I'm sure
I'm going to try and commit to a Monday
through Friday upload schedule with one
stream either Saturday or Sunday um and
I kind of want to figure out how to get
you involved in your own channel as well
Oh mommy now my own Jail yeah I want you
to I want you to search I was thinking
about doing a coding lifestyle from like
a female perspective um so I mean
obviously you guys won't see me and like
the atmosphere of it was it like
technology space till obviously I can
get an intern
or something but this hundred days is
kind of like the intro into like that
lifestyle of coding and something and I
wouldn't mind kind of just going I'm
just not as interactive as Dillon some
days I can be in other days I will just
be totally shut down so as long as you
guys can bear with me through my
awkwardness I think it'll work uh one
stream a week uh I don't know I usually
when I livestream guys I take the videos
down that night or the next day because
I don't plan on keeping them up because
I listen to music or something so um
nermal nermal Patel you're welcome and
I'm glad we're able to help you
absolutely yeah Laurie yeah I am Kevin I
think you guys are right like I've
actually looked for just like that okay
yeah sorry it's wrote justice
yeah so I'm gonna be one of those women
Laura I'm just I can't I have my moments
where I'm like sip your bubbly because I
like either I'm a super excited or I'm
happy to that day but some days I'm just
like super awkward and I'll walk by
people I know and not say anything
because I'm just so awkward but anyways
I looked for a channel for a female
coding and I didn't I didn't really find
any like I found like some weird ones
the girls the the hot chick soup code or
whatever yeah that kind of turned me off
from searching anymore it basically is
guy narrating this hot chick the guys
near it
I found one where the guy was narrating
a hot chick on a green scheme who was
just pointing out like the things that
he was talking about I'm like uh I don't
know that's genius
yeah not for me
you know and then the next thing was
like this hot chick whose breasts in my
face which you know some people like but
I could not pay attention at all so I
was just like I can't learn from this so
yeah yeah so I'm not a gamer though I
like watching gamers more than I can
play I would love to play if I knew how
to play like I play against robots and
it's sad so yeah so I think I'm going to
try and keep myself to a strict schedule
where Monday through Friday I haven't
upload every day and then either
Saturday or Sunday I do one to two
streams so I do like streaming but I
think it's going to be an off topic
stream where it might be a I'm buying
the HTC vive soon it might be a virtue
of me playing virtual reality game or it
might be me playing some other game and
just kind of hanging out having a good
time and going from there I haven't
really figured it out quite yet so I
guess there
fair to say that there's going to be
some expansion yeah and then once we get
on track with and two weeks from there
we'll do another I don't know what we
should do if we should do a week out of
time
30 days at time something maybe we've
gone a week off would be the best where
we go remember every other day yeah I
mean those are all things I think about
I think after the this two weeks was it
two weeks series two or three whatever
okay well after this break
I think that I will have a better idea
of where I stand with my skills and then
really be able to kind of like outline
what we monster doing because I mean I
would I would like to start you know
doing a vlog about my starting the
lifestyle of a coder and being a female
in that aspect and insight I don't know
the struggles one I'm actually already
did so I'm using a program that does the
dual stream right now so we're actually
going out to twitch and a YouTube at the
same time which is cool yeah oh when you
told me that I was like oh that's very
cool
but you just started using there oh yeah
a couple weeks I'll have used in the
past and I had issues I took it down
okay that's what I was since I was like
you told you why I love you about that
your new followers thank you Mike hunt
likes it wrong should wrap it up man
that's not the best advice um my advice
Mike hunt likes it raw
oh right raw food I I guess that wasn't
my interpretation Oh watch it a lot of
raw vegan videos so that's like exactly
where my mom's like like like around
like Rafi like unprotected sex or all
like Rob dog in it your that's it that's
what I am careful
oh no it's monogamous anymore there's
way too many STI is out there for me am
I gonna be doing engineer trip lifestyle
videos I don't think so man what do you
guys I'll do is how is it like being a
coding god yeah your father
oh no we get to see it every day I don't
know I might do some sort of engineer
truth videos because there are topics
that I'd like to talk about maybe money
investing saving your income to a degree
and how I do it and how you can't do
sort of things I don't necessarily like
to give advice for things that I haven't
taken or done in the past
I think that's um I think everyone
should be weary of that why you don't
like to people over that's so weird
yeah well I don't know a lot of people
give advice that they think is sound
advice but they've never had an
opportunity actually to carry it out or
like it's such a weird situation that it
worked for them like some people tell
you to take unpaid internship um and
things like that and I'm totally against
that cuz they pay an intern yeah I'm a
can't I'm not gonna lie to you I would
take an unpaid internship but that's
probably not going to be an option for
me so I won't but if I was living at
home
yeah one especially if it was like a
really good one like a really the best
thing is most of them never are because
unpaid okay well then why get an unpaid
one like if you apply to a bunch of them
and you have an unpaid and we get it you
get on pitch so like let's say you let's
say you have own experience not
necessarily because and this is off I'll
do a video about this but some people
does work out for this for sure so most
people doesn't though um cuz they don't
have any their budget to hire you at AMD
with that Kevin what's an AMD AMD is a
software company I saw they built they
build microchips Oh someone was talking
to me about buying a health insurance
like company stock I think it went up
like I forgot why I was talking about
but he made some good money is here
animals
yeah coding I want to pursue learning
code for my long-term goal that's
awesome
Congrats on the long-term goal most
definitely keep that going
yeah so that's true some colleges do
require internships and sometimes they
do have stipulations and what that
internship looks like so that's true
yeah what I was taking my graphics class
in school the next class that I was
going to have to take if I continued
would have been an internship at some
type of and the specific um they had
literally like this thick of a packet
about how specific the internship had to
be and the requirements that they had to
meet per my school and it's just like
how's pop that's why I didn't take this
second class my last semester as a
senior because I was like oh my gosh
because you're actually supposed to
start looking for an internship like
your junior year so uh
Nimmo Patel says where's some good
resources apart for free code camp like
I am a little less knowledgeable than
April so would you say it's good I would
say you should look into code Academy as
well as maybe a udemy course clearly
code Academy it's easy to understand
they touch on a lot of good basics cold
steel that's a good course that's ten
dollars called the web developer
bootcamp which is like 50 hours of
videos you know um Yale University has
lectures live on cutting I watch some of
that this morning I love lectures guys
it's stupid
why common eating well you know on free
code camp I don't know if you guys
notice but on the first project
it's not called can't like it's not
called free code camp what is it called
is like some weird name did they change
their name at some point a free code pin
yeah not that word cuz in the thing in
the video the guy calls it something
else they've changed the name of the
pisode free code camp use tabs if they
good line yes yes yeah like oh the zip
line I'm like what zip line so free code
camp used to have all this terminology
bass lines were like the little
step-by-step exercises there was if
lines there was something two or three
at bonfires you have bonfires or another
one so that that they really played into
this little campy vibe things okay um
periphery says white one two week break
code are die hard I'm with you man I'll
actually be coding the whole two weeks
okay I just I can't I can't the t-shirt
hahaha I can't I can't do it alright I'm
writing that down um why don't you
make a playlist called algorithms or so
are you talking about the code fight
Seliger that's right I want that t-shirt
dude code hard
okay because I'm like us I love action
movies so that just like rocks my
world right now it's so cool le Rue's
one one one welcome welcome I found out
that these code count sites get $10,000
per developer's being hired throughout
it doesn't surprise me so Ryan I am
going to be doing a playlist of all the
algorithms I'm actually going to be
having to so the a lot of people ask me
is how can I get better at algorithms
and I think I think at the end of the
day the best way is just like apps
Charles the the best way is by just
solving a ton and seeing them solved so
that you can see different thought
processes and thought patterns and so
when we move into the new office or into
the new apartment I have the new office
and all the lights are set up in the new
camera and the green screen yeah my page
should be arriving next day or two
actually I got Chucky again yes so um
but I pretty much bought everything I
needed I'll be willing that so that's
why I haven't been actually putting out
new videos other than these live streams
one because we've been doing the live
streams and two because I'm waiting till
I'm in the new office with the new set
up to do it but I'll be recording all of
the rear according I would say all the
algorithms I've solved up to this point
and then releasing one a day or
something like that and then I'll
actually be doing a second version as
part of my course where I will show an
alternate way of solving it and in much
more detail with by drawing each outch
out each one and breaking down
specifically each part into additional
detail to explain the logic so that is
the that is the game plan
um so Charles brixey uh uh or love you
too I guess is that appropriate to say I
you're just being creepy now oh I meant
we not like me specific uh so can web
developer smoke pot it depends on your
company um uh offense on your company
men um yeah so I didn't get drug tested
for my job April got drug tested for her
job like okay did you tell him about the
how quickly I got hired yeah April got
interviewed and they hired her that day
and then said hey can you start tomorrow
if so we need to go pee in a cup today
so um but uh so Ryan that that those
algorithm videos will start coming out
as soon as the course is done which will
be the end of next month I'll start
releasing it probably for ten there's
probably gonna be two different tiers I
want to offer a tier for like $10 a
month where you just get access to all
the monthly content I'll add to it every
month and then there might be a I don't
know what to even price it at maybe a 25
or 35 dollar tier where where um once a
week um we could spend 30 minutes
together and we can debug code we can do
we can do all the search stuff where you
can show me your project I can feedback
debug code and additional side I don't
know there's definitely gonna be two
tiers help me out um now
like it affects everyone differently so
it really depends on can you function or
can you not function so alright it's
really a personal discrepancy okay Wow
so Brandon lefur said I Dylan I took the
code Khadem eCourse a freelance web site
development one I didn't enjoy it as I
watched your video after three weeks in
I have to say I didn't get much out of
it I did get a good grass a channel CSS
but everything after wit week through is
a huge headache any chance you guys quit
your jobs and do this um maybe in a year
or two I don't make nearly enough money
uh to to do it now and the reason for it
is I make about three hundred and fifty
dollars in ad revenue in a good month
with sponsorships and some some other
things I'll make twelve hundred most
times I clear around 600 750 and so
that's all if I say say I say 600 or
let's say it's 550 that's ten percent of
my salary so it's not it's nothing that
I it's not like it's literally ten
percent of I need to tenfold to get to
where I'm at right now so I I doubt it
oh no no she didn't get a coding job she
got that office job yeah she's still
learning code yeah I know I know of
course you're talking about yeah yeah
Branagh um
everybody I haven't heard one person say
a positive thing about the course but
Charles bricks me so one of the reasons
that I'm creating my course is because I
do want to one day be self-employed and
I also have some other larger products
that are going to be for financial uh
like a developer store a developer box
these are ideas that I'm playing with
that I'm launching the course first
because that's more of a time investment
and that can help maybe fund these more
financial investments down the road
Thank You Charles I feel you Brandon and
that that was kind of what I said in my
video though about them kind of preying
on people's being novices saying oh hey
for five hundred dollars it's like a
mini bootcamp and you can come in here
and you can learn how to code and be a
freelance website developer come on man
so um but yeah so that I mean that
that's part of the reason why I'm kind
of taking these two weeks off also is
because I felt like I haven't been able
to give it my all and I'm overworking
myself and typically when I come home
from work I work about an hour to two
hours on my own side projects and then
April and I do that and so now it's it's
turned into the kind of an hour and a
half to two hours and then I have
another hour and then I have another
half an hour because I have two tags and
things like that and then YouTube on top
of it so it gets a little it gets a
little much right now
so Joshua Jarek a so does a spot have to
clear at your job and then you can prove
yourself to become a senior developer at
your job or do you get to or do you get
the senior dev when you go on full-stack
have experience with company so a junior
def is can be full sack as as i am and a
senior developer it doesn't necessarily
means a spot has to be open you can be
promoted to a senior developer but at
the end of the day that does mean you
usually get more money and guys and uh
so um but you just depends Manny it's
usually an experience thing regardless
of where you're at it's probably going
to be easier to stay out of company and
go from junior to senior like I don't
have junior in my title at all my just
web engineer but um my boss is title
senior web engineer right maybe some
trick on just teaching a cat to do that
in general would blow up YouTube well
yeah I mean and so I would love one day
- uh - that that is my end goal by the
way guys I've talked about this before
about being self-employed and doing
YouTube full-time or in one fashion or
another it's gonna be hard with a coding
Channel uh but you know if it takes five
years from now I'd be way happy with
that um yeah exactly and so if I work at
it for five years
my original game plan was my channel was
only to get a dev job I never really
thought about I never really thought
that I would enjoy youtube as much as I
do
or that I would yeah this was actually
only supposed to be a short-term thing
to catch job on like it's a way of
teaching easy yeah and then it actually
turned into something like yeah I went
from a delivery driver and a student to
a technology trainer at a software
company making X amount of dollars more
and then I jumped to my current role
being a full-stack developer uh
and so it's a it's done a lot for me and
it continues to do things I'm collecting
a monthly check from them it allows me
to like my course and I'm making it's
going to allow me to market it to people
who at the end of the day continue on
breaks are for the week I'm sorry man I
the move and the sickness is getting a
hold of me that um but I always say it
was me who requested the break and not
April so she's going to continue
studying um so yeah you know it's funny
that you bring up that course um it was
it Brandon you bring up that course
because today I got an email from
Codecademy let me see if I can bring it
up real quick and they've actually
changed the course and it's not even
five hundred dollars anymore it's two
hundred dollars now so they've actually
changed the course the name of the
course they've edited a course for now
the third or fourth time so I was
thinking about doing another video about
it um let me bring it up right now
um no bring up the course man
I'm gonna bring it up
imagine tchau tchau
yeah I'm trying I'm trying to run that
cash money up man
so we have age so this is the course
that Brandon was talking about so this
course used to be called freelance web
developer or something like that
freelance web site developer so now
they've changed it to build websites
from scratch and it used to be it used
to have no JavaScript and no jQuery and
uh and it used to and it's just so
misleading uh so now in eastery $500 now
they've changed it up in the last week
they throw javascript and jquery at you
was just up uh and they've
they've changed it around a little bit
but now it's only um it's only two
hundred dollars but a former ye the
former way good one more Google engineer
yeah but it's two hundred bucks is
straight it's a straight up cash grab
still um I don't blame him for doing it
but I do it could be so much better and
you you know it's crazy man you know
Stacy's I have offered I have offered to
spend ten weeks of my life doing this
like I don't need to do this I've
offered on several occasions
hey I would love to review your course
you would get a ton they would get a ton
of advertising imagine if we spent ten
weeks I spent two videos a week going
over what I learned in this cook Adam II
course and I did it and they they
haven't been interesting I want anything
to do with it
um but that doesn't surprise me um and
also 200 bucks where's my course being
released the end of next month first
week of the following month I'll be
releasing it I want to have quite a bit
of videos there's going to be a couple
courses on there um I would like to
cover a lot of stuff but I may I may not
release everything that I can with it um
but uh ideally what I would like to do
is launch it with HTML CSS JavaScript
es6 jQuery angularjs algorithms
wireframing and user flow that is what I
want to launch with it as well as some
videos about how to practice your
interpersonal skills and communication
that's crucial and have free resources
on other things so there's a lot I want
to do with it I'm not sure I'm going to
be able to get all that made in three
and a half four weeks even though I have
it mapped out that's another thing you
could do is teach someone how to kind of
plan that out my plan out there
you know time or getting ready to create
something
yeah so but um but yeah the algorithm
section the algorithm section I'm doing
right now because that's everything else
I kind of already know I'm going to be
breaking down there's also going to be a
list of just free resources in each
section that you can access to
supplement your learning I'm going to
have some cheat sheets some pins and
stickers and like each section it's
going to have a little $10 thing you can
buy they'll ship to you which will be a
laminated cheat sheet for that subject a
sticker in a pin something like that as
well
it's going to be a precursor to my store
I'm going to launch but um maybe some
flashcards as well but that stuff takes
time to develop by that I want to make
the flashcards okay baby
hey for you can sign each one you can
make it my hand I can make them by hand
but I don't know if anyone like that
should they like that what do they call
that now the it's not vintage but it's
like American handmade yeah that's fancy
just write it down I definitely better
than yours so but yeah so I would love
to launch my course at the end of next
month but I don't think he's on the
washing hand meat or printed any
discount for patreon members yes there
will be a free month for all patreon
members um and depending on how long you
were subscribed you may get some free
stuff as well and you may get a free
course from elsewhere um but yeah so um
we're gonna spoil you patreon don't you
especially the ones who have been
long-term members out trust me guys
always try to do right by my audience
especially the ones who give me money
alright moving on I am ready to sell out
boys um so the next thing that I'll be
going over is angular 2 as well once I
expand upon that now that that's the
reason for the monthly the monthly fee
of about ten dollars is it gives me a
way to have a semi residual income that
I can put up as well as motivate me to
continue
putting out content right and once I
have those there's good the way I want
to structure the course is it's going to
be uh it's going to be where you're
going to have the introduction section
like the JavaScript section the 3-hour
javascript course and then the next
thing is going to be free of vanilla J's
JavaScript Java Script projects actual
projects I want I think a lot of people
need projects to get jobs I think a lot
of people learn projects learn by
building modules our portfolio yeah so
that's the thing I want to help with and
there's courses out there and I'm not
just talking about single page
applications I am talking about that
like okay we just have a vanilla JSF I'm
also talking about full mean sac I mean
stack applications where you you start
front-end back-end database the whole
deal your high angular 2 why not angular
for I'm going to work my way up dangler
for my understanding is that angular 4
is based off of angular 2 and 3 but uh
yeah we'll get there
which I like so your comment about it
being two hand-holding for solo learn is
exactly why I'm going to have the
beginner introduction section as well as
the project section so so that everybody
has something else and what I'm going to
be talking about different concepts as
well ux/ui and showing tools that are
used in in the actual real world talk
about agile show you agile show you
confluence and JIRA all that sort of
stuff going to an in detail how old am i
am 29 years old now i understanding
their force compatible to angular 2 what
about sending april to a bootcamp uh
it's an interesting consideration that
would be up for her to decide she wants
to take out a ten thousand dollar loan
right now we have we have about twenty
five hundred dollars in debt which is my
car payment and she has a a college
degree in English and I think if she got
self-taught and got an internship she
would do just fine I'm not opposed to
her going to a boot camp I'm not opposed
going to boot camp I have a lot of fun
if someone pay for me to go um maybe
later on do like engineer truth day
where we go and raid in
recorded yeah uh I don't think we're big
enough for a bootcamp to sponsor me or
her um even with the work and relate
relationship that I have with deaf
Mountain and how they're they're killing
it and it wouldn't make sense for me to
go I'm already a working developer like
why am i leaving to go into boot camp um
but uh it's something that we thought
about but I think right now right now
what she needs to do is before she even
get sick is a lot of people think like
hey you can just jump into boot camp raw
that's the worst idea you should do you
should go into a boot camp knowing how
to code and so it's um it's sharpen your
skills like really hone in on that it's
it's not even part of the conversation
until you can actually code which seems
counterintuitive but the reason for that
is you want to be in the top 10 or 20%
and you go to build a network you go to
to build good portfolio projects to
learn new languages and frameworks and
you don't want to be in a boot camp
trying to understand basic concepts like
for loops while loops syntax
understanding how to solve basic
algorithms like we've been doing these
are all things that you should be
comfortable with and study to get into
it it's a loaded question curfew is that
is it pair pair very very it's a loaded
question but I'll go with the very easy
one
Edgar Allan Poe yeah
so that that's one thing fab that I
actually have a cyber sticky note that
I'm going to be adding that to right now
is how to study code how to practice
code so this will be one of those ask a
dev sort of videos that's cool those are
good questions
he's making a reddit clone you guys have
a good night by the way Brandon is
making a reddit clone a good idea for a
project yeah I think anytime you make a
clone of another project it's always
kind of cool um if I could go to a boot
camp a money was no object which one
would I choose I would actually choose
dev Mountain and I'll tell you why and
some people may say well why wouldn't
you go to like hack reactor or something
like that because hack reactor has great
hiring rates and they have a good that
like hacker actors kind of note in there
in San Francisco you know Silicon Valley
area so everything um the reason for it
is I do think that dev mountain's
program where they provide tuition and
housing that you living in a house with
three four five developers all going
through the same process I think you
learn a lot that way and bond a lot and
I think you can make a lot of cool like
you make a lot of progress instead of
just showing up doing your 8 12 16 hours
and then going home I think you working
eight hours there and then working eight
hours back in the comfort of your own
apartment you learn a lot so that's why
I would do it what would you say if we
would be good ready to go to boot camp
uh about what day I'd probably have 200
days at the end of us practicing for a
hundred days would be when I would
consider that she should if that is what
she's looking to do I wouldn't say that
I would say it really depends on what
100 day looks like like if I know
okay so HTML CSS check off my list if I
know JavaScript as comfortable as I am
with HTML CSS I would feel fairly
confident going into boot camp but I
would also like to have some other stuff
under my belt and a mean stack maybe
like the at least exposed to it before I
would go anywhere near a boot camp
because me I don't know about you guys
but I really like being prepared for a
situation and it preparation is always
key for me so I would really have to
look into
what place I would go to what their
courses look like and then make sure
that I have already been at least
exposed to the topics or maybe dive in
them a little bit before that but 100
days would be enough in my opinion
but uh all right guys so um we've been
doing an hour again just as a reminder
I'm taking about a two-week break so I
can recover we can move get situated I
get um I can work on my course a little
bit so I can put that out work on the
side projects YouTube channel all that
sort of stuff and then two weeks from
now um hopefully I am a hundred percent
yeah Colin we're not taking like a break
and just stopping we're just not doing
the one hour code because that one hour
kind of days into both our schedules
with everything that's going on so I'm
still beginning to be doing three hours
of code every single day like you bet
your ass I am so it's not like Ana
you're absolutely right when you take a
day off like you can tell like you you
can really tell so yeah so and that's
something that I'm actually fearful of
so that's something that I'm making sure
that I don't do you know how they say
like don't ever not go three days uh to
the gym in a row like make sure you at
least go like so it's just I'm I'm
applying that more extreme like push
let's get Cody cats again tonight gotta
tear down the wall um all right yeah so
um that's it for now we'll see you when
we see you these animals savages um
don't forget to join our Facebook group
code Tech and caffeine the link is in
actually not in the description because
we restring it up but you can
find it on some other videos and but if
you already knew why would you go to
boot camp
well we go to boot camp either for vlog
experience meet new people socialize
whatever better those skills also better
skills um I mean five good reasons
and like if it's a chewable price then I
think it would be worth it yeah and if
you want to support me on patreon that
would be dope maybe one day I get the
patreon the course high enough and I can
do this full-time
that'd be the jurymen so thank you guys
for watching I will continue working on
my and you guys probably won't see
any videos on the channel for about a
week and a half which is a long time for
my channel not not for everybody but a
long time for mine but that's because
I'm making a lot of good in the
meantime so don't don't I'll make up for
it with the free course every video when
your boy comes back so look forward to
that are you gonna even lead us out baby
with the patented patented statement go
ahead
code long and prosper and I am</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
