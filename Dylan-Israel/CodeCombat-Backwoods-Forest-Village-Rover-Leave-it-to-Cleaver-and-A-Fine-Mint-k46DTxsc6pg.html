and free cook camp we're doing that
villager over we're gonna be using
functions all right cool
let's get in it to win it so stop all
the augers and save all the peasants so
define a function here about find attack
enemy is equal to the function that of
our enemy equals now just one line of
code here at I find attack enemy can be
used so basically what we're doing
alright let's just jump right in so
while true
you can patrol the village using move X
while I find attack enemy so our
function here find attack enemy finds an
enemy tries to find enemy if there's an
enemy of attacks now move to the right
entrance so the right entrance here is
1631 so will will now go to hero dot
move X Y 60 31 and now we want to call
our function here so basically all we're
gonna do is say find and attack enemy
this is us calling our function or
functions already defined right here
this is the name of it it doesn't take
in any parameters and it's basically
just gonna run this code so it's gonna
submit that so move there they move back
and then it's gonna check if there's an
enemy attack the enemy
instead of us having to loop our code
like that we can go ahead and just loop
the function that does the same thing
makes our code cleaner it also makes it
easier and more reusable definitely
something that a function we would
wanted to find for this in the future so
leave it to cleaver I imagine we're
gonna be using our cleaving ability here
so the ogres must die
the function Cleveland clothes defines a
parameter called target and then if the
targets less than five cleaver attack
okay so we're basically gonna have a
Cleveland close target so now it's gonna
take in a parameter before it did so
right here you'll see our while loop
says while the wall true find an enemy
if there's an enemy run or cleveland
close now we're not going to change
anything in here but we're gonna
actually write the function here so
we'll say if the hero distance is less
than five if Cleve is ready so doing
this statement check if it's ready if it
is ready we want to go ahead and cleave
here
cleve target so see how this is enemy we
need to change this to target the reason
we're not checking if it's there is
because we're passing in a parameter
only when it's true here else we just
want to mean this goes in say attack
target attack the target I was gonna
submit that I think that's good
so clean so cleave is enough so they're
gonna be Auto mean cleave should be on
this group and this is our while loop
running that's calling our function so
functions just store code essentially
and then you call back to it so that you
don't have to reuse retype your code out
again and again it cleans it up a lot as
well very nice up next a fine mint cash
money maybe pans must I collect the
clients right
so we're going to be doing there's a
function called pickup coin so if
there's a coin moves there and get that
so what's going on here is we're calling
the coin object here we're saying find
the the position parameter and the exper
am the position x for the position y
parameter and input that in there so
this is just like 42 and 30 or something
like that right the attacked enemy
function below so what we want to do is
write a function here we're gonna say
function attack enemy and this takes a
no parameter it could but we're not
going to I'm gonna save our enemy and
we're gonna say if enemy so if there is
an enemy we want hero attack enemy all
right find the nearest enemy attack them
if they exist so this is our code right
here and then we're saying uncomment and
uncomment this line after you write
attack enemy so now what's going on here
is we want our attack enemy function to
run it's gonna clean this up as well so
attack enemy or pick up a coin so if
there's an enemy that's gonna attack if
not it's going to pick up a coin single
one then one one it's going to tack once
then it's gonna pick up a point attack
once pick up coin tack once pick up a
coin so we may have to change this to
attack twice but let's see how our guy
does first it looked like they've been
dying in one hit lately so we're gonna
attack first
pick up coin
so there's no enemies right now so we're
just gonna continue picking up coins
attack now go back to picking up coins
this makes our while loop a little bit
easier to understand as well because we
have our code broken up into segments
which is another great thing about
functions as well so while there's no
enemies pick up points once you get a
coin now so they're gonna attack this
guy you know that ain't cool bruh lay
that dude out continue picking up the
coins now it looked like they were
continued she was continuing picking up
coins but that's actually just the
passing so we've completed 20 while
loops and 20 argument levels pretty
solid pretty solid things are going
smoothly up next we'll be doing friend
and foe more of the same and what is
this backwards brawl all right and will
it at the end of this it looks like
we're coming to the end we'll be doing
backward sprawl and then the multi
player as well once we finish up the
last few in backwards for us so as
