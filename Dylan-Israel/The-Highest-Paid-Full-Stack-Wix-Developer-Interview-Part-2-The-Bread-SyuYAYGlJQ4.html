just a thought how does one attain the
level of respect that can't be the only
Oh Dolan knows is from side projects Oh
face recon okay well moving on yeah okay
I know this isn't even a real question
but how does one attain the level of
respect that Dolan gets they don't

for my audience what do I get my check
for being here

easy way or we can do this the long way
