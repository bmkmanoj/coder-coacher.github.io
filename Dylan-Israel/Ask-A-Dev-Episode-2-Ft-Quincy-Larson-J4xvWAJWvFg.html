episode 2 of ask a dev in this episode
we're coming quite a few cool little
topics I mean here get started we're
gonna have one of our questions that was
asked by one of the subscribers answered
by Quincy Larson from when I interviewed
him I'll be the final question of the
interview it is a very good question in
my opinion but let's go ahead and jump
right in
Bishop Shaw says how long did it take
you to finally get the hang of
JavaScript which parts were the hardest
for you and what was your first project
you first created with JavaScript so
this is the kind of general question is
is there kind of a time period at which
point how long does it take you to get
the hang of your first language or first
JavaScript and what parts were hard for
me specifically probably the same ones
that were hard for you I'm a little bit
different just because I I started doing
JavaScript only through all my websites
so I had previous program experience so
I picked it up pretty quick although I
would say it took me probably about a
year before I felt comfortable enough
with JavaScript that I could really dive
into it up until recently well now that
I'm working doing it full-time I would
say you could probably feel comfortable
JavaScript once you feel alright enough
to jump into a new framework or a new
library like angular is a great example
in jquery react if you can kind of jump
into those with relative ease you're
probably doing pretty well with how how
much javascript you know and once you're
able to kind of take that knowledge and
then implement libraries and things like
that the first project I ever did was
free code camp project I believe it was
the random quote generator so that was
the first JavaScript project I did and
all honestly all my JavaScript projects
have been from free code camp excluding
the ones that I do at work so that's
that it's any any side projects I guess
would be my my website just because I
used and
is to build that but that's basically my
how how it took me about a year to get
comfortable because now I'm using I can
probably pick up a framework in a
weekend or two and be alright so that
that would be my answer to that
amid uh elbow Hey apologize if I am
mister pronouncing that is asking I'm
guessing English is his first language
so I kind of roughly ass is it better to
implement is it better to learn with
free code camp tutorials or trial and
error and you kind of start your own
your own projects what's more useful to
me you should do both right so you
should have these online resources that
are going to teach you the basics
they're going to teach you how to get
started and then you should also take
that knowledge and that starts I project
so it's one there's not that one's
better than the other it's just one kind
of leads you to the other and how are
you ever going to build your own
application if you never build smaller
applications through guides along the
way or maybe be a book or maybe be a
video or maybe you know something else I
personally learned angular from watching
like three hours or four videos of Derek
vaana's angular course and that was
enough for me that that watching those
was enough so that I could go and build
my my my website coding tutorials 360
comm and so it's it's not that one's
better than the other it's you should do
both in reality and they both serve
different purposes I was that's not a
very political answer I always try to be
very clear-cut but also just do what
works best for you
this is a question I get quite a bit and
I'm not quite sure how to answer it so
we're as always I don't do a lot of prep
so we'll see what I come up with right
now no how do you make the switch from
coding online such as free code camp to
writing your own code like when you can
you make that switch and how you know at
what point in free code camp would you
say you're ready to make that leap so
the easy the easy part of that is when
are you ready to work as a developer and
make the leap that part is when you can
actually build your own applications
when you can actually do your own
whether it be web development so web
development is obviously at the Bloch
if you can build your own web
application you're probably ready to
make the leap right if you can pick up
various frameworks and libraries you're
probably ready to make the leap now if
you look at a blank text editor and I
and you know thought though maybe we'll
just give a free code game example it
was hey I want you to build a wikipedia
API project and you don't know how to
get started you don't know that you need
to break it up into this little piece
this little piece and this little piece
just to get going you're probably not
ready so like it's really how can you
turn you know the caffeine into code
basically can you take this like right
now I'm drinking I'm drinking a little
bit of pink lemonade monster right at
the end of this do you have something on
the screen and if you're like still
struggling with that which is fine
everyone does I was at a coating meetup
last night and gentlemen who's partaking
in the coding bootcamp he was struggling
a little bit and that's fine but you
know it's all about so he would not be
ready to be a developer because he's
still having trouble visualizing the
code to something I'm always talking
about you may be able to see where you
want to go and what connects to what and
if if you're still at the point where
you can't break down a problem and know
how to get started I'm not saying you're
not gonna run into roadblocks because
you run into roadblocks and coding for
the rest of your life what I am saying
is that you'll know how to solve those
roadblocks then you're definitely not
ready so once you feel like you can
problem solve your way out of a problem
very well and you're not gonna have a
blank text editor an hour later when you
have an assignment or a project or
whatever it may be a you know a feature
you're probably ready but if not it's
gonna be a little bit rough for you he's
a Husum as a someone who with no web dev
like no official web development
experience do you think it's better to
have small like a bunch of small single
page applications are one large like
project that's much more in-depth when
it comes to like putting it on your
portfolio in order to get like an
internship or in order to get a junior
devrel right I would say I
say the one big one but but the thing
you need to realize about the small
projects is they prepare you to build
the one big one you know the small
projects it doesn't hurt to have a
portfolio that has a dozen code pen like
apps or it doesn't simple like hyper dev
apps hyper dev is very cool I don't know
if if you've heard about it Dylan or if
your subscribers have heard about it but
hyper dev is basically like code pen so
if you have a full nodejs environment so
you can do full stack apps right and in
whenever you do something it's live
immediately and it'll stay live it
doesn't get doesn't get taken down up
for some period of time and it's totally
free you don't even need an account
actually it's by the way the team that
built Trello oh cool so we're using that
as part of our back in curriculum but
but what I was saying is you know
there's nothing wrong with having a lot
of good stuff but you should build some
large product like a full web
application that a lot of people are
using the the number one thing that I
think people look for when they're when
they're trying to evaluate a project is
how many stars is I won't get up I know
that sounds kind of weird because it's
like a big popularity contest but if
somebody sends me like their their repo
and it only has like three or four stars
on it and they're asking me to like
write about it or check it out or
something
then my immediate reaction is you
haven't done very much groundwork in
terms of getting people to actually use
it and so you know supporting it and
doing all these other things that are
necessary to actually emulate a real
world you know project because because
the real world is not like a hackathon
hackathon you build a project very
quickly you demo it and you're done and
the project just decays rapidly from
there right like all the dependencies go
out of date you probably don't ever
touch again nobody uses it in the real
world you create something and you have
to continue supporting it so it could be
like a an NPM module you're going in and
making tweaks people are opening issues
you're responding to them but that's
much more like real-world work than
busting out a quick hackathon project
so I would say one thing I would do is
get involved with an organization like
free code camp where you'll actually be
maintaining large open-source projects
or contribute to existing open source
projects if you have pull requests that
have been accepted into Firefox's core
browser or Linux its kernel or something
like that that is way more impressive
than any casual app that you can throw
together hey guys I hope you enjoyed
this episode of ask a dev episode 2 if
you have any questions go ahead and put
them in the comment section below so we
can have some content for us good have
episode 3 and we can answer the
questions that other young developers
and start developers starting line of
code can get answers to all I think
Quincy Larson for answering this
question make sure to go to medium free
code camp com if you liked his answer
and you want to see more of his vlogs
very very great stuff I get an email and
I read probably one in 10 that apply to
me but every time I read it I absolutely
am astounded with how much detail he's
gone into and it's very very good I
