Jim hating cigarette smoking and super
sizing may have come to
the wrong video yes we're talking about
the blue box today it's basically a
monthly shipment of nutritional products
energy / weight loss it asks you a bunch
of questions and then it gives you
products based on what you select your
fitness goals are so right now they're
running a three-month promotion so you
can normally it's ten dollars box you
can get this for as cheap as 333 a box
for three months right now so I for
three dollars they could they could send
me coal in here and like an energy shot
and I'd be happy you know like it's a
you know box achill it's a pretty much
so y'all fig I'll throw it in the bark
yourself course so I let's see what we
got in here some pretty cool stuff
that's pretty happy for the three
dollars and a quarter so I spent on it
so they include a bunch of you know
pamphlets this is something get you off
a diet weight loss site called dietbet
calm this is goes over all your items in
details it shows you the price of the
actual bigger full products that you can
buy and I'm sure you can find some promo
codes to lower that and this is a recipe
for one of the things we're going to
look at so why don't we start with that
and that is the hundred get it out of
here please you get two samples of the
Sun clora granules I apologize if I'm
saying that wrong it's basically
superfood that you can throw in
smoothies or shakes and go from there
and this is pretty cool anything I kind
of give you a boost like they do at JA
jamba juice or juice it up or something
so that's kind of what I equate these
two so that's cool I like that um you
get something similar to that too and
these are designed for coffee so they
are which vitamins and minerals that you
put in your coffee so your coffees a
little bit healthier oh there we go yeah
by the perk so I like that I don't drink
coffee too much but when i do i'll use
one of these and i'm going to actually
throw one in an energy drink and in my
blog i'll tell you how it turns out
throw it in a
the key ones i normally drink i actually
just finished one right here so if you
don't know if you try to eat a little
healthier like me i know i shouldn't
drink these but these only have six
grams of sugar compared to lie about the
52 or 56 that are in Normal Monster so
check those out you're trying to get a
little better healthier so this right
here I like this strawberry lemonade
energy shot I'll drink this um you know
this is let's pause this bad boy open
right now actually because I'm I'm not
addicted these things let's I'll tell
you what tastes like it's not bad man a
lot of these energy shots always give me
that type of thing it's not too bad it
uh just tastes to strawberry lemonade
it's still kind taste like a free punch
one to me but it's just that high
vitamin b12 and b6 2065 a hundred
percent of your daily intake is going to
taste pretty much the same like I get
behind this I like that two more items
so already I feel like we've got a
pretty good deal oh also um you get a
free 3 month membership to salted I
didn't know a sausage less but it's a
basically online cooking like video so
you get you know famous chefs and such
like that doing step-by-step recipes and
videos you get three months free after
that's 999 a month I guess regularly so
i wouldn't pay 99 999 a month but i
would sign my girlfriend out for three
free months not that I don't love your
cooking bit alright uh with that
disclaimer put out the way we got two
things left Oh vegan protein so this is
a sample it feels pretty hearty 21 grams
for some vegan protein I think it's
pretty good at all that's about what
you'd get in a normal protein scoop just
like the I mean they have higher ones
but that's a fair amount i'd say for a
protein shake and it's vanilla flavor so
pretty pretty standard it's got a bcaa's
boosted in it which if you're not
familiar with let's just for basic chain
amino acids and those are crucial for
repairing muscles so if you're vegan but
you're trying to bulk out this might be
the the you know protein that you're
looking for I don't know and last but
not least is something called our tracks
it's a natural soothing non-greasy
formula for relief of painful muscles
and joints uh I equate this was some
sort of pain relief Oh on like icy hot
maybe um I don't know I just give it to
my girlfriend thrown the first aid kit
or to my mom she's a nurse she might
have a better explanation for this so
just go over real quick in this
wonderful blue box I was very happy with
this everything in here was 33 33 that's
with shipping with the promo code down
below and in the blog so we got our
strawberry lemonade shot we got some
sort of pain relief cream a sample of
the vegan protein recipes all that
salted crap and then we got the coffee
insert that uh gives you the vitamins
and minerals and a superfood boost in
here so all in all I don't know what to
throw in a value on this boat say about
10 bucks uh you know just like two
dollars for everything I think that's
pretty pretty solid definitely more than
3 33 so I'm very happy with the blue box
and I will probably continue to order it
at this point I have two more months
coming and if they're all this good I
expect good things from them and if i
buy anything I get points and you know I
can get some free stuff in the process
so that's I kind of like that too so uh
this gets the thumbs up for me and if
you're interested see how they it all
tastes and everything blog will be up
probably about a week after the video on
my website subscription box guy Tom and
don't forget to click the link down
below for the promo code again and give
thumbs up to the video and all that
other good stuff thanks for watching
hi guys so i told you i'm just going to
put that light of perk in my energy
drink i figured in the car ride but as
good as any time hi i just poured it in
there right now before I got started I'm
actually filming this on the way to
school so do not do not attempt to do a
video such as this I'm a professional
youtube video making entrepreneur as
well as a highly caffeinated individual
it's used to stuff like this but uh all
jokes aside I put it in my orange
monster orangeade monster and let me
tell you what it tastes like tastes like
nothing it's not even like a really
I can get me here visiting a little in
the can when I when I take a sip there's
a slight like tang to it that's similar
to like a vitamin C but besides that
this is great if you're looking to spice
up your coffee with more minerals more
vitamins I really I really would
recommend this and uh I mean I don't
drink coffee by dou Qi energy drink so
that's another great Avenue to go down
so I hope that you if you're interested
in trying the vitae / it's on bulu box
calm and give it a shot that but I'm not
throw over the prices but as far as it
taste goes it's pretty good
