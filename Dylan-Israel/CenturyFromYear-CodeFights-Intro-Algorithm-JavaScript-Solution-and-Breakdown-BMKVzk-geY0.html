we're doing sentry from year so the
objective here is that you're given a
year such as 1905 in this first test and
you want to get the century from it so
what happens here is if if it if it is
that 1900 exactly it's actually the 18th
century in 1901
excuse me the 19th century in 1901 is
the enha is the 20th century so we have
a hundred year gaps so let's start by
defining the problem we need to return
the century and it doesn't necessarily
divided by evenly so what we can do here
is one we could divide this by 100 and
add one that makes sense in a lot of the
cases so why don't we start there where
where we go ahead and break down the
century into a floating point number
so we'll say a bar value to check is
equal to the year that we're past
getting passed in divided by 100 now
what happens when we return here we
return value to check you'll see that
it's going to return a floating point
number right because 1905 is going to
return 19 point O 5 so on and so forth
but what we can do on top of that just
go ahead and return math dot floor value
to check and I will clear that up just
nicely so first and for us okay and
we're saying well a lot of these are
going to be plus 1 because if you divide
it evenly
19:05 is actually 20 so go ahead and add
1 to there now we're going to write an
if statement to deal with the cases
where they're perfectly divisible by
even such as in the 1700 because this is
perfectly divisible but it doesn't end
up working out how can we solve that
well how I did it was I just did a
simple if statement
we're so hey if here modulo 100 is not
equal to zero excuse me yes I'm doing
the if statement out of order
my apologies so the first thing I did
was I did var divides even this is to
find out if there is a remainder and we
say hey if the Year module 100 we're
going to find out if there's a remainder
so if there's no remainder it's going to
be zero if there is a remainder all we
will go ahead and proceed like so
because it's 1905 or 1701 so we have to
check if divides even is exactly equal
to zero
go ahead and return you got to bring
this above values to check because this
divides evenly there's no reason to add
one and there's no reason to floor it so
1700 would become 17 and it doesn't need
to become 18 and then we're done so here
we just find out if it divides even we
could probably eliminate this and just
say it's going to eliminate it actually
it's better have less variables if you
can and we just say year modulo 100 if
that's the case where it divides even
link go ahead and just return this if
it's not bring this down to a zero
remainder zero decimal place bring it
down to an integer and then go ahead and
add one to it because it's not a perfect
century that's that's the idea there but
as always guys I may have bumbled my
