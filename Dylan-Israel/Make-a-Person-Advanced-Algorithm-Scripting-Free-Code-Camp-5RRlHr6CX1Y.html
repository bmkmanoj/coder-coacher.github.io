gonna be doing the advanced algorithm
scripting make a person for free code
camp now we're gonna be doing basically
just some object oriented programming
and yeah you'll see that they give us a
list of functions around here are gonna
create so we're gonna go ahead and get
started just by creating these six and
then as we go through we will test them
one by one
so first thing you see that like right
here I'm gonna just delete this right
away
alright delete this return statement and
get started so we want to with getters
such as get first name so we're gonna
define our function get first name now
this is a function area this not get
first and we'll go ahead and call it
right here all this all that we want
this to do is return something what do
we want it to return what we wanted to
return the first name now the way I did
this was our person takes in one
parameter in this case we're taking in
bob ross i created an array just called
VAR array and set it equal to off the
first and last dot split and we split on
the space so when we console dot log
this out we should have so let's go
ahead and return array and see what it
says if i if i remember correctly this
should just go ahead and put out bob
ross as an array so you'll see right
here here is our bob ross now we only
want the first name so we can just go
ahead and put the zero index and that'll
get a that's our get first name so we're
getting bald
that's all we're getting right there
now we can do the same thing forget last
name I'm gonna be very similar so we'll
go ahead and do this dot get last name
is a function so and in this instance
all we want our getter here to do is
return let's go to zoom in a little bit
return the last name which is the one
index plot now this is assuming that
we're only using first and last name and
our input here L so this would be a
little bit more complicated let's go
ahead and call get last name done just
make sure everything's working out as we
go through this is really how you should
be test your encoding yeah
so there's our the homie Ross all right
so get full name we want to then get
full name is just gonna return this so
similar thing this dot get full name and
oh let's not get full name equals
function and right here we just want to
return array 0 so first name plus a
space plus the last name and let's go
ahead and change this this function got
get
and now when we run it instead of Ross
we should get Bob Ross perfect so those
are our getters so I'm pretty
straightforward not too hard
excuse me might have some energy drink
monster you should definitely sponsor me
just throw that out there that would be
nice
but hang on so setters uh taking a
parameter and what a setter does for
instance that first name takes in a
parameter called first we're then gonna
override our value how do we do that
well we know that we're gonna have an
array so let's go let's just get started
they give us kind of a blank template
here I've set this dot set first name is
equal to a function now this function is
going to take into the parameter first
first it's going to be what we want to
reset our first name to so we're not
returning anything all we're gonna do
here is instead set that first index
position equal to R now new first value
first parameter so when we do Bob dot
get Bob dot set first name let's go
ahead and set it to Dylan and then when
we we want to get the first name now it
should go ahead and return Dylan so
after we set it and there it is so we
know it's working properly cool now
let's just go ahead and do the same
thing for set last name so this dot set
last name we're gonna do it the same
same way so we're gonna create a
function that takes in a parameter
called last and make sure you're
following the the suggestions here if
you don't it your code won't actually
pass at least my mind didn't at the time
of me making this video so maybe let's
change that it's over a 1 so our last
name we're just gonna set it to the last
parameter and we can go ahead and set
this
- CT 360 and was set last name and we
want to get last name let's go to run
that cool so our our set last name get
last name is we're getting now all we
have less to do is set full name it's
one slightly different it's not too
complicated just different so we want to
set the full name and we only want to
pass in one parameter now to do this
we're gonna create a function passing
the parameter first and last and what we
want to do here is we want to take that
string that's getting passed in we want
to split it like we originally did and
then we want to set the values so we'll
create an array here called a VAR a
split and we want to split our array
excuse me
split first and last string wherever
there is a gap
and from here it's just a matter of
resetting the original array values so
the first name we're gonna reset we oh
actually we might as well use our
functions so we're gonna say set first
name right here and we want to set that
to array split zero index and then we
want to go set last name right here to
array split one index so let's go ahead
and test this so we are going to say set
full name and we're gonna put in Dylan
put a space CT 360 and then we want to
get the last name which do we get full
name so after we set it we want to get
the full name it's going to run that set
first name is not defined
oops dot dot now run it there we go so
you can see now everything's working um
we get rid of this I believe our code
should pass and there you go
just keep in mind you saw I made a
mistake right there that because we
you're working within the person object
you're gonna need to use this to let it
know that that's what that's where it's
coming from essentially so I hope you
guys found this helpful as always I
encourage everyone put comments in there
code for the most part this is pretty
straightforward
I'll go ahead and put comments and after
thank you to everyone who's supporting
me on patreon don't forget to like and
share the video it helps out the channel
a ton and really keeps me motivated guys
I appreciate your time and as always
thank you and I'll see you in the next
video
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
