something that I think it's pretty
interesting a lot of people have have
asked should I learn angular 1 or
angularjs if you're if you're not really
too familiar with the angular framework
it's a JavaScript framework and there's
basically two versions there's angularjs
or version one point X they're up to one
point six point five at the time of this
video and then there's angular 2 plus
and the reason they say well you know
what what's the big difference well they
basically architected the whole thing so
if you learn angular 1 you're not going
to really you you're going to be
familiar some of the concepts in angular
2 but it's a whole new beast it's not
backwards compatible and a lot of things
have changed about the way that it works
basically so but that's for another
conversation the question that we're
going to be answering today we're going
to be talking about discussing if you
will and I want to know your thoughts
about it in the comments below right
because I'm I'm not the end-all be-all
it's just my opinion based off what I've
seen and you know my experience in the
workplace but should you learn angularjs
or angular 1 rather should you learn and
the question is maybe right as a as is
the situation for a lot of things in
life nothing is black or white so some
of the pros and the cons to learning
angular 1 well the pro so learning
angular 1 is that as it is being phased
out and a lot of companies are still
using angular 1 but if there is legacy
code already for angular 1 right there
are projects that are wrapping up that
are being built in angular 1 so this
something that has a lower learning
curve in my opinion compared to the
newer versions of angular angular
they're at their on version for right
now so for the newer version of angular
4 that has a much higher learning curve
than angular 1 does so if you want to
build something or learning a new
library that's going to potentially be
helpful if you're okay
painting legacy code or okay kind of
jumping mid-tier into projects it's a
great framework for you to pick up it
also is going to be much more familiar
than angular forest in that in I'm
making that comparison because that's
really what the one that you need to
make you can make the comparison with
react so that's a separate video now
what are some of the cons of learning
angularjs well not everybody wants to
work with legacy tech right when you're
working with older stuff even if you get
a job in it now you know the web
development timeline if you will is
constantly changing and what's OK for
you to learn now may not be in 3 4 years
and not everybody is the type of person
who wants to go home and have to learn
new framework learn new build tools
learn new this learn new that and I can
respect that to a degree granted you're
going to be learning every day but they
may say look man I want to learn the
newer stuff so I don't have to learn
something brand new next week or next
year right and so that's kind of a con
of it also you might be competing with a
lot of more experienced developers who
are of that same mindset especially if
you're just getting started right so one
thing I've talked about with learning
newer technologies that older developers
aren't taking the time to learn and part
of that is I feel like at some point a
lot of developers say they say look I
have a massive skill set I don't want to
have to go out and pull all these new
skills so I'll just keep working in the
stack that I have and that's ok so an
edge you can have is working in the
latest and greatest technologies in
angular one is not the latest and
greatest right and I thought I figure
it's a fair statement to say now I
personally love it right I work in
angularjs at my current work and I've
been learning so much about frameworks
and for the designing frameworks and
working within it and I think that it is
something that you could probably devote
a a month or two weekends to rather and
build out a couple projects when I
originally learn angularjs the way that
I did it was I in about a two to three
week period I went I did the
a coke Adam II section on angular and
then I went over and I watch Derek bonus
who has four videos I think totaling
about three three hours or so of content
and then I built my very first website
which uh in angular which is coding
tutorials 360 comm and this was my my
angular project and this this taught me
how to use things like filters right
here is a limit to filter which limits
how much character comes out of the
description concatenate it with a dot
dot dot this also is uses the HTTP
service in angular to do Ajax calls and
things like that as well as down here to
pull my channel statistics so we've had
Illuminati five five five but anyhow
this was something that after just doing
probably spending about four - I would
say it probably was about four hours on
the coke atom II course in about four to
five hours on the on the Derek lowness
videos I was able to get enough of an
understanding to go and build a simple
website for my YouTube channel that I
eventually would go and build a
portfolio as a portfolio item for that
and I think that's one of the things
that you could do if you're trying to
I'm not saying devote all your energy to
learning angularjs what I'm saying is
that if you want to add a somewhat
marketable skill to your resume
angularjs is something that you could
probably pick up in a weekend or two in
my case to get from doing no angular
knowing no angular to building this
website I would say the total turnaround
was probably three weekends worth of
work and you may be a better developer
than I am you could probably do it in a
you know a weekend or whatever it is or
maybe a little bit longer but for me at
the point in my time that's what it took
but I think it's something that's very
doable and very very very fun and funny
funny thing about this is I notice I've
swapped out this image for this
background I didn't even notice that
there's someone's name on here from the
stock image I got my name is Lee Kim but
it'll look like every time you look at
it now I can't
can't avoid it but one thing if you want
to give yourself kind of an edge I would
ask you to look at you say alright well
how can I make sure that I'm using the
latest and greatest in terms of the
angularjs framework angular 1 framework
I would have you look into angular - UI
angular UI is a very common they call it
a companion suite basically a add-on to
angular plugin if you will of various
components one of the most notable ones
would be UI router or one of the issues
that one of the reasons I went from
angular 1 to angular 2 was that nested
views or essentially how you would have
your logic display in the template you
could really only have one at a time
going and with all your logic and so
that became an issue as well as some SEO
issues and and all that sort of stuff
but my um my suggestion is that if you
are looking to spice up your
applications if you're looking to add
it's simple I don't say simple because
angularjs isn't necessarily simple but
it is very doable to get the basics down
at a very short amount of time that you
should look into angularjs and maybe
create one solid portfolio item in it so
that if you do come across maybe that
that that job or that that project you
could actually say you know what I'm not
I don't have any professional experience
in angular chest but I have built this
website and as a kind of learning
material because I have been spending
the time to learn it and I've also used
angular UI router and talked about that
and how that uses States and you know
the eight the UI router might take you
more time cuz that's that's a very you
should really be jumping around too much
but this is something that you could add
into that if needed or I just wanted to
make known for you because I do have a
lot of cool stuff such as slider
uploader validate scroll a lot of these
things Oh another bootstrap component so
I encourage you to check that out that's
angular - you I thought github that IO
for that but in terms of should you
learn and you
jas it depends on where you're at and
what you're comfortable with like I at
the time when I was looking at jobs
I saw angularjs everywhere but that was
like a year ago right and now I now I
think people are kind of expecting for
newer developers to be on that angular
for hypetrain or in that react hypetrain
but if you just want to spend a weekend
learning something new
you could probably build some small
projects in angularjs pretty quickly and
it might just help open doors for you
that weren't there before or
opportunities that you know maybe he's
not the perfect candidate or she but he
he's learning me is very any shows that
you're it's another it's another thing
that shows that you're constantly
learning and my regards is you know
maybe before yelling in jQuery you
didn't know where to go and you're not
quite sure if react is it or angular
force beyond you right now it's okay let
me spend some time playing around with
angularjs and maybe I can you know get a
QA role helping fix legacy code or
whatever it may be but the Sun lies it
it just depends it's an easy thing that
I think you can learn and at right now
part of the reason for it six tons of
documentation angular once been out for
what seven eight years maybe more and so
there are a lot of there's a lot of
sites out there that are built in this
that they will need people to maintain
the sites they will need people to still
build on plugins and build additional
features for for these web applications
and not everybody has the has those
skills or not everybody wants to learn a
little bit older technologies like me
I'm learning react react native Redux
and I'm also learning angular for I like
to be playing with the latest stuff and
I work with this at my current work and
so it just depends on where you're at
and what you want to do but I think it
is something that a lot of people could
pick up pretty quickly specifically
because of all that documentation but I
wouldn't devote all your time to it I
would say more so learn it letter learn
it right work with it build something in
it and then perhaps move on would be
probably how it summarized it but that's
my thoughts on whether you should learn
angular one or not
I really do enjoy it though the angular
4 it's a whole nother beasts and as I as
I dive deeper into the front-to-back
angular for traversing media course I
will give more details as I become more
familiar right now my my attentions on
the react course speaking of the react
course let's give one of those away so
we're going to be giving away a react
course and the key word for today is
don't forget you have to like and we
subscribe this always use the keyword in
a comment down below which will be
angularjs man so if you guys want a free
rap course use angularjs and we'll
choose a winner a few days after that
I'm usually doing it by Sunday so you'll
see something same a graduation is you
won with your email so I can send you
the link a lot of you guys haven't been
responding back to the emails and so I
haven't been able to send you your
courses please promptly respond back to
the to the comments when you can guys
with that being said I'll see you guys
the next video don't forget to join our
Facebook group code tech caffeine and
our discord channel all that great stuff
I appreciate you guys watching man it's
a pleasure to be able to talk about
things I care about and it's and you
know it's it's one of those things where
years ago I didn't know who I could you
know I didn't know about coding meetups
I didn't know about about where to go to
get better to answer these questions or
to ask questions and get answers even
just to have theoretical conversations
and I'm glad I get to do it on YouTube
and I can see everybody's input and even
if you don't like what I have to say or
you disagree I like to see those
comments so that I can question my own
thought processes and my own thought
patterns and go from there but so with
that being said guys thank you for
watching I'll see you in the next video
bye hey guys thanks for watching the
video special thanks to our sponsors dev
Mountain if you look for a coding boot
camp where tuition and housing is
included definitely check them out
appreciate it and I'll see you guys in
the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
