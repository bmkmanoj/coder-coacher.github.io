for the official the only the only
official place so I know you're all
pirating these live God's live streams
for Saturday weekly today so for those
guys what I've for maybe seen this first
time what I basically started doing a
month ago was every Saturday I wanted to
start having a I wanted to start having
a live stream so that I can answer
questions we're still going to be doing
the ones for the every thousand
subscribers that that we do I like those
as well I like live streaming to be
honest with you it's not the best thing
for the channel they don't do very well
oftentimes but I think they provide a
lot of value for the subscribers I used
to do a little bit of twitch back in the
day and it's it's it's somewhat familiar
today we're gonna be talking about well
I'll answer any of your questions but I
have recently learned how to build
Chrome extensions which is kind of cool
and that'll be I want will be one of my
first if not the first course I put out
I'm still working on how to start a
Coney Channel course but the Chrome
extension course I have three of five
projects that I want to build I'll
actually have a video on the channel
I've been talking a little bit with Brad
from traversée media and for a while
he's been telling me hey man if you want
your channel to grow you should probably
do tutorials and things like that and
it's just something I enjoyed doing
anyhow so I'll be releasing a a quick
tutorial on how to get started it's
probably gonna be two parts
the first one is going to be breaking
down the basics of Chrome extensions
what to expect what files you have to
include what the bare-bones minimum it
requires to get a chrome which - and how
load it and test it and the second part
will be a more detailed look builds will
build a model project so as of right now
for my course I have two projects built
for that really one I started building
the second one but it's almost there I
want to have five projects for the
course and then one for the channel
to give you an idea of what I'll be
building the first one I built at work
to teach myself how to build Chrome
extensions because I have a Chrome
extension I'm going to build for work in
the side project but that was basically
a customized error message so what
you'll do is you'll install the Chrome
extension and then right now it's
injecting a coding mean like a single
coding meme but it also allows you to
customize your error message or I'll
inject it so that your error message
when you get a 4 or 4 will give
additional data as well not something
that you always are going to want to do
but it's very least the bro do you even
know how to code meme might make you
smile a little bit when you get an error
so that that's a basic example of a
project but a good one to introduce you
to a lot of different aspects such as
when your Chrome extension loads how to
connect your Chrome extension
the other one was suggested by a user in
the Facebook group if you guys aren't a
member of the Facebook group code tech
and caffeine there should be a link in
the description below if not just search
for done on Facebook we're about four
four thousand members strong right now
and growing by a few a day and I
encourage you to check that out great
place to get oh you know Dylan dropped a
new video or see what's going on with in
the coding space a lot of people share
their projects and get help that way BAM
so the other projects for the Chrome
extensions that I'm going to build is a
bookmarks sorter so we're going to
interact with your bookmarks in the
browser and we're going to display those
bookmarks in a Chrome extension that you
can then search for which we'll teach
you a little bit of working with the
browser and the Chrome extension now the
the third one that I have figured out is
actually going to be a a that started
working on today is going to every time
you open your every time you open your
your Chrome browser it'll actually
display a coding tip of the day and so
it's going to it's going to showcase
this man's very aggressive in chat
telling me to off for some reason
um but uh I'm not quite sure what I've
done why he is so passionately against
Chrome extensions but hey
so the the third one will be actually a
coding tip so when you open a new tab in
the blank tab its I haven't decided it's
gonna be one of two things either when
you open a new Chrome browser it will
display a tip one time or you could
click that click the icon will display a
tip or what I'm leaning towards is when
you open up a new tab in the center of
your tab it will actually inject a new a
new a new coding tip like you know did
you know that you know XY and Z is true
about JavaScript but not about Java or
did you know the typescript it's made by
Microsoft so uh I'm actually going to
probably initially hard code those into
they're probably a hundred and then for
a future project I'm going to build a
back-end database probably in firebase
and maybe MongoDB or EndNote will see
what I built in the future in a separate
project we will build the backend so
that instead of just circling through
the first hundred we'll build a back-end
where the user can update those and and
add their own and stuff like that or
I'll add my own to my own API so yeah
the anger guys probably an IE dude I'd
be angry too if I was using an internet
explorer you know I say I'd be angry all
the time so today guys if you have any
suggestions I'm looking for about two or
three more Chrome projects Chrome
extension projects that I can build I
want to have my course have five
projects for the Chrome extensions I
think that's a solid amount and the
thing about building Chrome extensions
is a lot of it is working with the the
library of the API will be love working
with the API will be
the hardest part the rest of it will be
JavaScript and HTML the KC welcome
welcome Roxas and the MA steal and shine
hun welcome welcome
so Dom ah still sits in my opinion I
think YouTube coding channel to tour I
think he's saying my channel lack of mid
projects well that mean not basic and
not very hard yeah so I mean one of the
things that I I plan on releasing or
more detailed tutorials I've always been
afraid of investing the time effort and
energy but if there if I'm releasing it
in connection with udemy and putting it
on udemy I'll really it makes it a lot
more worth it and right now I am I so
part of the reason for this is your boys
saving for a house for some rental
property he's trying to become Johnson
Miss junior over here speaking of which
I got a I get John on here so I can I
can ping his brain a little bit but I'm
trying to buy a house so I am I'm
working on courses and working on books
all that sort of stuff
and I am looking to to basically just
build some some courses that could
provide value and and get it and the
Chrome extension is something new that
I've learned that there's not too many
courses on it and I think that you could
build some cool portfolio projects and a
lot of what I'm going to leave you with
in these projects it's not going to be
it's not going to be an example of
laziness and it may come off that way
but I'm good we're going to build
functionality that can be built upon and
so that you can go and continually to
customize this product so a good example
would be the Chrome extension that
displays the JavaScript stuff you could
actually go and build your own back-end
for that and update it and maintain it
and all this you'll have access to all
the all the code or the the bookmark
aspect maybe you'll want to create it
groupings and and customize that and so
I'm gonna leave you at each one of these
projects with multiple suggestions of
how you could go and build upon that
which I think will
kind of cool because that way you can I
guess the what I'm try say is what I've
done courses in the past my biggest
thing is that there come they're not
complete that they are complete but that
there's nowhere else to go with them and
they provide no like a lot of times its
introduction to languages and things
like that and what I want you to build
are tools that you'll actually use and
that you can go and continue to build
upon to continue your own learning at
the end of the course and that's that's
one of the things that I'm gonna kind of
emphasize and I'm gonna actually give
suggestions as are the last video for
the course okay this is what direction
you can go in here's a few ideas just to
get the juices flowing kind of like my
my most recent video where I gave 29
side project ideas so the Chrome
extension is very close to what I am
saying my suggestion is to try to make
it with as les frameworks as you can
yeah so you can't really not use the the
Chrome extension API for this but the
bulk of the JavaScript and HTML I'm
going to try to stick to vanilla
JavaScript one because I want to get
better and two because I want to so
there it's gonna be a lot more focus on
the chrome API then it will actually be
on the JavaScript although we're going
to need the JavaScript because that's
how you chrome the the functionality for
all this sort of stuff
but it's also going to be a course that
I can make and I'm I now that I
understand the basics of it I can make
these projects and and get going here
relatively quickly so and expose you to
a lot of the the API in the process so
today guys if you have any suggestions
I'm looking for three more projects so I
want to do one for free for the channel
that breaks down how to start building a
a Chrome extension and two I want to
build a a I need two more projects for
the course so that I can have value I
think five projects is a good amount for
this type of course you know if it was
like an angular 4 course they're
probably too because I think angular
takes quite a bit of development time to
set up to build and all that sort of a
chatbot huh hmm ai driven extension you
guys are throwing out some some complex
stuff here make a bookmark on the table
suggested web pages this might not be a
bad idea people have are big on this web
scraping idea I'd have to learn how to
build something like that but that's not
a bad idea
so I've been learning front-end from
team treehouse I know some JavaScript
jQuery but the problem is running into
it as putting all together build
something it's that norm is completely
normal if you aren't if you aren't
coding every day and and you're gonna
struggle even if you are coding every
day you're gonna struggle it's it's hard
sometimes you say okay I have this nail
and I have this hammer and now how do I
use the two together how do i how do I
do that and sometimes it's just practice
and and consistency is the main thing if
you're not coding every single day and I
don't mean six at seven days I mean
every single day for hours it's always
gonna be hard and but you'll get past it
you just have to put in the time so and
when you get past wherever you're at
with the JavaScript in Jake or you move
on to angular you move on to react you
move into all these sorts of things and
it's a it's a slow grind but you'll get
there
was it deal to smoke so this is just my
such a little diffuser that's that's the
only that's the deal
nothing nothing too crazy it's it's just
something I like at my desk it helps me
helps me enjoy myself hey David Davide
Kota welcome am i working from home
today I am not uh I'm at home I'm in my
office today is Saturday April and I
went looking at a few open houses just
to kind of see the market and see the
area I showed her where I worked because
that's probably where we'll be buying so
we did that today and today Saturday and
I do my Saturday streaming when I'm done
with this I'm going to continue to build
some of the Chrome extensions that we
talked about let's see here what
technologies am I currently working with
in my in my day to day role mainly
angular four I'm doing a lot of
front-end I got hired for a front-end
roll so that is basically what I'm
working with this is angular for on a
daily basis I I should keep I should
just say angular all the other angular
legit guys are gonna be saying amen you
need two mini delos ain't no mini
Dillons
coming up in this until house number two
we gotta get house number one first so
the only mini dealings are gonna be
little furry ones with tails called cats
all right that's the only mini Dillons
and we could have as many of those as
week as we want right now we have three
so uh it's uh you got a we got a cover
you do that so I might have some angular
for tutorials coming out I'll be the
oops Dylan tip oops I did it again I
forgot to pull no uh yeah so uh some of
the more technical tutorials that will
be coming out is I'll be really
two videos one talking about what
typescript is just sort of a general
with the general example and also be
breaking that down and then also have an
angular 4 tutorial coming out I'm going
to try to mimic some of Brad's success
and try follow stonefish stuff because I
like I like his format and I think he's
doing an excellent job and I'll it'll
just be my own tutorial but in a similar
form I'm even gonna steal his PowerPoint
swag Dylan do you think that'd be
alright for me to show assessments from
employers that didn't hire me on my
youtube channel can you elaborate a
little bit about that because there's a
situation where that's a yes and there's
a situation where that's a no but I need
to know a little bit about that uh the
must still you should probably focus on
one or the other
do you use typescript at work yes
angular for you exclusive not
exclusively but you pretty much only use
typescript with angular for I mean a
typescript and JavaScript but typescript
is primarily use with angular so yes
these on a daily basis I type there's
great man I am I've been loving it man
I've been loving angular so I got
nothing but good things to say about
angular I will say that sometimes it
took me a solid two weeks to get
comfortable writing angular and now I
feel up up to running up to up to speed
so I'm trying to say here people up to
speed so I'm about to turn in my first
real project can't really talk about
what it is but we are we're up and
running so
I would say that's okay so like let's
say that you had if I understand your
question correctly JJ Smith that you
have some employers that gave you
skillsets skills tests that did not hire
you based off those skills tests but you
want to take those skills tests show
your code maybe clean it up a little bit
and then and then from there make sure
that you you're doing a video breaking
down this test and how you solved it and
why you solved it if that's the case and
you don't name the employer and you go
from there I think that's perfectly fine
but you really have to make sure that
you don't name the employer do you watch
any shows TV on your free time i watch
some anime i was watching my hero
academia i ended i watched some youtube
channels mainly software ones and news
ones and i also watch Dragon Ball super
which we get a two-hour special tonight
always two-hour so uh do i watch my own
videos I do so every time I throw out a
video i rewatch it before I put it out
so that I make sure that it's something
that's appropriate to put out into the
world so two times where I've kind of
let my we've been two out of about 700
videos I have out there's two of them
that are on the more controversial side
that I that come to mind that would be
the code babes video as well as the
Google engineer who I'm forgetting his
name right now
I've also yeah so I've watched Dark
Matters season 1 and season 2 I don't
cease it I don't think
season 3 is out yet occasionally when a
good sci-fi series comes out I'll pick
it up you know I watched Game of Thrones
as well so I'm big in the anime and and
and sci-fi fantasy stuff all the sort of
dorky genres they that you would make a
stereotype about what a develop
would watch I fit every one of those so
you can make an assumption based off
that uh do you have a university degree
or self-learning I do not have a
university degree no I do not how do you
choose what to work on next like reactor
angular like you start working I want to
find the jobs that are hiring for the
other I would
it depends what your current skill set
is but generally speaking I just would
look in my area and see what's going on
and I would learn that and make sure
that there's jobs and that it's in
demand that really is all that's to it
and if it's a bunch of things you gotta
learn a bunch of things right three is
on Netflix a why you got telling me
these things brah yeah I might have to
check that out now you got a phat 1.1
percent raise ok time to look for a new
job bro do I know any portfolio
templates yeah man you go to start
bootstrap com it's a that's a free
template site that I've used in the past
that just has a bunch of different sort
of templates I'll throw the other link
up in chat and you can check it out
they're all free and you can see some
templates start bootstrap I throw it up
and shot therefore yes I also need to
put in some work for my book that I want
to write I have a book that I've been
talking about writing and I've wrote my
first section but I want to continue I I
need to actually sit down and write one
chapter a week that is my goal one
chapter a weekend I should say and I'm
starting that tomorrow good I should
start today
trying yeah hey you guys I I've told you
the five things that you need to land a
job as web dev portfolio was one of them
LinkedIn github all that sort of stuff
but portfolios one that taught one of
the stronger ones I encourage you to
have that that looks like a different
mic notes the same mic I just actually
have it in front of my face instead of
it might sound a little clearer so Henry
says yes are doing code fights how would
you add this to your resume under like
side projects or something well two
things you could do what I did which I
throw it up on github and I have a
readme file for each one of these let me
actually see if we can I'll show you an
example here let me pull it up real
quick so so you can do what I do which I
encourage you to maybe add your github a
little bit nothing wrong with that just
lets see our code fights and let's go
ahead and switch this to here
so you'll see here on code fights that
we have I have a repository called code
fights and then in each section I have
various like you'll see here I have a
little little readme file but if we
actually go into an actual algorithm I
don't know will do should I actually
need to break this up but you'll see
here I have I have a I have the the
algorithm and I also have the the video
linking to it as well as this but
basically I have all my stuff up on my
all my solution up on here I probably
should actually break these up into
folders so that it makes more sense but
this is one thing that you can do and
another thing that you can do after that
is you can put a in your side projects
your level as well as a description asks
you what it is how many algorithms you
solve maybe code fight song - and then
you'll see ranked put rank and then that
and what that basically does and a small
like one sentence description underneath
there it starts a conversation when you
get started like and then you can it you
can do you know you can elaborate it and
sell it that way no drop the chalupa you
can have it on your same site just have
a portfolio page I see your Starcraft
shirt have you seen have you been
playing on Starcraft remastered so
compendium I don't play games anymore
for the most part I am I'm in let's buy
property and save for the future mode so
I try not to I did buy a Super Nintendo
classic and I have put in about three
hours and last week or so into Super
Mario RPG which is a lot for me so why
not my videos are encoding I can't use
my videos I'll sit down for I can't use
my computer for the most part I sit down
for 20-30 minutes to play on there but I
try not to play games anymore that don't
have definitive endings like Starcraft
and legal legends I want a game that has
an ending so I can stop playing it so I
stay away from that it's type of stuff
how challenging do you consider these
code fight some are very challenging
some are not I would say for most people
who are just getting started they're
going to find code why it's pretty
challenging if you're looking for some
algorithms to get started on free code
camp is probably a better solution for
most people any teeth updates yeah man
so every month I get an adjustment on my
teeth and that basically just means they
put in a new they've tightened this up
so I am about three months from having
these off
it was the braces I had on our it was
for ten months so we're about six to
seven months in so about three months
from now I will I will be have these
often I'll get my teeth whiten I look
like a little pretty boy pretty dorky
boy and I'll have from my retainer so I
won't be that pretty but yeah so about
three months from now the the braces
will be off
and that also means that I'll stop
paying $170 month bill which is more
money for saving for a house what I
think about the web developer bootcamp
course by Colt steel I think that it's
probably a little bit outdated but I
think it's very helpful for a lot of
people and you get a lot of value for it
but it's not gonna be your only learning
resource as nothing is but I would say
that it most people tend to enjoy it but
we'll say by the end of it they need to
go pick up some other stuff as well what
languages would you need to start code
fights well they have 40 different ones
on their site so pretty much any
language that you want and we can pull
it up what type of interview questions
were you actually a job I can't actually
say it's not it's not appropriate for me
to answer that now I personally have no
issue with it but as an employee I think
that it's not something they would like
me sure I don't think that actually know
that because I I recorded eight so this
is a video that won't go out but it's a
very good video some kind of sad about
it so I recorded a video thirty minutes
after I interviewed for them in the
first place and I had a mock technical
interview and before before we dive into
this let me show you what languages they
have so you'll see here so this is an
example of code fights you can see these
are all the languages they have here so
you have closure
CoffeeScript JavaScript Java whatever
small talk Scala Ruby Russ Visual Basic
even typescript which seems kinda
strange but um okay I'm well so there's
a bunch of languages that you can
actually do these in so you can do it in
whatever you want
dart D so you having a language barrier
in terms of programming language isn't
going to be one of them so well yeah so
I can't say what my my interview process
was well I did record a video ten
minutes after I interviewed with them
and going over it and it's a very good
video but it won't ever go out so how
long will it take after I complete free
code camps get a job that's really up to
you it depends on it depends on what
what you're doing outside of free code
camp if it's your only resource probably
gonna be a while if you're doing YouTube
you're doing your Demi courses you have
side projects you have a great LinkedIn
you have a great resume or a great
github you're doing all the things that
you need to be doing it just depends I
could tell you that I got my I got my
first programming developer job before I
finish free code camp so it's it's all
relative no I've never thought about
picking up Perl
I'm pretty much going to be sticking in
the JavaScript stack and maybe picking
up some c-sharp for the backend that's
kind of where I'm at right now what's
your favorite kind of food the only
correct answer to the question is cheese
cheese is the best type of food there is
so everything else is an incorrect
answer so let's just get that out the
way right now now we can disagree about
what type of cheese that's okay but the
correct answer is cheese 100% of the
time so do you know anyone that
specializes in Java
I know people who work in Scala and Java
Java was what I basically was my my
first it don't forget the salt right
Java was my first programming language
it is a very popular programming
language and it's one of the more ones
one of the ones that are taught by a lot
of colleges now if you do learn Java
you're most likely going to be working
for a large
by national corporation because that's
what they love
but yeah so people do work with Java a
lot of people Kevin Cho and chat works
with Java for quite some time when did
you leave free code camp what do you
mean leave when did I leave it I'm not
an employee of free code camps I am NOT
a yeah
any thoughts on SQL so I've used my
sequel which is kind of all shoot sequel
which is pretty calling is it commonly
it's yes people you sequel all the time
it's relational databases if you're if
you're doing development you don't need
to be the best with this sort of stuff
but if you're doing data analytics or
your data scientist
you obviously need to be better but like
for me at my last role I did my sequel
and and I I could you know I could
create databases I could join tables I
could update columns update rows all
that sorry enough so your stuff Mongo
verse my sequel which one you choose
well what's your goal I every time we'll
choose MongoDB there I mean but there's
a very practical reason for that is it's
a JavaScript database basically and I
find it very easy it's it's one of the
things that you can get up and running
in no time it's also easy to make
changes so if I want to add on to if I
want to add a array of values all of a
sudden all I have to do is create a
schema and then apply a crater rate and
I attach it to the document and we're
done my sequel you have to join tables
you have to create associations you have
to do a lot of different stuff now
statistically speaking there's probably
more jobs that use my sequel not
probably there there are more jobs that
use my sequel then MongoDB but I
personally would choose a database a
document based database over a
relational database every day of the
week
but like if we were to and I have a
video coming out next week called PHP
verse node and we talked about my sequel
and we talked about MongoDB in there and
make a comparison so you may want to
keep an eye out for that make a just
mega we'll sit with a mega mega um next
week so that that might help you out as
well I pull up some articles and some
job trends and things like that Kevin
give me Kevin mr. Cho give me some I
know you got some chrome extension idea
so you think I should put into my course
I need three three Chrome extension
ideas I have one that involves the
YouTube API but I don't know that super
relatable to everybody I want to uh so
we'll see let's see what happens with
that one I may do it I may not
when did I break up with Rico god I
never broke up with Rico again free
cooking broke up with me uh no I'm a big
fan of Rico camped I just ran out of
content to really do on their current
site free code camp org the data
visualization doesn't interest me
d3 sucks everything that I would
do with d3 I'd rather just do in
Google's charts or charts Jas when a
matter of fact when I had a chart based
project to do I did exactly that the
turnaround time is much quicker I love
it so it's a slice of a learning curve
also d3 gives you such customizability
but it never actually it never actually
has any built-in basic classes like most
the time we're doing pie charts bar
charts certain we're doing 10 different
charts at most just build me a basic
class I don't I've deal with this
so I'm a I'm a much bigger fan of just
using a s or using Google charts do you
think reading other people's code is a
faster way to learn program rather than
write any small projects no pic I think
you're just gonna read stuff and forget
stuff I think you need to program and
code you're currently working on a cue a
framework and writing scripts at work if
you want to make if you want to make my
way in the front end if I want to make
my way in the front end what should I do
autofill fake data on a form using faker
I'll take that under consideration
there you go throw that up on the notes
here
um doing that or d3.js right now you
poor child
you'll beat this don't worry
any discuss anything on developing
Chrome extensions we haven't discussed
anything I mean I've discussed what I've
been building a little bit and what I
plan on building and that I will be
releasing a short maybe thirty minutes
you know build a Chrome extension in 30
minutes guide and then I'll finish out
my course so right now what I'm trying
to do is I have three projects I need I
have three and I need three more to do
what I want to do some if you guys have
any extension if you guys have any ideas
for a Chrome extension project that you
would like in a course on udemy or
anything like that let me know uh sigh I
can add it to this
but yeah I'm actually really looking
forward to free code camps beta whenever
it comes out and it's just and it's it's
been a long process or free code camp
been and the beta are you going through
any course or reading any book to get
Cermak stuff just know I just read the
documentation and started building stuff
take a screenshot and post it on slack
hmm what's going on Ichiro saves the
debug code can you be more specific
what do you mean saves the debug code
when I suggest any books to learn to
code no I would say buy courses watch
videos you don't learn much better I've
never had success with books and I think
they're more or less oftentimes outdated
I'm not a huge fan of them I would say
self-help books motivational books those
are probably better spent in your time
to stay motivated than actual technical
books some people may disagree with that
and that's a fair statement but for me
that's always been my why certs the
thing I really should hop on here and
start helping free code camp and get
this stuff out printing out a list of
objects basically templates of useful
debugging code that's the think about
that one is the JavaScript you used to
develop Chrome extensions for the most
part you have to use the the chrome API
and there's some setup that's required
with it when you want to interact with
the browser the tabs anything that has
you interacting with the browser in
general has to be going through that but
you yeah you do have to load files and
stuff like that and you can do it with
vanilla JavaScript you inject jQuery
angular whatever you want I'm going to
try stick it with vanilla JavaScript I
heard you don't know jazz is a good book
for going over the two first books if
you don't know Jess and they're great if
you're just getting started
for me I just read it because my
co-workers are reading it but I
I mean flute most part I would recommend
courses over books courses require a lot
more time than books most the time but I
think they have a lot more value
alright guys any any last questions
before we wrap up the fourth weekly
Saturday weekly live streams this is no
fun I gotta work on this Chrome
extension course though I also have to
finish up I'm on the last section of
traversing media's front to back
angular 4 front to back my favorite
JavaScript course would you believe me
if I told you that this angular 4 front
to back is my first ever course that
I've taken the rest have been free free
tutorials and youtubes I've never act on
YouTube stuff and just building things
and learning I haven't actually ever
taken a course before I would say if
you're just looking for it's a general
JavaScript course free code camp worked
for me check out their beta also because
they've had a lot of stuff on the s6
would you ever consider doing videos
where you critique other people's
portfolios I add that as a future on my
patreon so now that it's on there
probably not but I did offer to do it in
the last live stream so if you catch me
in a live stream for a thousand
subscriber special I will do it they're
big I catch everything
Oh pumpkin got can't hear my god no no
there we go what are some good habits to
sleep early especially winning Cup on a
code keep coding late night code in the
morning
uh-uh I take 750 milligrams of melatonin
every night to knock me out stuff
trouble going to sleep
matter of fact April forces me to take
it now because it makes it that much
easier so is it good would you recommend
it I almost want any but got salt
instead it will definitely teach you all
the basics that you know I'm actually
gonna I shot bradda an email said hey
man do you mind if I review your course
and
I'm gonna go and do detailed review
about the pluses some of the few minuses
but yeah I would recommend it overall
but I'll have I'll have a detailed video
probably in in every two weeks
I have a video about it eventually
aren't you afraid you'll become
dependent on melatonin I'd rather go to
sleep fight if he ever gets to the point
where I saw I don't take it on the
weekends during the weekday so April
forces me to take it so if I ever get to
the point where I am tired even though
I'm taking melatonin or I'm not going to
sleep I will stop taking it I don't take
it on the weekends for that reason to
kind of give my body a little bit of a
break now if if I'm taking it I'm not
getting good sleep even with it and I'm
not going to sleep I will immediately
stop taking it but I haven't had that
I've been taking it probably for about
six months and it wasn't even my idea
April's forced this on me guys she's
forcing me to take melatonin a matter of
fact if I'm working in here at nine
o'clock normally normally we're in bed
but sometimes I'm finishing up a video
I'm finishing up whatever it is April
will walk in with a bottle of water and
a melatonin pill and put it in my hand
and she'll make sure that she won't
leave until I actually drink the the
swallow the pill so that she can go to
bed on time as well as I can this is the
life I live man this is but yeah I'm
very aware I I I traditionally have had
a very addictive personality so I'm
pretty aware of of when that becomes an
issue all right I also have the
discipline to stop taking this ourselves
so um any I guess I appreciate you
watching for a Saturday weekly for
Saturday weeklies I will see you next
Saturday
going to go work on some Chrome
extensions maybe work I'm finishing up
the angular 4 front to back course and I
am gonna get back to the grind man it's
it's been fun it's been a pleasure I
want to thank you all for showing up and
and giving the suggestions and asking
questions every time I'm here I get a
little bit more intelligent because I
get to understand what's going through
your minds and that helps me come become
more educated so if you come to my live
streams you'll know that I like to often
when I remember leave you with some
words of wisdom a final thought for the
Jerry Springer fans and some of you are
so young you don't even remember Jerry
Springer you're like who is Jerry
Springer which is a shame you missed out
on a Golden Age of the 90s with Jerry
Springer as a talk-show host you really
did to think that as like an 11 year old
I was watching Jerry Springer puts a
smile on my face so um last question
here from Tecmo self I would I prefer
using the command line I've used GUI in
the past but I forced myself to laying
the command line recently and now I
prefer the command line so uh what we
want to talk about um what was a good
topic from today for our final flop
let's talk about so a gentleman earlier
said hey when I finished free code camp
how long after I finished free code camp
will I land my job and I think it's kind
of a dangerous way of looking at things
and the way that it's it's phrase is
pretty pretty concerning when you're
when you're diving into something new
like software which you really have to
fully immerse yourself in there are a
lot of different things a lot of
different tasks that you have to
accomplish and some people have
critiqued me in the past for saying oh
well this you know this is just your
opinion man and that's fair but I think
it's also fair to say that
the amount of effort that goes into
transitioning your your brain to be a
software developer is your you really
are reprogramming your brain and what I
mean by that is you're you're taking
your your your brain and you're saying
look I need to think in a certain
pattern a certain way and I need to not
only think that way I have to then apply
these tools I have to learn and when
you're doing something like free code
camp that's a great resource to get you
going it's a good resource to to guide
you along but it shouldn't be your only
resource you need to be doing ten other
things and some of you may be laughing
and some of you may be thinking that's
unrealistic but for you to be successful
you have to be doing udemy courses you
have to be reading blogs you have to be
watching YouTube videos you have to be
feeling side projects you have to be
going on coke atom and doing their
courses you have to be going to meetups
you have to be doing networking there's
a lot of stuff but in terms of the
resources that you're learning you
should never ever ever be learning from
one resource even how even I I mean I'm
a big believer free code camp has helped
me so much in just learning web
development and learning to be a better
developer but you should never ever ever
use a single resource and honestly a
single resource just ran out of time
right even for your cooking it's got a
ton of stuff eventually you'll burn
through it but you need to be exposed to
different thought patterns and different
teaching methods and you need to self
teach beyond belief to be successful
long term in this field or even short
term and you need to be exposed to
podcast with different announcers uni
because exposed to YouTube channels with
different teachers udemy channels
different teachers you need to you know
as much as I don't like books sometimes
those are best for people I some people
enjoy them
so maybe not books blogs where you get a
ton of information in different format
and II need people interpret this
information and think in a and what's
gonna happen is over time your
brain is going to slightly morph and
slightly understand hey this is how I
think this is how you should think to be
successful unless I should think to
break down problems to solve things and
build things from scratch so that when
you do get that blank text editor and
you're just gonna be it and it's
overwhelming that times because there's
so many resources on the internet you
know you're talking about web dev on the
web it becomes kind of crazy right but
hopefully you can find some good ones
and you know there's people like me and
other people who will recommend things
and guide you the to the best of our
ability right as we have tried to guide
ourselves and people have guided us so
what I would say is that if you're only
learning from one resource you're
playing a very dangerous game because
you're only being exposed from one
source and what may be important on free
code camp they'll be overlap with other
resources but you may be missing out on
things that that you had no idea even
existed a good example would be
something recent where I showed a
co-worker debugger I showed him hey what
a debugger is and he had never been
exposed to that like he had no idea what
a debugger is and that's okay
and they're just I'm not trying to pick
on my coworker or anything like that but
the reason that you pair program with
developers is so that you do learn new
things from each other and you do see
things from different directions so and
he's taught me a ton as well as just to
throw that out there in case you're
watching but but uh but really what I'm
trying to say guys is you need to be
getting multiple sources even if some of
it's the same information because
there's so much in JavaScript alone
don't don't even think about HTML CSS
compilers build tools you know sass less
frameworks libraries databases back and
routing
there's so much that just JavaScript
alone you need multiple sources for so
that you can learn as much as possible
and someone will expose you to new
things so if you're only using free code
camp you're at a massive disadvantage if
you're only using code
if you're only using YouTube's you're
only using your Demi if you're only
using blogs if you're only using books
so what I would like to leave you with
is just understanding that you need to
get your information from multiple
sources when you're learning and that
doesn't mean you can't have a preferred
method or anything like that but
definitely expose yourself to different
things and that doesn't mean do ten at
once maybe you're doing two or three at
a time
you know you do free code camp for a
week and they say hey man that jQuery
course was pretty cool on free code camp
I built some projects let me go buy a
jQuery course on udemy for twelve
dollars read up on some blogs watch some
YouTube videos just really hammer it in
and learn and you'll pick up three four
or five things that weren't covered in
that course but if you never took the
time to go to multiple sources you'll
never ever learn everything that you
need to because even if ten percents
missing out that could cost you a job
that could cost you from a $10,000 raise
it could cost you everything that you
want and just make you look like a scrub
when that one day you can't look like a
scrub to get your foot in the door so I
hope that you're taking advantage of all
the wealth of knowledge out there all
the wealth of channels that's why I did
top five channels to share so share some
love for these channels because everyone
has a different take on different topics
so you asked me my take on MongoDB vs.
my sequel I'll give you a little bit of
my knowledge and they say okay well what
does you know what does Eric think what
does Brad think what does Chris think
you still listen the same topics and
sometimes you'll find that hey you know
what maybe the main resource that I'm
using it doesn't even work for me all
that well like it's it's great and I'm
learning but this other guy smaller
channel large channel whatever is I get
what he's saying he's explaining it or
she's explaining words I understand and
maybe after I go here's Michael back to
this other resources may be too
technical or not not user friendly and I
can gain other things so that's why I
want to leave you with guys
my final thoughts use multiple resources
you never know what what tidbits of
information you may pick up and also
even if it covers some of the same stuff
as it will this is the nature of
learning you're going to hammer in those
pieces while picking up a little bit of
the gems long way so thank you so much
for watching us I appreciate you all
it's been a pleasure as always join the
Facebook group join the patreon there's
other things to join join has subscribe
if you're watching this for the first
time like the videos comment in the
future I put out three videos a week
sometimes more with one live stream on
top of that I'm working very hard on the
channel as well as on courses and a book
as I mentioned and really trying to to
get my life to that next level so no
matter where it is that you're at in
life my immediate goal right now is to
buy property be a first-time homebuyer
or something that I never really thought
about until tell her recently and it has
been come a goal of money so saving
money and working towards that and I
never thought about it because my main
goal was to become a developer and I
accomplished that and it's a good
feeling so I hope that you accomplish
your goals and I have several goals
become a better developer buy a house
and be financially independent grow
YouTube channel a lot of these goals
overlap but have a having a wonderful
weekend and think about what your goals
are and how you're going to accomplish
them and using multiple resources may
may be one of the ways that you get
there a little bit faster so thank you
guys see you next time
