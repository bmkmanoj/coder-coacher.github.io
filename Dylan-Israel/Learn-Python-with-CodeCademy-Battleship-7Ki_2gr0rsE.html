were doing battleship as you can see
have 53% of this done yesterday while I
was doing it my power went out for a
brief second I think the AC overloaded
it so I lost the video it's on it it's
there but I can't access it file formats
messed up or something along that line
so we're going to just go ahead and
restart it again but yeah so we're gonna
restart out we'll just be resetting this
half of the code as I go so this first
one we're not doing things basically if
I remember correctly we're creating kind
of a our own mock battleship so here
it's asking us to create a variable
called board and set it equal to an
empty list that's all we need to do
there cool all right and then let's go
ahead actually and copy this because I
am so we're going to create a for loop
in our 5x5 grid here and it's going to
be in the range for I in range of 0 to 5
that's basically saying we want this to
go 5 times starting at 0 hey sorry
little cats are getting the kittens game
picked on anyhow so for AI we want to
save loop we want to print out excuse me
rather we want to add to board the board
board append
Oh times five and I originally tried
times fiving it at the end but
unfortunately it didn't work properly so
let's return outside the function no
border pen Oh
so let's uh luckily we are you do this
so apparently I need to put this in
brackets because this is a list that
we're adding to it well it's a cigarette
let's see print Oh print board it's
asking us to print it actually it's not
asking us to do either if I remember
correctly so let's go ahead and take
that out there you go so we're not
actually returning anything right here
quite yet so we're just adding to the
list so now it's going to ask us to
print it so we're going to print the
board and now it should print out 5x5 oh
s--- and you see right there we have 25
votes we haven't stacked them yet though
cut this out alright so first you let
your existing print statement good then
to find a function called F print bar
it's a def print underscore board with a
single argument board inside the
function write a for loop iterates
through each row and bore it in each row
in board and print it to the screen so
for I in board how did I do it before I
do it in range or frying board oh yeah
that works too
print I
call function board make sure it works
all right so my cats going crazy on the
catnip right now all right so print
underscore board so we're gonna call
this right now let's put a space in here
break it up a little bit so print board
and we're calling it on our board list
so now it should print 5 5 5 5 and drop
down Brian board don't forget your colon
and there we go so we're partway there
all right now it wants us to use we're
going to try and clean it up a little
bit using a something called a join
function so we can see above here that
how it's how it's used so let's just
kind of kind of go ahead and go from
there so we're going to say I print i
dot join board and see if that does it
this object has no attribute join oh
excuse me
join hi I and then they wanted us to
have an an empty space so just like this
so you see took out the kind of the
array brackets and it cleaned it up at
an empty space cool
alright so define two new functions
random row and DEF CON so deaf random
kind of square row board and we're going
to have a deaf random underscore column
and that's going to take an board as
well and then each one of these are
going to use they already supplied up
here if you forget how to come get from
a library so from the random library
we're importing random int so that's why
we're going to be able to use this right
now we're going to say return Rand int
between 0 and the length of the board
minus 1
the reason it's minus 1 is because
length doesn't start at 0 it starts at 1
and when we're getting the index when
we're using this for index points in a
list or an array or anything of that it
that starts at 0 so we have to minus 1
to get either will get a index out of
bounds or add a balance there and then
we're going to do the same thing for
this so return Rand int and same thing
it's uh because it's 0 content of the
board minus 1 and call Kali trunks on
the board so let's call it now so we
have random I square row board and then
we have random I'm going to show column
board and let's see what's going on here
make sure we did everything correct all
right cool
so we're getting in there all right
and where was I so create a new variable
called guess row so guess underscore row
and we're going to set it
oops not set we're going to let this be
an int that gets raw underscore input
and I don't remember if we did this
right if we've used raw input before but
um I think I'm thinking of the
JavaScript course but this is kind of
like Java scripts prompt this is going
to prompt something up in the browser or
in our ID here and the user will give
input for that so we're gonna do the
same thing here we're gonna guess the
column and it's good naming convention
when you can kind of like if I were to
give this to my mother and be like what
do you think guess row does what do you
think guess calmed us so if you can get
it to that point obviously we won't be
able to do that every time but an
application like this is designed for a
user so if you can get this to work and
so to the point where even your
variables kind of make sense to the
average person it's a good good start
and that's my point is I like guest role
and guest column and ship row and ship
column these are good name so let's go
three and three cool so you see we've
got our input we haven't done anything
with it yet though all right now it
wants us to print the value of guests of
ship column so print ship underscore
column
print ship underscore row and I think
the next section is where MSO three and
three so it it was basically saying that
the ship row is foreign one all right
yeah now we're back door is that so
we're saying I believe I had this let's
take that out all right so add an else
if I was sleeping there so add an else
if print out you miss my battleship and
else if print out you miss my battleship
if guests are L it is add an else under
the if we wrote in the previous step
okay Oh area some somehow we should
alright so on line 29 at an if and guess
the row so we're adding if guess
underscore row is exactly equal to ship
row and guess on a short column is
exactly goes ship column we want it to
print some out so so print and then
just because I always seem to have
spelling errors I'm going to copy and
paste this in here
so we're going to say three oops
make sure you enter in a proper integer
so that it was two in one so we didn't
sink the battleship alright now we're
going to add an else statement that says
else print and again I'm just going to
copy this over because I've had so many
errors with the things being misspelled
or not punctuated properly
alright so else you missed my battleship
set the list element at gastro guess
Comdex and then we are going to say
we're going to print that you miss my
battleship and now we need to override
whatever the board is for that silver
st. board and we're going to say how to
go into this so row first so bored guess
let's go row comic guess and for column
equals equals or equals x rally
as less on your else statement print
print
call print board also print underscore
board and now with our new slightly
altered board we can see the X of where
they've already guessed
so let's guess three so three and three
should be I'm pointing the screen like
yes and see you missed my battleship
this indices must be integers not tuples
my tuples are two numbers so oh whoops
alright so this is my fault
I basically tried to put it as like
coordinates when we're actually the way
the way we're doing it is it's different
they're different the there's there's
like five arrays instead of two and
we're trying to say get this point this
array and in this array get that so this
should fix it right here
so three and three BAM so we missed
there's our three so 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 BAM
so that's not it so cool so the outer
listen in our list is how they would
explain it also add an if statement that
is nested under else alright so if I
like the simple and it should check if
guest row is not in range at 5 and guess
column son Orion Drive
so if guess I'm just a row
yes
greater than or equal to a range greater
greater than range in our range five for
guess a column is greater than range
five print
and again just copying this over I shall
just copy it with quotes
I know for the : after your new if
statement add an else that contains your
existing handler for negress yes so if
guess row is
then we're going to add our else here
and we have to indent all this let's see
if we made any mistakes so we're going
to say again well actually let's do one
and one so we miss you missed my
battleship and it's within the range so
everything works so let's cool and we
know it works because it's an else
statement under this if statement so
everything's good to go I add an Elif to
see if the guessed location already has
an accident so Oh see here
I believe this is the correct spot Alif
so L if our board gets your guests
column already equals equals and x print
you guess that one already
oh let's try to zero zero zero you miss
my battleship there's four four so looks
like everything's going well thoroughly
test your game make sure try a variety
of different guesses and look for any
errors in syntax or logic so pause this
video and do all that that's not
something I'm going to do well you're
kind of there the only thing we really
need to add to this it's probably a
while loop so that we can continue doing
until we meet one condition if I had to
guess that's what we'll be doing next
so we missed those are four and four all
right so add a for loop that repeats the
guessing chunk part you're game for four
turns like the example above alright so
we're just
all right so this is where you want to
do this is like the bulk of our our
board here are a battleship so we're
going to say for turn and range for
print turn
, turn +1 2 let's play know what turn
the iron indent everything so I should
be refuted alright so we just need to do
that and I if ever if if everything I
said is correct so this says it's turn 1
so we're going to and to you miss my
battleship so cool turn 2 so 3 and 3
cool or on turn 3 now 4 &amp;amp; 4 miss my
battleship and 1 &amp;amp; 1
there's my battleship alright so it
seems like our turn method is working so
now we're going to see at an
entertainment to check see if the user
out of guesses so we're ghosts how do we
put it under the else that accounts for
misses so see you miss my battleship
alright and then we'll say if
all right so if turn is equal equal to
three print game over so we know it's
one four so let's just try and make sure
it works a two two three three and then
turn four four four game over and it
prints the board one last time
cool so add a break under the wind
condition to end the loop after win all
right
and so we're adding a breaker right here
to break the loop the reason for that is
so that the game doesn't continue
running and we should probably do the
same thing for game over here too so
let's go ahead and see that it works so
we're going to say 3-0 congratulation
you suck my battleship it doesn't print
again we're good to go so it's a safe
submit let's try it one more time these
are congratulations you sunk my
battleship and extra credit dang this
might be something with you in the
future
actually let me pause the video I'll
come back to this and I'll actually do
this extra credit so all I'll continue
on just
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
