we're working on getting our free
developer certificate full stack
developer and web developer certificate
we're in basic algorithm scripting
bonfire factored factorial eyes a number
if you're not sure what it means
factorial eyes is typically denoted by a
number and then exclamation point
following it and what that means is we
are going to take that number in this
case 5 and then we are going to multiply
it all the way down to 1 and so in this
case 5 factorial is 120 so first thing
that we need to look at is what's going
on so we need this first one to return
120 so what are we going to do for this
so we're gonna create a for loop and
we're going to have create a variable I
to keep track of it and in this case
we're starting at 1 we're also going to
say while I is less than num whenever
we're going with we're gonna change that
shortly though and then we're gonna say
num is equal to num times I so we're in
our 3 we're gonna 1 times 5 2 times 5 3
times 10 4 times 20 and get our are and
so on and so forth so but the only issue
here is that we actually can't use known
we're gonna use count and we're gonna
set a variable before because I was
having issues with this I've done this
many times so we actually need to keep
count because when we keep on increasing
num here we're going to actually
decrease
we're gonna keep increasing this and
it's an infinite loop so let's go ahead
and run this to see what's going on so
that that works so we store a thing to
num here we say create a variable I say
as long as I is less than our count
whatever our num is increase it store
the number and then let's return it when
we're done so you can see that it works
for factorial 5 and then we can do
factorial eyes
my is 10 which is gonna be three point
six two million or so there's that and
then we can just go ahead and copy and
put that in there as well but you see
right here that whatever ginormous isn't
worth a factorial 0 we do not get a
value and factorial is 0 should return 1
and so what we're gonna do is just a
simple if statement we're going to say
if count is equal to num equally equal
equal to num return 1 else do our for
loop that we just wrote so now let's go
ahead and just take out all these guys
and we just want to test out 0 so let's
make sure that we are returning 1 run it
naturally they want all of it
Oh whoops so if count is equal equal to
zero that's what we wanted to do I guess
we're gonna use three equals run that
there we go
cool so let's go ahead and tweet this
it's always good to try and help out
these free sides so just a quick thing
let's type in some comments right here
so we can go if we need to come back we
know we're talking about here so far
counting equals no why did we do that we
did that so that we could store a count
variable for for loop here statement
four unique zero case scenario and then
here we did our loop two factorial is
starting now one and moving up to the
end cool so that's our comments that was
how to factorize the number of bonfire
I'll see you guys in the next challenge
which is going to be let's check it out
here real quick check for palindromes so
should be a lot of strings and stuff
like that see you guys next time thanks
for watching thanks for watching the
video don't forget to Like and subscribe
that helps me out a ton and I appreciate
all the comments that I get and all the
questions I get in the comments and I'm
happy to answer them so keep them coming
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
