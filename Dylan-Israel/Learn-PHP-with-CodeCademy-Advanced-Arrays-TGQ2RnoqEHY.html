coke at amis PHP and we have advanced
arrays and maps it's probably a little
bit of review and it's only for our
course estimation I think we've I don't
know what the video is added up to but
probably went a little bit quicker than
that and in this case I actually already
started it but um it's having us
instantiate the array of fruits here so
we're usually over a keyword here and
then we're going to insert the values
and the second part is just modify the
echo statement on line 9 to display that
the fruit the fruit in the middle of the
Ray that would be apples so we're going
to use the dot you can take out this
comment you could also leave it and if
you want I just prefer to take it out
we're going to call the fruits array and
remember that the index values always
start at zero and so apples would be one
and so you see up at the top I love
eating apples too and then the next
section associative arrays so let's take
a look at what's going on here so we
have this is array using integers as
indices so we have three ra this is an
associative array remember kind of the
hashes and the keys and whatnot so this
is the key to the door to the value key
to the door to the value key to the door
to the value that's just how I remember
it but uh so we blue blue so let's go
ahead and do our section so freash array
and editor add the value BMW to the end
of the array for the associative array
alright so we want to add BMW to this
first array
alright and then we want to add for the
associative rate used to make as the key
alright so we're going to put at the end
here so put alma to add a new section
we're going to say make and now our sum
equals equals arrows and we're going to
it BMW and see right here we get BMW BMW
because we're calling make and we're
calling third index which is zero one
two and three so bam there we go all
right so you generation the previous
exercises write an echo statement online
22 to talk about your car beyond the
fact that it's blue try using both
erases thrive the card which one makes
it easier so in this case its echo we
want to do this echo my car year is
don't remember if there's a way to make
it so it wasn't such a pain to do I
don't remember the exact there's a way
that we don't have to dot it like this I
don't remember the syntax but we didn't
learn it so we will go ahead and do my
array and we will call the zero index
2012 and then little dot will put a
period or action of a hand will put will
call it is a space with dot and then
we'll call the my associative array
and then we will in there put the make
and then we'll cut and i'll put period
and then we will call the semicolon into
that and so there it is my car years and
this is bringing out from before but my
car years 2012 enters of BMW which isn't
even remotely true in my case I in the
editor create your own associative rain
loop through the keys and values so um
you see a little example here it looks
like they wants to create a for loop so
create your own associative array okay
so which is great to values so if you we
can look at the salad example and we'll
say we'll just name this villain
lowercase those pills until the standard
dimension we're going to keep create
array and then we are going to say name
name is the key for the door it gets us
the value Dylan and then we'll do one
more and we'll say age 9 and 1 will say
27 actually we don't declare that as a
string and then in this case we will
iterate through the for loop to echo it
out so we can actually just go ahead and
let's copy pasta this here save yourself
a little bit typing so mom say just set
it to Jay so Jay is this
log j j is less than Dylan I believe
there's a dot length alright let's see
if we remember the function was called J
plus plus and villa
okay actually that won't work because
we're iterating through the index using
an associative array and we need to use
for each like this one ok so my mistake
that's treating it like a regular ray so
we need to use a for each and then and
then the sort through Dylan as I will
say value gray value which I like my
case key to the door to the value here
going to echo do you want to display
excuse me I so there's a key we've got
puts face you're done and then we'll do
value and then we will put a line break
in their online 36 let's sit here syntax
are expected
alright so we're just going to copy this
real quick we did get that earlier air
that we get on occasion of PHP where
shake it's a little funky we're going to
control pace that back in and hear that
alright so it's it works just fine just
stuff for some reason the IDE it's a
little weird in Codecademy so in this
case I once asked to add another card to
the array can have whatever rank suna
value but keep in mind that needs to be
does it want us to add another array try
any another card to the rake and all
right so this is just wanting us to
basically add a third dimension to the
array will print that out and make that
name from a diamond's area still prints
that out but we just added another array
to it so let's see all we've learned on
our very last example of PHP all right
so we are going to create a variable
called my array set equal to a new array
we create array and then we'll just do
name and age like so Dylan and also you
don't have to have the same type of
input it's nice grab a value from your
array and display it we're going to echo
out hopefully array excuse me my array
and will just display money now loop
through the array I'll put the contents
little browser all right so let's do a
for loop since we're using a standard
array will create an integer cult I and
will so um well I is less than my array
leave it was length uh we're just going
to heart cut this just goes I don't Your
Honor the exact name of it so in this
case I believe to will work I plus plus
but in general you don't really want to
hard-code things we have to it actually
wants to school put this on you all
right so we got another air here before
we continue let's go ahead and copy what
we have here in refresh the page alright
so I plus plus and then we want to echo
out and ring that that weird air and I
go out the my array and in it we're
going to just have it be sorted out by I
and that should work
so let's control see this refresh the
page um fortunately we've been having
issues all week with this same cement
nothing was printed huh oh we need to
set this equal to zero and let's go
ahead
i is equal zero eyes listen to i plus
plus echo out my array 0 to do alright
let's try that now there we go so see
Dylan Dylan 27 so this Prince it wants
and we're going to share this and we
finished our PHP course so let's go
ahead and close this and you notice we
don't have another section it's just
going to give us a quick course overview
you can see we're hundred percent done
so i encourage everyone to share this
and take advantage of these cool coding
900,000 people have argued enrolled in
this i'm not quite sure we have actually
finish it it's a quick for our course
beginner level and probably when they're
quicker courses Ruby's about eight they
recommend but that was PHP and i'll be
working on a few api programs the
meantime and of course the other the
other sections as well if they have and
i'll see you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
