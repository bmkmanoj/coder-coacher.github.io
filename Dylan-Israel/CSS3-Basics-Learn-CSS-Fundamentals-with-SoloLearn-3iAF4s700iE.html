back in solo learning and CSS in the
css3 basics let's go ahead and get
started here
introduction to cascading style sheets 3
some of the new features include border
radius border images multiple
backgrounds animations and effects I
guess it is is it is indeed possible to
have multiple backgrounds box shadow is
another aspect Green put a shadow behind
things gradients as well linear and
radial gradients are basically taking
two colors and then doing something with
them
CSS defines two types of gradients
linear and radial as we just saw
transforms allow you to rotate scale
move and skew elements so transforms you
use quite often we can kind of drag and
drop things and and do things like that
on average so animations here I mean I
have to go back and read this real quick
okay so transitions are what's used to
try to animate from one value to another
so you like transitioning you'll see
that a lot in a lot of these libraries
like angular material are somewhere
rather or you know bootstrap version 4
where those things already built into
your built into the library
border-radius is in Chrome and Safari
but you need a prefix excuse me you need
a prefix WebKit for border-radius for a
Safari and Chrome
so you see a couple of web kits here for
each each one WebKit WebKit Moz - MS -
Oh fill in the missing code to support
border-radius from Zillow Firefox as
well so that was Moz - border-radius
you should definitely look up if before
doing that to see what browsers support
it or don't or just go ahead and test it
to find out you give it an element
rounded corners like this using border
radius and setting pixels you can do it
on various things as well
border radius you can do it in part of
it all of it it just really depends on
what you want to do so it goes same way
top right left bottom top top left would
be 15 if I remember this correctly that
would be that excuse me top left would
be 0 and then 15 pixels the bottom life
so top right bottom right bottom right
is 10 and then we have bottom left is 15
and then top the left is 10 15 0 and 20
I think I got that right it would appear
that I did not so let me go back and
look at this real quick so I thought it
was going to go right but I think this
yeah starts in top left top left top
right bottom right bottom left okay so
top left is 0 15 pixels to the bottom
left so the bum lift is last one bottom
right so 20 and then 10 cool
you can create a circle so you can do
all these sort of things right if you
put a hundred pixels or I believe it's
fifty percent will create a circle so
the border radius should be 50 percent
of the height and the width and it will
basically create a circle so then keep
in mind box shadow
see the shadow around it that's the Box
shadow you're gonna need two pixels and
then a color basically the offset and
then the vertical offset so basically
how much to the right do you want it now
or the left and how much above or to the
bottom do you want it so we have our box
- shadow and then we want 10 per 10
pixels I believe it was vertical than
horizontal we'll find out right now good
to have it backwards you said you so
assume a 20 and 10 so it's horizontal
than vertical now you can kind of see it
gets a little blurry right so you can
use blur and spread so this is Blair and
then this is spread
negative values so like I said we were
going right or down if you wanted to go
left and top you could put negatives in
there as well place the box shuttle
properties value in the correct order so
I believe that's it there we go
box-shadow techniques you can do it on
the inside as well like so we're using
inset you have to use the insect
keywords to get it to look like that you
can do it around the whole thing if you
want just guide you inset here once and
the inside here once but notice that
it's within the same box property you're
gonna need a comma in between the values
so you can get pretty pretty intense
with this as you can see right here we
have multiple kind of going on so you're
gonna separate them with commas
transparency so this is your RGB a sort
of things that we were talking about
there's RGB which is red green blue and
there's red green blue alpha so if you
want something if you want like a
background color or a button color and
you want to be partially see-through you
use our GBA and throw it in there
zero is fully transparent one is fully
opaque goes into a little bit more
detail but you see kind of this right
here slightly see-through
so here we're gonna have a border - top
that we want to have a pixel around and
then we're gonna have a box shadow what
has an inset of 0 1 pixel and then a
bunch other so you can start combining
these very well get very complex very
soon so similar to the box shadow you
can also put text shadow if you look at
our text shadow here you can kind of see
the shadow before it so let's see here
down so they've had the blue so 25 and
15 text shadow you can see it's a little
bit you can kind of start adding some
colors to it as well
and offsetting it and just continues on
so you have multiple text shadow similar
to box shadows basically as many as you
want pseudo classes allow us to style
elements or part of elements that exist
in the document tree without using
javascript so yeah first child and last
child what this basically means is you
can kind of saying like the first one
from the parent class in this case you
have your parent and then the paragraph
like so so basically the first paragraph
look at our example here so the div ID
here this is our parent class and we're
saying look only target the first item
the first paragraph right here basically
is what's that saying and then you can
keep it going as much as you want maybe
you want the last child second child all
that sort of stuff so we want Terry with
perks element basically just think as
the containers as the parent and the
stuff within as children and continuing
onward
there's pseudo elements I'm not too
familiar Sioux element so let's see here
there are five suit elements he's
starting with two double : we have first
line first line of us of a text and
selector first letter selection select a
portion of element I've selected by user
before some content and last so that
first line and first letter is pretty
cool I'm gonna have to keep that in mind
so you're gonna need to use the mas
prefix to use this at least well at the
time
tutorial was made first time before
heading I don't think heading was one so
you see right here you can use this add
a little bit of style throwing your
content just kind of showing you an
example P add an image prior to the
paragraph before and then the URL like
so so if we want to add an image right
before each paragraph we do it like so
word wrap it's not something I'm really
familiar with word wrap property allows
you to allows long words to be broken
and wrapped into the next line takes two
values normal and break word in this
example below the word wrap property is
set to normal okay now let's see what
happens when we see the name same
example in the word wrap property to
break word it looks like it kind of just
wraps down within the container okay so
fill in the blanks to fit the text in
that so this was word - wrap and I
forgot what it was it was a break word
or break word excuse me and then font
face font face the last custom fonts to
be loaded into the webpage okay so you
see all these sort of font types i dot t
TF + dot o TF and then internet explorer
because they'd like to be a pain in the
ass kzo t so all of them are supported
except yo T and excites forward it's for
ie only so font family kind of similar
right so your font family you pass it in
and then you pass in the source as well
you just do the at font face and you can
import it into your CSS I didn't know
this so this is pretty cool I'm gonna
have to keep that in mind just passing
the URL like you would in your HTML
documents makes sense so that all your
styling really should be in here so it's
this was
that font - face and then we are I
forgot the syntax already so that's a
font - family source okay so this is
font - fat font - face so you define the
property and then you say I want the
name of the font - family and then the
source of where it's located at kind of
interesting that they broke it up in two
parts but I guess it's a little bit
easier to understand in the following
values give her for the bottom right
corner and we're starting top left top
right bottom right that would be 30 use
the font face to find a new font a cs3
and fill in the blanks to color the text
in the paragraph with the ID my text so
let's go ahead and pass that in also add
a black shadow so text a shadow and then
with five pixels to the right and three
pixels down and you're good an
assignment color I might have got those
pixels in the wrong order fill in the
blanks to the first line of the
paragraph use a newly designed font
phone family so again this is gonna be
at font - face and that source is our
URL and then this is first - line and
then this was first line usually
define font called tests
I think that's it and bam so you see how
it all ties together so up next we'll be
doing gradients and backgrounds lots of
cool stuff I'm gonna actually be using
that app font face for now on in my
videos and as I continue to try and
become a better developer and fill in
the gaps in my knowledge in cs3 CSS in
general transitions and transformers I
expect to learn a lot as well as
gradient background basically from cs3
and on on I think there's a lot I'll be
learning but as always guys thanks for
