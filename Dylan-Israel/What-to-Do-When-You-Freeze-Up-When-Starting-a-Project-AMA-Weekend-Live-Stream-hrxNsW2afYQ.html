from the streets of st. Petersburg
Florida
all right so for those who are new what
I like to do every weekend and oh my god
please tell me this is a public
livestream and not a private one I think
my last one I did was unlisted and I
make a mistake no I suppose public a
cool just checking just checking I so uh
for those of you who are new to the
channel and there's quite a few we've
had our best month of growth ever which
is fantastic in this month alone we've
had almost 3,000 new subscribers so
welcome to the fam welcome to the family
well welcome we got our voice from
Atlanta from India today but every every
Saturday sometimes Friday sometimes
Sunday but every Saturday I like to do
livestream a little bit of a thank you
say thank you for coming hopefully I can
answer your questions provide some
direction whatever it is I started off
with the question a little bit about
what's going on with me and go from
there so uh a little bit about me before
I answer today's question which we'll
start off by talking about what to do
when you freeze up when starting a
project this is something that is really
really common especially wearing getting
started but as people are tuning in here
for the next second I got laser eye
surgery yesterday so if you thought your
boy was handsome before hey now no more
glasses so I only got it in this eye
right here I got it done yesterday
pretty quick thing it cost me about four
hundred dollars is really in my mind
cheap and yeah I go in just for a
checkup make sure everything went right
but as of today it's been less than 24
hours I have no pain in my eye
it's a little dry but you're supposed to
take drops for the first two three weeks
and
the only sort of after effects for the
for up to three months is that lights at
night are a little bit blurry and I
could say that I was true at least last
night but uh I my vision is perfect now
so that was something new that I did
yesterday which was exciting and I of
course am also enrolled in school I just
got done ten minutes ago passing my
third course I this course took me three
weeks only because one of the weekends I
was actually working for my company we
have our biggest event of the year a
conference that we throw that's a
three-day conference and I was helping
them out and so that that threw me back
a little bit but in a matter of seven
weeks I've completed let's say four
three and six thirteen units in seven
weeks pretty happy about that gonna
continue that trend to the best of my
ability I also have released the
JavaScript 360 course which is about
seven hours of content with a little bit
of a brief intro to github and markdown
and algorithms so something for you to
check out if you're interested in that
all right so now that people have kind
of tuned in let's go ahead and answer
today's questions and then we'll start
taking questions so today's question is
what to do when you freeze up when
starting a project right so this is
something that happens all the time
where you're starting to learn to code
right you're going through the tutorials
you are doing YouTube videos doing free
cocaine if you're doing coke Adam you're
doing udemy you're doing whatever it is
that you can get your hands on and they
say hey it's time to kick it up to that
next level right it's time to actually
build so far we've been giving you the
words the syntax sort of the dictionary
definitions but now it's time to piece
it all together and so you open up that
text editor you open up that code pin
and then immediate fear sets in and you
go oh my god I have no idea what I'm
doing I don't know where to get started
and I panic you essentially have a panic
attack so I would and you start
questioning things so that is this for
me do I really did I really understand
what was going on
it's pretty common um and part of it is
just not being familiar right so you've
been learning about all these things and
you know I always use the hammer and
nails because what you're really syntax
is nothing but tools right and methods
are nothing but tools and supplies right
and so you've been started talking about
tools and supplies but and you got a
hammer and a nail and now we say all
right cool now go build a house with it
and you're like whoo how do I build a
house with a hammer and nail I know what
a hammer is I know what a nail is and I
thought I understood how to use it but
now when I have to go use it I kind of
panic so just the first thing to
understand is that it's completely
normal
it's something that you're you are
kicking it up a notch and it's okay to
sort of be baby step even in something
like a tribute page write a tribute
pages of something just attic HTML pages
where you just want to create an image
create a paragraph and that's really
after you look at it you have to sort of
break it down piece by piece and say
okay okay
calm down for a second what did what is
it that I actually have to build here
and you have instructions I need to
build a tribute page what does that mean
it means I need to build an HTML page
start out by creating your HTML page
right in term literally the page note no
content so you're like okay this will be
tribute dot HTML
what is the bare bones that you need for
such a project to get started well I
mean my dog tag I mean my HTML tag so
I'm gonna need a body and they start
saying okay hopefully by now you've
calmed down a little bit he's like
alright where progress has been made now
it's all gonna be a blank white page
looks like progress to be made but
you're slowly analyzing the situation
and that's what you have to do is you
have to start piecing this out and this
is there something it's gonna happen
throughout your entire career when you
are going up levels right and you need
to be able to piece out the parts that
you do understand and go from there and
you say okay I don't need images how do
I inject an image worried about it
making it look better later I say all
right an image tag what is it how do I
do that
what's in an image Peggy maybe you have
to go and look it up that's fine he's
like oh it's a source the source
attribute you start piecing it together
okay okay okay now I need to do a
paragraph how
paragraph yeah you know stackoverflow
google whatever and figure it out but
the the real goal for you when you sort
of are panicking and putting it all
together is really start piecing it out
piece by piece and if you have to if you
have to legitimately draw it out on a
piece of paper write some pseudocode
have it have like a box and they put IMG
and then source and write the equals two
and just search your your your
handwritten notes communicating it into
the text editor and it start piecing it
together because that's what happens is
you get overwhelmed by the sense of this
massive or you know what is perceived to
be a massive project and you say oh my
god how am I ever gonna get to the
finish line well you don't need to get
to the finish line in your first ten
lines of code what you need to do is
figure out how do I break this down into
twenty subsets two subsets five subsets
and just attack those pieces
piece by piece by piece and then at the
end it all comes together and it works
so when you're in that situation where
you're getting overwhelmed by an empty
text I just evaluate what it is that
you're trying to do even right steps you
know I want to insert an image ok IMG
and draw it out and then slowly try and
communicate piece by piece and it'll be
a much less overwhelming and stressful
task so that's my advice for you when
you freeze up starting those projects is
try to evaluate what are what can you
sort of say okay well the menu let's
start with the menu right okay what do I
want the menu to be well I need menu
options how do I get menu options well
let's start by putting text in and then
we'll worry about it looking nice later
so that's my advice when sort of getting
overwhelmed by projects I think it will
be really helpful for you when getting
started I am I hope that I hope that
helps excuse me I am if you guys want
know a little something something my
girlfriend is not letting me drink
energy drinks in the house anymore but
she allowed me to have one cuz I had a
test today and I had like this much left
I was drinking issues like you're done
with your test right so you'll need that
anymore and then I ran off because she
was trying to take it away and I was
drinking it and then she smacked it out
of me pushed me over and then I spit it
all out
through my nose through my throat so my
throat's a little sore my noses smell
like energy drinks and my carpet behind
my pcs all wet so that was if I sound
like I have a little bit of a hoarse
voice
you can blame her that's what happened
all right you boys just want a little
bit of extra caffeine for the day
and she wasn't having it so let's go
ahead and answer some questions how am i
I'm good
sup bossed from the final boss uh
looking awesome Thank You Man I uh I've
been kind of struggling with caffeine
lately my girlfriend is on me about it
so I will do better how can you master
angular how do you system I would start
by building some of your own projects I
would also start by taking some of the
wonderful courses that are on udemy
right I am doing a course by Maximilian
that I do about 30 minutes a day like
70% done and it's like a 26 hour course
something that is gonna treat you see
that everything in angular but that I
would say it's really for developers or
you're just looking to get started
there's a lot of other courses that are
like six seven eight hours to get you
going
found out about me this month one more
viewers to Sweden shout out to our boys
from Sweden it's a kind of interesting
thing is how many like between my two
courses I think I have 20 different
countries four people have bought
courses which is really cool so many
happy moments we do like livestream
sorry I'm not a follower ahead Tesh I'm
not familiar with him you landing your
first internship I'm gonna be able to
learn JavaScript no to express it nice
congratulations that learning
documentation nice I'm also a fan of
traversing media do you have a diffuser
something that's just my essential oil
diffuser what language is good for
freelancing jobs uh well I mean there's
contract roles and there's freelancing
or else if you it's kind of there's a
difference right I would much much more
so tell people to go for free he's thing
you can with all these languages you can
do freelance and contract work with all
them it just a matter it just matters on
how good you are what how well you can
market yourself but I can honestly tell
people to stay away from freelance until
they have some some years of experience
cuz it'll be much easier and you'll get
a much better client and much higher
pain roles
uh advice for a first job of a software
engineer in agile development
environment I would say just be prepared
to spend about two hours a day after
work just getting caught up on the stack
right so when you start a new role as a
developer this goes for any new job but
especially when you're just starting is
you really want to be going home every
day or showing up to work early and
prepping right you're not going to be
familiar with all of the software all of
the languages the frameworks their
development tools their you know
Jenkins swagger the DevOps tool all that
sort of stuff
and so I would encourage you to spend
some time about two hours a day for the
first three months getting up to speed
and going from there what happened to
April learns to code videos well April
there's no longer learning because she's
actually been learning project
management she just got her third
certification and project management her
most recent one was a scrum master
certification and she's studying right
now for her PMP which is like the mack
daddy project management certification
so that is the that is the the go-to how
how to have energy throughout the day I
have a lot of caffeine but a lot of
times it's just about getting good sleep
what's going on Roxas always loved the
the Kingdom Hearts fam have I been
pretty good man I've just been doing the
college thing the YouTube thing the
udemy thing the work thing the boyfriend
thing and recently most recently the
laser I think what do I think of react I
think there's a ton of jobs in react I
think it's worth learning and I would
suggest angular or react but if I had to
go in one direction or the other I'd
probably go with react just because I've
seen so many so many more companies
heading that direction lately
today's shirt looks different oh yeah I
actually used my own cup Mike my work
company actually produces essential oils
that's what I use I believe right now
it's tea tree in it oh I see so I'm off
this is kind of a mess when I took this
exam they made me like throw everything
40 feet away from me yes ones for sure
tea tree cuz the ones I have in my room
are lavender and eucalyptus any tips for
freelancing I have a video about
freelancing how much to study on
weekends when you work 40 hours well
when I was working 40 hours a week I
studied on weekdays about 3 to 4 hours
and on weekends I did about 4 to 8 I
have a video coming out on Monday about
how many hours a day you should code and
it's going a little bit more into detail
about that so keep an eye out for that
that's Monday's video for a front-end
developer wanting to move back back in
language what do you think is best to
start with well if you're employed
probably whatever language they're using
at your work and try to make that
transition now if you're not it really
depends right so there's a ton of PHP
jobs in terms of job in terms of jobs
PHP has more in terms of not wanting to
kill yourself notice much better in
terms of in terms of high pain back-end
Java is great and also c-sharp and net
would be advisable as well so that would
be my my advice but honestly if you just
look
you're 14 you're just looking to learn I
would say just choose whatever you want
men in power three should I deep dive
into reactor learn some viewer angular
it's uh you should probably not learn
view I know I know Eric is always
promote in view as no jobs in buted so
reactor angular I think picking up react
or angular is fine
do you like trips I of course I like
trips but trips are expensive so this
company still required degree if my
project is rock-solid uh I mean it all
depends right so in my case I don't have
a degree and I've had companies like
Amazon and Facebook reach out to me and
say hey we're interested in you as a
candidate would you be interested in and
working with us and doing going through
the interview process so it depends how
can you make yourself stand out is it
easier to get a job with a degree oh my
god yes well most of developers you work
with have a degrees probably will will
you learn a lot in the process of a
degree debatable but will it be well
most people need a degree yes because
most people that really struggle with
standing out as a developer it's
something that I've been able to do
quite successfully and it's been very
helpful for me in my transition to being
a developer oh what's your favorite
javascript framework or library um
probably just angular current current
version angular I've really sort of
enjoyed it just because it's introduced
me a lot to typescript and I've been
I've been loving it I'm a big fan
typescript I'm doing software
development that's what my degree is in
a Bachelor of Science in software
development
it's going quite well I just finished my
third course in seven weeks and
continued from there shet our boy Joseph
chambers all the way from May
nice
but I mean the degree the degree thing
is here's the thing guys is it's really
hard not to get a job you have to do a
lot you have to do a lot too - I'll put
this you have to do a lot - to get a job
without being a developer right so I'll
give you an example of things that I'll
give you an example for me I have
volunteer experience with code.org I
have a YouTube channel that I I'm I work
on all the time I have a Facebook group
that I have started to promote I have
courses on udemy that I have put out
there
I have mini projects I also have what
else would be something that would make
me stand out I I also am in the
process of writing a book to help with
that all that but you get the ideas
there's a lot of things there that take
a lot of time and energy and and a lot
of people just won't do or follow
through with because they have to hold
themselves accountable which is a hard
thing to do for a lot of people how
should I start with freelancing I would
suggest start by getting a job like
actual contract job or because I think
you'll make more money how much do
programmers make with front-end per hour
it depends I mean I I think my hourly
comes down to about 36 or 37 an hour I'd
have to look at what my salary is based
off that but that's what my hourly rate
would break down to not counting
benefits or bonuses or anything like
that but I'm also I have about a year
and a half development experience and
I'm sort of just getting my start in the
industry but it kind of depends on where
you're at is using less mainstream
libraries consider a bad thing it's not
a bad thing but it's gonna make it a
little bit harder for you to be hireable
in my opinion just because if will it
make you understand JavaScript better
will make you a better developer of
course you can learn anything and it'll
make you a better developer you could go
out there today link COBOL
it'll make you a better developer will
make you marketable is the different
conversation entirely or how how
marketable will it make you is is a
different thing also right so like if
you want to learn cobalt you're gonna be
a better developer are there cobalt jobs
out there yeah are there a ton of them
probably not you already have a job
mean sack developer I don't think I'm
earning much and why don't you leave and
get a different job if you think you can
earn more how much time did it take you
to understand things proper and in depth
I'll let you know when it happens I
don't know I think I think your learning
process when it comes to programming and
frameworks and languages is always
continuing right you may have an
understanding of a method or you know if
we're talking about past the general
syntax you know we're not talking about
operators we're not talking about for
loops or you know if statements all that
sort of stuff and I understood it
relatively quickly it's when you piece
it all together it gets a little harder
and that's probably one of the
challenges was front-end it's not only
are you piecing it together your team
typically effusing it together with a
framework and you're also having to
focus on making a GUI you know the view
which a lot of other programming
languages really just focus on the
backend how much
use first-semester about $3,500 that's
what I'm paying about 3 500 the cool
thing about Western Governors University
is so your semesters are six months and
what it allows you to do is you can take
as many units as you would like right so
in my case I just finished my three
courses typically most most semesters
you'll complete somewhere between 12 and
16 units so I've finished close it
either 13 or 14 units with my three
courses and now that I've done that I
can go and continue in seven weeks which
leaves me with about another 20 19 weeks
to go and do additional courses so I can
get max value for what I'm spending on
the semester in terms of units by the
way can I just say that you guys seem to
have loved my JavaScript course and I
appreciate the support because that's
course is sold more than my angular
course already in like three days and it
is appreciated is the front-end data
visualization back in free cough can
certificate enough to be higher well
it's one of its one of the things you
can use to be hired well that's another
good example of something that I have on
there it's I put the free code camp cert
to showcase how I am continuing to learn
but yeah it's it's just one of many
things yeah you could go and learn but
you need to continue your education you
start applying for internships so
everyone's different on their learning
path and so it's hard to give you hard
set answers right the world is black and
white and this is what this is what is
kind of always working this is what's
not always going to work I can tell you
that I was learning a whole bunch of
different ways and that I got my first
Deb for I even finished the front insert
on free code can
who are you and where are you working
that's kind of a little bit of strange
questions oh you finished the Google
scholarship challenge nice yes I just
released the JavaScript 360 course how's
the job jobs great man
what'd she do now to get into level 2 I
think he's just had to wait for them to
say if he did or not in the meantime
just start studying always the thing is
is you just got progressed every single
day have everybody invited from big
companies uh Amazon Facebook I said a
Facebook recur to reach out to me last
week I am still technically in a junior
role although I don't think it's fitting
to be honest do I think people have
problem with me being visually impaired
uh I mean I think you're gonna have some
issues but if you improve that you're
good developer I think you should do
just fine
how do companies reach out to developers
email LinkedIn have I read the John
Duquette looks know every boy is a a
little bit bad when it comes to reading
books I should get better I've been for
a long time wanting to read John's books
simple programmers books and going from
there
I am supposed to speaking out on my job
tonight they I am supposed to be moving
to full stack at my current work so I'm
going to be doing some dotnet and
c-sharp in the first do I have
girlfriend yes if you watch any of my
videos to the end I usually have a
little skit at the end of it with her so
at the end of the video right before
like the outro or I tell you check out
my course and subscribe and all that
crap oh yeah I tell you I have a little
skit with my girlfriend so somebody
hasn't been watching to the end of the
videos Mendips ed in early because every
single video I have something with her
in there how many how long did you
program daily when working till you can
pay enough to live off development on
the weekdays about 3 to 4 hours on the
weekends like 8 to 14 and really depend
on how how that usually create a little
bit doctor love what happened to Dolan
Dolan is coming back in a how to
Freeland had a not freelance video in
about two weeks you'll see the mustache
is almost there once the mustache is
back Dolan comes out of hiding for a
single day have I taken a vacation I
have not taken a vacation in quite some
time in over a year I would say um right
now I'm saving to buy a second car I'm
also saving for I don't want to take any
vacations so I'll see what happens to my
one year at my current job that's the
truth of the matter and we're about
halfway there how long did you do that
until he started like a year something
it's it's hard to debate but I dropped
out of college it's hard to say this
because I had a little bit of previous
experience not really in web development
but I dropped out of college and took a
job at a software company and doing
essentially technical writing and and I
was at that point doing that for about 7
months before I start
applying for jobs singing doing full
stack web development or data size but
after watching dole on I'm motivated to
be a Wix developer oh yeah do you make
time for video games no not really I
mean with college guys I'm trying to
finish this at my current rate I might
be able to finish my degree by November
December that's kind of the goal it's
and it's pretty achievable based on how
fast I'm going through my courses right
now and I would like to continue that
in-between that work YouTube and
building courses and I'm also writing a
book that's gonna be the next big thing
I work on I also kind of owe angular 360
part 2 which I put some time into so I
don't really have time for video games
and be honest no one I really no place
video games anymore so that's kind of
where it what's that favorite subreddit
I only watched one subreddit it's called
the MMA streams where is your cats my
cats are roaming about are you
encouraging dropping out of college
though no hard feelings no I wouldn't
say I'm encouraging it at all I I've
consistently said that for most people
going and getting a CS degree will
probably be there into the industry I
will say that it is not for everybody if
for sure isn't for me even as somebody
who's going and doing it now on my own
terms in a situation that works better
so there there are some people like
myself who do better in a self-taught
environment and so I would say that most
people probably should go get a degree
because they're gonna need that to help
them get their foot in the door they're
not going to be able to do you know the
free code camp search started coding
channel you know release two courses
going voluntary through code.org go to
ciaw and get your shirts there and do
all this sort of extra stuff along the
way to make yourself stand out in the
process that they're really going to
need that degree to sort of get there
freako camp needs to get their new side
up dude III feeling on that I check it
every now and again and I was really
hoping that I I know Quincy sent that
email out saying is gonna be out
Christmas I thought he meant of 2017 not
2018 we'll find out how many hours do
you code it might at your work Oh
somewhere between 60 to 75% of the time
this was asked recently by a recruiter
and they're like how many hours to code
at your job was like 60% maybe because
all the stand up the meeting the
requirement so it's probably closer to
75% it feels like whenever you're in
those meetings eyes just taking up your
whole day but really it's like 1 or 2
hours here there Josh Silicon Valley i
watch the first two or three seasons but
I haven't caught up to it it's data
science more on the math side than web
development I would say there's a lot
more math with data science I recently
discovered a web / mobile dev BS program
I had a local college is it worth for me
to go 40 60 K they'll us I've caught up
our cheese that's a lot of day I would
say if you're interested in a bachelor's
program look to it go to an online
school if you think you can handle
self-taught I mean the thing that I like
about Western Governors University is
that I can knock out multiple semesters
in a single semester if I work hard and
they'll save me money in time that way
but I mean $40,000 is the average debt
to get a bachelor's nowadays so it's
something something to consider yeah
what kind of documentation do you write
at your work I don't write any I mean I
your code should be documented well
enough that it's readable and you can
see what's going on CS first i.t well if
you like IT you should probably go into
hardware ants and DevOps
more than see us it's just gonna be more
for the software architecting
a keen interest you can you hack basic
stuff no I mean I I I'm pretty content
with web dev there is a a part of me
that wants to go into blockchain
but that's something that's years off
that's not something that's around the
corner for me right now my main I have a
couple main goals I want to accomplish
by the end of this year one I want to
finish my degree to all I want to buy a
house three I want to be promoted and
four I want to finish my book five
diuresis I want to graduate so those are
the my five big goals I want to
accomplish this year and until I
finished all those I don't really have
room to add one more oh also I want to
grow the YouTube channel two hundred
thousand which is something that I'm not
quite sure I think we'll get close I
think we'll get to like 7075 by the end
of this year but it is those are kind of
my personal goals are they all
achievable yeah is it gonna be hard yeah
may I fail some yeah that's okay I'm
gonna keep trying though I want this to
be the year I get that silver
play button that big dick silver play
button boys and girls for the ten
percent for the four women out of the 42
that are in here we want the the big
silver play button all right that's what
I want by the end of this year
I got five months I got my free code
camp sir I saw five other searched for
me Demi how should I display them on
LinkedIn and portfolio say you put on
your certifications I put the free coke
a certain in the education section and
you just have certified certifications
in there and if you want to give a three
or four word description I think that
would be okay as well I can't really
speak to as a Indian developer trying to
get a job a developer job in the US I
couldn't tell you the main reason I'm
considering university is because of
financial aid in the current market for
junior - doesn't seem very good yeah I
mean as a as a junior dev you almost
already have to be a developer right you
have to prove that you can code you have
to have a portfolio resume all that sort
of great stuff they you can't just sort
of say hey I want to be a developer and
they're gonna mold and groom you those
those days are hard do they exist yeah
are they going to be great roles maybe
not no you already almost have to prove
that you're there how was my life going
great man I I have perfect vision almost
perfect my eye still healing I got the
laser eye surgery yesterday I might be
getting my braces off in a month
III I'm gonna ask I go in for an
appointment I want I can't wait to get
them off then get my teeth whitened
for all this coffee I've been
drinking lately but yeah life is good
man I spend more time on understanding
you know you need to stop writing
everything in caps sir I'm reading
everybody's questions and if you write
another question in caps I'm going to
put you on timeout this is just rude
but uh in terms of understanding just
arrange yes code you just got to do both
that's the truth of the matter when you
feel like you understanding you gotta go
right so
upload your three-part clean code videos
udemy course to YouTube I might
eventually we'll see um how many people
work at my company 300 maybe technically
we have a lot of contract we have about
sixty thousand contract employees or
something like that around a thousand
because we are a multi-level marketing
company so would you like to work at a
tech giant company or do you like a
smaller company I would love to work at
a tech giant company that is actually my
couple couple of reasons for that as
well that would probably be my next
destination
whenever I finished my degree and and I
move on from my current role or anything
like that is I would love to go work at
a Facebook or an Amazon or Microsoft
something like that a couple of reasons
why I think it makes my important like
from a very practical standpoint I think
it sort of elevates you as a developer
on your resume - I think it would give
me a little bit more authority in terms
of the YouTube channel right you know
people people would put a lot of like if
I if I was a developer from Facebook if
people might be more inclined to watch
my videos from and be more motivated
right here you see somebody who was
sleeping on a couch two and a half three
years ago and is now a developer at
Facebook and you know maybe you would
watch that sick damn man if this idiot
can do it I can do two right but yeah I
love I would love to at some point work
for one of the tech giants of the world
is this Oh
she's anything worth it uh I don't I
don't think I'm associates worth it at
all my couch look at my girlfriend in
here creeping and talking in the
chat oh my god baby go study or do job
apps or some Jesus I live with this
girl and she's over here watching
watching the channel why are you doing
you make a guy for the intermediate
algorithms for free Co camp I do I have
every single algorithm on the YouTube
channel you just gonna see the playlist
it's there though is there any harm for
applying for an unpaid internship I did
a video exactly about this about about
unpaid internships and the stats have
shown that not only do you are you twice
as likely not to get a job from an
unpaid internship if they do make you an
offer it's 50% less and the time that
you spend at getting unpaid internship
only increases your likelihood of
getting a job by about 2% your time is
much better spent just studying on your
own time I'm putting the work in then
going to doing an unpaid internship most
of the time but I have a whole video
talking about that should you just like
go on YouTube and type in should you
take an unpaid internship or are they RN
it might be like our unpaid internships
 I forget what I titled it do I
still play league no I wanted to
recently I wanted to see if I could get
Matt on there but he doesn't play
anymore so every story about starting
your own company I've had thoughts I've
had some ideas here there that I would
like to maybe pursue later on in life or
honestly I think my the only company
that you will see me pursue is the
YouTube company
I don't know that technically becomes a
company until you make full-time salary
office so until then it's just a it's a
hobby that makes me a little bit of
money uh and that helps me continue my
love for software what do you feed that
caterpillar hey just time and energy all
right how to motivate yourself to start
learning programming every day if you
need somebody else to motivate you or to
tell you how to motivate yourself it's
gonna be a struggle
you should really find out why you want
to learn to code what you enjoy about
coding and that should be enough to keep
you to move forward right so like for me
for me I for me I basically just was
sick of being broke and I enjoyed it and
I just say alright I'm gonna study every
day and tell them a developer that was
kind of my mentality of I'm just going
to study every day until I have a job
and here we are who inspired me the most
uh I would say to start a YouTube
channel would definitely be Matt from
engineer truth I'm just seeing someone
who you know you know very well starting
a channel and being passionate about it
alright is something that I think is is
admirable and being able to sort of pick
his brain as well I've also been
inspired by by reading up on people like
Quincy Larson who have a dream and just
taught himself to learn code and all
this or so how do I meet Matt in the
sixth grade I want to say in middle
school so Matt and I have known each
other about 20 years no is your
JavaScript course the best course on
JavaScript ever I I wouldn't say that I
would say it's a great course to get you
introduced
I think all courses are unique so but
yeah so I've known Matt for a while what
are you thinking about John saunas I
think John's a very smart guy who
understands it and gets it and I think
he's also one of those guys that loves
to work and I can respect that because I
at times mmm like that and that has made
him very successful but I also think
he's one of those guys that's not gonna
let you him and he understands
the way the world works and I think
that's a important trait to have is as
to succeed in this world where you have
to look out for number one and I think a
lot of you advice is kind of that just
kind of trying to communicate that look
you know the companies of the world they
are the ones that are going to look out
for themselves and you should do that as
well and you should have the confidence
to thrive in today's stuff and
unfortunately a lot of us don't right
how old am i I'm 30 I'm that big three-o
son did Matt used to have hair yeah back
in the day Matt had hair all why we were
kids
some tips to prevent back pain from
continuous development each there so a
standing nest like one I have here
actually let's go ahead and do that
stand up so you get a standing desk they
also have things that you can put on top
of your desk
raise your monitor and laptop and all
that and another thing to consider is I
have one at my work but there is a
backrest that you can have so you have a
good good posture and a sheet rest and
stuff like that so those are some things
that you can do to help also just you
know take some walks every 30 minutes
here or there stretch your legs
what I like an Arduino probably at some
point I wanted to start I have a couple
ideas for using the YouTube API with
Arduino and then like every time I
subdue would just blink I guess I just
blink for five seconds but unfortunately
I've seven at the time I can't do all
the side projects in the world
unfortunately that would probably be
something cool though if I ever just
worked for myself just being able to do
all my side projects and I just do a
video about hey Lou this thing I worked
on for a month it's a bulb that lights
up when I get a subscriber on YouTube
let me show you how I make one yeah you
know I mean so I do I exercise now I was
trying to a little bit doing some
perfect push-ups well that's about as
far as I've got I need to get better
it's on the agenda and it's it's a goal
of mine as well
what kind of nature you used to have in
college I'm not quite sure what you're
trying to say there any collaboration
videos coming maybe I have a video
coming out doing shoutouts to five just
five small coding channels and in it I
say hey if if any for you oh I might
have one actually I reached out to real
tough candy who I've been a fan of her
videos and she doesn't really get enough
views throughout good her video so our
subs and I think she's around about 1500
or something like that maybe 2000 and so
I reached out to her and so I'm
expecting the email and then we're gonna
set something up hopefully
how much is my JavaScript course if you
use the coupon code coding dot is $14.99
what was my behavior I used to have in
college ah stressed anxious depressed
I'd probably be pretty much pretty much
a good example how much CSS should I
know before I do your JavaScript course
all the JavaScript my JavaScript course
is entirely based in JavaScript it
doesn't connect although we do cover
events a little bit and Dom manipulation
we are focused more so on the methods
and the functions that are a part of
JavaScript and you know operators all
that sort of stuff syntax so you don't
really need to know any CSS Jose
Gonzalez finally we have some mods in
here to put you all in check sharpening
that hammer down I'm banning you guys
forgetting hyphy um you know I'm gonna
do so I'm gonna give you guys a free
course somebody's gonna get one free
course I make a coupon code I'm gonna
make a coupon code I'm gonna throw it in
the chat guys get ready for
new JavaScript course because I'm gonna
plug my course and throw that that in
there so for those of you don't win we
can go ahead and give free course uh
let's see here
when you create a new one real quick all
right guys get ready we're doing the
countdown five four three two one I'm
throwing the link in the chat first one
to get it gets it
good luck I'm okay I'm gonna pause for
20 seconds or so and it's gonna fire in
there
get ready see if you can only one of you
gonna get it let us know if you do get
it let us know all right look at that
chat look at that that chat here goes
one of you are going to be a lucky
winner of a free course who will it be
what is my dream huh poof uh maybe right
now the meet it so dreams always
fluctuate Jose Gonzales got it all right
there it is got to be fast boys I told
you just one yeah the mod got it of
course the mod got it if you guys are
interested in the course though I'll
throw the other link in there coupon
code coding god you can get it for
$14.99 I have a video going over the
course
oh yeah so all the weekend livestreams
stay up on the channel and continue to
to be there so I think I'll give away
one course randomly every every
livestream so possible to jump back into
the back backend of course it is so a
lot of things are possible is it harder
when you're just starting maybe because
I think the UI might help you visualize
a little bit better what's completely
possible
all right guys I'm gonna go ahead and
call it quits right about now
oh hey stinker everyone was asking about
you Oh Oh buddy
so I suppose say thank you guys for all
the support lately and sharing the
videos has been something that has
helped the channel grow tremendously
tremendously and if you continue to do
it you're gonna help me you're gonna
help me achieve my goal is trying to hit
a hundred thousand subscribers this year
and it'd be a really appreciated and of
course if you're interested in any of my
courses go ahead and check them out we
hang out the angular project one and
then we have the JavaScript one now it
just got released and I hope you enjoy
keep a look out for Monday's video which
we'll be talking about how many hours a
day should it code and why and continue
continue the grind so thank you for
thanks for showing up guys I'll see you
next Saturday where we'll talk about
some other and have some fun I'll
see you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
