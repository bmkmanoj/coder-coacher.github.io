day at the supermarket under your listen
dictionary says you can see I've we
finally have caught up to where I was
preparing for my Python course so we'll
only be resetting about half of it and
the other half will be brand spanking
new for me at least so create let's go
back to the first alright so we want to
use a for loop to print out all the
names so what we're gonna do here is
we're gonna do for I in name's Cole in
print I and I should print it then you
see right here I is the values in our
names array and we're just saying for
every name for every item in the name
print out so use a for-loop to go
through webster dictionary pronounce all
the definitions so for i in webster
somewhat similar but because it's
there's a keys and values we have to do
it a little bit different so what we're
gonna say is print
alright so print webster and then we
want to put in i and that should print
out the definition it's just what they
want I wasn't sure that they wanted the
definition or the word so just a
reminder that work we're saying Webster
I so let's get this and I'm princess now
if we were just to do I hear it
pronounces the key values alright so
like the step two above loop through
each item on the list called a alright
so for I in a mixer 3 if the number
receiver print it out
Susy if I Mon Tue equals equals zero so
if it's even we want to print I likes it
a thief no true no you just say all
right that's it
they don't wants to do anything with it
so there are two four six eight ten
twelve perfect all right so I'll see you
write a function that counts how many
times the string fizzing list right
functions are called first count
all right so death is underscore count
and it takes input X and what are we
doing with this create a variable called
count
it's a hold on going count initialize
that zero so we're going to count equals
zero and what else do I need to do for
each item in X all right so for each
item in X so for I
and X I know I did for you Chinaman X
and so for I and X if it is equal
stringing increments alright then we'll
do it if X now if I is equal equal to
fizz so if if our value is equal to fizz
count equals count plus 1 after the loop
return the count of the variable and
then right here return count
invalid syntax your co2 bersa have an
air so see if eyes you go
so if I
Iko Iko the fizz all right let's see
what's going on here
all right I'm not sure what the air
we're getting here cuz this looks
correct - oh don't forget the :
that's her air right there and bam so
we're good to go there all right string
looping this just kind of looks like we
want it to print one letter in the word
Codecademy and you see it going down and
does the same thing for letter I basic
stuff here
alright so create a stock dictionary
with the values banana alright so they
give us an example here get rid of that
word and say stock and then we're gonna
say let's go ahead and just copy and put
this in here see if that will make our
lives a little bit easier and then don't
forget the appropriate commas
however to use curly braces to make the
dictionary do I need a semicolon at the
end there we go I don't think we need
this semicolon either but let's find out
real quick nope alright so it looks like
we're finally caught up look through
each key in prices so for I in prices
like for example above for each key
print out the key along with the price
and the stock information all right so
we want to print out I plus prices I
like this I love because you key along
with this price and stock information
print print the answer in the following
format
four key and 4i in prices printed on and
I think that's right
can I can't tonight this GRE so space is
saying it can't add these together like
this because they are integers and well
actually the AI is not an integer the
SGR prices is so we can leave I alone
but we have to go and say look treat
this as a string and there you go you
should have exactly three print
statements okay so we want to print out
it looks like they'll wants to do some
stuff here I don't understand it
apparently print prices high let's see
there's that orange there's you fair you
know occurrences are printed you should
have exactly make sure there are no
occurrences a print in any comment or
string are you talking about okay
all right so I'm not sure what they're
asking so I'm gonna go to the forum we
are on 8 of 13 and day at the
supermarket throat keeping track of
produce okay so let's see what's going
on here
oh we were supposed to create another
one I thought we were just supposed to
change the price all right so this is
stock and then we need to have a price
so if you live here let's just go ahead
and look at this as a reference so
don't forget that multi-line cause all
right so we have prices and we have the
stock so the first thing we can do is we
can just kind of copy this over because
it doesn't really matter we know how to
do keys and that's our first thing and
prices so make sure our indents are okay
cool so we have two different arrays two
different keys and values so the first
thing we want to do is print you look at
what we have once is nice alright so we
get rid of this I already have that so
the key so we want to print out I print
prices and only want to print stock and
if
check your code prints for orange it
doesn't quite look right so we're just
32 pair 15 all right so go back Turk
code I don't think that's auger supposed
to do we need another for loop for Keon
prices
so we declared it for key prices key
Stocki okay so it looks like we need to
say look for that key value what's the
stuff but I think they want it formatted
a specific way so let's just go ahead
and copy over the format here Bryce's
stock prices stock you know so they want
it formatted like above so what's this
is gonna say is take this get cat neat
but with this key is not defined this
needs to be I and this needs to be
adjusted properly you should have
exactly three what's going on here so
I've orange there is our price for very
orange just 1.5 for stock is 32 so we're
gonna instill some sort of hair so let's
take a look at what's going on here
anyways to show you in check it's not
quite right
orange air that's what we have so there
I finish rename price
so let's see and like let's see if this
is it at this point if you've done
enough code Academy videos oops you know
that things are not only case sensitive
they are often super sensitive so make
sure you don't have any spaces after the
colons and let's get right back into it
okay so create a variable called total
and set it to zero so simple enough
total equals zero loop through the
prices dictionary so for I in prices do
some stuff what do we want to do third
Fork
move through the price decision there
Eddie looping through it and it looks
like for each key and prices multiply
the number of prices by the number in
stock for each key well let's see if we
can do it in here I think we can so
we'll save total funny else loop through
the prices dictionary let's do our own
for loop here so we're gonna say for I
in crisis and then above this total
equals zero just a default total and
then we'll say look through the prices
dictionary for each key and prices
multiply the number and prices by the
number in stock so we're going to say
total equals total plus
yukine prices I'm so so what we want is
just say crisis with our key-value time
stock with our Q value and then we want
to print total and I believe that short
there you go so at the end we have 117
dollars worth of merchandise so first
make a list called groceries with the
values banana orange and apple
so we'll say equals orange apple cool
alright next define a function called
compute bill so def would shoot I'm just
work bill that takes in why are you
meant food the function create a
variable of total sorry I say told on
we're gonna give it initial value 0 for
each item in the food list at the price
of item to the total alright so far I in
food total equals
so total equals food equals prices i
prices and then return so
so I returned three instead of 1025 so
Ryan from total equals total plus prices
I there we go I have to make sure that
it's not just overriding but adding to
it all right
so make the following changes to the
compute bill function while you leave
through each item of food only add the
price to the item to total if the items
stock count is greater than zero so
we're doing a flip statements on it if
stock so if stock I is greater than zero
we're going to add to it
chuckling for language dhaka and then
we'll say stock i equals stock all right
minus one there you go
and what's the last one just a little
bit of shows us you know something go
over real quick so we have our arrays we
have our dictionary of slash libraries
we have our functions and a little bit
of for loop and if statements and that
was our day at the supermarket not too
bad we stumbled a little bit on some
syntax stuff and well that's coding
that's that's what happens in the next
video
student becomes the teacher it looks
like we're gonna be making sort of a
quiz and tests and homework type of
thing calculate grades maybe but i'll
see you guys the next python video as
always comments and constructive
criticism is appreciated
