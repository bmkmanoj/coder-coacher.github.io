in solo learn doing JavaScript we're on
functions it's gonna move forward
user-defined functions now function is
basically a block that outputs code that
can be reused over and over again
defining a function to define a
JavaScript function use the function
keyword so when you want to define a
function you have to let the computer
know it's a function you know so if
didn't name the scope using brackets
like what is where is this function and
running code where does a code start
where does the code end now to fill in
the blanks to find a function called
hello so again you need to define the
function and you have to spell function
correctly and then if you want to call
the function because it's not going to
run automatically you have to you have
to go ahead and call it like so so that
your function can actually do what's it
it's intended for right how many times
it's gonna function being executing and
web times as many as needed which will
lead to infinite loops with an answer
like that uh but uh yeah so just be
careful with that guys
we've all done infinite loop there's
nothing to be ashamed of it actually is
like a little bit of pride once you
write your first infinite loop
hey man I'm learning that's what it is
anyhow what to do when you create a
parameter so fuck you can pass things
into functions that will then use that
that's called parameter use the VAR
keyword is from write a variable name in
the for instance there you know using
parameters move forward you'll see when
and how is parameter use by calling a
function and placing a value in
parenthesis by placing the value before
the function name by placing the value
before the function call
I think that's what do you mean it's
kind of a weird question right there all
right fill in blanks Eclair function
nice drag-and-drop so you're gonna start
with the function the name of the
function any parameters you're gonna
pass in and then so we have our function
my alert so here's my alert and then we
have this and then in here we have oh
look at them man they're getting fancy
so it's getting a little more
complicated right so let's go ahead and
take this out I thought we had to use
all there you go so you have to put the
value in there like that and it's a
string because we use quotations using
multiple parameters so you can take more
than one parameter in here what
character is used to separate parameters
it's a comma what's the output of this
code so we have a function takes in two
parameters we say X is five right here
and Y is a so if X is greater
else right Y so our code is eight fill
the blanks to create a function on
learning the sum of two parameters so
it's going to be a function my function
and we are going to just put a comma and
then what doesn't want to do the sum
excuse me so you're gonna add the plus
and y so you can add your arguments
together like so how many times kind of
declared function be used any nice so
the return statement so sometimes you
may just want to return the value with
the function to be used in another
function or somehow use elsewhere now
when you need to input data when you
need to make the calculation and receive
the result is when you will use the
return function or the return at return
in a function when is return same in
place outside at the end of the function
description typically
now function return' add numbers so
please enter the corresponding keyword
now the result of the function below
displayed on the screen so o see her we
want to return the result
hence return because results already
factored here it's the first parameter
minus a second and then we want to
return that result so that we can do
something with it right there's also
alert which is basically a pop-up
something that's kind of annoying so I
don't know that you'll actually be using
this to it how many parameters can be
accepted by the alert function
oh I don't actually know this I gotta go
back I guess just one cuz it's just text
right so I believe it's just one and
then the prompt box you can actually
enter code although again this is kind
of weird that you would do this this
kind of outdated stuff but you could so
if our name is equal to a prompt and
then you want to set the alert to the
name so basically you're going to set
enter your name and then you're gonna
call the alert to the name and then
finally there's a confirm box which is
the cancel or okay box that everyone
gets when they get spam right and so
this would be nice that this is gone but
there's the confirm box
okay returns true counselor returns
false and let's go on to the quiz the
following code will result and what
value we have a function that takes in a
parameter number so test - so we're
gonna alert the value of 2 so 2 while
number is less than 5 + + so that's
going to be 2 3 4 it wouldn't be 5
because it doesn't
what's your ability doing wrong before
excuse me it's going to be 5 because it
runs on 4 then it adds then it returns
sorry guys
was the output of the following
expression multiplied numbers so far VAR
c is 2 time or a times b a is 2 B is 6
that's gonna be 12 actually nothing
oh nothing cuz it never actually gets
returned hence why it's nothing
so please fill in the corresponding
names for the built-in dialog boxes
let's see here
getting input from the user that is the
prompt and alert so alert is for
displaying a message prompt is from
Forgetting input from the user
fill in the blanks to calculate the
maximum of the parameters so we're
saying if a is greater than or equal to
b return a else return b and then
finally what is the Crick's are one more
what is the correct syntax for referring
to an external script called script GIS
so you have the script and then you have
the source of the script and what we'll
learn on this fly screen so we have a 15
and B 5 so it's 15 is greater than 5 so
this is going to fail sorry else is
going to be 3 because it's been 15
divided by 5 which will return 3 so
we're making good progress just three
things left we're gonna be covering
objects core objects and then they Dom
and events
I think I'll actually pick something up
indomina vents just because sometimes
you missed some things that you normally
wouldn't just by that you don't normally
use so I'm looking forward to that but
as always guys don't forget to Like
subscribe comment and share and make
sure to check out our weekly interview
series behind the code where we
interview a developer a designer or
somebody in the tech space and kind of
shoot the shit for about 3045 minutes
about their profession what they do and
any advice they have lots of great
questions we always take questions at
the end subscribers when we do them live
as well so check that out
appreciate you all guys don't forget to
support me on patreon comm slash coding
tutorials 360 I'll see you guys in the
next video thanks for watching special
thanks to our sponsor dev Mountain if
you're interested in coding boot camp
why don't you check them out where they
include housing alongside their tuition
so you can get up go and immerse
yourself
