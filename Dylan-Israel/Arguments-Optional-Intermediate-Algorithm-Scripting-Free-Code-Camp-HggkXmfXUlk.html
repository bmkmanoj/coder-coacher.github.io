what I would consider the hardest
intermediate algorithm scripting section
arguments optional now I had to leave
some notes in here because he it took me
a while just to get the concept down so
there's basically six things we have to
do essentially what's going on here is
we want to add two numbers together or
we want to add two parameters together
or we want to add two functions with a
parameter each together and we want to
be able to tell if it's a number as our
inputs or if they're not so the easiest
way to slice this up is using arguments
and because we're not taking in we're
gonna set a function that doesn't
require anything to be taken in but you
can always add stuff so what I did was I
create an array the slices the arguments
arguments being every all the parameters
that all the inputs what we want to do
is a create a array and we're gonna do
this value doing this and then we want
to dot slice call the arguments and
we'll go ahead and return right here
crams
so we can check as we go along so it
might make a little more sense that's
good and we return that cool so you'll
see right now we basically sliced these
values slice one into our array slice
two into our array so cool so that
everything's working so far now that's
about as easy as this is gonna get so uh
I guess we could add the two values
together first so let's start thing so
we'll start with the if statement where
it simply checks if the length of our an
array is exactly two so the reason we're
gonna check that is we have a
number number one and number two we can
add those together very simply so that's
why we're gonna knock this out first so
we can just go ahead and return the zero
index and the first index value and this
will give us R this will give us our
output
make sure it's equal to two it's gonna
run that harm this is not fine you are
correct
cool so you see two and three four turns
five but we still gotta knock out these
other four now I used every it's a built
in JavaScript function where we're gonna
iterate we're gonna do an if statement
and we're to say if any of those values
are not numbers return undefined so
that's gonna take care of this string
right here let's go ahead and do that
cool all right so right now it's
returning this because uh yeah who knows
why but it's your dirty Wireless but um
so instead what we wonders we're under a
statement that's gonna check our params
for every value and within here we're
gonna create a function that takes in
complain cars parse we're gonna create a
function that takes in a single
parameter so the the value we want to
check is the parameter that we're going
in so check the first array index check
the second or index a third array each
one those index values is the parameter
some stuff and in this function we want
a return type of and if of our per am
the value we're checking return the type
of the value we're checking if it is
exactly equal to the number number being
an answer so sharing type treatment I
have a bracket issue here else we want
to return undefined this is this fix it
oh no capsules there sorry so return the
type of number for every if it's not
true basically if this is not true so if
it's ever false this whole thing return
undefined so even if there is a number
here eventually after going to the next
spot it would we've made this by 5/5 it
would eventually break cool Oh actually
this is a string that's why it's not
checking the value of string if we were
to put in an integer where the quotes
were setting as a string all right so
check the number it's not a number type
return undefined cool we're almost there
now we we have basically an else
statement to do here do else so we have
our last part we need it to run when
there are two functions essentially run
add together with two followed by add
together with three we need to know what
that is we don't want to call it twice
we what you just want it to do work like
that that's really all you have to
understand so I'll store the first
parameter because we need it we're going
to store that
remember we split split it and that's
gonna be our parameter zero so our first
value will store that so that we can run
a function within a function we want to
run the function whatever that returns
we want to use to run within a new
function we're gonna Craig right now so
the next part is store function
that will take in the second parameter
and using recursion call itself to add
the values so how do we do that well you
create a variable so I called mine add
one more so add one more is a function
that takes in a second parameter and
what we're gonna do is store that value
in there so what we want to do here is
basically using recursion call our
function add together and we want to put
in that first parameter which is a
simple number and that second parameter
which is a number as well and just run
it through our add together function our
largest scope function and that will
give us a value and that's all we're
getting we're storing it reusing
recursion to call a function that we're
gonna set a variable to a function that
returns a value using recursion so add
together and then we're just gonna put
our two two parameters that we have
first for am and second per amp
and then because we need to actually all
were doing here is storing it outside of
this we can go ahead and say return add
one more and that's going to return the
value I believe we don't need this and
this was for this line
and there you go so one more time I'm
gonna walk through it because there's a
lot of stuff going on in here it's only
26 lines of code with a bunch of
comments but there's a lot of stuff
going on so we're gonna slice up each
parameter int and store it into an array
so it could have a million parameters
it's gonna million length array we're
then gonna check and tell if it returns
false for the parameter that we're
checking to be not a number go ahead and
return undefined so this is ever false
returned undefined because it's not a
number now if there's only two
parameters go ahead and add them else we
want to store the first value of that
with that we're gonna create another
variable in which we store the value
from a function in which we basically
just protect parameter 1 a parameter 2
and run it run it using recursion and
then at the end we just want to go ahead
and return that value if we get to here
so I hope that makes sense I know this
is a little bit of harder one this took
me a couple days to kind of figure
everything out and a lot of lot of
googling a lot of research so that's
arguments optional and hopefully you
found it helpful I know it took me a
minute but as always guys don't forget
