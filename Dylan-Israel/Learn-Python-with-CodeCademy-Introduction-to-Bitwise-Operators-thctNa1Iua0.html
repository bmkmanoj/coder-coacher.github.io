end of our Python course we're in
advanced topics in Python introduction
bitwise operators the zeros and the ones
and shit like that so apparently this is
how you do the bitwise and and or XOR or
I don't know so just some stuff to keep
track of I guess so we're gonna print 0
b1 you know I had something on bits in
my classes and I've always hated it I
just like we I've never found a reason
to use it
I'm sure there's reasons but just not in
my case so fill out the rest of the
numbers with their corresponding binary
values up to 12 in the editor to the
right so um let's see all right so
everything's going to start off with
equals 0 B
yeah that's getting here cuz I wasn't
paying attention alright so maybe we
should pay too little attention oops
so it goes zero eight bits four bits
so I'm actually gonna look at a forum
because real quick just to see what's
going on
all right so let's look at this and see
if we can understand it so one is 0 B 1
2 is 0 B so you had a 0
that makes it - we had a 1 that makes it
3 so 4 logically it would be 0 B 1 0 0
good and then we just keep on switching
out so let's go ahead and control X and
see if we can get this correct
so it goes 0 B 1 0 say 1 1 0 let's try 1
1 0 6 yeah I don't understand this this
is why I never did very well with this
so 1 0 1 then we work our way up to 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 all right so 5 is 1 0 1 all
right so I think with 5 of these I can
figure out the rest
so sickle 0 B so now this is 1 1 0 equal
to
say I'll be a ones there 1 1 1 now this
is equal to 1 okay she'll be 1 0-0
service this is equal to
there'll be 1 0 0 1 this is equal to 0 P
1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 this is equal to 0
will be 1 0 0 0 all right check the
value for 10 so we're all the way we're
good to write here so a 0 B 1 0 so let's
see what they have for 10
so we need to rotate to oh whoops make
sense and then we fucked up our other
ones in the process because of it
forgot a zero and we forgot so that's
now we're good
it's kind of a pattern to it why it's
important to know I have no idea so
anyhow we fried an example the bin
function in the editor go ahead and use
print bin to print out the binary
representations from two to five frames
Ben then let's try a range to see this
works
you can use a separate print statement
for each number okay I'll just do that
to Prince Ben should do a loop for this
but hey sometimes you do things the hard
way
all right let's here so this is printing
out the binary representation of this
number this is what like the computer
sees I believe they call so several
different ways to use the int function
second parameter
unlike seven you st. to print the base
tan equivalent of the binary so print
int
come attend so what they're asking
these examples one for us a guy use into
print
so I'm not sure what that too is let's
see if this doesn't
so the 242 in 110 you might know you
might not know that this infection has a
dish optional second parameter when
given a string containing number and
that base number is in the functional
return the value converted to the base
of 10 okay
shift the variable shift right to the
right twice and shit the barrel shift
left to the left twice try to guess
what's the print alright so oh I've
always been bad with bitwise operators
um use example instructions okay so we
want to shift it so this is our code I
want to shift
so we'll say shift all right shift
underscore right - I'm gonna shift which
are left - I think that's let's ask you
did you say chef right equals chef right
oh yeah
oops and of course we need to treat them
as variables apologize if I'm not
explaining this it's I to be fully
honest I don't fully understand it so
but I mean I'm here to learn as well but
at least you'll have a little bit of
insight of what's going on than just the
forums so what's going on here is we're
shifting this twice Saro b11 we're
shifting the right one to the right so
we're knocking off the last two and then
we're shifting to the left the left one
and we're adding two on so you can see
anything print out the result of claim
bin on night so
see this is what I want to do
so apparently this will combine them and
give us a new number or a new result it
may not be end up being a number so for
practice print out the result using
pencil print
from the benef / and this above goes in
a little more detail of how this works
fully honest with the guy I could care
less about bitwise operators so it's not
exactly the most interesting thing to me
and I it's just like one of those things
I will you should know this is a program
where I'm like okay cool
never touched it again alright so for
practice print the result of using the
bracket so print been OB 1 1 1 0 bracket
OB 101
try do it on your own without using wait
this is a 0 and this is a 0
lb 101 1 there you go all right so see
this is not that hard the bitwise not
operator just flips all the bits into a
single number so let's see here
not 123 is just so apparently this just
makes it negative and minus is 1 from it
I think all right so we're defining a
function called check underscore bit for
was one argument input
I don't like oh that's a primary I
should check to see if the fourth bit
from the right is on if the bit is on or
turn on not print check the hint to see
some examples so if input
yeah i'ma have to see some examples
check fit for
if input
it's an integer though
oh my god I remember this fucking
creating a mask and all this sort of
shit we're going to the forums I
migrated tanked after I did this wise
mask always on the man behind the bit
mask right 49
so let's see if we can understand what's
going on here so in this case we need to
create this we create a mask so in the
example above we create a random bit we
set the result equal to the input and
our bit and if it's greater than zero or
turn on else or turn off that's as much
sense as I can make of it I I would need
someone to sit down and explain this to
me to be fully fully honest with you so
I move it in the editor is a variable a
use a bit mask and the value of a in
order to achieve hers all with third bit
from the right is turned on what I in
the editor a variable a use a bit mask
so we'll say mask is equal let's do a
new part of this mass is equal to
obi-wan all right obi-wan all right
where the third bit from the race you're
not sure to print your answer is in the
bin string
and I'll be Prince Ben of something how
do we check if
all right so back to the forum on this I
don't we're gonna forms a lot right now
but I think we're on 12 turn him on yeah
I don't understand what to do either
buddy
all right so desire equals a
I guess what I'm thinking the reason I'm
having show like okay I kind of get like
all right you're just saying masters
equal to a a slash mouse and then you're
printing it out but
okay so somehow we're combining these
two or turning one on with our function
here so our mask has to be correct but
since I'm still struggling with trying
to gather the point of bitwise operators
it's hard to find the to fully
understand what's going on here
all right in the editor is 8-bit
variable a use a bit mask all right so
we got mass and the value a so we need a
mask marches or well all the all the
bits are flipped on be sure to bring
your answer using a bin and then we
print then and then we have design we
can do desired and we'll take that guys
example print bin and in here we need to
print desired and we need to somehow
create a mass that turns all these on so
let's start off with what we know we
know 0b and those are all one one so
maybe we do it like this 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
use the carrot
make sure your answer is a binary string
I thought I did
okay so I thought were you doing
everything ranked getting them all to
ones basically but apparently we're not
so back once again to the forums so
let's see here
this answers a little too in-depth
every needs to flip all the bits in it
so apparently this needs to all three
four five six seven eight
needs to be one to flip all of them so I
thought one men on zero men off but
apparently we just need to change all of
the night
yes oh I have no idea I'm sorry guys
Jeff flip I'm just for a bit
it takes an input number comma hand I
know that this one on my retired can
tell no no way
flip the aunts bit with result being the
first bit and storing result and then
return return been results
all right
so number two equals a number
shift shift
all right
all right so we're somewhat there we're
just a little bit off on the logic here
so last exercise why doesn't this work
- no I just want straight up I don't
want to get user input
be aware
so our masks we need the masks and if
it's less than a mile on
let's see if we can understand this so
we create a mask in and we know we need
masks we return the bin result my result
is equal to the number I don't
understand why this isn't shift though
well anyhow we're done with bitwise
operators I apologize for isn't much of
a help but as I'm still learning myself
and I haven't had much practice with the
other than a single course but hopefully
I'll be able to help a lot more with
classes this is kind of where you really
get into object-oriented programming and
you'll define classes and reuse them and
it looks like we're making a fruit class
here and we create a lemon object out of
it so I'll see you guys in the next
video and hopefully it goes a lot
smoother than the bitwise operator stuff
and sorry about the misunderstandings in
there and I wish I could be more helpful
