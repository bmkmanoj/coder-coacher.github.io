back in code Academy looks like they
have a preview for their learn SAS
course here so let's go ahead and check
that out your firsts a style sheet now
SAS is kind of a ton of this planet it's
basically a better way to do styling it
saves you a lot of time a lot of code so
right here it looks like we're importing
a font oh we're going to need to get our
SAS compiler so in our main CSS it looks
like they will notice in the terminal
here in our bash terminal we're going to
basically just initiate our compiler
here I believe that's what's going on
here
alright so now that we've done that it's
auto compile door code so this is
essentially what it's going to look like
now it doesn't look too different right
now because we haven't really done much
with it let's uh let's go ahead and move
on to the next one
so this is our output right here
so inside main CSF RSC SSS how you know
it's a sass file this is our CSS this is
our SAS flow we want to create a inside
of the banner class so how we would have
done this before as we would have
created and we would have done the
styling like this now what we want to do
is inside our banner we want to create a
child that inherits this but instead
what we want to do is inherit everything
that's in here and then we want to do a
slogan that has its own stuff so what do
we want we want to position to be
absolute yeah you're essentially nesting
your styling that's basically what it
allows you do not only does it save time
it's a little bit easier to kind of
understand what's going on we're going
to add solid a solid border here we're
then going to add pixels here and left
width of fifty percent
let's change this back to persona and I
apologize if you guys here like my fan
going it is miserably hot in California
today so height 200 pixels oops
alright let's run that make sure we did
everything correctly so it looks like we
did so span the following span select
your insights lo slogan so within our
slogan here if it's a bit in the banner
and a slogan we want to then call the
span object and we want to add some
stuff as well so all we're basically
doing is saying look take everything
that's in here and then apply it it's
just like how any of your JavaScript
code or any other programming language
like nesting would work except with
styling tech session line and then they
wanted line dash height and we want to
put 200
yes it's going to run that
cool so it inherited everything else and
then we have inside nest the container
so if it's within the container and it
has the ID of icon go ahead and do this
we want to display inline block you want
to give the margin a two percent all
around we want to give it a border of
floor pixels solid and black I'll give
the font size of 32px and again all
we're doing is kind of saving the time
from like you see right here redoing
everything as we go along so it's all in
one easy to see place
so um
so it's not only limited to IDs we can
also Ness a lot of other things so we're
going to basically set the border
property here and we're going to do that
inside banner so it's like dot banner go
ahead and do it right here and we want
to say border and it looks like we need
to for border to put for when we're
targeting things like border you want to
actually put a colon in front of it so
do four pixels solid and black and then
we also want to add the bottom four
pixels solid and
let's go to run this
Oh
okay so make sure you're zoomed in to
exactly one hundred percent you'll see
that I got a little bit of an issue
there because it adjust with the font
size because I was zooming in for the
video so you may have to if you zoom in
because you're blind of like me you
may have to change it up you also have
the ability of creating variables which
is kind of cool so let's go ahead at the
top of here like you would maybe with a
global variable let's go ahead and
create our variables we want to create a
variable called translucent gosh white
rgba now this is going to be helpful if
you know you're going to reuse a common
variable or a common color in this case
we're creating a color scheme here that
we can reuse later on and we're setting
it with the opacity of thirty percent so
we've created it here we then want to go
to the background color let's see where
is that
close bring it down
so we're looking for background color
reference a variable as a value for in
slogan okay so we're going to add a
background color to slogan and we're
going to just go ahead and say look we
already have to find this at top so
we're going to say translucent dash
white now this is kind of a long name
for something like that and yells
it's a large sea but it is a little bit
translucent here so let's go ahead and
move on all right another variable at
top you'll notice that it's all denoted
with the dollar sign as we go forward so
we're gonna say i conned square dash
length right put 300 pixels now i'm
gonna go ahead and copy this value save
myself some time so inside our icon
class right here we're going to set the
width to icon square lights oops
actually take take that off and we're
set the height here to icon squarely now
what's cool about this is if you have a
lot of styling it may be a little bit of
a hassle to go through your code and
find what is the value you're looking
for so if you actually just started at
the top it makes it a lot easier down
the road so we're going to create
another bit of variable called standard
border and you'll notice that well kind
of the convention here is to put a dash
in between in between what you're naming
now this will be helpful just so that
all if you're working with other people
you're going to want to follow the same
general convention it also makes it
easier to read it all right so for all
instances that use for so we're going to
just go ahead and replace all this so
before when we typed out for pics a
little solid black what we actually
should have done is just create a
variable that stores what it is that we
would need for that
save you a little bit time a little bit
thinking what did I what did I put for
the border again how did I do it you
just have a variable that you reference
nice
so it looks like we did our first lesson
here we were able to kind of understand
nesting now it shouldn't be that
complicated of a thing to get started
the hardest part will probably be
getting your if you're using this not on
us a thing like code pin or in our
Codecademy is actually getting your
compiler onto your site if you're not
familiar with that in terms of nesting
it should be pretty pretty
straightforward instead like slogan
right here is equivalent of doc banner
slogan and you don't have to retype some
of the code if it just kind of brings
everything in a little bit in variables
so next we're gonna actually be going
over SAS data types number string
bullion's knowles list and maps so as
always guys thank you to everyone who
supports me on patreon it's really cool
don't forget to Like comment and share
it helps me out a ton and i'll see you
guys in the next video thanks for
watching hey guys thanks for watching
the video my good friend Matt at
engineered truth has a three-part
interview with Quincy Larson the founder
of free code camp go ahead and check
that out and so you'll get a lot of
really cool stuff thanks for watching
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
