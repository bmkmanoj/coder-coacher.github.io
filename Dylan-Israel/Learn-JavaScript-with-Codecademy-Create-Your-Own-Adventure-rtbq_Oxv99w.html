with JavaScript on our second part here
choose-your-own-adventure so check if
the user is ready to play using the
confirm command make sure the user is
ready to play for example I would use a
sentence I'm ready play add whatever
phrase he would like to confirm confirm
play question mark semicolon let's see
if that works and we're going to hit
okay cool so they are indeed ready to
play understand the existing code
declare variable called age age is equal
to the prompt what's a question mark
and then when I say s8 if age is less
than 13 we're gonna console.log print
out all right so this are you ready to
play okay what's your age seven oh hey
we forgot the end on console but uh oh
good luck and have fun
there we go so print in the introduction
using console dot log remember the
introduction to string picture keep it
between quotes
are we suppose print at the beginning or
the end all right we'll just do it at
the end and we'll say story equals that
and then we'll give console.log story
and that should work just fine
are you ready to play okay 927 okay and
then parrot prints honours update your
existing code print out suddenly Bieber
stops Nick Clare we'll just call this
story too
take out one of those and then we'll say
log 32 then we'll say declare variable
user answer set it equal to
make it equal to prompt
all right so I have a little brain for
it here and I forgot so this semicolon
we see Oh
area we forgot to prompt here we're
doing it backwards that might work
let's see here prongs equals
I solicit any user answer and I believe
now we're doing what we need to do so
yes I'm 27
who wants to race me I do
okay so we messed up it's actually two
different sentences here our mistake so
this is actually story two again and
then this is details Matt look at you
every time all right
I do not want to raise all right use an
if-else statement to write out the last
Brailer game make sure the to check the
console for error messages and
suggestions okay if all right so we
basically need three things here
if yes I'll write it out I'll write out
its user answer
and I'm not sure if it's case-sensitive
had yes it probably is it's three equals
now we have our else statement for
everything there's some reason
that should work are you ready to play
yes 27 do you want to race all right
let's find out if it's a No
okay so in this case sensitive so we're
gonna do a lowercase here at least in
the running apart do we need a test yes
this one is three double equals but
let's try this one more time yeah so
that wasn't it use your answer if use
your answer alright so we're at a little
bit of a crossroads here yeah right
thing oh I actually gave us in the
prompt something they want us to write
so we will rewrite that that might be
our air this is I know submit let's see
if that fixes it 27 yes
all right so that was our actual code
fine we just needed the correct print
out statements so now we want to create
a variable called feedback this would
actually be a cool way of writing like
an old-school RPG we're just images come
up and text comes up they come like the
old like almost DOS type of Dungeons &amp;amp;
Dragons game so we're gonna say if you
make people to prompt and we're going to
ask feedback
saturating between please just going to
be to key on these semicolons drop a lot
of languages I've been using lately
don't include this and so it's kind of a
I wanna say it's bad habit out mine but
uh it's just a something I've been doing
without thinking about it but you should
always follow the convention he may have
sometimes it allows you not to all right
so now we're gonna do another so if
feedback is greater then a turnout
we have to lose one of the bracket six
thank you we should race at our next
concert else we are going to drink out
I'll keep coding yes enter rainy between
110 I'll say nine thank you we should
race at the next concert cool so
congratulations you've just programmed
your first game this is incredibly
impressive it says all 42 lines of code
I'm pretty good though so we're gonna
run through one last time with your age
27 you wanna show streamer at home on a
10 I'll go on I'll keep practicing
coding amazing so that was our second
choose your adventure there of
JavaScript
let's see next time we're going to be
introduction to functions in JavaScript
so it's get ready for that looks like
it's gonna be a little bit more the same
but I'm sure the pace will pick up
pretty quick I see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
