focuses primarily on web development
javascript and being a JavaScript
developer myself I could ask was the
best JavaScript book to read whether
you're an entry-level or your senior
developer trying to learn JavaScript for
the first time the best book to learn
javascript in my opinion is the series
you don't know J s by Kyle Simpson who
also has some video tutorials out there
he did a Kickstarter for this and was
able to raise slightly over ten thousand
dollars now this covers es6 which is the
newest version of javascript and
something that people who are learning
JavaScript should be learning and it's
also there for people already know
JavaScript I want to know what to expect
with es6 now the great thing about this
is it's low cost in every way possible
it's spread out over six books about
five dollars a book and each book are
very readable there they're usually
around 100 pages maybe less and I've
read the first two and I can vouch that
is a very good and simple read and
something everyone should have now if
you don't have any money you're a
college student you can definitely go
ahead and download it for free there's
an eBook version as well as a github
section so that if there were any areas
in the book in future versions people
can contribute to that as well
you don't no js' is my favorite book in
javascript i highly encourage you to
read it it's sitting at a four and a
half star on Amazon with over a hundred
reviews all the books seem to be very
well received I've read the first two I
learned a ton about es6 and it gets my
vote as the best book to learn
javascript now if you're the type that
likes to read multiple books and you're
looking to learn JavaScript there's a
couple other ones that are good as well
you have JavaScript design patterns
eloquent JavaScript and of course
JavaScript the good parts which are all
good be reads from what I understand but
I can't personally recommend them
because I haven't read them myself but
for the general consensus in the
JavaScript community seems to be that
those are great options as well hey guys
thanks for watching the video special
thanks to our sponsor dev Mountain
go dev Mountain comm if you're
