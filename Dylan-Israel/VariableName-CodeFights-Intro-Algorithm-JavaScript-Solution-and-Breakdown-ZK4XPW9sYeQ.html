variable name raids the reason
intersections now some of you may have
seen my ipv4 address and I said why am I
going to spend time learning something
that I know there is already a solution
for on the internet for something like
password or something like email
somebody's already solved that for us
now here is an example of a simple one
which wouldn't be solved for us other
than the fact it's on a coding website
so I didn't feel that it was right for
me to do that so I actually put in the
time to solve this and I'm going to I'm
going to explain my my simple regular
expression that we're going excuse me
little sick dying over here we're just
going to return statement that tests a
regular expression now to start off our
regular expression we have these these
slashes to contain it and then the eye
on the end here the eye the end means
that we don't care if it's uppercase or
lowercase in a regular expression now
the next thing that we have is this
caret denotes the start of it so we want
the start of our regular expression
within these brackets here to only
contain something that's in here so this
a to Z is going to be letters A to Z now
if we didn't have that eye we would have
to do something like this to include the
uppercase and the lowercase because we
said hey we don't care about carrots
excuse me because we don't care about
case well do we can do it like this
now we also allow underscores in here in
here we basically I forgot to go over
the problem but the problem asks is oh
hey we have letters digits and
underscores and they can't start with
the digit so basically we just wanted to
start with a number
excuse me we wanted to start with a
letter or you want to start with a
underscore
and we've set that up already the next
part of it is we want the words to be
able to have any value in it and the
slash W the W stance is for words and
digits and underscores so saying yeah
that for any and then this is the end so
that's the end so nothing's coming after
that so that is our regular expression
that is it now I struggled on this part
a little bit right here but I think I
have a decent understanding of what it
is I'm still trying to get better with
regular expressions but the test
function here is I take that regular
expression test that this value we're
passing in and return a true or false if
it passes but I did spend about two
hours three hours trying to understand
regular expressions a lot better and I
will say that having done it I
appreciate that I could say that I
understand this part and I understand
this part pretty accurately now that
I've learned a lot because of it so
that's always guys thank you for
watching the video don't forget to
comment like subscribe and share and
support me on patreon join the Facebook
group the discord Channel all that great
stuff is in the description I'll see you
guys next time bye hey guys thanks for
watching the video special thanks to our
sponsors dev Mountain if you look for a
coding boot camp where tuition and
housing is included definitely check
them out appreciate it and I'll see you
guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
