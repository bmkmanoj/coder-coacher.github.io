question code CAD me or free code camp
we all have a limited amount of time
when studying for web development we
want to make sure that we're using the
best resources available and these are
two that get kind of paired up hand in
hand almost as much as the angular or
react from the subscriber so today we're
gonna dive into which platform I think
is best and how to best use each
platform so so that you can get the most
out of your studying time in the most
out of learning web development little
self-promotion before we get started if
you guys are interested in buying and
selling stocks I use the robin hood app
and a cool promotion they have going on
right now is if you sign up through my
link you'll get a share of stock and
I'll get a share of stock it's more than
likely you'll get a 5 or 10 dollar stock
but some of the stocks go as high as
Apple or Facebook which are about 180 to
170 dollars depending on what time of
the month it is so if you're interested
in that there's a link down below it
also include a link to the video where I
dive in a little bit more into detail
about Robin Hood as I've been using the
app for a while so you can see it a
little bit more about the application so
before we get started I want to kind of
dive into what code Academy and free
code camp is if you're not familiar with
either one so code Academy is the as my
understand the largest interactive
tutorial site for coding they focus on
web development but they also have some
partnership courses they recently
released Amazon Alexa partnership course
then you know programming so it's not
only in web development there's also
courses on Java or as well as the data
science so you know database elements
and their entry level tutorials I would
say that the bulk of their content is in
web development and it's basically for
beginner developers and let's jump into
this HTML just so you can see the the UI
a little bit but typically how it goes
is you have your your sort of text
lesson then you have some instructions
then you have your text editor here and
then you have your
view here so you can see what is
actually happening now free code camp
slightly different because they break up
their their sort of lessons into larger
applications will focus on the front-end
development certification because this
is the one that most people are going to
be learning and kind of a flagship
program but you can see they have HTML 5
to CSS and a bunch of it and it's it's
structured in a way that this leads to
this which leads to this which it's
really helpful for a lot of people who
are just getting started
one of the things that separates free
code camp also is that they don't just
focus on entry-level a lot of the stuff
is entry level but they kick it up a
notch right they do hold your hand to a
point and then they you know they throw
in okay algorithms for instance here are
twenty algorithms for you to solve and
they they give you an estimated time 50
hours so it's just a probably a fair
amount of time if you're entry-level
developer someone's studying they also
have projects code Academy has projects
also but they charge you for it free
code camp is completely free everything
on here is if you want support them you
can financially through donations and
things like that but there's free they
also have a YouTube channel that's
200,000 followers where it's constant
video tutorials coming out from
different people people volunteering
trying to support in that way as well
one day hopefully I'll go and throw some
tutorials on there but you'll see when
we go into let's I don't know we'll just
choose this one and that it has a
similar flow to free code to code
Academy where you have your view which
is much cooler that's in a phone by the
way and your text editor and then you
have your your sort of instructions here
it's very clean I'm a big fan of it
one thing note also just because a lot
of people aren't aware that this exists
is there's a beta for free code camp as
well beta dot free code camp dot org
will take you there and this is new
content that they are are creating and
going to eventually be put on to their
their site as well and this will be free
act tutorials basically you can see here
that they have all those sort of
sections they have additional ones now
frontend libraries data visualization
and their ap eyes and micro-services so
reactor ducts so they're constantly
adding new content and which is kind of
cool so now that we've done a brief
rundown of code CAD imme some of the
pros and cons of both well code Caddy me
and my and my experience well one of the
pros was it was kind of the only one for
a long time there's not a lot of sites
like code CAD me other than free code
can
there's algorithm sites there are you
know there's sites like code combat
which is like an action-rpg coding game
kind of thing but there aren't a lot of
sites that just give you a interactive
tutorial where you're running down these
things and figuring and going piece by
piece and so I mean they're they're both
great resources in that and I tend not
to like to say to use one resource to
the other but that's what this video is
about and in this case I would say code
Academy is a great entry-level resource
but one of the things that I find that
happens with people who use code CAD
Amin is because it focuses so little on
you actually thinking things out most of
the tutorials in here are you copying
things and changing one or two lines or
one or two words in those one or two
lines and you don't really learn that
way and so I would say if it had to be
one or the other it's definitely gonna
be free code camp and there's a couple
of reasons for that one I surely do
believe that the structured content is
much better a lot of times people are
like well I did this what do I do now
and they get overwhelmed right web
development is changing at such a fast
pace that sometimes people just want to
be handed a Trello board be like learn
this in this order and to that I would
say take a second to kind of follow the
the market and understand what's in
demand what's cool what you're
interested in but if you're just getting
started
following the front-end development
certification is fine and then sort of
by the time you finish this and mind you
I I ended up getting a web development
job when I was like right around here
my first real role and you'll you'll
you'll end up being able to figure out
your own path from there also I think
that the challenging aspect of the
algorithms and the projects that's
really when you learn everything else
even through these hours of tutorials
you're really just sort of being exposed
to things you don't really become a
developer until you start to put put it
together in your own way right and even
those these projects live tutorial
squawking you through them to help you
out what you should be doing is after
you saw some projects on free code
campus you should start a side project
you should build say hey I always want
to build a Chrome extension or I always
wanted to build a you to use the YouTube
API are always I've been interested in
finances I like to build a finance
dashboard so I could track the stocks or
whatever it is that you're interested in
build that but for me it's it's free
code camp hands down because of the fact
that yeah they do hold your hand through
part of the process coke Adam II holds
your hand through the entire process and
if you want projects you have to pay $20
a month to code got me well here you
sort of get project ideas for free and
you get some more stuff with coke adam
ii pro like you have people you can talk
to but if you want to talk to some
people they have forums and they have
chats and and get her their glitter
whether it's a get er yeah get her and
you can ask questions there and I've
done that in the past when I was working
through a lot of free code code camp and
I I have found people very helpful and
they have different subsections and just
to give you an idea where I'm coming
from as a developer is I've done about
75% of every course this is a separate
account which is why all these are out
here this is a nice teaching April of
code I create a separate account but in
terms of catalogue I've done 75% of all
their courses and in terms of free code
camp I have C I've completed the
front-end
I haven't submitted my RAC projects but
I've done these three projects I have
built two of these although I need to
put those videos out and I've built all
of these so I've built all these API
projects and I haven't got to these yet
so I've done about 75% I would say of
the free code camp free code camp as
well and I look forward to when they
release their beta but one of the things
that is more the most important reason
that I'm saying free code camp
and that I think they provides better
content for web development specifically
is that in it and in order right a lot
of people have struck struggle with a
learning path they get so caught up on
hey should I learn this should I learn
that and if you just say look I'm just
gonna follow what's here this leads to
this which leads to this which is what
they recommend right that you should go
in order you'll find out that it's very
beneficial because you just you're
continuing to grow you're continuing to
just keep a pace and keep it moving but
the the real thing is I think because of
the algorithms because of the projects
that you start to think like a developer
that's going to be the hardest thing for
individuals to overcome when they're
learning to code is how do I start
thinking like a developer and when
you're just doing these sort of HTML and
CSS introductory sort of tutorials this
is basically just telling you what
exists this is you reading through
documentation until you actually take
that those tools that build it like if I
told you that that this is a nail and
this is a hammer you could say okay this
is a nail this is a hammer I understand
that and now I say go build something
would you be able to do it you probably
would because you understand what a nail
and a hammer is but now you have to take
that same thing I say okay this is a for
loop this is an if statement and you
know all these this this this this but
do you ever actually build anything and
start applying so that yes you
understand by definition what a for loop
does but do you understand how to use it
and can you use it and I think free code
camp really hammers that fact down which
is why they have projects and why they
have these algorithms so you can start
reprogramming your brain to solve these
things and on top of it they have the
video content on their channel and I
consider that extension of free code
camp and code Kadim II doesn't really do
that they have no video tutorials I have
a video coming out basically saying they
need to get on that that train and make
it part of their their platform and free
code camp although I don't know if
they're going to include on their new
release they may just they have a whole
section here video challenges
which are just you basically breaking
them breaking now multiple aspects of
JavaScript and that I encourage you guys
to watch this fear if you're interested
in it you want to know about how to
better debug more big o-notation gets
either they're constantly trying to
expand these things as well and you know
eventually you can get some mock
interviews some coding interview prep
some start working on open source
projects as well to build up your resume
that way but the most important thing is
that helps you to start reprogramming
your brain on how to how to actually
solve these things without holding your
hand right it's kind of like they're
both teaching you what you're getting
fish if you will to go to an old analogy
from them both at some point the
fisherman says you're on your own
learn to fish and that's free code camp
while code Kadim e just keeps giving you
little fishes and nothing to help you on
you know they don't even throw your rod
if you will Co Academy really holds your
hand the entire process and never lets
you go swim on your own so that that's
why I say free code campers I think it
helps promote that I'm going to think
like a developer mentality through these
algorithms through the projects it's
very real-world it it may blow your mind
but I I probably did eighty you know 70%
of coke out of me without building a
project until I came to free code camp
and it never even occurred to me to
build something which is crazy right and
when I did when I started building these
projects when I started solving these
algorithms I really started to
understand the documentation better and
I really started to think wow look at
now I get it
now it's there it's it's engrained into
the brain and I I could feel myself
getting so much better so much quicker
than I was before
so if you guys are really I encourage
you to do both right because you get the
more the better sort of thing but I know
a lot of people are only have a limited
amount of time so if you want to know
what I think is best for web development
I think free code camp especially when
they release their their beta content
you'll see front-end libraries Java
Script algorithms responsive web design
these are all going to be different
certificates and if you're a nursery
Acton Redux and react and redux that you
can see they're diving into that with
new projects and jQuery and all this
sort of stuff and they are staying much
more up-to-date on the on that like this
is a full-time project and it seems like
code cabin has been on the back burner
for kind of updating their content for
the most part so I'm a big free code
camp fan and I've pretty experienced
with them both and I can confidently say
if you really are trying to only do one
free code camps the better choice
although I encourage you to do both
right do the JavaScript section on free
code camp go do it on on code Academy
and you might pick up things and both
and it might reinforce it right so it's
a big benefit of doing things twice is
you do it twice and you kind of you're
gonna pick up and reinforce what you've
gone over so that's my two cents on free
code camp or code Academy again I
encourage you use both but thank you so
much for watching the video don't forget
to comment like subscribe share support
me on patreon join the Facebook group
all that great stuff I wish you all the
best of luck and if you think I'm wrong
and you want to tell me why or you think
there's a better resource for
interactive tutorials online let me know
I'm always looking for great resources
I'll I've read all the comments so it's
it's great to helps me learn and and I'm
always interested to say so thank you so
much I'll see you guys next time bye
quick shoutout to device plus comm if
you're interested in the latest IO tease
hacks do-it-yourself projects revolving

some great how-to guides I highly
encourage you to check them out and
