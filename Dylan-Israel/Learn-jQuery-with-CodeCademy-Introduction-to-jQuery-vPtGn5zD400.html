codecademy we're starting a new section
jquery it's a short three hours section
compared to most of them which are like
11 or eight to ten or something like
that so jquery i believe is slightly
based off javascript i've never actually
worked with jquery supposed to be my
first time messing around with it so
let's get started introduction to jquery
are introducing jquery introduction to
jquery all right see it to believe it so
it looks like we're doing some kind of
standard HTML stuff except we're calling
a script here we have our style sheet
and then our script a whole lot of stuff
going on here hopefully will be
explained shortly let's see what's going
on so we hover over it you can see it
adjusts on the color style sheet is just
kind of saying what the colors are and
then this dot animate height ok so this
is done animate when we mouse enter I
think this is saying when we mouse over
plus you're tense one on the mouse
leaves minus ten okay I get that check
out the code in the script JSO I'll
explain the code more soon but for now
the main idea is when the HTML docket
loads the codes will select the HTML
HTML element and make it disappear we'll
want to target the div element here so
on line two inside the line two inside
the div
alright so what we want to say is for
the div we want to fade out oh wow there
looks like you're stiff is still there
oh it looks like we need quotations here
for the store looks like it faded out
and that's good so that seems to be
working document dot ready function okay
so all right so look right here
basically we're trying to say for the
script we need to target certain things
here let me see us us selectors we have
the div ID green that's what's there to
talk about inside the all point to the
idea cream all right so we want to say
fade out for point pound green and bam
it fades out you see right there fades
out again let's go back
all right on the script ji step add the
missing pieces on line two so that your
jquery code calls fade out on the div
with the ID found not ready so ID is
pound not ready BAM so I'm gonna submit
you can see it in action add a script
tag to the index dot HTML its type
should be text / java script SRC should
be script is so this is basically what
tells the server or whatever's
processing your information what we want
to like what language it needs to work
with and the SRC is saying for that
language get it get the script from this
file
script time to forget something oh and
of course make sure you close the script
tag as well cool not too bad add a
document ready Cole alright so dock are
already function Collins gorgeous room
I'm talking a special it's not a child
like pee or do so it doesn't go in close
looks like it's already there okay so
this is already here I don't know why
they asked to do that I got a place a
function inside your dot ready so it is
it's there also you don't need anything
okay so we did that all set it's already
there it's kind of weird online tune
script j/s make div into a jquery object
and call slide down so to make the div a
jig where we start off with the
parenthesis or the the cash money and
then we'll put div and then we want to
call dot slide down and then inside here
we want to put slow so we did that we
haven't done anything with our divs yet
so what's going on here is we're calling
a slide down function with the slow
parameters just probably tells it house
how fast this lie down similar like if
we do pixels for height and we're
sitting for all divs currently all right
mid lesson breather okay
in your index dot HTML tab add a script
tag connect your HTML alright so this is
our style sheet so now we want to add
script equals sex / java script SRC is
equal to script jas and then we need to
close it / straight all right now inside
your script j/s put a document into
jquery object and call ready so it's a
document and then function
so I'm trying to this off memory i
apologize i miss this up take on a
function document dot already maybe that
was it I think this is it function let's
did you sit scripts type of tribute
script type there we go alright so
script type and then we've basically set
it up for this to be ready we haven't
really done anything with it yet alright
using the examples above make it so your
div fades to one which is one hundred
percent opposite opposite e opacity
obviously not know so or uh yeah when
your mouse enters div make the animation
speed fast make sure to give fate to its
inputs in order or speed rather than
that word I can say if they click click
slowly mouse over the Dib to see the
effect alright so we have our click me
here but what we wanted to do first
thing we need to do is say look treat
this div as a JavaScript for it with
JavaScript we want to call the dot fade
to on it and this also needs to
alright so it's two parameters there's
fast and then one which is going to be
how how much house ether is and I
believe that's it
so looks like we're going to do right
it's like you can say your dish fasted
agent one I did check the example
instructions if you need help
Devdas a two
okay so what we didn't do correctly here
was it looks like we didn't set the
condition for div the fade for it to
fate / so Mouse enter is function that
we want it to do win
no let's check our brackets here so do
fade 2 semicolon semicolon
meh center then we have the function
then we call it ooh is this Ari right
here oh alright so let's go ahead and go
to the Q&amp;amp;A forum we're on 11 of 13 get
yourself in
alright so let's compare this working
code to our own so we have document
already function
that's it right there I think do mouse
enter function like we're messed up on
the brackets so Patrol XA with submit
there we go you can see a change right
there and it became much clearer so just
a simple bracket mistake I saw between
the center and the enter document
already added Mouse leave I use this
fade to return your jizz all right so we
need between the end through mail center
so Mouse enters right here we want to
add another one that says when that div
so
Oh wrong one so this is a mountain mouse
enter we wanted to do it right here I
believe this is what we want to do here
so you wanna say it's going to look
similar to mouse I'm Turks I'm just
going to be a mouse leave div dot now
salute leave
have this function do some stuff
we're going to say this div
dot fade to this is going to return it
that's why we're doing this and it's
going to be fast otherwise once we hover
over it like so it will just always stay
that way we don't want that fast and we
want it to go back to point 5 make sure
you get out see how it goes back nice
0.5
it looks like you didn't say your dish
yes we did alright so let's check over
way too let's see if no that's not it
there's no way let's just go to the Q&amp;amp;A
forums it's probably another bracket
issue or in 12 of 13 try this so let's
compare this let's see what's going on
here so we're good on this first line
it's identical we're good on this second
line it's all side that's a fade three I
don't know why it's three what hey guys
we're good there we're good here so
let's compare this mouse leave function
jfa too fast
and it's a semicolon air cool that means
that's good just because it means that
we understand what's going on oh maybe
saw someone calling her this works
for this guy but it doesn't work for us
so our code works but
that's not correct so let's go save and
submit it works so we're getting it so
that it worked right there for a second
so I don't know it might just be a
little bit of an error there so it was
working fine I'm not quite sure with the
issue us but you know Eureka you've
completed we've finished our first
introduction to jquery it wasn't too bad
this is a lot more coding this is more
similar to actual coding than like HTML
was for me stuff like that so I kind of
like it I have a feeling it's doing it
very complicated once we start tying in
databases but we probably won't even do
that let's see what we're doing in the
next video close that we're doing J
query functions and selector so it looks
like we'll probably just be doing a
little bit more in-depth actions with
this so I'll see you guys the next
jquery video and as always comments
questions concerns wordpress ideas for
videos and just any sort of topics are
always appreciated thanks guys
