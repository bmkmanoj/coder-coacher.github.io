take this opportunity to wish everybody
a happy new year and kind of talk about
what my resolutions are in regards to my
personal life as well as my channel so
an OP and i'll also be safe guys it's a
little you know I know people tend to
get uh as a kids would say well turnt up
no but people are helped they're having
fun and just be safe you know use uber
and lyft and all that sort of stuff if
you're going to be out drinking or
smoking or doing anything it's going to
not make it safe to drive it but yeah
that's my public service announcement in
regards to New Year's resolutions I have
a couple um one is to get back into
shape I've uh I've just been having
muscle turn to jelly and now it is time
to hit the gym again so i'm going to
start up on monday if the gym is open I
think it's a holiday because for the gym
so maybe tuesday so that is the first
and foremost on the agenda second is to
be a full stack developer I've been this
is a been a a goal I've been working on
my work as a front-end developer mainly
and I'm supposed to be learning full
stack so by the end of 2017 I want to be
a full stack developer and probably the
the largest goal that I have is to be is
rather is to make a coding website so
that might be something you will see in
some of my livestreams moving forward
where I'll be working on something for
an hour or so after work you know maybe
even starting today but uh that's that's
my those are my current new year's
resolutions and I think I can accomplish
all three of them so by the end of the
year I would love to know what your
guys's new year's resolutions are I hope
they're you know pretty proactive and
and accomplishable goals and things like
that so be safe have fun and have a
happy new years special thanks to our
