we're gonna be doing a four part
interview series we're gonna start with
Davis who's an Internet wake up call him
he's a software intern so he's doing a
lot of coding it's his second year doing
this and he's been just loving it and
it's pretty cool to get the perspective
of an intern how he got started when his
experience level was going forward and
what he actually does on a day to day
basis so we're gonna start with Davis
after that we're gonna go ahead and move
on to a back-end engineer and then after
that we're gonna go to the head of
product who is also a full-stack
developer and does mobile doesn't web
applications and then finally we're
gonna work our way up to JJ who's the
way up CTO so we're gonna start at the
bottom work our way to the top so if you
have any questions make sure to leave
them in the comments and I'll make sure
to ask them moving forward but let's go
ahead and jump right into it code
everything so why don't we start out
David's wanting to kind of introduce
yourself and where your internship is
that and those sort of things yeah sure
so my name is Davis out I'm about to be
a senior at bi school in New York City
um I'm interning at way up which is a
online marketplace for college students
to find job part-time jobs during the
school year internships full-time jobs
once they graduate um yeah so this is
the second year that I'm doing an
internship went way up last year was
great I was working there it was a great
experience I'm just wrapping up my
internship this year and it's a it's
been a lot of fun so far and I've been
really enjoying it yeah uh so you said
it was your second year so how did you
in your first year how did you kind of
find out about the internship and how
did it come to be sure so actually my
sister actually went to school with the
two founders of way up JJ and Liz
actually lived with Liz during school
and was one who actually designed the
first logo for the first business that
they did together so that was sort of a
way that I knew Liz through that and
actually I last year I wanted to really
get involved in sort of doing on
programming at a startup and I knew Liz
was sort of in the know in a lot of ways
with the different people with different
people in the industry so I sent her my
resume and I asked
to sort of send that around to different
people but um then she took a look at it
and then JJ who's the CTO took a look at
it and they liked what they saw so then
they asked me for an interview and then
I interviewed I had a few interviews and
then ah yes I could come onto the summer
nice nice networking it's always a great
way to get your foot in the door people
are only asking me oh how do I you know
how do I get an internship how do I get
this and that and the easiest thing is
really talk to people that you know and
see if they can help you out while still
going their traditional route of like
applying and like looking and just
trying and just really being hungry for
it but networking is always one of the
best ways to go about that yeah
definitely it was it was good to have a
sort of a have a shoe in there was nice
yeah and so um you said that you're
interested in software and that's kind
of is your internship kind of revolve
around that a little bitter what if
wasn't what do you kind of typically do
in a day as as an intern
sure yeah so I'm an intern on the
engineering team would one other intern
this summer and basically just to walk
you through a day we get into the office
and the first thing we do when everyone
gets in the office is you have a morning
stand up
Reverend sort of goes around and says
what they did yesterday and then what
they're planning on doing today so you
guys you guys follow like agile sort of
principles yeah oh yeah so it's not like
directly like scrum in terms of just
everything like that but it's uh it's we
kind of try to keep it so everyone's on
the same page at all times which is
really helpful and then once we do once
we've gotten through that never sort of
on the same page um right now I'm
working on a pretty large project but
sometimes I'll either just pick up some
tasks off the backlog that are like
either bugs or like small features need
to get done and I'll work on that for
most of the day or if I'm working on a
larger project then I'll meet with
people that need to meet with about that
and I'll work on that
for most a day and then yeah so
basically most of the day I'd say I'm
programming we use a we use sort of
Django and Python for that um and then
um I'm doing mostly backend stuff so
that's that um and yeah so it's really
it's really a great experience being
able to actually get my hands on code a
lot of time which is something that we
expect at the beginning
the internship last summer I wasn't
really expecting you to be so hands-on
with to be honest with you but that
that's actually really impressive that
you're in there and you're you know
clearing tickets and doing everything
and coding and not because I my I had
one internship
I'd like a web design thing and it was
absolutely like the grunt es grunt work
of a of an internship you could imagine
it's like do these content changes awful
so I'm glad to hear that you're you're
actually doing some fun stuff that's
that's pretty neat you said you're
working on a big project any details so
you can say about it and I know
sometimes people are kind of secretive
about these things yeah I'm not a
hundred percent sure what I can sort of
share but I can talk about something
that I've finished in the past that sort
of gone live this year
perfect huh so basically one of them one
of the things I worked on earlier this
year was sort of adjusting how how
businesses actually post a job in terms
of the descriptions that they're the
descriptions that they're giving and
also sort of how everything looks so
again like a little bit more of a grunt
to work stuff in terms of like there was
some copy changes but it's also really
interesting because it was more on the
front end which is something I hadn't
really been working on in a lot um that
much so it involves sort of adding some
overlays and doing some and doing some
changes on that side which really
actually make made it a lot simpler for
businesses to actually understand what
kind of job that they were posting to
the site and what season they were
posting the job course that it's a lot
more straightforward for them actually
going through the process and then that
sort of gives the sales reps less to
have to sort of explain when
everything's on the site that was a
project that um I took up and sort of
met with the people met with someone
like the project managers who sort of
helped me through what the specs for the
project were and then sort of just took
that on and did all the did all the
JavaScript and CSS to sort of get that
and the right in the right format sorry
and then push that out the door and
that's been live for a few weeks that's
been great nice it's all it's always
great when you actually get something
out that's working like yeah yeah I find
it like really cool when I can actually
go on the site and see something that
I've done like there is Earl the first
thing I did this year was just changing
how a little check box look
so it looked normal that was just like a
half a day long thing except actually
going on the site and seeing the
checkbox how it's supposed to look it's
pretty good it's a pretty good feeling
yeah it's nice to see like oh man people
are actually seeing my work seeing the
things getting done and mind it's like
oh cool it's that it's a physical
tangible feel because up until then it's
just code like it so it sounds like
you've been doing quite a bit of coding
before the internship just kind of for
people who might be interested in
software engineering kind of maybe talk
about what your experience is software
wise that led you to be able to get such
a advanced internship I guess yeah
definitely um so I'd say I started
learning how to program around five
years ago it actually started with me
and a friend we wanted we just googled
like how to make a computer virus and
clearly that's not going to give you any
like good intel on to how to make an
actual computer virus but it got us to
like this YouTube video that sort of
showed us how to make like this prank
thing and then I sort of followed that
up with just the that guy on YouTube
just had a bunch of other videos so that
I watched I watched those and then I
went through some some other some other
youtuber actually had a ton of videos on
Java programming so I decided to sort of
go into that after after actually
talking with the UM I talked a lot with
the owner of the YouTube channel from
the first videos that I was watching he
got in contact with me actually was kind
of interesting he had like put out a
side project I was like an IM chat bot
and i was talking to that and then he
was that's how he got like my contact
info I was like oh you're the first
person who's actually like looked at
this is not someone that I know like who
are you those kind of interesting sort
of learning meeting someone through that
sort of channel talking him a lot about
sort of how he approached learning how
to program and then once I decided like
to do job I sort of um watched actually
YouTube videos a lot on how to do that
and that's sort of how I got my foot in
the door with that and then on Python
which is what I'm using for the UH for
my internship this summer I learned
through Udacity had a few classes on how
to first like just intro to Python and
then another class they had on web
development which was
taught by actually the CEO of reddit
which is really cool
I'm just watching videos on that so a
lot of a lot of videos and a lot of
interactive stuff online was how I
learned part that's really what I tell
people is one of the cool things about
programming is if you're willing to you
know devote your nights and weekends and
kind of just buckle down and stick to it
you can once you actually can make a
product and people can see that you're
capable
you know doors will open it's a have an
impressive portfolio they'll overlook
some other things like lack of
experience so I'm glad you got started
five years ago that's really impressive
yeah thanks very well I guess Larry
let's jump back to the the an intern
topic how would you from like a as
someone who's got an internship from
networking standpoint what were you did
you just kind of start doing looking or
were you applying places or were you
like did you do anything else or did you
just say Isis hook it up like how did it
go about um well I sort of um because
obviously like being in high school
there's not too many like official
channels and in terms of getting
internships almost like the in like I
started looking probably around February
and most sort of like big companies that
have internship programs first of all
they're there for college students
second of all they sort of wrap up
around February instead of starting
around February some other summer plans
now sort of trying to at that point just
trying to maybe fill in a few more weeks
but then when I was able to sort of I my
sister actually was one who brought the
idea of oh maybe I can send my resume
out to my friend you can unde send it
out to some more people and then she
sends an app's like six or seven places
maybe we'll get something where he can
like be ya be driving cough like getting
coffee for a few weeks and just like
being environment and that's really what
I thought I was gonna be doing until I
get on the phone and then he's like oh
we have this project we want you to work
on and I'm like that's fantastic but um
though I'd say really what I was looking
for was sort of just getting getting in
the environment and seeing sort of
seeing what it was like even from an
observers perspective um I accepted sort
of grew out of that into something that
was more engineer
focus and that I really enjoyed that
sorry I don't know if that answers the
question like super directly but what
are you and do you answer the answer the
best way good right you have any like
side projects you're working on have a
curiosity um currently not the very
current moment I am but a lot of the
stuff that I do is sort of focused
around my school and sort of stuff like
that cuz that's obviously where I spend
a lot of my time there anything where
where I'm able to like deep problems
that there are um so one of the things
that I was working on was sort of like a
way for like teachers to like post
assignments and kids to like submit
submit their projects sort of online and
doing all that online in a way that um
that existing products that do that
there are a lot of things that do that
um just like there's certain things that
especially like like um like there's a
computer science class in my school's
like ways for that for them just sort of
like do like automated grading for stuff
like that all on all in sort of one
system so that was a side project that
was working on a little bit ago
sometimes I just like for a while I was
working on like the old game space war
of just kind of trying to like redo that
would like a make multiplayer thing
that's sort of just a lot of small
things that I sort of work on just to it
just to keep up when I get when I get a
little bit bored and I'm a little bit of
spare time um right now though during
the internship it's sort of difficult
like when I'm programming for 10 8 8 8
or 9 hours a day to sort of then go home
and sort of try to work on something
else but um there's a few things I
haven't in the back of my head that with
a few friends I think I try working on
you soon that should be exciting yeah
nice man I'd love when you finish
something or you push something out or
about to we can do a follow-up interview
and see yeah what would you say to
people that were in similar situations
you know young young young men sick you
know let's just say 16 to 18 then are
trying to get into programming what
would you your advice to them be I think
the one thing that it really takes and
um is just me it's not necessarily like
it doesn't come easy to everyone first
of all like definitely I really didn't
understand a lot of like the main
concepts of programming that are really
necessary to to sort of be the keenest
like proficient at it when I first
started
except it's not necessarily you don't
think you have to know that it's not um
you don't need to understand those right
away you just have to sort of work at
like sort of working through the
techniques and working through the
concepts that you're learning um and a
big part of that is not just like going
on and looking and reading things or
watching videos but it's also um sort of
trying to make a project like the first
project I ever tried working on um I
didn't really understand like how like a
return statement like why you needed a
return statement whenever you think it'd
just be like a global variable like
everything's just up there you don't
need anything um but obviously like
that's something that is it's like a
very basic computer science concept that
like for me at least being in a
environment or not in the classroom
learning about it it was hard for me to
understand but if you're actually like
working on projects you're actually able
I think to learn sort of some of the
concepts that are pretty necessary that
you might not come as easy to as as they
might come to some other people and I
think just really sticking to it and not
not giving up when you get frustrated is
really important for sort of learning
how to learning learning how to program
and learning how to do it enough in a
good way okay you said that you're in
your senior year of high school I think
you're going to college any any degree
in mind quite yet um I think I'm gonna
be pursuing computer science or at least
some point of engineering also I'm sorta
interested in robotics so I might do I
don't know exactly what for engineering
but I think definitely sort of like the
I'm a fan of like the technical sort of
nitty-gritty so I think I mean I'm
excited for like getting some sort of
like technical degree you'd be good nice
I thought that's what I was assuming I
was like ah I'll leave you get if you
hit me with that I'm gonna be a liberal
arts major I might be a little confused
but I'm glad to hear that hey guys
