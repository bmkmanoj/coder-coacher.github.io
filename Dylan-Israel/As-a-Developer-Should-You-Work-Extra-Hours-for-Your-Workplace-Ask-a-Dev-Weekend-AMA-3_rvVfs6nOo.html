weekend livestream we're doing it on a
Friday today and it kind of relates to
our topic of the day which is as a
developer should you work more than the
standard 40-hour work week as a salaried
employee or win should you I think it's
a better way of putting it because not
everything is black and white in the
world and we'll jump into that in just a
moment so we are doing this on a Friday
instead of Saturday I am working
Saturday for my work I am going to take
Monday off as compensation if you will
they have nicely said hey take Saturday
off comp time since you're going to be
working an extra day this week but on
top of that I'm actually putting in
about 10 to 15 hours extra this week
because I am doing some stuff for the
company that has a day to day deadline
that needs to be delivered because it is
a something gets released daily so I
wanted to talk I thought this was a good
opportunity as you guys could see me a
little bit tired in the middle of the
sort of extra work hours grind to share
my thoughts on it
um and I educate yourself a little bit
on this now as always I kind of preface
this by saying that most my advice is
that when it comes to companies is that
it's a case-by-case basis right every
company is different much like every
person and thank you to James by the way
who just donated $2 to the channel I
appreciated James and Erica brown
welcome so right now we are in a very
busy week in my company we have the
largest event that's going on this year
and they needed some extra hands on deck
to actually do that your boy is
essentially a cashier at a conference
help me run things helping helping ring
things up and doing any of the sort of
tasks really at the end of the day that
needs to be done
extra extra pair of hands essentially
and on top of it I'm also doing some of
my dev duties for the last day and a
half and I will continue to do it for
the next couple days because
unfortunately this is taken away from
the time I would be developing it am i
okay with this yes and I will tell you
why by and large my company encourages
me to work 40-hour work weeks I would
say I've been with the company around
five months this is the first week where
I have worked past that on their Accord
mean meaning it's game day and I've said
this kind of before where I think it's
perfectly acceptable for a company to
ask you as a developer say look it's a
game day
can you show up to game stage are you
gonna be an all-star on game day are you
gonna be a benchwarmer on game day and I
think as individual you need to rise to
the occasion when it when it's
appropriate now how often should there
be a game day is a very different thing
when everything's a priority nothing's a
priority and same thing goes with
working extra hours per week so when
your organization has a game day on a
weekly basis and you're working instead
working 40 hours you're working 45 55 50
55 hours a week because that's what's
expected to me that is a toxic
environment and one that you should
probably leave it doesn't have a good
health work-life balance and really
isn't all that great for you as an
individual in your mental and emotional
health and probably will affect your
relationship all that sort of stuff so
it's just not good for you to do that
now what would I say is an appropriate
game day sort of period of time where I
would say one to two weekends one to two
situations every three months so about
once a once every six weeks at the
absolute most where it's like hey we
need you to come in late this weekend or
hey we need you to do this we need you
to do that we need you to stay late can
you can you can you accommodate that
and what does that get you at the other
day is kind of how I look at it one you
your team player yeah which is nice as
long as you because you make sure that
you're a valued player and so you
shouldn't want to be stepped on as a
employee and I encourage you not to but
I also think you should it's this
healthy line of okay I'm gonna step up
to play help out when I can
the other thing is it gives you the
confidence and this is something that I
don't suffer with because I'm very
selfish employee I'm very looking out
for a numero uno type of person but
there are a lot of people out there who
feel very uncomfortable leaving a job
after one year leaving a job after two
years for more money and I think a lot
of you if you put in if you arrive on
game day every single game way that that
arrives when the one year mark comes
around you get a one and a half percent
race or something ridiculous like that
it may give you the fuel you need to
sort of give the finger and drop the mic
walk away and take another offer which
is equally as important and one of the
fastest ways to raise your your salary
as a developer which is another reason I
think you should show for game day as I
say but that's my sort of thoughts about
is it okay for you to actually work more
than 40 hours a week and then the the
the situation isn't yes or no as it
always says it is a when it's
appropriate and on what frequency but by
and large if your works a seeing work
every week fifty hours a week probably
want to leave that workplace that's my
my opinion but that's what they anyhow
so that's today's conversation starter
and we're gonna go ahead and talk about
whatever it is you guys have questions
for this is the weekend am a the weekend
livestream on a Friday night we're
counting us a weekend because I have to
work tomorrow and I'm a little too tired
to study so a little update about me I
am just finished my second course in
college and
I got another certificate from the
certified Internet web specialists as
part of that I'm currently working
through another course I'm completing a
course on once every two weeks this next
course because of this sort of game day
week is is going to probably take take
me three weeks and go from there but um
I'm doing very well and I'm I've
recently started continuing to write my
book which I'm very excited about again
and I've also recently started to finish
up my algorithm slash JavaScript course
which I'm excited to share with you guys
which will probably be about a month at
the rate I'm going for the course and
then book kunos end of 2018 is my guess
all right so let's see we have a couple
questions hi should I learn PHP so
Samaras I hate PHP not that there's not
jobs in it not that it's not a language
that has become better in all honesty
since PHP 5 PHP 5 is and then PHP 7 is
much better from what I'm told anyhow I
could I can't really speak to that as a
developer in page 37 I only did PHP 5
now what I can say is that are there a
lot of jobs in PHP yes will it help you
get a web development job yes is it the
only back-end language no but it is the
largest one I would say at this point in
time and so if that answers your
question I think that's one way you're
going about it so what if you're
expected to work a lot of overtime the
company fails to compensate you for it
more than a couple of times if the
company fails to comp so if a company
promises you money say ok hey man we
know this is going above and beyond and
we're gonna compensate you you know
extra hours we know your salary and
we're gonna compensate you you know your
whatever your hourly rate would break
down to as a bonus or something like
that to help out and they don't you need
to go and get your fucking money yes now
if it's one of those things where
they're willing to pay you and then they
stop paying you or they only pay you
once or twice it's a nice thing and then
it's becomes expected you need to have a
conversation with somebody a boss a
manager and go from there and exactly so
Mario Silva says exactly what is there
his promises are bullshit at the end of
the day is promises are nothing more
than words
much like your goals much like your
dreams you can say them all you want but
until you work towards them until you go
and get them and have something
substantial behind them it's just words
same thing with people and companies
promising things so that that's why I my
mentality is your team player and if you
get rewarded within your one year your
two year for being a team player great
if not you figure it out
whether that's there or other places but
that's that's my stance on it in it hey
if you're being a team player for more
than sort of a once every six weeks once
every three months would be ideal you
may want to leave you may want to find a
better job that's the church doesn't
matter a lot of workplaces are really
stressful I happen to be at a very good
workplace that values your your family
time values here your hours int and work
and out of work which is strange because
I'm kind of a workaholic if you guys
haven't noticed but I encourage you to
understand your value to the market and
understand that I'll give you a good
example
I turned down an offer that was fifteen
thousand dollars higher than my current
one which is a lot of money so we're
talking about the difference between
seventy-five thousand and ninety
thousand and would have been at a very
great company that was very much
interested in to a large financial
investment company and I turned it down
because all of the developers look
drained they look stressed out they look
like they're probably working too many
hours
and it's not a good environment for
anybody to do that and so even for more
money how much money are you losing out
on by you working those extra hours are
you really making more money or you
actually probably going to take a loss
on an hourly basis you have to think
about all these things and how many how
much money are you losing by not being
able to study other things so I'm a
front-end developer if I wanted to learn
C sharp and dotnet how much more money
would that make me twenty thousand
dollars a year maybe I think that's
probably a pretty accurate number if I
go and learn C sharp and net I could
probably make 20k more a year and
transition to full SEC but if I don't
have the time to do that and I'm making
five thousand dollars more ten thousand
dollars or maybe some stuff to think
about I'm probably really tired and
unhappy about it and probably dealing
with people who are in the same same
issue it's not something that you should
really want what is my favorite Mexican
talk to me it's gonna it's got to be a
good season carne asada that has a
little bit of like a hint of lime like
it has to have that tang to it like that
a tangy carne asada is what I would I
that's what I that's what as a kid say
that's what I fuck with I have a daytime
job not coding related I only have about
two hours a day a free time I also have
to watch YouTube Facebook and and watch
some only stream games only got one hour
left is that okay okay for what it's
okay for you to learn to code one hour a
day probably not if you can't give up
fucking YouTube you can't give up
Facebook and watching streaming games
you need to get some fucking
self-control I just accept the fact that
you're okay with whatever your situation
is if you're if you're saying look I
want to get in a better financial
situation I want to get a better job I
want to do this
but but but but I can't give up twitch I
just can't man I got a watch
I got a watch the LCS alright I got a
watch the head shots I got a watch
I got a watch at all I got a I got a
watch the the the YouTube video so I got
a I got a watch my hi my cutie pie
whatever it is right the the call of
duty vaz I got a go on Facebook guy go
on Facebook gotta make sure that I'm
liking thinks common and thinks I'm
sharing dope shit you are a child and
you need to grow up and that may be
harsh but that is the Trulie
true true true true true words and I
don't mean to say that pick on you but
as the kids would say use a basic bitch
yeah
we're keeping it really aren't you tired
that the sugarcoat it for you but you
need to you need to re-evaluate your
priorities is what I'm trying to say
what is the most interesting thing you
have learned in school the school thing
that you're doing it was most useless
thing the first year courses I did was
webdev I didn't learn anything I learned
a lot of useless stuff a lot I've
learned a lot about like html4 I learned
a lot about like the internet history
like rebe script and things like that or
jscript rather how many years does it
take to learn all these things you gotta
be a little bit more specific and also
it's not really an answer you can give
the thing about software is everyone
learns at a different pace right and
there's levels to it you know it's kind
of like oh well you get it this part you
get this much part after a year then
maybe two years it's that much part and
then if you keep studying at it you get
that much prior three years something
that four years it's that much part you
drawback no but uh everyone goes that
different base so you can't really put
it I think it also depends on how often
you suck are you putting four hours a
day every day for five years probably
gonna be pretty good
so I've been doing the coke atom and
building websites from scratch and
learned some things however I do have to
say the only thing of value is when they
walk you through doing your code on your
device yeah so I mean that's kind of
what a lot of these sites are is they
charge you I think you're talking about
the code had me pro stuff where
essentially they will do code reviews
which is something a super valuable and
that you do in the workplace essentially
they see your code hey you could done
this to sort of refactor to make it
better
it's one of the best aspects that I I
got from the Udacity nanodegree program
do I use MySQL I used to have my old
work that's on MySQL it's just a
relational database like anything else I
will say that I think the syntax for my
sequel it's a little bit less intuitive
than sequel itself I often find myself
thinking when I would be doing my sequel
is what was I would say the words in
sequel which are very close to how you
would say this in English and then you
are like okay well how do I do that shit
in my sequel that's my that's my
thoughts on it
did you get paired with cool senior dev
when you first start your first job no
my first job was basically start up with
three and a half devs
half dev was in turn so that's where
that's where they have to have comes in
and I really didn't get much direction
from my applied over 200 times live in
Cali what am I doing wrong so when I was
applying for my very first step job I
was applying all throughout the United
States I was also doing about 50
applications a day um so you may want to
and I don't have time Juan bonds Juan
Ponce oh seven - you should have Juan
Ponce Cinco seis siete and so what you
should have been no see that day to look
at your portfolio but honestly
it's a very large very large task 8 for
a step job you have to apply non-stop I
really I'm not bullshitting you when I
say I applied to every state in the
country and I was doing about 50 jobs
today I would come home and I'd spend 4
to 5 hours after work doing job apps go
to sleep go to work come back do four to
five hours of Java echo sleep good work
and I did this for about six weeks till
I got a job coming they tried to recruit
me
but the juniors if their hate it yeah
it's your friend of India all right cool
well what's this demon in the back eh
hey don't you worry about it it's just
the essential oil diffuser what do you
think of learning the fundamentals of
love development in a crash course event
uh I think learning any sort of crash
course is great if you go and
immediately apply it I think that really
issue people have if they say crash
courses and then they like alright cool
they do one project but you take you
know to our course your next two weeks
should be building stuff and what you
were introduced to in that to our course
to expand upon it uh I just guys telling
me to fuck off I'm go ahead and just ban
that guy
let's go ahead and ban that guy
I'm not quite sure why he's telling you
to fuck off there we go um I think I've
been very cordial with most of you guys
Europe you are on point sorry I left
self control thanks look at that man you
tell the man the truth and he
appreciates it
you didn't just hide he didn't just go
back and he just flip off the finger
good for you for taking some
constructive criticism you were cool
thank you lost millennial Jonathan
Johnson cook sounds or pucks and let's
just want to say thanks for your content
has held me on stay on track and finally
working as charter person in turn will
be full-time about 23 days
congratulations this is something I've
talked about quite often is that a lot
of these Junior Devils a lot of you guys
want to get hired right away for a
junior dev role as possible don't get me
wrong I did it but a lot of companies
they will sign you for like a 90 day and
Jonathan maybe you can contest to this
if you thought it was well you did a 90
day or three month internship to see hey
can this guy actually do the role and do
we want to keep him around you see a
good fit and that's kind of their test
your way to find out
how did I land my first job for six
weeks I applied to jobs all throughout
the United States about 50 a day I was
it I mean I worked very hard to get to
the skills where I could do that but in
terms of actually applying jobs I
applied to jobs only on the apps that
came out that day for front-end roles if
your DS
distracted with social media
entertainment and get internet back in
shitty computer a minute so the thing is
is I I at one time what's the same thing
I used to go home when I was in school
play League of Legends cuz for hours
what I eventually had to do is I had to
get rid of my TV I got rid of all my
game systems I got rid of every all the
distractions I could and then I made it
much easier for me to I uninstalled all
my games on the PC made much easier for
me to stay focused exercise the sport
focus on their areas for environment as
well you can be a great coder but if
people don't think you'd fit in the
overall culture of the company I work
yes this is something that I've talked
about quite a bit is work on your
communication skills you will be working
on a team if someone looks at you and so
this guy is so uncomfortable I don't
want to work with him they're just gonna
move on to the next guy who isn't
uncomfortable who can you know the form
a sentence and can have a personality
really I mean part of being on a team is
collaboration part of being on team is
being able to go ahead and communicate
clearly what it is that your issues are
how you can work through them and that's
in a personal level and a technical
level and you need to be able to have
good communication so really do focus on
that do I live in Florida still I do
indeed how long did it take you to feel
confident in JavaScript algorithms I'll
tell you later man that's been a year
too
I don't know honestly probably not till
recently
well ever make a course that helps
people get a junior dev job
yeah it's called the YouTube channel man
if you've been if you've been watching
this ask a dev series all it is is the
knowledge in every video to help you
become a better developer to get a job I
think I think the Lizzie worth maybe
some of the that you granted that I
could make a video about or a course
specifically about hey let's do your
Linkedin list you're right but I've
pretty much done those videos on my
channel
and I think what a lot of people are
looking for is a man I'm not saying this
is your you specifically it could be but
a lot of people when they ask that
question is what was the secret sauce
Dillon that got you through that
everybody else that made sure that you
got hired in the next week and for me
honestly I just covered all my bases I
had a portfolio I had a github had a
LinkedIn I had a nice resume I applied
to a lot of jobs I was willing to
relocate I was you know I learned the
skills that were popping up on resumes
you know I on those are on the job
applications all the basic stuff and
it's a lot of work right every time I
saw angular or react I had to choose to
I won't learn angular John learn react
and then I had to go build a project in
that I had to learn something to build a
project in it and go from there and I
saw get version control okay and I just
started noticing what are on these job
applications now to go learn those
skills so there's not some sort of
secret magic bullet that like look man
all these fucking coding guys they're on
their coding challenge they're not
giving it up I've been giving it up 700
videos now alright
your boy is easy when it comes to the
coding knowledge right so it's it's all
of it combined I guess is what I'm
trying to say there's not like a magic
bullet it's all of it combined I'm a big
fan of the channel quick question
a quick question was what is the best
online resource for learning rails at
the novice intermediate level either
paid or free but short of an online boot
camp thank you honestly I couldn't tell
you I don't know anything about rails
other than I don't ever see jobs do I
know any good resource for learning
relational databases normalization so on
my teacher does not explain the way I
want it so I need some studying
materials maybe or some experience
honestly it's it's just the only
experience I have is in the workplace
and personal projects I will say I will
say that code fights calm added a I
forget if it's a my sequel algorithm
stuff where you can go and try and solve
and practice that way where they have
database problems like most algorithms
you're solving in like JavaScript or
you're solving and c-sharp or if you
know 40 other languages they actually
have a database one of about 60 database
problems and that'll teach you a ton if
you put in the time and energy it's
gonna be hard but it definitely worth
your time energy what would be the best
job in 2018 anything and software that
you're passionate about honestly I have
a video coming out on Monday about
should you learn front-end development
or should should you be a web developer
in 2018 and we talked a little bit about
how it's more important about your
passion but in the in the field I would
say I would say I think if I was to
choose one thing that falls under the
software category in it I say that
because that's where I think all the
best jobs are I would say that learning
cryptocurrency it serum contract type
languages right now would probably be
the best bet for you
frickin s Monti because of that I
thought I was the only one that
abbreviated shit like that when a custom
back in languages after node.js should
one move into my sequel uh well I mean
no js' is sort of the back end in my
sequel is a database but typically if
you're doing it no js' backend you're
probably doing a JSON or yusan database
so you might want to look more into
MongoDB but there wouldn't be any issue
with learning my sequel or sequel where
is your friend Dolan takes Dolan about a
month ago back his moustache though
you're gonna have to wait til that is
getting an a BS degree in computer
science worth getting if you already
have an unrelated degree know what I
would say is that if you are considering
going back to school the University of
Georgia I want to say has a $4,000
computer science master's program now
you may have to test into it because you
don't have a related degree but I do
believe that they take work experience
as a way to allow you to enter the
program so if you really are have your
heart set on going back to school first
off as somebody who's going back to
school I'm really just going back to get
a piece of paper but sometimes a lot of
people have faith in that piece of paper
so if that's something that you're
looking to do what I would say is
consider the master's program before
anything else do not go back for
bachelors under any circumstance I can't
figure out how to build a song and game
pissing off you know how I've built
every project on free code camp for the
most part and I get more people the only
one that I really didn't pillows the
Simon game and put up a video for
I get more people asking about that
stupid project that I should just do it
how long until those braces come off
hopefully hopefully within a month we
are in the homestretch right now it's
spinning out straight the straighter I
need to get them whiten when these
things come off but yeah wait I thought
reactive you were not frameworks
reactant viewers libraries technically
but when you install 40 fucking
libraries you have a framework as far as
I'm concerned which is what happens with
the react start doing a react project
and then see how any it and even want to
react tutorial they will install ten
dependencies from ulta from open source
to this open source set and by the end
of it you basically have a third of
angular it's a framework as far as I'm
concerned because that's how it's used
opinion on game development
uh well from everyone who I've
interviewed in from everyone who I've
interviewed and talked with in-game
developments a very stress heavy
industry and it's one that's hard to get
into because it has a very like oh well
this would be so much fun and this and
that and it's so stressful
there's a lot of crunch time meaning
that like there's a lot of deadlines
that have to be hit so you're working 12
a 15-hour days law and the money sonal
that great and on top of it so I would
stay away making one big project to help
you get ahead of Corsican IO all you
really need is one good project you
don't need a bunch of tiny projects the
big projects are gonna be the ones that
are most impressive my YouTube channels
my most impressive projects my long-term
projects but still thing I've stuck with
ice pencils are going to help me grow
and I encourage you to have a very big
long term project doesn't mean you have
small projects you're gonna need those
anyhow to learn frameworks libraries
languages why do you think I don't sit
here how was your experience looking for
work in LA I soon else a lot of su sharp
would you move back there once you get
your degree
I would move back to LA if I got a fat
salary that salary being somewhere twice
around two times what I make now and the
reason I would do it is because I miss
Mexican food and my family's there who
you know my parents are getting older be
nice to lives a little bit closer to
them but it has nothing to do with me
getting my degree although in fairness I
wouldn't leave my current job until I
had that part of my life complete so
maybe it does
you know if unless some you know Google
came on look man we heard you were the
coding guy I said Google you heard
fucking right and then I was like cut
the check Google then maybe but yeah
like I'm not looking like I'll give you
I'll give you an example right now you
guys want to see what it looks like if I
people think you're bullshitting you say
you get recruiters message you every
single time what's today today is
February 1st you do this is nothing
special this is nothing to do with me
but this guy this guy actually emailed
me looking for a job uh a recruiter
let's go down here we continue uh
recruiter a recruiter a recruiter a
recruiter and it just goes on and on the
point I guess I'm trying to make is that
if I wanted another job I could go and
get one I'm not looking for a job and I
wouldn't even consider it until I
finished my degree because I I kind of
don't like so much change at once
because I think it's stressful looking
for a job it's time-consuming so what do
you think about developers from
countries like the United us in
developers from the US our American
developers over price uh I just think
there's probably more tech jobs
let's probably choose the matter more
jobs hired a man I mean if you could
think about the United Kingdom and
compare it to the amount I I mean this
is just my gut I'd have to actually look
into this but my gut tells me that the
top tech companies are in America
competing for the top tech talent and
that if you want those people and
there's a lot more jobs yeah yeah and
less people to fill those roles on a
percentage basis you're gonna have
higher salaries but I don't know that
this is what my gut tells me what would
you suggest for me a first client-side
framework learn reactor angular view
isn't gonna get you a job because there
aren't any jobs in view I'm thinking of
moving to Orlando are there web
development jobs there there's web dev
jumps everywhere now I wouldn't move
anywhere until you have a job you can
interview via skype via phone calls and
get a job I didn't have a Skype call
when I got my job I was in California
got job in Tampa area of Florida said
two phone calls couple emails when bam
thank you ma'am was there that is a
essential oil diffuser
our developers drug tested it's on my
company by company basis I wasn't drug
tested at my last company I was
contrived tested at this company and I
don't remember my previous County how
many free code camp projects in your CV
to get you hired hey oh hey man did you
use it only your free cooking projects
in your CV I I had some I want to say at
the time I had six projects on there and
four make four to three were front-end
were free cocaine fronting projects one
was my website coding tutorials 360 comm
which was an angularjs site I built the
other was my YouTube channel and I think
the rest were free code camp projects
our recruiters even valuable they're so
annoying recruiter got me this job I
love this job I would say the same thing
you tell the recruiter
your recruiter got me a job
what about Android development is any
better
no I honestly guys if you're if the
choice is between mobile development and
web development what I'll say to you is
I think you'd be making mistakes using
mobile development not that there aren't
jobs in mobile development not that they
aren't that it's just the skill set I
think is more time for this the skill
set I think there's more jobs in web
development than mobile development and
I think it's not going to change if
anything I think is going to go in the
opposite direction as you continue to
see things like ionic pop up and react
native that's slowly going to dwindle
away some of the Android jobs out there
and the iOS jobs are Swiss jobs
I mean Python there's Python related web
dev but mainly it's used for data so
it's how am i doing how far you and like
a please hang euler five-course are you
talking about
Academy of course I'm like 3/4 of the
way to write I use bootstrap for a
little timeline your job for nothing
that's not true
Java is widely used by like fortune 500
companies large super large corporations
use Java and like Scala all the time and
they love it now in your personal life
would you ever use Java
no would you ever actually do a web dev
project in Java a personal web dev
project in Java uh no how many hours a
day where you're grinding while learning
web dev what were your main resources
when I was working as a technology
trainer at at education dynamics just
kind of a small project manager course
with a technical writer and project
manager all I was putting in four hours
a day after work and on
weekends some days I would and a little
bit more on Friday night it's like six
seven hours on the weekends I put in
about 12 hours a day maybe more I mean
the thing I say and I say we ended up
talking about this every last year
because I you guys are like look man I'm
studying I'm coding I just want that job
I want that internship I wanna continue
learning outside of work but I wanna you
know I want I want to get paid I don't
care if it's minimum wage I want to get
paid and I want to start getting some
resume experiences I understand that is
what really helps and it does but I'll
say this
and I said every livestream code every
day until you have a job three or four
hours a day every day till you have a
job and that could mean going to meetups
that could mean you know blogging your
your learning process it could mean some
maybe less code heavy thing cuz you know
we all get burnt out over writing code
so code everyday until you have a job
then you will have a job every day
what's going on Kevin Kevin Kevin show
and has entered the building
um look ups are trying to make projects
actually impressing your deso type
project do you think could do this
unique projects people are not impressed
by weather apps they're not impressed by
calculator says they're not impressed by
to do things they want something with
personality and they want something
custom so those are the types of
projects you should have should I use
you know pros and cons pros it's it's
pretty easy to learn my understanding
this cons you're wasting your time
because there's no jobs in view yet
react versus Express Jaso they're kind
of two different things
Express is a back-end JavaScript
language you use in node and react is a
front-end view template in library
although I like to call it a frame or
PHP verse nodejs pH few more jobs no js'
more sanity what do you have against
Java uh I did Java I'm not I'm not
saying job is an awful language I think
we can all agree it is but it's just one
of those things that it's not very
intuitive there's a lot of rules to it
which some people say a programming
language should have so it's it's it's
sort of overly developed in my opinion
and also it's not something that you
would ever use in a practical project it
really is a language that you use if you
are at a corporate you know company top
500 company that I don't I mean does
anyone here know anyone that started a
side project in fucking Java it doesn't
happen because it's awful to do it it's
much easier when it comes to doing
something JavaScript I've searched all
these are web dev frameworks doing web
dev in Java and I've done it because
I've done all my coursework in Java was
realist read ick Ulis and so the whole
time you're doing it you're like God I
could just do this in JavaScript in two
seconds that's what I have against Java
what is your favorite javascript design
pattern I have to look dude I don't have
a favorite JavaScript design panic if
you guys think I have design patterns or
I know bubble sort or I know Big Ten
notation anymore you are out of your
mind
you you're not dogging the right
developer to give you some JavaScript
design patterns but that's not how I
roll I had a white board interview but I
didn't attend it because I feel I didn't
know much on coding it did I fuck yes
you did
the white board interview would have
shown you first off what sort of
questions we're gonna be asked you was
gonna make you more more okay with being
in a stressful and awkward environment
cuz it's definitely gonna be that way
another thing is it was your chance to
introduce yourself to some people who
would have said if you made a good
impression because not only would you be
interviewed you would do the white board
of course but you would also be
interviewed and they would say hey you
know what
that guy Dylan or that guy King Ritchie
if you're named his King or itchy you
definitely have a memorable name but
that guy King Ritchie I like him he
tanked the shit out of that white board
interview but I can tell based off of
his github pushes I can tell based off
his LinkedIn his portfolio that he's
trying you know we all stress we all
crack you never know you never know how
much that they're gonna be away that so
yes you should have gone are you gonna
probably not get the job I don't know is
it gonna be awkward and stressful yeah
get over it
they they liked you enough based off
what you showed them to invite you for
an interview that's not you know I
applied to hundreds of jobs before I got
a couple interviews
when you say code everyday do you mean
create a project stick with it or do all
the toriel's on free coke and so on just
do something that progresses you three
to four hours a day in your coding
career that could be meetups that could
be tutorials on free code camp that
could be building a project that could
be writing a blog about your your coding
journey that could be homework that's
related to software it do something
that's related to you moving forward in
a coding direction that could be
reorganizing your github okay it doesn't
have to be one thing it's actually going
to be five or ten things I can't which
sort of not really know do I do I have
any cool project ideas for web or mobile
does that matter you need to have your
own ideas when you need to take
something that you're passionate about
it could be anything new your passion
about Pokemon could build pokemon card
with Pokemon API something fun you're
passionate about you FC go and use it so
sort of random UFC API build a UFC API
you know how dare you I challenge you to
coding to let you Java Lee accept no
because nobody needs to see Java alright
isn't Western Governors University
software deaf course Java centric they
do have to Java courses yes hey I
wouldn't say it's Java centric but there
are two Java courses that are part of it
Wu's software deaf course it's more of a
IT course you do talk about project
management you talk about web dev you
talk about software but has more of an
IT feel to it what's your opinion on net
core and c-sharp and all that that's
what we use at my work with a anglia
front end and I'm I'll be picking up net
and c-sharp and whining you asked me a
couple months I'll give you a much
better idea what I think
do you ever think about doing is
development now are you still during the
live broadcast tomorrow no this is this
is tomorrow's live broadcast because I
have to I have to do some work tomorrow
is the developer mr. robot realistic
that guy got skills
that's a real question but by and large
don't try and take your expectations
from movies I learned to express yes
have the right to talk to us right look
man everyone here knows expressed Reyes
isn't perfect but it's beautiful and we
love it anyway so okay it's made our
lives much easier in the in the
JavaScript back-end if you don't mind me
asking why is what verbally bodied you
gotta elaborate here what I recommend WG
you to aside from the University of
Georgia seriously guys I don't recommend
college I am not learning anything in my
first two and now my current third
course so it's hard for me to recommend
college as a whole so what I recommend
getting a master's know what I recommend
EB masters over getting a bachelor's in
computer science when you already have a
degree yes I would also recommend that
if you're trying to break in the space
getting a bachelor's to some sort if you
don't have a degree because that's
usually the barrier of entry
I can't really get it too much into the
architecture of ruin have you committed
any mistakes on job yeah I'll tell you
mistake I did so part of the thing I'm
working on has a daily release where
every day I need to make sure that I
have that day's content out and I got my
days mixed up so I was one day behind so
everybody was on social media posting
four or five four oh four pictures of uh
where's this where's where's this thing
and and we send out text messages right
with these links to these sites it's a
this was like this was like two days ago
so um so that is uh that is something
that I recently did where I got my dad's
like oh I have one more day to do it and
then I'm getting messages from various
people a did you put so-and-so did you
put this out yet I was like yeah yeah
it's day you know 34 they're like not
due to say 35 like oh so yeah I I have
made mistakes um it happens even you
know every coding god has a plan for you
right even when you forget to do so
so I've pushed straight to master in my
like second or third week so one of the
things I maybe I should do a video just
talking about the top five ways I messed
up at job we have like a code review
process and all this sort of stuff and
you gotta make sure the test run all the
standard stuff and I was I was trying to
wean myself off using a gay
tool like a GUI tool when it comes to
get and so I started trying to learn man
I went in there tired one day and I was
just like oh yeah and before I knew I
pushed straight to master it was like
week two just like who guess that's
going to production baby so I mean yeah
it happens man
you know am I always making mistakes no
you know there's there's other
developers to read your code there's QA
you know do things fall through the
cracks or their use cases of course are
but those are sort of the more memorable
mistakes I have made at least in the
last five months yeah
I will say I did get in trouble a little
bit on a less and what I considered to
be a less important project that had
late-night something needed to go out
the next day and it was like 10:00 at
night and I didn't follow the the
processes at work and because they
needed to go out I just pushed it
straight to master and I did get kind of
smacked down a little bit about that but
I did defend myself and my reasonings at
thought for uh thought process for it so
hey don't forgiving me the power if you
don't think I'm gonna push it when I
meet but that's I didn't really get it I
would say I got in trouble with that we
had a very lively debate to a degree do
I do TDD at work I do all right guys it
is we are it is about time to wrap this
up it's been about an hour I hope you
enjoyed the weekly live stream on Monday
we will have a nice video coming out
talking about should you do web
development in 2018 we
those facts we have some job stats
things to work out things to to think
about and talk about they don't leave
you a like all the ladies before I found
the love of my life you're gonna go on
girl
don't worry about it all right you're
gonna meet your own dough long all right
I need to I need to go rest a little bit
I got a long day tomorrow and I need to
go eat so let's uh I usually try to end
on a fun on a final thought of sorts and
one of one of the things that if you
watch recently I did my dual on video
just kind of making fun a little bit and
having some fun and I a while but when I
turned 30 I released a video talking
about the top five things I would tell
my younger self and one of the things is
that it's okay to be be okay with
yourself and sometimes that just means
that you can laugh at yourself sometimes
that can mean that you can throw
yourself out throw yourself out there
and be willing to fail and be willing to
you know just sort of make a fool of
yourself at times and I would encourage
you to embrace that a little bit more a
lot of us especially with social media
where we're only posting the good things
right you know no one's posting videos
of their you know people are posted in
photos and videos of their nice cars
they don't then post the video of the
you know when it gets towed away because
you can't pay the bills on it right so
what I encourage you to is not
necessarily gear car towed but I would I
would encourage you to be willing to
laugh at yourself and be willing to
accept yourself a little bit and of
course work hard because hopefully then
you won't get your car towed I don't
know where I'm going with this I
appreciate you all don't forget to

shirt that you can go and treat yourself
to the bro do you even go shirt and
maybe just maybe rumor on the street is
that don't long might have his bro do
