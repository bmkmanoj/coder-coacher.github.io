back in angularjs and codecademy we're
in unit 3 here services I just got done
doing it it's a very fun little
interesting course and I just little
heads up a little bit of an outro or
outtake of this course if you go past
the outer of the video you'll see it but
with that being said let's go ahead and
jump right in so what the service the
service is basically like an API call at
least in what we be doing here you'll
see that we're using some sort of
forecast JSON here but just think of it
if you're familiar with the open weather
api something similar so in the browser
to the right let's go ahead and visit
our JSON object here so you'll see that
it takes in so it has some data and then
it has an array of data that is for each
day of the week it looks like so you'll
see they already have a set up here with
a get call this is just a standard
angular get call for like your api's you
pass in a URL and then on success you
run a function that does some stuff and
then on on failure or on air you do run
a function that does some stuff so let's
go ahead and jump into index.html and in
here we are going to include a new and
here we're going to go ahead and include
this forecast jas which looks like we
already it already did it right here so
you'll see we have a script it's our
service it's being called at the bottom
here and then in our main modify main
controller by passing in so let's go to
our controller we have main controller
like so and what we excuse me we have to
go into the
forecaster so here's our appt factory
and then in our main controller we want
to go ahead and pass in in the
controller let's go ahead and pull this
up again I wish you just have all these
things open makes my life a little bit
more vedic so you'll see right here
we're passing in scope we're also
passing in forecast and we're passing in
a function so we have like so you didn't
reset this properly that's what's going
on here there we go and then we passed
that in so basically in the controller
now you can have the controller in the
app typically that's what I do because
I'm not making large applications but
you're basically seen in the controller
here let's go ahead and add that back
for some reason to detect that so we're
basically saying a scope here equal to
our data and the forecast success now
what is forecast just something we're
going to be using later on the gist of
this you should kind of already be
familiar with the main controller and
the app at this point but let's go ahead
and just kind of go on to the next
section and we can kind of review how ap
is work and what we're trying to do with
in API that's really the point of this
section at the end of the day so inside
forecast we have the get if you remember
that's basically right here so let's go
ahead and view this and I'm actually
going to put this in a new window real
quick and make it nice and big so are
going to see it so you'll see here that
we're getting some a JSON data back and
i'm using a a json format or so if it
doesn't come out this beautiful for you
go ahead and just google json format or
extension and it will make a lot your
life a lot easier so it's taking a date
an icon and a high temp in the low town
but it's basically just data as we can
see here so what do we want to do we
want to jump into our index dot HTML or
outputting this data
and we have a there goes cuz it wasn't
loading I was like no that's not right
and for some reason I have this kind of
entry set this at all this is really I
apologize guys so I'm just going to
delete this as we go along here so you
can kind of see what's going on
unfortunately it didn't reset what I
wanted to do so we'll just go piece by
piece and delete it I do try to do this
beforehand so everyone see so we have
our class here called forecast and then
ng-repeat remember will iterate through
all the values in an array and so the
day in five days and if you remember
from our thing here five day would be
our data and days days would be the
array so we're going to iterate through
all the all the data in the day's array
so what do we want to output we just
want to output the the four parameters
here so first we're going to go ahead
and do the we'll just do the date-time
wow they didn't they didn't set this up
at all all my stuff yeah it goes
datetime icon high and the low why they
sorry guys this this kind of its thrown
me for a loop because it's completely
different than what I did like two
minutes ago but yeah so we're going to
take day in five days day and we want to
go ahead and just get the date-time no
no upper case and then we want to do the
same thing here except we want to do an
image when we do an image we're going to
have to use the angular property or
energy source we're just going to go
ahead and pass in I can type correctly
day dot icon
I forget if you have to have closing
tags and angular I know you do and react
I don't think you have to in angular
we'll just go ahead and put that in
there from my personal preference and
then we'll have something here that will
be day excuse me this is going to be the
high day dot dot hi and then we'll do
the day dot low we're basically just
targeting the data now if you're you're
confused this is essentially the data
dot day and then the array whatever
current item were iterating on dot low
so let's say it's the first one this is
our data this is this would be days
excuse me days this would be days and
then the current one that we're
iterating on I would be this and then
low would be this so just just so clear
that up if you're still a little bit
confused some people for some reason
I've issue kind understanding the flow
of it but here we go there and then um
it wants us to also use the date filter
so if you're not familiar with like
filters in in cook on let's go ahead and
pull it up real quick so you can see a
date angular filter we're just going to
use it the default version which is
going to do the bulk of what we need to
do but there's tons of stuff that you
can do when it comes to this so the date
filter will allow us to format our dates
without having do any complex stuff so
we have all these other parameters like
oh man maybe want a year you're like
this one year our weekday so tons of
great stuff and you denote it by this
brackets the variable and then this us
straight slash and then date and then if
you want to format it a certain way you
would then do it like that so just
something to keep in mind we're just
going to be doing it like so and this
was her date time so we're just gonna do
a simple / and then date let's go ahead
and run that
and then once that's runs we'll go ahead
and jump back into here and we can see
our localhost 8080 right here nice and
clean I'm a little hard to see on that
background I should've made the font
white or anything but that was our
services what you really need to kind of
take away from that is being able just
kind of familiarize yourself with how
services doing get calls HTTP GET like
so and but if you've done API calls
before it really shouldn't be a problem
up next we are going to be doing routing
so I'll see you guys in the next video
