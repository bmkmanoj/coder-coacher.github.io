little bit of a controversial topic
which I tend to stay away from but it's
been highly requested and it's kind of
relevant to what's going on in my life
so we're gonna talk about should you go
to college at the same time should you
drop out of college we're gonna sort of
sway some of the pros and the cons and
which video that I've struggled about
making I've thought about I finally
decided to make it assume in this video
gets released so let's go ahead and talk
about it while you're out there trying
to figure out what path is right for you
might I recommend dev Mountain coding
boot camp they're teaching web
development iOS development Salesforce
Quality Assurance and more they're one
of the only boot camps if not the only
boot camp that I'm aware of that
includes housing along with their
tuition which is really cool you can
check them out Deb Mount comm to get
started and get more information I want
to sort of preface this video and it is
my opinion for the most part but we're
gonna be talking about something it's
like sort of consider facts but a lot of
times whenever you talk about college
traditional education a lot of people
are very cult-like
in their mentalities they're not very
flexible they don't want to hear other
arguments and I have no doubt that the
the comments section of this video will
will be filled like that that's okay I
encourage people to expand their minds a
little bit be open to the different
solutions for different people I mean it
was just even when I when I dropped out
of college for the second time so I'm an
expert all right let me tell you know I
love that dropping out maybe not about
college but um I I get emails on
occasion from people just last week I
got an email someone emailed me to
solicit unsolicited advice about how
dropping a college is the worst mistake
I'm ever gonna make and all this stuff
so it is something people that we've
sort of have it ingrained in our minds
to such a degree that it's kind of
strange
you know it's just an article yesterday
came out about how one-third of college
students don't have a place to sleep and
one-third of college students don't have
enough to eat
and yet they're still going to college
instead of maybe getting their life
together in an aspect that would help
them in the immediate so it's it's a
it's a strange world where we have
students struggling to find a place a
bed and a meal and so something
obviously needs to change but that's for
a separate video let's talk about should
you know what are the benefits ago in
college and I'll talk about should you
drop out and why I did and why it was a
good decision for me and maybe it was a
good decision for you
so college is a strange beast because
you know the average grad in 2018 is
graduating with like 37 or 38 thousand a
debt will just say $40,000 in debt I was
taking them five years on average and so
let's say you're somewhere between four
to six years if you're killing it
for years you come at six years if
you're kind of a you know kicking back
so it's quite a big time investment not
everyone goes for a high pain degree
either high paying degrees being you
know there's a there's a couple but you
know in our case for the you know
software computer science there's some
business degrees that pay well well
there's about two-thirds of degrees that
don't pay very well you know English is
one of them right my girlfriend is an
English major she had a full scholarship
so luckily she she didn't have any debt
when she graduated but I could tell you
that you know as an English major when
you're getting started and for a very
long time if you were to have $40,000 in
debt you are going to have a very hard
time paying that off an almost comical
amount of time you know you might just
default by you know there are programs
set up in the degree program where if
you make the minimum payments for like
10 or 15 years and you still don't have
it paid off based off what your salary
is is how the
payments to find they'll just say
alright you paid us for a decade that
we'll call it a wash it that's
indentured servitude at the end of the
day and that's kind of scary
and a lot of people go and get degrees
like that and you know God knows I've
met so many software developers who you
know they went and they got a liberal
arts a very a very liberal arts degree
and to their surprise the rules that
were there were no better than you know
$12 an hour rolls where you know you
could have just worked six months at a
job and got something like that and they
transitioned into something else
after I've spending you know many years
in school so-called college is strange
in that fact but it does have some great
benefits the hardest part of being a
software engineer or aspiring software
engineer when you're just getting
started and don't have any relevant work
experience is scaling that HR firewall
right just like blues there's good
nutrition it's like about the skills of
China and they charge like yeah here you
ain't got no degree we're like your kind
right so the college aspect really helps
you scale that that wall and very very
well so very much so to get that first
real job now are there other ways to
scale the wall absolutely but for a lot
of people college is the the only way
and it's so ingrained in our society
that even now I did a video when I
turned 30 you know about six months back
about the what I would tell my younger
self
and one of my points was to be more
accepting of who you are and even even
saying that I then went back to college
which I knew I wasn't going to enjoy or
like and that wasn't for me because it
is so engrained in me and even sort of
trying to be as self aware as possible
so
but we're getting off track here so
college is great to scale at HR firewall
it also is great to give you a learning
path even if you know every college is
slightly different but even if the
majority of colleges I would say are
teaching you know the fundamentals but
what they're really not teaching are
things that you need for the workplace
you know and and it's it's kind of it's
kind of a strange thing where we are
having college grads graduate that are
not ready for a job
which doesn't make a whole lot of sense
to me but you know as I don't know I
always assumed caught you went to
college to get a job a good job but you
don't come out with the skills for the
job so but the the one main benefit you
do pick up some sort of logical skills
just by thinking you'll have a piece of
paper that says hey I'm a decent human
being
hire me to n HR so yeah we respect
decent human beings we will hire you or
at least consider you and then $40,000 a
debt so it's quite it's quite that's
really how I see college now why might
you not want to take that $40,000 a dead
just really really something to talk
about how to overcome that and why you
should drop out of college and why you
shouldn't and just because this is a
life-changing decision even though I
don't think this needs to be said if you
are considering dropping out of college
mind I just recommend that you do your
own research and not just say hey here's
this youtuber who is a software engineer
he's doing all right for himself he
ain't got no education at least no
degree anyhow and just go based off that
I encourage you because at the end of
day you are the one who has to live with
your choices you're the one who has to
you know walk in your own shoes so
please don't just watch this one video
tomorrow drop out of college
and then just think you're gonna hit the
ground running people who should stay in
college are the people who can't handle
freedom what I mean by that is there's a
lot that goes along with going to
college college also offers a very
structured learning path and structure
it just offers structure really and we
can debate whether that learning path is
good bad but does offer you a learning
path and it does offer you structure
where you need to be in this chair at
this time for this amount hours and then
you're going to need to prepare for this
test on this subject so it's very
structure which is which is good for
some people because when you get freedom
that's really what it is is when you're
on the self-taught you have the freedom
to choose your own materials choose what
hours you're doing what and when and how
you're going to progress and a lot of
people so I don't know if it's a
maturity thing or personality thing
that's that's for a separate video but a
lot of people when you give them that
freedom right when you give them that
sort of hey no one's going to make sure
that you study today no one's gonna make
sure that you are one step closer to
becoming a developer they they crumble
they fail and they you know they might
just sit on the couch playing xbox all
day so I'll study tomorrow start hitting
the bong all day and get to it tomorrow
right and it's it's one of those things
where it's not it it's not a that
freedom it's not something a lot of
people can thrive in and it's the harder
part of being a self-taught developer
but if you can you might be more
successful in the long term now it is
it is hard for me to let me just tell
you why I dropped out of college and
then maybe you should you'll decide if
you should as well I dropped out of
college because I was sick of being
broken hungry and I wanted to work a job
and I wanted to code and the computer
science program had very little coding
in it College made me really depressed
really miserable just an awful awful
time so that's why I dropped out of
college and I did so with a plan and
this is what I really want to emphasize
if you're considering dropping out of
college and and going a different route
is no plan is a shitty plan at best as
John likes to say and in this book when
I when I knew that that I was going that
it was a real possibility that I you
know what I I don't know how much longer
I can actually do this I devised the
plan my plan was pretty simple
get an internship you know doesn't
matter how far away it is or whatever
it's ended being two hours away got each
way you know making $12 an hour from
there get a relevant job drop out of
college that was basically it continue
working on the YouTube every day work on
the skill set so that I could have the
skills ready and once I got a job that
could pay my bills
I dropped at college that was my plan
and then from there on continuing
working on those skills and I think what
was mote and I I the reason I bring up
the freedom and being able to focus and
all that sort of stuff is I wasn't
always one of those people where I could
sit down alright Saturday after work you
know it's right now it's 7:50 in the
morning of filming this video right
every morning I work on my YouTube for
about an hour and a half or coding or
you know hour and a half of personal
development in some direction I was
always one of those people when I
dropped out of college I had no choice
but to be one of those people because
I'm paying my rent I am working a job
that even as a even working ass off
we're coming I still wasn't a developer
I wasn't where I wanted to be so I had
to I forced it basically I put myself in
a situation where I had hit my rock
bottom in life and I said look I gotta
go up from here I'm going any farther
and also I put myself in a situation
where there's no going back
that's it I dropped out there's no
there's no other path to take other than
hard work because God knows we've
already been broke and we've already
been hungry and sleeping on couches I
don't go back to that and so if you're
at the point where you are so miserable
going to school everyday and you are so
miserable you know taking on tens of
thousands of dollars a debt or that idea
alone is something you say that I
don't take 40 grand a debt it might be
for you it really might be ant but I
want to preface all that with have a
plan you say okay Dylan look I don't
want to go do a computer science degree
I just don't want to spend 4 years I
think the amount of time that I can earn
the amount of income I can earn even if
I start slow in 4 years along with not
taking on debt and working internships
and getting my way up I have a plan to
accomplish that if you have a plan and
you can work towards that to achieve
that I would highly recommend going that
route over a traditional education and
part of the reason is that the amount of
income you would lose over four years
would to a degree will probably weigh
itself out but also four years from now
so you drop out today and you actually
start executing your plan four years
from now you might be in a position
where you can go back to school and not
take out any debt you know like even
though I was just in for one semester
it was $3500 here I'm and right now I
lost $3,500 to go back to school but I
don't have I don't have any debt that
was the only reason I was able to pay
for that out of pocket was because I
have experience and I'm working as a
software developer if I was a student
going back after thirty five hundred
dollars in debt that's gonna carry with
me until I pay it off and thirty five
hundred dollars of debt when you make
eight dollars and now
or is a ridiculous amount of death is a
very large amount of debt that is gonna
beginning chipped away like it's a
mountain for quite some time but you do
have that option down the road and you
might even consider not going the
self-taught route because it's hard it's
it's it's it is hard and I've had people
really say Dylan do you really think
being a self-taught developer is harder
than going to college and I'd say for
for people like me at very at least it
is where I don't like learning things
that aren't relevant
I don't like learning the memorization
is not a something that I think is a is
a good skill memorization is the ability
to essentially be a parrot and being
able to figure things out logic that's
what I enjoy and unfortunately the
schooling system at least in my point of
view is teaching outdated things and
really it's just a example of how well
can you memorize and pass a test which
is an unfortunate thing but so if you
are considering dropping out I'm not
going to tell you whether you should or
shouldn't really at the end day I just
want you to know that it can be a
consideration but if it is something
you're thinking about please do have a
plan have a one-year plan and if three
months in you find that you don't have
the you don't have the self-control the
maturity the the will to when you wake
up every day all right cool
let's have for our coding session I have
some lunch cool come back have another
four hours coding session you know when
I was working a job I wake up an hour to
an hour before work come home to two to
three hours of code on the weekends I do
about eight to twelve every day on
Saturday and Sunday so I did that until
I got a developer job if you don't have
that type of self control where you're
gonna go to meetups you're gonna do
courses you're gonna you know build
projects even though you have a job even
though you have children this the the
dropping a college thing may be a very
bad idea now if you do think that you
can do that create a plan create
routine you know find a way to be
consistent with your learning and
understand what is you're gonna learn
and three months in if you find that
even though you thought you could do it
you couldn't consider going back to
college consider doing that if you
really enjoy it because you may need
someone to help you scale that HR
firewall and even if take on the debt to
do it is something consider so that's
sort of my thoughts about whether you
should or shouldn't drop out of college
and whether college is a good thing we
talked about law stuff today on this
video so I tried to give you the best
objective opinion of it as I can being a
two time college dropout that's gonna be
your boy ever writes a book it's gonna
be engineer or a developer sometimes
people get weird cuz I call engineer
because I don't have an engineering
degree every job tile ever has an
engineer but yeah so we'll say developer
youtuber author to time college shop
around the book it'll be good
but anyhow guys I hope you enjoyed the
video don't forget to comment like
subscribe share support me on patreon
and I encourage you to share your
thoughts about this this subject I know
this is something people are very
passionate about and I struggled for a
very long time considering if I should
even do this topic because it is a major
life decision it is something that
people don't talk about enough right is
it hard being a self-taught developer
yes but it's a it's also very hard to go
to college for some of us so not because
the classes are hard but because of the
structure and the way things are but um
that's my that's my two cents let me
know what you think in the comments
below see you next time bye
