part 5 I think of the Wikipedia API
search so we're gonna add some new
functionality to things really the first
thing when we search we want our word
right here to go away and when we search
we want Melissa typing world we want our
enter see it's not it's not working
we want our enter to run the search cool
so there's a couple things that we can
do first what we want to do let's go
ahead and reset that word now the best
way to do that in my opinion is just
target the value of this right here and
then set it to an empty value so after
it runs the for loop we're gonna go
ahead and reset this right here by just
targeting our search term search term is
the ID for the form control for the
input class rather so let's go ahead and
do that hashtag is ID search term and
then we're gonna set the value to be
empty cool so now when we do our search
let's go ahead and submit it it's gonna
still display everything but it's gonna
empty out the box nice okay what else
can we do so that's our first part next
what we want to do is actually just make
it so that whenever you hit enter
regarde whatever is in the search bar
it's gonna search for that that is kind
of the we can do is enter or we can do
it as the target the ID so we'll
actually do it the proper way to target
the ID completely so we'll do it like so
then go look
when our ID win this right here is
entered to sit within it like so so
let's go ahead and say search term and
when we press a key in this case we're
pressing the enter key run this function
pass in the key that we pressed and if
that key eat out which that's just our
key that we're passing in is equal to 13
go ahead and run search dot click so
search is our submit button right here
so we're basically just saying look go
ahead and run what would be in there run
search click save it and so let's go
ahead and type in world hit enter and
that didn't work hmm works there let's
try this one more time this anybody hit
enter hard enough so type in world
submit yeah we hit world here type in
hello interesting so it's not running on
the first the first iteration but oh I
see what's going on make sure you put
this in the right scope so we actually
want it outside of our Ajax scope so
when we do it here we hit enter hello
and there it goes
so I sorry about that guys don't forget
your semicolon but so again we're just
resetting the value so it clink clears
it and then outside of the Ajax call
we're just setting it up we're look when
you when you're in here and you hit
Enter it does some stuff so the reason
that we're targeting search term is
because we don't want you to be able to
hit enter anywhere else and nothing get
displayed so
I hope you guys found this helpful just
another two little quick features for
your Wikipedia API search as always
