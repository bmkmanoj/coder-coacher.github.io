camp we are working on those basic
algorithm scripting bonfire where do I
belong is what we're doing right now I
just did it real quick and it's it's
pretty simple when you look at it for
the first time so what are we what are
we trying to do is we take in a number
50 and we're saying how many numbers is
this bigger than the other number so in
this case it would return one so what we
want to do is we just want to create a
simple count variable and we'll set it
equal to zero
don't forget your semicolon and then
we're going to do a for loop so the
count is to keep track of how many
numbers are actually smaller than the
know it how many numbers in the array
smaller than the number provided so
create the for loop create our far I and
we're gonna set it at zero because we
started the zero index point and we're
saying Y is less than the array the
length of the array increased by one
iterate through the array so all we want
to do is put an if statement here that
says if the array index value in this
let's say it starts 40 at zero position
is less than whatever provide a number
is we want to our excuse me - so - that
number is less than zero meaning if it's
a smaller number because they would
return at a negative number all we want
to do is set count equals account plus 1
and then when we were run it oops
and here we return count and now when we
run it we're good to go so let's put in
some comments real quick so although
there's only ten lines
it always helps to put comments in it's
one of the best things you can do when
you're just learning in program so count
is equal to zero so this is our
counter variable for results let's look
if you think about whatever and this is
more for this statement if it if
subtraction if array value minus number
returns negative it is less than zero it
is a smaller number and that's all we
really need to put here that was pretty
much it for this one it's not it's not
too bad it's going to share the news of
our grand endeavor and I'll see you I
hope I hope you guys found this helpful
and they do recommend using sort it it
out and this just seemed to be simpler
for me so use what works for you and
what you understand but also check out
the documentation and as always
questions comments concerns anything
constructive always appreciated don't
forget to Like and subscribe that really
helps the channel I'll see you guys next
time thanks for watching the video don't
forget to Like and subscribe that helps
me out a ton and I appreciate all the
comments that I get and all the
questions I get in the comments and I'm
happy to answer them so keep them coming
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
