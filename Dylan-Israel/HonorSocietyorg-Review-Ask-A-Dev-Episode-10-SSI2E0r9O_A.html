mind introducing yourself in your role
at Honor Society org hey I'm Mike
morodian I'm the executive director of
Honor Society org
nice now what can you what what exactly
is honor society org I know this may be
something new for some people I I have
yet to hear of it until I looked at it
but it seems great well that's a great
question so honor society Oregon's one
of the leading honor societies and it's
not only for students but for anyone
who's looking to kind of grow and to
build a platform success we we mainly
focus in the areas of academics
leadership and networking and so
basically this is a platform to help you
as an individual connect with other
like-minded people who want to go
further so basically it's a big online
community as well as regional and
college chapters where people can meet
up in person or connect online and you
know we have a lot of similar attributes
so people who want to grow people who
want to succeed and you know what we do
to enable that as a society is we have
some exclusive benefits for our members
scholarship opportunities we have member
trips we've gone to Los Angeles and
Washington DC recently on member trips
and besides that we also have the
community networking and of course the
recognition of being a member now you
said that there's a lot of networking
stuff now with this with someone who
maybe doesn't have a college education
but has maybe they've done boot camp or
there self-taught they'd still find
value in being a member of Honor Society
org definitely you know we've seen
non-traditional students be one of our
most beneficial areas and that's because
you know non-traditional students don't
have the same opportunities as a student
on campus may and really what this one
and enables that student to do is to
kind of plug
into the network that they may have
missed out on on a traditional campus
and to kind of build that Network you
know kind of organically but outside of
the actual brick-and-mortar University
experience and so we've we found that
you know non-traditional students are
excelling in our program and they're
they're actively seeking out a lot of
these benefits and opportunities that we
offer so I think you know boot camp our
non-traditional students is an
exceptional fit I I like that a lot
because I feel like there's a very large
gap for students like that who are maybe
self taught or just trying you know
networking is probably the best thing
you can do when you're trying to get
that entry-level experiences hey I have
this friend he's really great can you
interview him and as long as you're you
know a somewhat decent candidate you're
probably gonna get the job so it's it's
a great it's great that on our site uh
org provides that I it's I can't
encourage people enough to take
advantage of it definitely I mean you
know knowing people and knowing a
community it means just so much because
as you said it's it's just that foot in
the door and finding like-minded people
who may be one step ahead or one step
more progress in their career that can
open up doors for you and so you know
one of the things we seek to do is to
really kind of open those doors or try
to at least minimize the friction so
make it easier to connect with these
type of individuals now what does one
have to do to become an honorary Society
that organ umber so the Honor Society
membership is very straightforward we
look to recognize students in the
student category who have maintained
certain GPA levels with the levels being
three to three five or three eight for
honors high honors or highest honors
respectively but it's important to note
that we are an inclusive society so we
do not prohibit people from joining as
students or not students if they don't
meet those factors and the reason being
is because you know we
that there's so much value in our
services that you know we don't want to
preclude people who could use it the
most which is people who kind of need
the opportunity or need kind of
framework for success and so we kind of
use it as antithetical to our mission
which is to helping individuals succeed
and so with that in mind we brought end
up kind of our mission and agenda to let
anybody in who demonstrates that
themselves that they want to be a member
and what that means is that you're
proactive yourself and you want these
opportunities so yeah that's that's how
one goes about becoming a member I like
that because I often find that the
people who maybe have fallen down before
and are bringing themselves back up
those are the people who are determined
on a very good level not saying anyone
who's obviously has high GPA and stuff
but kind of when you've hit that rock
bottom and you're ready to get your life
together it's a great candidate
sometimes because they know how bad it
can get and now they're very serious
about life so I like that you have an
open-door policy of those people yeah
the last thing you want to do is
preclude people who are interested in
growing because as you said you know
life can take you down certain paths and
you don't want to make it harder on
somebody who maybe didn't seize the
opportunity or wasn't eligible before
you know we're moving towards a more
inclusive community and more inclusive
society in general and so part of that
is being is you know kind of opening the
doors to letting people join and you
know that's something that we're really
proud of because traditionally honor
societies are very you know precluding
other people and trying to kind of set
up walls for entry but we really just
want to be open to allow those who are
interested to seek out our opportunities
nice see here just going through though
the website real quick when I see
benefits there's a job search
now now one of the things that I was
really impressed by with the Honor
Society dork was that you the the
organization as a whole has seemed to
take quite a emphasis in social media
was that a like a thought out strategy
that's that kind of naturally happened
yeah well you know we have such a big
following and because we're a tech and
able community we're really doing things
on web 2.0 Way or kind of things that
other honor societies never really
visualized because they were built a
hundred years ago or two hundred years
ago and so what we're doing is we're
consciously going about and connecting
people through our Facebook page which
has over 1.2 million likes our twitter
is a you know very important channel to
us but also Instagram and never to be
underestimated is LinkedIn because
LinkedIn is a professional networking
platform so we have a community and a
group there just for our members and we
posts content and it's it's great
because you can then show off that
you're a member on your LinkedIn profile
so yeah I mean we take you know our web
presence is very seriously as something
that's a value add for our members and
you know we love interacting with people
on those so just find us you know add on
our society org or our handle on each
respective social network and feel free
to start conversation with us there yeah
and I that's one of the things I preach
about coding is kind of putting yourself
in a situation to be with like-minded
individuals whether it be Facebook
coding groups or going to meetups and
having a good social media presence
where you're you know you got 1.2
million people who are all trying to
better themselves and better their lives
it really keeps you focus and it keeps
you motivated and I'm glad that the
social media game is that all-time high
like that's that's something that like
you're talking about maybe older honor
societies maybe be a little bit behind
the curve on that
it's unfortunate yeah I mean you know at
the end of the day you know we it
behooves us as a society and our members
to take advantage of the opportunities
that today offers and so that's why so
much of an emphasis is placed on our
online presence I mean even Honor
Society org it's in our name you know
it's it's just that integral to our so
we are as a society and you know we view
technology I mean as a game changer it
hasn't in almost every environment from
commerce to education and we view that
building a you know a membership group
and a society to help people succeed is
no different you know it should be
available online 24/7 and empowering
individuals out their own time and pace
so yeah we're really proud to be kind of
on the leading edge for honor societies
in the online space so what I see that
you have a section here to start a
chapter what does that entail when
starting a chapter that's a great
question so starting a chapter is a way
for our members who have joined who may
not have a chapter at their university
or region to reach out to our chapter
development team and to kind of
proactively get the ball rolling say hey
you know I'm here I I want to be a
leader connect me with you know the
information and the different you know
things needed in order to put a chapter
together so we have a chapter
development team and they reply to
everyone's questions and you know we're
really just focused on building out the
offline graph as well so to complement
our online presences it only goes so far
it's the offline as well that enables
the social networking and so we have
about 25 active chapters right now and
you know we're actively looking to grow
that so if you're or you or your friends
are interested feel free to reach out to
our chapter with development team and
get the ball rolling
yeah and uh you know obviously most of
people were talking about our students
and it seems like you have quite a few
benefits maybe help their their cost I
see a lot of health discount plans
restaurant discounts a lot of great
benefits any ones that really stand out
that you think a lot of people will
appreciate well I think you mentioned a
couple of the great ones but one of the
most overlooked benefits that doesn't
necessarily hit the tip of the tongue
but I think is among the best is our
vault career guides so vault comm is
kind of the leader in career and company
resource and information what they've
done is kind of created 8,000 profiles
that are up to date on companies giving
you the edge on what they're looking for
what their culture is like and you know
a whole different set of information as
well as about 500 different industry
profiles and it's extremely useful
information so when I was a student
graduating college I actually used vault
and it helped me land my first job which
was at KPMG accounting finance company
and I know firsthand that vault career
guides can help you and you know we're
very proud to kind of offer an exclusive
license where our members can access
vault career insider for free or for no
additional costs you know it's it's a
benefit that you know can cost up to a
thousand dollars if you buy an
individual license but rolled into our
greater package we were able to
negotiate you know a fair rate for all
of our members have access to this tool
so it's kind of like a Netflix for
finding jobs and job information if you
will that that's really something I'm
glad you brought that up because I
didn't know that and this is something I
suggest people when they're looking for
jobs to always do research about a
company because forget about the money
for a second like that's very important
but the culture of a company where
you're gonna feel like you belong and is
a positive company because there are
negative companies out there and you
need to
know not to take a job at that point
even better if you see a good company
you need to jump in head over heels for
it so I'm glad that you have all
available for you know well not only
that but you know an interesting second
point to that is the fact that you know
really competitive companies and really
competitive jobs you know they screen
candidates very rigorously and showing
that you've done your research and you
know about their culture you know about
their history you know you know kind of
just you should you shown that you care
basically when you're able to bring up
things about their company as a
candidate and you know that helped me
firsthand as a interviewee
so I know it helps it definitely you
know made me stand out when I was
showing that I cared enough to research
a company and so I think you know that's
an another you know benefit is the fact
that you can easily digest information
on a you know easily kind of a profile
and kind of use that information to your
advantage to to shine and to show that
you you really care about your career
path that company and growing with that
company so I think it's great it's it's
it's very powerful to have maybe just
three facts about a company that when
they ask you the standard question why
do you want to work here and your answer
isn't well I just need a paycheck like
you you want to get have something well
you know in 2010 when you guys decided
to go in this direction I thought that
was really cool when I was doing my
research and that in itself you're
already in the top 10 percent of
candidates because you've shown the
initiative you've shown like okay let's
let's move this guy to the top because I
like him I like that he is interested
enough in us that he actually wants to
work here and just isn't looking for a
paycheck
exactly you show you care and then goes
a long way you also have a Scott this is
so I keep on going over on society
there's just so much great stuff from
the vault the benefits but there's a lot
of scholarships I do do a lot of Honor
Society how does how does the typical
Honors Society or member get a
scholarship do they
why and what's the process like that's a
great question so we have eight
scholarships that are offered
exclusively to our members and basically
you know it's there's a form an
application for our members to fill out
and we have a scholarship committee that
reviews each and every one by a rubric
ranks them and you know gets back to the
recipients and it's something that you
know is a big part of our mission we
recently you know awarded $50,000 in
scholarships and you can see the
recipients for each scholarship on the
respective scholarship page or kind of
on the map by University and kind of
play around and see you know who might
might have been a recipient at your
university or near you so you know
investing in our it members and their
education means a lot to us as a society
that's geared towards academic success
and so scholarships is just one facet
that we like to invest in we like to
give back to our members with now do
those scholarships are they are they
exclusive to traditional colleges or say
we have a software individual who's
interested in perhaps going to a boot
camp would that be something that a
scholarship might help them with so I
think it is possible I I'm not sure that
we've awarded a boot camp scholarship to
date but we do work with one or two boot
camps if you look on our benefits
section actually and so we do have
discounts and kind of an a foot in the
door for people interested in boot camps
you know through our benefits section
but I would definitely encourage anyone
interested to apply and it really comes
down to the scholarship committee and
the rubric that they use for each and
it's generally listed on each specific
scholarship so it's rarely be able to
see which ones you may be eligible for
nice and if not a lot of colleges now
are actually doing their own boot camps
which is very enter
seeing usually about a length of six
months so hopefully hopefully that would
be another option for potential students
as well see so uh I see that you guys
have a very great network with LinkedIn
and career edge which I'm not familiar
with what is what is courage
well career edge is kind the name that
we gave the career insider tool so it
goes back to the vault career guide
we also lump together our job search
tool you know we have a job search tool
that basically connects members to
listings from across the internet so
monster simply hired indeed aggregates
all of these plus our proprietary
positions that we have received through
other companies and list them all in one
place and so all of these together are
the career edge gotcha now I you also
have a internship opportunities with
Zappos is that is that a common thing
usually partner up with some of these
larger companies for internships that's
a great question so yeah as a post has
been one of our very successful
internship opportunities it's a paid
internship a summer long paid internship
with corporate housing provided and you
know they're a company that kind of
embodies our core values and someone who
we respect a lot and so when we were
searching and seeking out partners it
may natural sense to seek and work with
them so Zappos is kind of a great
partner they exemplify our Honor Society
core values and yes we you know we are
building out more and more company
relationships just like that to kind of
directly connect our members to the
company so you know basically skipping
through the process and and getting you
as a member in front of the hiring
recruiter as quickly and seamlessly as
possible so that's you know one of our
main goals as well what's the
application process so that's a great
question and an important question so
like any honor society or fraternity
there is a duce and the dues to being a
member are $50.00 it's only every six
months so it's kind of set up to be like
a semester type fee but you know it's
roughly equates about nine dollars a
month or you know half the cost of one
textbook if you want put in academic
terms no cost I got like one-fourth the
cost yeah and so you know the main thing
though is that we we want the deuce to
feel like the members immediately
getting back like double or triple the
value so it should feel you know like
fifty dollars as a bargain and so every
day we're working on making our society
better adding more benefits adding more
you know career tools that really makes
it feel like a bargain yeah one hundred
dollars a year for something such a
large network to get people involved and
all these resources is a really great
value yeah and you know it's a it's a
you know portfolio of items that's
always getting bigger and better and so
I think when you look look over time
you'll see that you know in six months
we'll be talking about how much of a
even better deal it is just because
that's the nature of growing you know we
as a society are focusing on growing and
adding more value to our members as well
and so we're really excited about
everything we have coming down the
pipeline as well hey guys thanks for
