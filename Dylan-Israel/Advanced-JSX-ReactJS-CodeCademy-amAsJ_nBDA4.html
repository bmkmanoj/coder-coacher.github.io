in introduction to react to s part 1 on
code Academy doing advanced J s JSX so
let's jump right in I just got done
doing it so I'm pretty fresh with it
it's pretty straightforward I'll try to
make it as simple as possible
then I reset this alright so I think
this first one didn't get reset the
other estimation
basically what it's saying here is that
the class the class is reserved in
JavaScript so when you're naming an HTML
element in our JSX
to give it a class you're gonna actually
need to call it class name that's
basically all that's going on here so
let's go ahead and create a variable
called zoom in a little bit so create a
variable called my div and we're gonna
set it equal to a div except instead of
class we're gonna give it a class name
equal to what was it big just gonna run
that oh and don't forget to put I am a
big div as the text as well in all caps
run that one more time and of course
because we need to render this as well
we're gonna need to go ahead and do
react react Dom da render and in here we
pass in two parameters we're gonna pass
in the basically the changes or the
application in this case it's going to
be my div and then we're gonna pass in
the location we want those changes go to
which is going to be document dot get
element by ID app now before we move on
I'm just gonna go ahead and jump in the
other files so that you can see what's
going on here so in our index.html here
is where we're changing it the app and
if we were to go into styles that CSS
you'll see the class big here and that's
all that we're doing so it is targeting
stuff in other files let's go ahead and
run that and should work just fine so
now you see I am a big dip right here
for some reason that is not being
declared properly so maybe I last name
is equal to big that's working I am a
big div that's it oh let's go ahead and
do this like this I have an issue
earlier you guys may as well wear it
kind of likes us to do things on one in
multiple lines
so uh this is still in beta so some of
this stuff is a little weird what's
gonna zoom out see if that's it as well
alright sit still in like the
pre-release after my div make sure you
start a line I'm not sure what's going
on so we'll go ahead and get the code
here uh-oh I think maybe I forgot this a
semicolon right there sorry about that
guys it's gonna move along ok so what's
going on on self closing tags in html5
uuhh the tags that are self closing self
closing like this you don't actually
have to put in the the self closing tags
however when dealing with JSX it is
required so image tags would be an
example BR tags the line breaks are also
all examples of things that we're going
to have to do when we're using JSX so
you're gonna have to make sure to self
close these as well
alright oops it looks like it didn't
reset them like they were all supposed
to for whatever reason I don't know if
they're cashed or whatnot
let's go ahead and we'll get rid of this
and we'll start fresh so um so react on
what it's basically saying here is when
we output some HTML as you would
normally expect the expression to
evaluate itself it's actually going to
output it as a string so when we render
it we'll go ahead and show that right
now when you're rendering h1 2 + 3 in
JavaScript normally you would expect
that to output 5 but because of the way
that we're using JSX it's going to
actually just output it 2 + 3 as a
string well showcase that right now so
when we run this we're gonna get 2 + 3
this is a hold value so any second now
so there we go right there so you'll see
we got two plus three now this may not
necessarily be what we're trying to do
so when we go if we wanted to actually
treat it as an expression we would just
wrap it in some curly braces like so and
this is how you'll actually treat
variables as well when you're trying to
output a variable such as like I I did I
don't know it'll come up in a second but
I'll put the value of a variable instead
of like a string of that variable name
so we're having an example here it's
basically just showing us that you know
we can use the math library as well so
let's go ahead and jump into app KS and
we'll get rid of this and what we're
gonna want to do here is declare a new
variable called math and we're gonna set
it equal to a JSX variable that takes in
an h1 now we want to put the following
in our JSX two plus three is equal to
two plus three now this is just gonna
output this as a string which is not
what we're gonna want to do make sure
you put a semicolon at the end as well
what's this continuous running there we
go oh it's not it's not gonna put
anything right now because we haven't
rendering it out but let's go ahead and
do that right now and you'll see that it
will render out to a string of exactly
what we have so we're gonna render out
the app which is our math variable right
now and then the location which is
document dot get element by ID app now
keep in mind that this could be anything
doesn't necessarily have to be named app
it's just kind of that to be intuitive
this could even be class or whatever but
typically it seems like this is a normal
way of going about it so if you have two
plus three is equal to plus three again
probably not what we're trying to do so
if we wanted to evaluate this as an
expression we just wrap it up in curly
braces like so
and then we get two plus three is equal
to five cool go ahead and get rid of
this so now what we want to do is take
this the best string and we want to do
the same thing we did for those numeric
expressions and treat it do the same
thing for variables as I mentioned
earlier so when we want to output it
we're gonna react Dom dot render and in
here we're going to pass in a h1 tag but
instead of passing in the best string
like this we'll do it just so that we
can make sure everyone has a clear
understanding of what's going on we're
going to pass it into the document
document Susan
Oh
oops what did I do here I think I
misunderstood what we're doing right now
sorry guys
let's see here go back to the beginning
Oh No all right so that's what they want
to see I was just reading through the
instructions they tell us to do that so
okay back to the beginning so we're
gonna output react DOM dot render and
here we want to put in some H ones and
then we want to put in some brackets
here the best string now if we didn't
have these curly braces here it would
just output the best string as if it was
a string instead we want to actually get
the value and we're gonna go ahead and
do this to document dot get element
element by ID app just go ahead and do
that and run this lalalala I am the best
so very cool very cool let's go ahead
and get rid of all of this so we're you
can also do this for images and pretty
much any HTML element so we'll go it'll
you'll see right here that we can pass
in multiple parameters as well most of
them are gonna be named the same but uh
besides class and class name so
everything should be pretty intuitive so
let's go ahead and create a variable
here called goose path and where it
looks like it's a relative path that's
going to be equal to dot slash goose dot
jpg just going to run that
all right that's good there next we're
gonna create a variable here called
goose pick and we're gonna set this
equal to the IMG now if you remember it
correctly we actually need to include
the slash because of the way this all
works and here we're gonna set a source
equal to I don't forget the curly braces
Goose paths so let's go ahead and close
that with a semicolon so we have our
relative URL stored in goose path which
we're using as our source and then we're
gonna just simply output what we just
did by rendering it and we're gonna pass
in goose pick comma document dot get
element by ID and we're gonna go ahead
and put in the application here or the
location so remember app location it's
kind of weird calling the goose pick an
app but this is basically what you'll
you'll do later on you'll be passing in
a single application that typically has
multiple applications within it alright
so we're just actually reset it like
it's supposed to
so look at line 17 rack Tom got render
all right sorry guys I'm gonna reset
this one I'll restart this exercise just
because I don't remember what lines here
we're supposed to be changed okay so
you'll see here we have render no value
in null value so we won't change that
we're into the kiddie by plate so one
pass in our kitty variable here like so
and then we want to pass in document dot
get element by ID app let's go ahead and
run this
oh cool the next thing it wants us to do
is add a new attribute to our image tag
here so let's go ahead and do that
you'll see add the new image attribute
on click so you can you can also add
event listeners such as on click and in
here we want to let's go ahead and look
at the example you'll see on click and
we're gonna use curly brackets to set up
the to let it know that we want it to
use our JSX
so on click and what we want to do want
to pass in make dogee that make dogee
function so we run that you should pass
them to make dogee function and now when
we click on it it should be switching
between the two like so
taking a second load great work you're
doing time to use jam so it's basically
singing now that giving us an example
that we can use this statements as well
so we'll be doing that right now
definitely take a second pause the video
if you need to if you need a second to
kind of catch up I definitely encourage
it oftentimes a 15 minute video will
take me to watch probably like an hour
because I you know I try to do it as I
go through and get help along the way
but alright so we're in a pas and we
have this fjs as an example but this
point if you're learning react you
should you should be pretty okay with
if-else statements so all we're gonna do
here is an if statement says if our coin
toss function so if coin toss is equal
to the heads we want to do some stuff
else we want to do some other stuff down
here so what do you want to do if if
that's the case of our image is equal to
IMG SRC equals chicks kitty and remember
we have the closing closing bracket as
well and then we're gonna create the
same thing here of our image is equal to
IMG SRC equal to the
the pics da doggie just go ahead and run
that so basically it's a 50% chance or
it's math dot random less than half the
time - if it's true she said it's if
it's not shoes tails we have our ternary
operator here somehow I mess this up so
if coin toss is exactly equal to heads
fixed up Kitty image' SRC fixed up doggy
your condition should be if it's exactly
equal than heads did I misspell
something let me do that and let me see
what the difference was
oh that's because I reset it so if else
nummies SRC maybe I need a space there
let's see here I think art our code is
doing okay let's take a look at the
if-else so our if statement seems to
look fine our else statement I yeah
let's see what they say we need to do
here so I'm not worried about the react
Dom render I don't see where our air was
I think maybe we needed a space and
maybe that was what miss was messing us
up but then we just render it out we
pass in an image because this is gonna
run 100 percent of the time and we're
gonna have at least one image and then
we're gonna output that out I think
maybe we might have needed a space there
and that was kind of what it was failing
with in actual code CAD me logic here so
let's go ahead and reset this as well
so here we're basically doing the same
thing except we're using a ternary
operator and say doing an if-else
statement so we're the first thing that
we're gonna pass in in our we have our
picture right here or I'll work saying
is basically look if coin toss is equal
equals we're putting in our if statement
basically if it's equal equals two heads
we want a kitty so put in kitty else we
want don't you that's basically all
that's going on here and then we're
gonna pass in that image our variable
here and then output it so it goes if
statement true state if it's true and
then false value that's basically all
that's going on here what is going on
here I wasn't working
one more time the stereotype should look
like coin toss is exactly equal to heads
I'm Kitty that should be should be fine
show us one more time
coin toss function exactly equal to
heads that's true the output kitty put
doggy
react render we render the image doc
here
let me see I don't think this is gonna
be it but maybe they want us to wrap it
up as one element but it shouldn't be
the case Oh
or maybe coke atom E is just going full
full Academy this year
sounds like that's the case so ternary
operator clean sauces they got this
happened to me earlier to when I was
running it doggy oh maybe I needed
quotes no that's not it
we can try it maybe that maybe that's
where my mistake is I don't think we
need it like so but I've been wrong
before
let's try writing it one more time
Oh yep sorry about that guys because
this I I made a mistake this isn't
actually an array this is a key value
pair so that's why we need the quotes my
mistake
all right the next thing that we're
gonna be doing here is we're gonna we're
going to actually be using the and
operator so similar to everything else
you can kind of have a list items here
Oh
coke atom II come down over here so on
line 13 they want us to use the and
operator make it so that this expression
nacho-cheese straight out of the jar
will only appear if it's not judgmental
which is basically a variable here so
all we're gonna do here is we're gonna
pass some brackets around like so
because now we're treating this as a
expression that we're gonna be
evaluating we're say and not judge-made
toll and then that's all we're doing
here and we run it so basically if this
is false we're gonna go ahead and run it
and you'll see that it didn't show up
now will show up about half the time
based off of what the value is of
judgmental
it's going to reset this as well
all right so you'll see that we have the
map function here apparently this will
be used quite a bit according to them
what we're actually gonna do is write a
return statement for our map that
returns an Li containing the person
parameter so we'll just go ahead and
pass in person actually will pass in
person in curly brackets because it is a
parameter and not the word so let's go
ahead and do that I definitely take a
second to look at this if you're a
little bit confused about what it is
we're trying to do and from here what we
want to do is we want to react render
yes I'm still here coke atom e reactive
dot render that out and we're gonna pass
in a ul here and we want to actually
pass in our people allies so we're
passing in a bunch of list items within
our ul and we're gonna just output that
to document dot get element by ID to
where the I believe it's the main
section or the div called app we run
that
let's see here
make sure you start a new line with your
rock reactor in there let's see what it
says we're doing it wrong here it looks
like perhaps we had something misspelled
here or maybe they just wanted it all on
a different line on all it is all the
same more or less so
what's basically going on with these
keys is the key is similar to an ID in
the fact that it needs to be unique now
the reason that you have keys is two
things because there's memory needed to
render them or because the list order
might be shuffled but you still want to
know what the value is like you still
want to be able to do something with it
and that's where keys come in in handy
look at the code and for some reason the
code that it wanted was not to have an
eye in here at all I'm not quite sure
why that's the case
that's very interesting though all right
this page is basically just telling us
about how we don't actually have to use
JSX if we don't want to if we wanted to
not do that we could do it by creating
elements so let's go ahead and create a
div how we normally create like an h1
here rather we use h1 hello world
very intuitive now if we wanted to use
create element we would say the tag then
null and then the value we would want in
there such as hello world this is how
this is basically what JSX is doing
every time
Oh Oh that was the example let's
actually follow the gutter so they wants
to take the greatest dip here and do the
same thing so what type of tag it's a
div followed by null which is some sort
of value and I remember what it is and
then we have right here we're gonna pass
in I am div you know but that's
basically JSX in a nutshell
so a little bit of a hiccup on I think
it was number 14 for some reason but all
in all not too bad that's this is the
end of the advanced JSX
some things to keep in mind is that you
know just keep working through it and
there's a lot of stuff take a second to
read all this I read it earlier so some
of its pretty intuitive some of its
pretty nice but um coming up next we
will be doing the first react component
so get ready for that some good stuff
and I'll see you guys in the next video
