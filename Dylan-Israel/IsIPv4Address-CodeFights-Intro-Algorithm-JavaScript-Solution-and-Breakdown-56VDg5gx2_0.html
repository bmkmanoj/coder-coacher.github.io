ipv4 addresses the intro in island of
knowledge at Tai Lopez section alright
so this is going to be kind of a
controversial video I don't some people
may think so you're saying deal we're
doing algorithms how
controversial can it be well some people
may disagree with what I'm about to say
um do you actually need to solve this
and my answer isn't no you need to have
you need to know how to use regular
expressions in terms of what functions
are work with them in this case we're
going to use the test function and then
but in terms of do you actually need to
sit down and define this ipv4 regular
expression I don't think so
the reason for it is not a practical
learning experience and if someone gave
this to me in an interview and that I'd
be pretty pissed I'll be honest with you
and so in the real world exactly what
would happen is exactly what I did which
is hey Google ipv4 regular expressions
and you go and you test it out and you
confirm that it works which is exactly
what I did so in here you understand
what regular expressions - if you do
great if you don't you should go and
understand what they do but in terms of
actually sitting down and defining a
stupidly long regular expression I
completely disagree with that and so
here and I will give stat it will give
credit credit to Stack Overflow as well
so right guys
and we can eat out I'll get I'll put the
URL in there and Wow there we go give
credit where credit is due because it in
the real world you're not going to sit
down and you're not going to
write this IB PV for look how
complicated that is and there's no
reason to
so we already wrote it go and find it go
and use it this is you know there's a
reason that open source and things like
that exist but this test ok so let's
talk about this the one thing we can't
talk about because I haven't at this
point shouldn't extend what return true
return false says so this test basically
takes our input string and uses this
regular expression here which is to make
sure it's an ipv4 format some so that
means one of these these are invalid so
these are example examples of valid ipv4
address it's cool so it test to make
sure it's one of that and if it if it
does pass the tester returns true it
does it returns false so if it's the
true statement we're going to return
true false state we're going to return
false so some of you may very well
disagree with me on this I understand to
a degree but I'm not going to spend an
eternity of my life doing this one in in
how I would actually solve this in the
real world is I understand how to use
tests and regular expressions I probably
couldn't write this regular expression
without sitting now for about 3-4 hours
I'm just kind of hacking away at it
that's the truth of the matter and I
probably learned a lot in the process
but I don't have time to do that so here
we are so that's why I'm kind of saying
it might be a little controversial with
me put posting this video but this is
really really what you would probably
end up doing so with that being said
guys thank you for watching the video
probably this more of a discussion and I
Algar the walkthrough today but it is
what it is if you disagree with me let
me know in the comments right as philip
defranco would say this is it a once one
person shows conversation
apparently so I'll don't forget enjoy
the Facebook group all that Goods up
links in the search I'll see you guys
the next video hey guys thanks for
watching the video special thanks to our
sponsors dev Mountain if you look for a
coding bootcamp or tuition and housing
is included definitely check them out
appreciate it I'll see you guys in the
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
