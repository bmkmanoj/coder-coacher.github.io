2 which covers latest version of angular
we worked with cryptocurrency API so we
display some data we filter the data
sort the data we display a chart it's
all really really cool it's a really
cool project and one I think if you're
interested in cryptocurrencies you'll
actually maybe use quite frequently so
I'm pretty excited to show it to you let
me tell you all about it alright so if
you took part one where we're building
an angular project and we're building a
personal portfolio it's about three
hours of content the my new course
angular 360 part 2 is six hours of
contest so it's doubled it's still same
price $10 with the coupon code coding
god but I just want to bring up the
first one because sometimes people oh
well there's parts to actually the first
part no the first part is just slightly
easier less concepts more streamlined
you're gonna build a cool portfolio
project there and I think you should
check it out and we do go into detail in
the first one like part of the way my
courses are structured for this specific
type of course is I actually wireframe
things out to deliver a picture to paint
a picture of what it is that we're gonna
build in part one I actually go through
and and share with you my mindset as I'm
building this out and wireframing out in
in part two I just these are the
wireframes and this is what we're doing
with it I don't think we needed to cover
it twice so there are some things that
are different but part two generally
covers a lot more concepts but there are
two different projects project space and
so part two follows the same structure
as before where the content gives you an
introduction what it is that we're
building why we're building it we
actually go into user stories as well
how to write a user story what they are
those sort of things things I try to
build these courses so that they're as
relevant to how the software development
lifecycle works in the real world and so
we have wireframes we have user stories
and then we build out the project right
we build it out this is what I call our
rough draft we build it out and the way
of our unit test
right and you'll see even right now I've
them up and running where I write with
you nine different unit tests and using
karma and Jasmine and if you don't know
what those are don't worry we're gonna
go over all that in the in the video we
cover a lot of topics in here you'll see
that in the description we're going to
be covering angular typescript
JavaScript with Jasmin slash karma get
html5 css3 and bootstrap for so I mean
this is mainly an angular types of
course but we do in JavaScript of course
but we do cover all these other aspects
because I want you to be as prepared as
possible though so that's kind of the
standard stack you would do with the
project like this so we build our rough
draft out we then run our unit test
which is our build our test those are
our tests we refactor the code and then
we have the fun stuff right the how how
can we how can we how can you the this
is this section six it's how can you not
we anymore what can you go and do to
make this section make this project even
better this is how it sticks right you
go and you practice your practice you
practice you learn so that's kind of how
it's set up and so I'll give you some
hands so okay well this clean code
section this is something you could
clean up writing additional tests so I
only wrote nine there's probably should
be around thirty with all the components
we have there and that's for you to go
practice and get familiar with writing
tests so you can get familiar with
jasmine and karma and then a bug-fix and
then some features that you're gonna
build out that I have wireframes for as
well but let's take a look at the
project right so what is all I'm talking
about I'm not showing it she so our
project here is the top 100 crip does
that's what I called the project and
we're consuming as some open source
cryptocurrency API so you don't have to
go get an API key or anything like that
that was that's that's always a hassle
when to get people up and going so
literally you could take this link throw
it in the search bar here or the URL bar
whatever it's called and you'd be able
to see the data so the project itself
gives you the top 100 Kryptos right we
are going to filter the data so you'll
see right here if it's in red not a good
day for curve day that much associate
positive
one hundred only three or positive he'll
see it's in green we've also applied the
show only ten right and then we've we've
been eight we've been able to sort on
each one the column headers so this is
something that we're gonna add as well
and then we're adding the BTC price of
these things or the USD price right and
then we also build a chart using an open
source chart charting library which is a
chart jeaious wrapper sort of thing and
so this will show the last year or so of
Bitcoin prices which i think is pretty
cool so that's the project in a nutshell
it was a lot of work right I would say I
mean this this varies but I didn't
realize I was doing six hours of content
by the time I was done well we also I go
I do go over get so that you can go and
push this to your github that's one of
the things I really want people start
getting active with is working on their
github adding things to their github and
I give you a very brief introduction how
to get going with that but it was it was
a lot of fun it was a project that I
wanted to make we basically made sort of
a mini coin market capcom site and
that's actually where two of the api's
are from thank you to Queen market
Capcom for supplying me with stuff to
make but yeah six hours of stuff we also
of course display the data here and it
was it was a ton of fun
if the I'm always surprised by how much
work it takes to actually make one of
these courses and like any of the
courses I am always actively looking to
make it better so something I stumble in
the video or if you're like hey can you
maybe dive deeper on this one thing you
kind of glazed over it I'm happy to do
that so let me know in the comments and
if you do get the course please please
please review it much like subscribing
to the YouTube channel when you take the
course in your review it really helps it
stand out
with the other courses on there because
there's a ton right just like YouTube
there's a ton of competition and if you
don't like something about it send me a
message about how I can improve it
before you rate it in a perfect world
that would be how it works um but yes so
this is my third course it's kind of
crazy right we have now and this is out
by the way if you're watching this
videos now for a few days I've but again
there's a link in the certian for coding
god and there's a link in the
description for coding god for all the
courses your interest in just a
javascript 360 course coding how you
give her $14.99 the angular 1 coding
guide you get it for 9.99 and/or angular
the angular part one not an angular part
two $9.99 so uh pretty crazy right I am
slowly been knocking these courses out
and it's been a it's been an experience
I don't know I've started a new project
of my own so I probably won't have a
course for a while but I do plan on one
thing I want to do is I want to create a
a crash course series if you will I
don't want steel traversing medias name
and I won't but that's kind of the idea
where I want to build a about 10 hours
of content where think of it as a mini
boot camp like cold steel's where I go
over ten topics an hour piece and make
it so that might be something that I do
down the road and I think would be very
beneficial and then maybe on each one of
those topics I'll build an expanded
course but right now I'm in a very big
project that I started where I am I am
building a sort of it's cuz it's uh I'm
building a quiz platform so that I'll
create quizzes that will be coding
related right so you want to be tested
on Java sir if you take the JavaScript
quiz and it's really dynamic and all
this there's stuff but is uh I'm
building the crud tool so that you can
maintain the quizzes and in phase one
I'll be putting on my own quizzes and
then Phase two people can co and create
their quizzes and share them and upload
them and
they're gonna be based on certain topics
and things like that so I mean I have
another quiz for Lola cos that's taking
all my energy I'm super passionate about
that we spend a lot of fun with that but
it's going to be actually the first web
application I release like in terms of
like putting it on the internet for
people to use we're just kind of crazier
ie the web developer almost two years to
never put anything out there on the web
for people to use what's a strange
concept but yes so if you're a nurse
through the course it's really cool like
we went off on tangent this is about
promoting the course we're promoting the
 out of this course
so check out it was a lot of fun it's a
great great introduction just a little
bit about what it goes over approached
it started with this we're gonna be
talking about components we're also
going to be talking about services pipes
interfaces classes what else are we
going to be talking about that stuff
testing unit testing unit the test fit
in angular a whole bunch of stuff you
want to know more
there is a introduction video and a
course introduction that breaks it all
down we cover exactly I have like a
PowerPoint it's very professional so
professional it has three slides but
it's super professional so check it out
guys again the coupon code is coding guy
and there's a link in the description I
appreciate you watching this video when
you buy these courses it helps me get
that much closer to chasing the the
self-employment YouTube / udemy / a
little bit of your thing dream and
that's exciting so thank you so much for
the support and I'll see you guys to the
next video bye hey baby I just finished
building my second angular course that's
great baby what's the angle angular
quick link to our sponsor device
plus.com you guys are interested in
Arduino and the internet of things such
as raspberry PI's might I recommend
checking them out device plus comm if
you click the link in the top corner
it'll take you to a really cool thing
it's an intro beginner level tutorial of
how to build a tripwire using Arduino
check it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
