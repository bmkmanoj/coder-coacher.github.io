second to last activity for Python try
and finish today I'm a monster number
two monster or any energy drink company
please sponsor me but how selfless
trying to save a few bucks broke-ass
college student at classes make your own
car let's get going baby
alright um so if you remember from the
last video to define a class you start
off with class and then you name it
and then if you remember also since
we're doing the steps you would just put
past so that it's just us ignore this
code for the time being oh and don't
forget to put object in here as well so
you have to put object in there let it
know what it's doing now below your car
class create a new object called my car
so my underscore car equals car and I
don't forget to put self in here excuse
me you don't put self in here so that's
that's all we need for the time being
all right inside your class replace the
possum with new member variable
condition and give it a value of new all
right so condition is equal to new to
the string new rather my car is new is
2015 I already have I got in 2014 of
course they always do a year before so
it's kind of relevant to me um alright
so at the end of your code use a print
statement on the condition of my car all
right so let's print my underscore car
dot condition now this isn't a function
so we don't need the brackets that we're
just printing out the variable so
there's our new alright now we have to
define the init method so def under in
it
of the clock tick it's gonna take in
four parameters I'm taking the self it's
gonna take in model color mpg with
itself top model equals model self dot
color equals color and self dot and P G
equals MPG then modify that then modify
the object my card to provide the
following and puts it initialization all
right so we're here we are going to say
I guess what you do it below will say my
underscore car dot model equals the
DeLorean all right
dang it down with that then my under sir
car the dot color equals silver and then
a whopping mpg of 88 miles goddamn like
it's 40 for highway and it's that's good
but 88 is some next-level all right
so there's 88 you include self takes
exactly forward arguments guess 1
9:7 oh whoops
alright so they wanted us actually to do
it in here so self is already included
so the model is DeLorean my mistake then
we have silver and then we have 88 that
should be it
you should still just print new alright
put the model in my car so we print the
condition so print and i underscore car
dot model grant grant my or different
out the color car color alright dot MPG
cool
there it is it's new it's a DeLorean
it's silver and it's 88 miles per gallon
inside the car class add a method called
display car
okay so def display car
now we'll reference the cars remember
very real search returned the stream
returned just got a copy this
you use this to your friendship to your
mpg and to history
let's see if we can do it in here I
don't think we can but why not I like to
test things let's clean this up a bit
replace the individual prints Amos my
car dot dot display car and we'll
probably have to clean up that print
statement let's play car takes no
arguments one get in no self we need
that oh this is a color yeah so alright
so let's clean this up so we are gonna
say this is space plus self dot color
plus what are you doing here
I'll plus the model self dot model plus
with space plus self dot n PG + space P
G dot and then we need a space right
here now we'll do it
so tell model make sure you built the
display correctly adding member burials
together with the plus this is Claire mu
plus assistance all right so I remember
in our next rows we have to use a self
keyword and all right so let's let's
just go through our string here because
that's probably where our air is so we
display the car self we want to return
this is a space self dot color and then
another space plus self dot model space
so cell television
okay so let's this is a space plus
hilltop color plus Wow okay so let's go
to the Q&amp;amp;A former find out what's going
on round seven of eleven it was creating
class methods output is correct was
still getting air I put the period
okay this is how they want us to do it
so if you remember a way back when
early early on we had this AM % s where
it would we could put in the variables
in his case he forgot the period I
forgot about all about this I was like I
knew there's an easier way to do this
this isn't much easier it's about the
same length but this will basically we
it looks like we're module aleena it's
the same symbol but it's gonna
substitute it in order cool so you see
this is a silver DeLorean with 88 miles
per gallon nice so inside a car class a
domestic drive car so just clean this up
and death drive car that's a self dot
condition to use and then we'll say self
dot condition equals used remove the
call to my car dot this flake car
instead print only the condition of your
car print print my I'm just for card
condition then drive your car
drive don't save mine I'm just our car
dot drive it's go car finally prints a
condition again so print my wares for a
car dot condition and if we did
everything right it should change to use
unexpected indentation you are correct
Python emulator so new and then use
because we drove it the hence is use all
right so let's create another class
called electric car and in this electric
car we are going to inherit from car so
I'll extra car car and then def we have
to define it in it and it's gonna get
self
that's it ISIF init method of that
includes a battery type member variable
in addition the model colour and mpg so
it should already include that and then
one sha class parent class a second
friend define a musician sold yourself
battery
I'm just your type it sounds like it
wants this override this will do a model
color and PG I'm not 100% sure but this
is what it sounds like to me a
self-taught battery comes or type and
equals just for type sometimes you just
got test things out self dot model
equals model self dot color goes color
self MPG egos MPG honest I know can I
say how refreshing it is to not be
criticized in my videos like I know I
make mistakes and I don't I you know I
have like three hundred subscribers
right now it's not you know a lot but it
is nice to know that people understand
that the point of these videos is for to
teach myself as well as to help others
in the process so thank you for anyone
who's you've been like oh my god what's
going on why can't this guy see this air
it's part I feel like it's part of
programming part of learning and I
appreciate for those of you who have
just kind of accepted the fact of that
talk these videos are kind of going
they're kind of supposed to be learning
tools for the viewer and for myself hang
out
so um init method that includes better
type so then create electric variable my
car with molten salt
what's a molten salt battery time
alright so let's see here we have
I guess we can create renamed the same
things that's it's gonna be taking in
different variables we have to delete
the old one
Mike articles we'll just do what they
say for the time being and this is
molten salt and then we'll just do a D
and C and for T just speed it up so we
have an invalid syntax
make sure you define new electric car
class electric car Lane 20 nice so oh
don't forget to comma BAM we got so we
still getting renewing use but all our
code is good here he's inside electric
car at a new method drive car so we are
going to define drive under sir we're
gonna override drive car and just
yourself and your self dot condition
equals like new
apparently they last better then outside
I like jacquard print the condition self
print I I'm getting rid of this one real
quick we don't need that anymore you
don't need this either my I'm just her
car condition and then print my I'm just
for a card dot drive that's right car
and then print it the condition once
more condition so I should get new and
then it should go to use like fifteen
there we go
so noon unlike new drive car so
apparently it doesn't return anything
for that which I guess is not supposed
to and there we go
cool so we're gonna define a point 3d
meth I class a class point 3d and
inherits from object alright
as I point through 3d define a init
method self X Y Z and then initialize
them self dot x equals x self y because
Y self dot Z equals Z I then define a
under under re PR under under that
returns ok so apparently what this does
oh this is I don't know why they use the
D instead of the S but hey whatever
whatever works so this is just gonna
format it properly for when we wanna get
it returned and then outside the class
definition credit variable called my
underscore point let's drop down one
more line my underscore point containing
a new instance of 0.3 D equals point 3 D
and we have 1 comma 2 comma 3 and
finally we want to print my point so
print my underscore point
and don't forget self and there we go so
we get the 1 the 2 and the 3 and we've
earned our class badge what what and we
only have one final Python course I
never thought it would come and then we
will start our PI game game so very soon
so I'm looking forward to that but file
input and output is what we'll be doing
lastly and depending on what sort of
thing was sort of language I've done
this in Java it's a pain in the
ass and I'm hoping Python handles it a
lot better so with that being said
comments questions anything constructive
appreciate it and WordPress topics I
want to do some wordpress videos I use
it every day and I'm not sure what
people need to know for WordPress I'm
trying to come up with stuff on my own
but anything helps so I will see you
guys in the final file input and output
video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
