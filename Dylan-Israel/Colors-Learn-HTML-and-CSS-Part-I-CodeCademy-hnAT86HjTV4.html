in learn HTML and CSS part 1 styling
with CSS colors let's go ahead and jump
on it so there's a lots of different
colors that you can use that are default
built in and there's various ways of
choosing custom colors as well so that's
probably what we're going to be going
over in this section it's also going to
be talking about CSS syntax and have a
link CSS and HTML files together alright
the foreground color the background
color the best of coffee relate regions
so you'll see color styles the
foreground then the background color
Salzburg so there's kind of the the
background of like an h1 unevenly oh
it's just letters but technically that
space that empty space behind it is the
background so let's go ahead and set the
foreground color or just the color
parameter of the main heading to
midnight blue so we have our main
heading which is header here so let's go
ahead and see if we can find our header
so here's our header and we got want to
go ahead and set the color here to mid
night blue which is a built in color
just gonna run this and there now that's
changed the color of this so as of right
now by default h1s don't have a
background color it's set to transparent
now what we're gonna do here is just
kind of showcase the difference between
color and background
so we're gonna set this to cyan they're
just kind of like an off red
throw this one more time
counter is properly
huh not quite sure what I did here
well I believe they wanted this in the
h1s not in the actual header so let's go
ahead and jump down to here and do that
my mistake I apologize for that there we
go now you'll see all science apparently
I don't know the color sionis but it is
like a turquoise I think I was thinking
maroon excuse me so you see now that
this kind of space that this takes up
the background color is there we're
gonna go ahead and remove that because
it looks awful just go ahead and change
that back and there we go so we showcase
the color and we showcase background
color next thing that we want to do is
set the color of the main heading the
crimson I'll go ahead and change this
when I'm gonna set it to crimson and we
want to go
and we want to go ahead and set the
background color of the subheadings
which I'm guessing they're counting
knives the h2 so that to a dark magenta
so let's go ahead and jump down to our
dark magenta you'll see right here
there's some hashtag numbers this is
another way of setting a color that
isn't built into the H the CSS library
let's see let's go ahead and get the
code and see what they're saying we're
messing up on
so the background-color oh excuse me I
see what I did here my apologies
let's go ahead and control Z here and we
actually wanted to set the background
color here mistakes were made dark
magenta now we should be good to go
it's gonna run that you'll see now we
now have our background color like so
you're gonna see us use RGB now RGB of
course stands for red green blue now
we're gonna set the main heading let's
go to jump down to here to this so the
way that you you set it using RGB 5474
101 and obviously you wouldn't have this
memorized except a select few such as
like black or white or like certain
colors but the reason that the reason
that you the way you would find this is
there'd be like a color wheel online or
a CSS or at like a a document and
Photoshop that would be telling you
these numbers so you can get the exact
color from a document that you're
looking at let's go ahead and jump down
here and we're gonna change this to RGB
and we're going to set this to 23 notice
the commas between these as well to
separate them and then to 24 so the red
value of the green value and the blue
value now
that was so we saw how you could put
direct words in there we also saw how
you can do RGB and now we're gonna do
the hex color so in the main heading our
h1 here we're gonna go ahead and set
reset the color here using the hashtag--
this gives us even more options to color
and again you would use this this that
you'd be able to get this number from
like Photoshop or from various color
wheels on the Internet let's go ahead
and jump down to our subheading here and
which it's already using that for its
color but instead we're gonna do it for
the background color we're go ahead and
change that to the hashtag aa8 eb-5
you'll see right there it's nice kind of
purplish color
so I haven't actually used
hue/saturation or lightness but
apparently that's short for HSL which is
another color parameter that allows us
to or part a color that allows us to do
certain things which is kind of
interesting I didn't know this
so you'll see right here we're gonna set
the color jump down to chase lovely main
heading so we're gonna take this out and
we're gonna put HSL right foot three
fifty fifty eight point eight percent
saturation and then we're gonna put
forty two point zero percent
what's the L again that was lightness
it's gonna run this and see the
difference alright it's a little a
little different
there's also rgba so say you wanted to
make your text a little translucent you
do that with rgba you just add an A to
it and then you would have the LAT you'd
add a fourth input and that would be how
translucent you would want it to be you
do the same thing with a hsla as well so
change color main heading to RGB eight
colors alright so let's go into the main
heading here excuse me and we'll use RGB
a so the same same thing we're gonna put
the red then the green then the blue and
then now we're gonna ask between 0 to 1
in our case our new point 6 for the
transparency and you'll see now that
it's gonna be a little bit see-through
you can kind of see through it
what happened there
all right so I forgot to run my code
because this sinks a little buggy so
I'll do this one more time which is 293
140 and then 0.6
excuse me
so it's transparent I want to make it a
little bit more opaque so we're gonna go
ahead and do up that 2.9 leave the color
the same you'll see it's a little
stronger you can barely see through and
unless you look real close if you really
wanted to make it really see through you
can throw a point one in there like so
and you'll barely see it there change
that back to a point nine so the lower
the number the more see-through it is
so let's go ahead and jump into the main
heading here do a little it looks like
we're gonna be doing a little bit of
review so we're gonna change this the
main heading using RGB and we're gonna
change this so this is going to be three
150 100 it's gonna run that there's our
black three 150
interesting
oh excuse me I forgot to remove the a
there we go it's gonna run that now we
should be good well the next line we're
going to set the the oh it looks like
we're going to be doing two of these so
we're gonna do RGBA
and so it's showing us that we can stack
these I didn't know that
see we're learning things every day so
we're actually gonna set another
parameter like so as I said in a
previous video I am always learning
things about CSS we're gonna do RGB a I
really had no idea you could stack these
unless you're trying to make a point
that you're not supposed to stack them
like this so it's gonna run that which
color was applied to the heading let's
find out
it looks like it maybe just took our
transparent
interesting so what we learn this this
this section we learn primarily about
color
we learned that elements like H ones
have a foreground color or the text
color and a background color the empty
space behind it we also learned that
apparently there's 147 named color so
you can use we learned about RGB RGB a
naming colors that way and being able to
set transparency we also learned about
the hexadecimal colors which 16-million
color possibilities from our compared to
our 147 named ones and then we also
learned about how to set opacity using
hsla it says here that not all browsers
support hsla or opacity for the most
part they probably do this is just kind
of a a general thing but there's a lot
of and also it talks about a lot of
color resources Pickers available on the
internet so I hope you guys found this
