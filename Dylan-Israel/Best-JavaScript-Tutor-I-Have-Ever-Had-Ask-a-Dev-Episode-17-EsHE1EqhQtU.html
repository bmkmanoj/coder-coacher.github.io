get someone that adds me on Facebook and
wants me to tutor them or wants me to
mentor them and I do do that but I
charge an hourly rate and I send them my
page and whatnot and I want to share
with you my best tutor I wouldn't
exactly call my mentor by any means but
when I needed help Learning Express
learning MongoDB learning node the
gentleman I turned to some of you may
even know him because he has a a coding
challenge is not very active but if
you're a free code camp enthusiast you
may have come across him Stephen my you
and I want it I really had a very good
MongoDB tutoring session last night and
I wanted to share with you his tutoring
service because I really having gone
through it now I really learned a ton
and I as for those of you don't know if
Stephen is a wait we did an interview
and I definitely encourage you to check
that out in the behind the code
interview section where we talk about
his teaching experience so he was a
teacher who became a full-stack
developer while he was teaching code
excuse me why he was teaching English
and I believe it was South Korea at the
time he taught himself through resources
like free code camp and that works as a
full-stack developer in Austin Texas but
he has a passion for teaching and loves
to do it he's very good at it as well so
if you're interested in in you know
front-end development and you want a
tutor I highly encourage you to check it
check him out you can at the best Jas
and to see what sort of things he
teaches on here's a picture of Stephen
you can see teaches all the fundamentals
right HTML CSS bootstrap get github
chrome dev tools I really like this
because it's it's something that's come
out in the beta free code camp as well
to kind of dive into that a little bit
more but he basically teaches the myrn
stack which is mean express it's also
JavaScript issue
react it's it's a MongoDB Express react
and then note oh sorry
brain fart there but if you're looking
for a tutor and you these are some of
the things that you're interested I
couldn't recommend Steven more
especially after having gone through a
couple of his sessions I really learned
a lot and I think you will too and he
definitely has a passion for it I
thought it was really kind of funny I
was telling us tell my girlfriend when
we ended the when we started were
wrapping up our MongoDB session he's
like all right Dylan it's all right I
think I think we got enough to get you
started and get you dangerous all right
man thank you I'm not gonna get
dangerous right and then uh I think
asked me uh you know what did he's like
I just want to ask you before we leave
what is one thing that you learn and we
kind of just did a quick review and it's
very is very uh almost nostalgic I felt
like I was definitely a student for a
second but uh I it was a very good I had
a lot of source code that we typed out
together and I can reference back to as
well so I couldn't recommend Stephen
more if you leave for a JavaScript tutor
cover any from the basics to the more
advanced whether that's deployment front
end you know es6 and I learned a lot
about es6 in the process of learning
about MongoDB as well answered all my
questions very well and great guy I
highly encourage you to check them out
at the best j/s you can view a spry
sitting in there it's subject to change
but it's pretty reasonable and if you
want me to tutor you or you want a
