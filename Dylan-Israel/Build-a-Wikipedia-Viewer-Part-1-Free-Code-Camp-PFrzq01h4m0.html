going to be working on the Wikipedia API
Search project for free code Kent's
front front end we're going to be doing
some HTML some basic CSS mainly using
bootstrap we're also going to show how
to hook up the wikipedia API I'm using
jQuery and how to use that and we're
going to display a create an image that
when clicked will open up a random
Wikipedia article like so we are also
going to create a input here which will
then display our search results and like
so so let's type in hello world
and submit and then it's going to
display it down here like below and I
might even clean this up to look a
little more clean but I usually don't
like doing too much CSS so let's go
ahead and get started alright guys so
we're in free code camp we're going to
do two things we're going to import
everything we want first which is our
bootstrap and then we're also going to
import jQuery now everyone's styles
different with how they like to start I
personally like to do the easy sort of
let's kind of get our page set up look
so for me that just means let's start
typing out some HTML so we're going to
create a div class instead of equal to
container we're just going to go ahead
and close that and that's just a class
it's basically going to bring our page
in a little bit so that when we actually
look it's just so it doesn't go to the
edges doesn't look all weird
it's a bootstrap thing so I'm just gonna
create a div we're also going to go
ahead and create an h1 here
and it's just basically going to say the
title the project is Wikipedia API
search and then below that I like to put
credit from where I got the idea so
we'll go ahead and create an h4 and
we're go ahead and say we could say we
can either say put it like this FCC
front-end development cool so we have a
little bit of our page so far so what do
you need to create next the easiest
thing would be to create an image that
would then that would open up in the
link so that's pretty simple so what do
we need we just need the first anchor
tag that's going to link to a random
article free code camp provide to this
just going to close this out a little
bit so free code camp provides this
we're not going to actually have any
words because we're going to use an
image so I just got a random Wikipedia
image off of the net pull that up okay
see all right so in here we're just
going to go ahead and create an image
tag so we're saying image' SRC equals
cool enough let's go ahead and look so
here's our image before we styled it in
anything so that's right now it should
work so let's go ahead and test that and
it's pulling up so we don't actually
want it to open to another page we
actually want and this isn't like in the
proctoring thing but again small styling
as you go along isn't bad so we're gonna
go ahead and sit target equal to blank
and now when we click on it's going to
open in a brand new page like so cool
let's head back so the next thing that
we want to do is probably set up our
input class so we ever ever heading we
have our image to search now the next
thing that I would do is probably create
the search bar in the button so we'll be
going back to these I'm just really
trying to get out the kind of a rough
draft if you will so we're go ahead and
use input class your input and we're
going to set the class equal form
- control and this is a a bootstrap
class so input close control and then
where we will need a ID to target this
later on so we're going to go ahead and
set the ID here equal to search term
that was what I use so basically the
reason we're studying ID is so that when
we're using jQuery we can then get that
value concatenate it into the API string
and from there we'll be able to make the
correct API call based off the user
input so let's go ahead there we did
that we need a way to submit it check
that it's working somewhat we need a way
to submit it with that we can just use a
simple button
all right so we have button here and
we're going to with this button we're
going to give it an ID as well so we can
go ahead and say search and we'll say
type equal to button and from here we're
just going to give it a class we want to
look a little bit nice and we're just
going to say BTN BTN - primary so that's
going to hear it so stuff is gonna make
it look a little pretty and then we'll
go ahead and say submit and we'll close
the button and we basically have the
rough draft version of what we need to
do oh there's one more thing so we're
gonna need an output so the way I did it
was I just created a div and actually
this might be a better way is let's go
ahead and create a ul and we put our UL
in there we will then we'll give this an
ID equal two
put it out put and then when we call it
we'll just output a bunch of list items
to it so this is basically our rough
draft if you will of the code that we're
going to need in HTML we're going to go
back and clean it up a little bit and
add some classes I believe by for
instant divs but this is mainly it so in
the next video what we'll do is we'll
actually start the jQuery and we'll
start we'll start it with just a simple
click function and doing the ajax call
from there let's see you guys next time
thanks for watching
hey guys make sure to check out my
twitch api videos which will be coming
out pretty soon as well as my new series
drunk developers where I ask questions
and how did you get into the field what
was the favorite thing you ever did what
languages do you recommend learning for
a beginner all the sort of stuff while
having drinks so I hope you guys enjoy
that and keep an eye out for it see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
