running behind schedule
I apologize to anybody here who was I
apologize anybody was here at a 5:30 is
now 6:40 my deepest apologies sometimes
I get a little airheaded
because I have so much going on in the
background and stuff like that so I do
apologize I would never intentionally
make anybody wait
it just kinda slipped my mind
so I'd uh give it a second to catch up
here so it's lagging a little it'll fix
itself in just a minute here
all right cool uh so I'm so sorry about
that guys um I'm here now though my
apologies I hope all the free courses I
give you guys make up for it I have so
if you're new to the channel one thing
that I I do is I for every thousand
subscribers I like to do a livestream
AAMA a let's just hit me with what you
got sort of thing so we are officially
at 24,000 subscribers we actually grew
in the last 30 days by almost 1900 which
is large for my channel so hopefully
that that trend continues part of that
bump is from from me guesting on
engineer truth Channel when he did the
reality's reality verse expectations of
of a full stack developer and I was the
guest talking about it but yeah so if
you're one the new thousand thank you if
you're one the previous 23 thank you as
well
so I try to
one of the reasons I do these is I don't
I don't have all the time in the world
to to help to answer questions to
provide guidance on a one-on-one basis
and trust me you guys try right you guys
try people people add me on LinkedIn
Facebook which is cool but they I can't
necessarily answer your guys's questions
that's why I provide you know mentoring
and things like that if someone has a
few extra bucks to spare otherwise I'd
be doing it all day every day and your
boy would be homeless unemployed so how
exactly did you go about doing the
algorithms a free code camp did you give
yourself a time limit before googling I
had to Google probably one or two but
for the most part I just put in work man
like a mind you also I had done similar
algorithms in Java as a computer science
student so I wasn't going in there raw
if I wasn't going in there all right so
I had to add a little bit of a
background right and but I I would put
in anywhere from two to three days
sometimes on some of the harder ones and
I didn't look it up until I probably hit
about ten hours if not being able to
figure out now one thing I always
suggest is I suggest using a whiteboard
especially for algorithms because a lot
of times the hardest part assuming that
you have the documentation down and all
that sort stuff the hardest part is
actually being able to comprehend what's
the word I'm looking for comprehend how
your loops are going how your what's
actually doing what right when this loop
hits here what's the value of this
variable in this if statement and and
then it shoots to here what is it now
and trying to actually piece it all
together and if you use a whiteboard you
can kind of slow your brain down but a
process by process and iterate through
piece by piece by piece and I think a
lot of times especially when you're a
a newer developer you need to kind of
build that vid mental visual you don't
have the mental you know have the
abilities for the mental visualization
quite yet
but you you may once you get better but
it also just makes a little bit easier
to to do that with the whiteboard
especially when you get started and even
even you know professional developers
have whiteboards all in their office I
have five in my house for various things
sometimes it helps just to have
something in the look at it from a far
bit code how are you doing by the way
sir I know you've been working hard
again I do apologize for being late I I
got off work I took care of I start
working on a video a very funny and good
and important one look forward to this
Friday's video guys look forward to
every Monday Wednesday Friday video but
definitely look extra forward to this
Friday's video so this Friday's video is
it talks about three things it talks
about what you should do when someone
lays you off or fires you it talks about
how you need to do research about a
company so you don't put yourself in a
position that you are working on back on
me cuz that definitely increases your
chances getting laid off and then it's
and then it showcases a real-life
example of what you shouldn't do when
you get laid off you're fired so it's a
it's a good video I'm looking forward to
sharing that with you guys oh good
evening David good evening so so I've
been pretty stressed out lately just on
a personal note I've had a lot of stuff
going on in the background some things
that I don't necessarily want to talk
about it no it's not another troll video
it's not another Joe video no no no no I
know he built up the trophy this is a
real video this is a real video I I make
it I feel like you might be saying I
have a reputation now or something
for Trello videos I did one troll video
- 600 and all of a sudden you're worried
about it is April still Kony April right
now is working on project management
certification specifically in lean and
agile after us doing kind of 30 days of
code she wants to come back to it and
maybe go maybe go into a a different
path she still wants to learn to coach
she did enjoy it but she practiced
project management will probably be the
best path for her getting started so
even though he took a different route
self-taught and have become a painful
stack developer do you plan on going
back to school to get your CS agree why
why not I do so this is something I was
talking about today actually with
somebody and I am currently in the rack
noun degree program which I'm waiting to
complete as well as some potential
things in my my career I have a one year
review at my job in about a little less
than two months so in about two months
and then I'm imagining at my one year I
will get a raise and that will help me
pay for school so I don't have to take
any loans out and why I want to go back
a couple things I kind of an upset with
myself that I never finished I don't
think I need you to be honest with you I
think there's definitely a benefit to it
there's a benefit of me going and
knocking it out and and becoming a
having a bachelor's just in terms of
being your you know it it would be a lie
to say that you're not a more attractive
employee having a bachelor source not
right it's not the end-all be-all but it
is it is something the other but the the
main reason other than kind of a chip on
my shoulder being more hireable is I
could see myself teaching down the road
and and maybe out at a university where
maybe 10 15 20 years I'll be 30 in
October and um I'll be 30 in October and
maybe at 50 I might kind of retire and
each part-timer do something like that
and that's something that I've kind of
thought about it's kind of one of the
reasons I like YouTube I like maybe
having a talk about talking about these
things and teaching these things and
doing doing what I can so how much time
do you recommend investing and learning
to create web applications versus
algorithms there's some hard question
bit code because you need to be able to
do the algorithms to be able to build
the web applications not that you need
the algorithm to actually build it but
you need to be able to solve algorithms
to be able to build the web applications
I would say if you can 75 percent
projects 25 percent algorithms if I had
to break it down have I ever bombed a
coding interview oh yes what about
having kids if I are not at that point
matter of fact on a personal note we
can't have kids unless we were to remove
the IUD which is good for another four
years
so at our current our current plan is to
just wait for that thing to break and
not be good anymore and let's say four
years from now will probably be together
about 10 or 11 years and you know it
takes about 10 years to tie down this
hotness
so that's hate I said that so yeah it's
not something we're thinking about right
now my main goal is on career it's on
YouTube which I consider part of my
career it's on me developed becoming a
better developer it's on saw enough
saving money and investing for the
future we won't be having kids before I
buy property this is something that I've
I'm a big believer in and I believe that
you should be financially ready to have
children and not just have children so
that that's kind of that's kind of where
I'm at in terms of children I don't
like children also that's another thing
like I'm sure I'll like my kids I don't
like children so that might be a little
harsh but that's that's a truth let's
see here early welcome to the 30s Club
bro I know man I'm feeling old although
you know what with these braces man I
bet people are thinking I'm like 22 23
he's a computer science degree really
difficult it's one of the harder degrees
there's a lot of physics there's a lot
of calculus there's a lot of
courses that you probably don't really
need you're learning web development
good for you MIT should I use reactor
angular 2 I'm learning react right now
if I don't if I had to choose between
one and the other I'd say learn react
but once you feel comfortable to react
I've been to angular two men now the
thing is dive into it all it's better
jump from one learning platform to
another or as building projects right
away more efficient what I what my kind
of thought process with this VLS is that
you go and you learn something on you
learn the basics right through a youtube
video and through like code cadmium free
code camp and you take what you just
what you just got exposed to I don't
really want to see you learn you take
what you got exposed to and then you go
and build a project in it that's
immediately like that day that and then
you'll you'll actually retain some of
what you learned with what you got
exposed to your other it's a mere just
free cooking throws to the Wolves I feel
like it's a fossil another API projects
out googling you tubing
g-money Mozart nice name by the way I I
would say that that's part of part of
how you how you learn to be honest and I
don't think they necessarily throw you
to the wolves play part of the part of
my things with coke add me is they hold
your hand too much and you never
actually learned and one of the crucial
skills about being in developers you
have to be able to research
which your issues cuz 99% of your issues
have already been reported you have to
find those issues so that that's my
thing is it's it's gone
okay well or one other thing everybody
doesn't like the diffuser so um see here
it's a better bill freako camp projects
I cut out around that cut fin it is
indeed see how do you stay motivated
what drives you um uh I mean if someone
who's recently unmotivated for one day
this recent recently I would say
unmotivated burnt out but this Saturday
I for the first time other than being on
like the few three-day vacations I've
taken I didn't code on I'll admit it I
did not code on Saturday part of it was
I was kind of emotionally drained and
mentally trained and I had my family
down and just some personal things so
buy this but I don't I don't find I
don't find the need to stay motivated
because that that means like something
something tangible out there is giving
me motivation I don't really see it like
that
for me it's it's easier to stay
motivated when you enjoy doing it right
so like like for me I don't it's not
like YouTube is a chore for me I I enjoy
I enjoy YouTube so I do it I enjoy
talking about this stuff so I have a
Facebook group
I enjoy coding so like code right
and thank you shout out to Ricky Garcia
and also has a youtube channel those
brothers and sisters our code guide is
an angry god join me in sending an
offering unto him in the hopes to avoid
is the wrath yes oh but um what drives
me is a different thing altogether
um I uh I'm driven by money
very very much so I'm also driven by
having a nice life I am I'm of the
mindset that I'm going to put in a lot
of work in the next 10 years and I'm
going to reap the benefits of it in the
meantime it's one of the reasons that's
so easy for me to to live a lower
lifestyle then then it's one of the
reasons that I I live below my means
just what I'm trying to say so and I try
handling I try to become like I try to
do all the things that you should do and
a lot of these things we all know we
should do right we know we should study
we know we should have good credit we
know we should be exercised and we know
we should be trying to progress
ourselves and learn daily and if you
just do those things already should know
and an understanding that you're going
to progress and you're gonna reap the
benefits of it it makes it very easy
right so for in terms of finances that
means you have to invest that means you
have to put money into a 401k or a Roth
IRA or just you know peer-to-peer
lending or or Robin Hood or acorns or
whatever it is but you have to start
investing and you're basically putting
off and same thing goes with what drives
you is you're investing in yourself
right that's what's really that's really
what it is we say motivate why are you
staying motivated so that you can
progress your life and when you first
it's much easier once you've tasted a
little bit of success right so like
there were days when I was studying
every day to become a developer that I
was I thought about giving up right I
thought about maybe taking a week off
and going back to it
I never did but those thoughts did come
into my mind but now it's like I've been
able to reap the benefits of that and
not once do I do I think about that um
so I don't know Roxy so for me it's I
don't want to say it's just money
because that sounds very very shallow
but I do I do respect what money can
provide you money can provide you with a
home for your your you know future
children and food right
if you show up to my house that fridge
it doesn't matter when you show up to my
house that fridge is full the freezer is
full the mini fridge is full because I
didn't you know a year and a half ago
two years ago when it was April and I
sleeping in the living room and you know
we was and we gave up our bedroom for
her sister we didn't have a full fridge
of food you know we didn't have we
didn't have that stuff and so and I'm
not saying we have it super hard or we
had it worse than others that's just
situation you're in
so those are the things that I which is
probably why I'm gaining weight man your
boys been put your boy is put on like
ten pounds easy easy and I need to start
I need to start working the apps and
doing the squats but if you stop
personal what does someone your
profession earn it depends on what what
what you're actually what your job title
is what you do what how how skilled you
are what your resume looks like it
really depends on the individual how is
my course going I that was something I
was stressing me out and I didn't I
couldn't for some reason I felt very
uncomfortable charging money for a
course and I decided to put that on hold
and instead focus on my career in terms
of learning Reax which will I'm doing in
a degree program going back to school
and at some point I will put out a
course I'll probably do in the easier
course a less technical course for a
while I've been thinking about making a
course about how to create a YouTube
channel in terms of like specifically a
coding Channel and talking about all the
tools available pitfalls that I fell
into and how to avoid certain things and
the different types of coding channels
and that's that might be that will
probably be my first course because in
terms of like there's a lot I can talk
about and show but in terms of like a
time commitment it's about one tenth of
what I would expect a coding course to
be
all these youtubers with 1 million
subscribers say money isn't motive at
all are complete yeah man um I
mean I just try and keep it real right
it's easy to say that money doesn't
motivate you when you're bringing in a
hundred thousand dollars a month right
like it's it's it's easy to make that
argument cuz you already got enough
money right what is a hundred and ten
thousand dollars a month when you're
making a hundred thousand all right um
but when you're making you know
less than that a year and put it in work
and life of a youtuber man is not too
shabby when you get there so uh and and
when you do have those days we're gonna
motivate it right and you'd only do 20
minutes of coding that's the reason that
you have the disc or channel that's the
reason you have YouTube subscribers or
YouTube channels that you follow right
some days I'll just watch a video on
coding right it's just it depends on
what you trying to do but there are
other ways you can become a better
developer this doesn't actually have you
use a keyboard you can learn a lot just
by watching the tutorial
I've got basic JavaScript down now I'm
trying to learn nodejs what do you think
would be best to use any course
recommendations I haven't taken a course
on nodejs I have just watched some
YouTube tutorials on it traversing media
has like five different tutorials on
meme development and specifically note
and express I would definitely check
that out any advice for someone who's
looking for a community of people has so
much skill level to help and sort of
speed up your progress has become well
so the meetups go to meetup.com and look
up coding and programming meetups in
your area
that's probably the best thing you can
do say the latest video man how I became
a developer really at home I'm glad man
I I I just try to tell my story even
when I talk about advice I don't give
advice that I've never taken so I really
just feel like I'm telling you guys what
I have done is more of a story excite
when people give advice of that
they have no business
talking about right um Thank You Adrian
I appreciate it you have any
recommendations on udemy courses you're
learning react I could recommend Steven
Grider although I have never taken a
udemy course the the first course I will
ever actually complete will be this
Udacity nanodegree program um same here
I'm doing an MBA program because I'm
thinking about my future
how are you planning or learning the
business side of coding example you
decide a credit course would it be a
business so one of the great things
about being a coding youtuber is you can
learn from the other coding youtubers is
I don't necessarily have to I don't
necessarily have to sell anything now
but if I ever get around to actually
build it if I building a course or
building a product to sell I have I have
that I have taken the time and the the
the energy to create an audience right
at the end of the day we have as of
today 24,000 people that will get a
video in their Facebook feed that
hopefully I've built up some sort of
reputation that you can feel like you
would get a quality course along the way
and or a quality product or something
where you say you know what man
these are people interested in coding I
have a coding software product and I can
pitch it to them and they may be open to
it so in terms of that we've already
handled the hardest part which is having
somebody to buy the course that's the
hard part right having some getting the
word out and being able to make the
relationships with other people have
audiences and guesting on their channels
and stuff like that so I'm not
necessarily worried about the business
side of it and someone who's who I I
feel like I'm probably a little bit more
business savvy than the than the the
average person but that's just because
it's I'm money hungry
it's type stuff that interests me my
story of why I became a developer is
pretty damn boring courage to dial on
dealin would it be easier to land job
with a startup company
normal company probably startup company
I'm guessing a normal company you're
kind of referring to like a fortune 500
company or a large multinational company
startup companies are going to be more
accepting to a recent computer science
grad or a self-taught developer in my
experience you're working on your own
challenge you tube network and good for
you Jordan how's it now degree coming
along pretty good I was working on it a
little bit yesterday I'm doing this
tonight the live stream and I recorded a
video look forward to Friday's video
it's going to be super good but I like
what I have so far I would imagine that
by the end of this week I'll finish the
project that would be my guest today I'm
doing this and then tomorrow when I get
home from work I'll be working on the
nanodegree and I might put in about
thirty minutes on thirty minutes of it
offline to ticket going doctor named
Burgess
I've no I don't know too much about
every jeaious I've talked with Eric a
program with Eric quite a bit and that's
kind of his main go-to framework he's a
big fan of a he's even written a book on
it my thing is that you should really
only be learning things that are in
demand unless you're already a senior
developer so that would probably be if
you're looking for a JavaScript
framework it be reactor angular for last
question do you think about IQ burst
determination when it comes to
programming
I do not uh I mean I think you probably
have to be inherently probably pretty
intelligent to get good at at I I don't
even think intelligence right word I
think you have to be a little bit more
logical than most people so so speaking
of a good logical people we got our boy
Nicholas Spinoza for those who don't
know Nick and I are going to be starting
a podcast together in the very near
future just waiting to wrap up a few
things on my end and then we're gonna
get started so look for that
in the coming future for your rides in
the car and things like that am I going
to get my CS degree online yes
so Rasmussen university has a online CS
program specifically for people who are
going back to complete their who
complete their degree it's gonna take me
about 18 months it's low cost low cost
meaning it's going to cost me about
fourteen thousand dollars and when the
cool things about it is you through your
coursework you actually can earn
certification so I want to get better
with AWS that's one certification you
can get the associate's I want to get
better with Linux there's a Linux
certification so you take a course
that's designed to fulfill those
certifications and then you go and you
take it rasmussen University it's a they
have that they also have they also have
if you don't like the online setting
they have campuses that you can go to
what's the podcast going to be called
this is something we've we've been
discussing code tech and caffeine was
one idea coding gods not that were the
coding gods but the people were
interviewing will be the coding gods
self taught self made is a one I like
but that might that may not be it may
not be that may not be too like I wanted
to really push the whole coding idea
what about meteors yes same same thing
Juba do ball is that unless you're
senior developer you should really be
focusing on the most in-demand stuff and
that's react and angular everything else
falls to the wayside when it talks about
JavaScript frameworks I'm learning react
Devin dear so I guess I'd have to
recommend react although I don't think
either one or bad choices long so you're
learning angular 4 if it's your entry
level language right
they stink um interviewing the coding
guys that still I'm a name now one day
I'll go and I'll actually edit that edit
that um that blog I read today that
really say and throw it out on the free
code camp channel and get some publicity
yeah so if you're gonna learn a
framework in in the hopes of landing a
job make sure you have an okay
understanding of JavaScript and
specifically start focusing on
typescript start focusing on es6
standards and also projects man that's
what's gonna get you hired just don't
say you know angular react build build a
project that isn't like a weather
application build something that's
unique and custom the hardest thing for
you guys did you have a github account
when you first when you went for your
first interview I don't remember I had
to be honest with you I didn't have much
on it if I did
hey I'm in a coding boot camp now and I
feel kind of crazy behind how do you
learn JavaScript well I just did free
code camp every day and I watched videos
what do you think is a good idea to make
advance projects with angular or react
yeah I mean that's that's kind of the
point is of the the JavaScript
frameworks to make big big big projects
so our podcasts gonna be on Google
Hangouts leister's there's a more
professional that we're gonna have a
separate YouTube channel will be on
there and the podcasts are going to be
released on iTunes and things like that
what's more valuable for you for me I
guess github for my you to show my
youtube channel by far my youtube
channel is a great
a great thing because it shows passion
and I think that's a big thing that a
lot of a lot of people and I can say
from the interviews I've had with
developers who who are willing to say
okay this is a guy I want to work with
it's okay I'm knowledge in that it
doesn't mean I don't have the passion
right because I do but I can say that is
one thing that I think that I'm certain
of has done a lot for me in my previous
job I was able to get that job at that
software company because I have a
passion for software and I was going to
be doing video editing and creating
technical documentation even though I've
never done it before so in this job
played a role as well where to get
inspirations for projects I mean the
easiest thing to do is just think of
something I you think you can make money
with and if you're making my second make
your first few bucks it makes a lot
easier for you to uh to be motivated but
also find some that's unique to you
right it just happens that for me it's
YouTube right so if I I'm going to after
I finish this first react course build
either an angular 4 or react I'm going
to build some youtuber tools I have a
couple ideas that I'm going to build and
I'm going to put it online and that will
be one example project that's going to
be unique from what I have in my
portfolio and I'll probably go and I'll
build other tools as well and things
like that so what are your thoughts on
functional programming versus
object-oriented program well I've had a
bad introduction of functional
programming but a lot of people seem to
think that it's going to be the future
development and to be honest I couldn't
really tell you one way or the other
because I took one course in college was
poorly taught I've talked about this
before but my my teacher showed up and
my teacher showed up and they said hey I
got hired today I've never I've never
even heard of Scala which was the
functional programming language we're
learning and we're gonna learn it
together so I didn't have the best
introduction to him so I don't think I
could accurately say how can one build
his / her portfolios entry front junior
front-end developer first thing you guys
should always do is you should get
yourself a portfolio site and what I
mean by that is go by Felix column or
whatever it is and and put it together
right and build it build a custom site
don't get a wordpress site build a build
a about me page build a a build a
portfolio page and so your code pins you
shouldn't have a code written on there I
understand not everyone can you know you
got to out pony up about six dollars a
month you might be able to find a free
site somewhere go and buy yourself a
wide one three four instead having a
code pin put on github you should have
it on get up you should have it in both
places the code pin and your github but
you should also have a portfolio page
where you've uploaded it and put it on
there why would a company hiring an
intern with foundational skill and HTML
CSS and JavaScript I found one I thought
of flying since I'm still learning
why well perhaps they want to mentor you
into the role perhaps they want to save
money perhaps a lot of times companies
will hire interns for three months in
hopes of hiring them at the end of their
internship that's a lot of times what
happens and it's kind of a nice way not
to have to hire and fire people to be
honest where do I live right now in the
u.s. I live in Florida Tampa Florida
don't do anything weird with that
information do you advise against using
github pages to host a portfolio website
I think there's something to be gained
by having a portfolio page Brandon I
mean when a resume comes with the
website section and you don't have a
website to put on it I think I think
there's an issue are you thinking about
going back to get your bachelor's degree
yes yes talked about this earlier am I
already through the calculus linear out
discrete mathematics yes I finished that
before I dropped out I might have won
calculus course left I don't remember I
don't remember specifically I'd have to
look at it I took three or four calculus
courses but I am originally a kalfa Los
Angeles California native specifically
Pasadena but yes I am I'm going to
Rasmussen university I've been talking
with them what's the difference between
a website portfolio and a hardcopy
resume well one they can actually go and
click through your website that's that's
prayer your portfolio project that's
significantly better than you saying
weather app right another is you can
change it and you can on there you have
more than so on your on your on your
resume you can have on your resume you
can only have so many so much space kind
of why you have a resume and a LinkedIn
your LinkedIn as a public thing where
you have more than everything at more
than what you can fit on one page right
why do I move I got offered a good job
and it was out of California and so no
state tax no traffic so I'll tell Chris
Hawkes Chris Hawkes isn't gonna do
anything strange I'm in Tampa Chris
Tampa Florida the home so I'll tell you
this man is if you thought that you saw
crazy stunts Florida is I don't know I
didn't know people in Florida didn't
know this but they didn't know that they
were kind of in America there's kind of
a joke that when weird happens it's
always in Florida no one's surprised and
it has just proven more and more I
didn't know John was from Tampa is there
a reason you develop using windows
rather than mac OS yes I've been using
windows for 20 years that's about it if
I had to use Mac at a job
would but I'm not not too worried about
it which day is better to live in Cali
or Florida and why so California is much
better there's less traffic less
homeless people not that there's
anything wrong with homeless people but
there's a there's a little there so
there's less like I wish we could take
care of LA is you you can't go you can
turn the street on LA and there's just
blocks of people I'm not kidding you
they'll have tents and they'll have
they'll have like stoves like I met as
this they're camping stoves they'll be
cooking it up and it's just hard to feel
safe at times when you you have people
like that and it in your pain high
amounts of rent so the rents lower the
traffic is significantly less I'm able
to get my three-bedroom two-bath
apartment for 1150 a month
it's about 1400 square feet it's in a
beautiful condo complex something
equivalent and and by the way it's an
eight-minute drive to my work if I
wanted to get something equivalent in
Los Angeles we're looking at two to
three times that amount easy and like
like when I was when I came down here
and I was looking at apartments I had to
ask stupid questions like does it come
with a fridge does it come with AC
central air and they're looking at me
like yes man did this guy just get out
of prison why is he asking all these
stupid questions because in California
that your thing gets gutted man there's
no central a/c there's no fridge unless
you're in a luxury apartment Lots right
so yeah I'm joking man I'll be real
serious but also as I there's a higher
tax right so just by me Sarah's making
the same up forget cost of living but
say I was making the same amount of
money in California as I'm making in
Florida I save I save every month about
$300 in my check so that in itself is uh
maybe for 350 after you know what it is
do I find not having your degree as a
limiting factor to wage increases
promotions are seemingly like a glass
ceiling to transfer to a different job
nope I'll go into
it's I mean there there is something
where it can be said that hey obviously
it's just a thing I always feel like I
always feel like people think I'm
bashing CS degrees I'm not I've already
explained you that I'm going back and
I've talked about why but it does help
but it's not the only thing right um
I've had I've had I've had numerous
interviews and it's now that numerous
interviews with recruiters and not once
they bring up that I don't have a siesta
Gris they just talk they're worried
about what I've done what I've built
um um yeah but Chris can go hit up John
John where'd you used to live I can need
to know John's gonna be like yo man I
don't know about all this but do you
think that completing the full stack
program freako camp is nothing at your
door that don't your foot in the door of
the developer I got my full stack job
before I even completed the free code
can't front insert a lot of that's hard
work right it's taking what you learned
applying it building stuff with it
showcasing your skills showing that
you're eager doing all the basic stuff
have a good looking resume have a
portfolio site have a github have a
unique projects right show that you care
have a good LinkedIn do we know the
basic stuff people will give you a
chance even if their internships get
going but you go from there right I mean
I talked to you guys today about the
video I released today was all about how
I was two-and-a-half years ago I was
delivering pizzas got tolls on our job
two hours away did that tried to try to
do the freelance thing for a bit did it
still school jock out went and took a
job grind in and out in in Los Angeles
and then from there now I'm here and
things are going great everything's
going in the right direction everyone's
past is different man so it just it just
depends
but is it is it okay to say that not
having a degree while living you in
certain ways yeah certain employers will
not hire you or or certain employers
will make it harder for you to be hired
I should say because a lot of times when
you look at the job applications it will
say right on it degree or equivalent
experience what that means is equivalent
experience fees are willing to say it's
nice if you have a degree but if you're
good we're happy to have you and that's
kind of the state of software
development
what's the small things my essential oil
diffuser oh and I only know HTML CSS
JavaScript bootstrapping jQuery are
those good enough for junior dev jobs
out there oh it depends on the job but I
probably need to pick up you probably
you most likely need to pick up angular
angular for react I'd be the best thing
I could advise you if you're trying to
be a friend and developer pick up
angular for react make sure that you
have version control if you want to
stand out start doing some tests you can
learn testing unit tests relatively
quickly and I'll make you stand out in a
short amount of time I don't know what
the NHS is so I don't know
Oh somehow we got started talking about
health caring here I'm okay with that
free health care um but yeah guys and
the the the point of of today's video
when I talked about my path and you know
I could talk about I could talk about
the path before that and the choices I
made that weren't coding related and how
I change my career I changed my how I
did I went and got my EMT certification
and I studied accounting and I studied
journalism and and all this sort of
stuff so it's it's one of those things
where not everything you know not
everyone has a straight and narrow path
man not everyone not everyone will do
that but but Chris is right when you say
they'll straight up not hire you without
a stem degree government contractors are
known for that there are companies that
will do that I I don't think they're the
hard part the hard part without the stem
degree will be to get your foot in the
door and get that relevant experience
which is why you need to get creative
right
are you a runescape kind of guy or
called duty it's so funny of you ask
that I bought so I mentioned that for
the first day in about a year I didn't
code on Saturday just from kind of being
burped out and stressed out about
personal things and I couldn't sit down
and I couldn't work on a react I went
and bought the new Call of Duty the new
one meaning they called you advanced
warfare let me tell you that game is
garbage I played it for like an hour
I'll play the campaign but I think I'm
just gonna buy the new one I don't
really play games guys I really just
code all the time
um yeah but I mean to say that you not
that I've been turned down I've been I
feel like I'll tell you the first time I
had the the first time I remember ever
getting turned down directly was so way
up if you're not familiar with layup
they do internships for college students
and stuff like that
so WAMP has that's basically the thing
they help you they help you go and get
internships and and entry-level jobs and
it's like a job market for the way up so
they were interviewing me for a YouTube
like personality for them where
essentially I'd be doing this talking
except I'd be talking about way out
talking about you know the growing
trends and in college the growing chance
and getting internships and jobs and it
was going really well and I felt like I
was good good and this was before this
is about three months before I took this
current job it's going really well and
and I had the phone call we were talking
on the phone and she asked me what my
degree was in and then I say well I'm
you know I haven't finished my degree
yet I'm still I plan on going back in
the future this and that and she she
said oh sorry we're only considering
candidates with degrees thank you for
your time and literally it ended that
quick I'm not pushing you guys it ended
that quick and yes so there to say that
doesn't exist isn't the case um code all
the time aren't you worried that you'll
burn out hey you burn out and then you
burn back in you know I'm saying so but
what if I have a degree in
world religious is it better than no
degree yes a lot of times they just want
to have that checkmark this guy has a
bachelor's BAM let's go baby anakin code
cool good enough
would I be willing to look at your
resume give you some constructive
feedback uh why don't you throw it up on
the Facebook group and get everybody and
I will I'll give you feedback on that
why don't you do that because uh I mean
the Facebook groups there so that you'd
only get my opinion you get other
people's opinion but I will comment on
it as well but uh I mean yeah you burned
back you burn down they burn back in you
so it's outwards right um and I I do I
do
so I've been on I've been on in my
lifetime I've been in the hey I'm not
doing anything so there's no chance that
I'm gonna burn out I'm just playing
modern warfare to like it like it's
gonna pay me a full-time salary with a
pension of benefits and then I have the
other end of the spectrum I'm at now
which I'm working everyday like right
now it may say oh well you know this is
you consider this work yes I consider
this work to a degree right I enjoy my
work there's something wrong with that
and and so uh this I you know I recorded
a video earlier I talked to the
recruiter I you know I'm working on some
YouTube stuff and I'm gonna be working
on the rack now and agree probably for
about 30 minutes before this and at some
point I have to go say hello to my
wonderful girlfriend who's here so it's
it's okay I beam on both end of the
spectrum I'm okay being on this end and
April will tell me like look I can see
it in your face you're about to flip the
 out like you're about to you're
about to go that level why don't you
take a day off why don't you go and play
video games even it's just for half the
day even if it's for 20 minutes I'd
rather have my girlfriend be telling me
I need to sit down and play video games
than her be telling me you know what I
gotta get my together
so do I know firebase would you consider
covering a child's point I've been
introduced to it we had a remote
developer for a short period of time who
wanted us to use firebase and the reason
we did not was my understanding was that
to connect to a server so do i watch
Game of Thrones yeah man so that's one a
few things I
so in terms of television other than
YouTube I I watch Game of Thrones every
Sunday night first time in my life I've
ever been able to pay for HBO GO so
shout out to HBO I've made it six
seasons without having to pay you and
I'm sorry about that but I got I got
some monies now you're getting your
$14.99 because I feel guilty so I do I
do watch Game of Thrones and I watch two
anime shows right now I'm watching
Dragon Ball super I'm also watching my
hero academia besides that I watched
some news on YouTube and I watched
coding tutorials that's about it
oh and I watch it a couple of cool
investment channels do you wear a shirt
and tie your work no I kind I work on a
business slacks and Nikes and like a
collared shirt I got like a yeah colored
shirt I guess but what I cover so I do
plan on doing coding tutorials like
actual ones where I'm breaking out
content and going to going into our long
videos and showcasing it that's on my
to-do list but but I I I right now I
want to do it with react first and I'll
do Redux and then I'll do react native
after I build a project or two I'd
rather do projects right I like building
things and so I think the best way to
actually learn is to build something so
that's what my tutorials are gonna be
I'm gonna draw a lot of inspiration from
traversée media he I recently talked to
him I said hey how do you get your your
project ideas and he kind of let me know
and it basically at the end of the day I
kind of have to find my whole way of
doing it but uh I will probably I'm
gonna try to do one coding tutorial a
week in the near future sorry dude I
hate April why do you hate my girlfriend
have I tried Python I've had some
coursework in the past in Python and
Boston I've also built
game in it using the PI game library
during that course it's one of the only
courses in college I actually enjoyed be
honest with you because of the way it
was set up can a person call can a
person call myself a developer fee only
works with WordPress and Wix you can
call himself a wordpress and Wix
developer when you go back to school you
have to take Python or Java course I I'm
not quite sure what language they're
going to be teaching what do you think
about being a web developer in a third
world country I think I have no business
answering that question to be honest
with you I only would say I can probably
accurately reflect my views on the
United States market anything else I'd
be talking about would just be out of my
butt what I can't say is that I've
worked with a lot of developers at my
old job that were on visas I know they
hired they hired a lot of people as well
through agencies to help them out with
certain aspects of the project but
that's about all I can say I don't want
I hate I hate people who just start
talking to other their ass just because
they get a question asked it's okay guys
so there's think it's okay to say I
don't know I don't know this is why I
dunno but the rest of it I don't know um
how old am i hey girl how old are you
know um I am 29
I would be thirty in two months so help
me I'm feeling old two months in three
weeks just to keep it straight I'm still
I'm still in 20s baby um that's music to
listen to when coding I listen to a lot
of trap I listen a lot of anime remixes
a lot of gaming remixes you're actually
inspiration keep it work well thank you
man I I just try to I guess now I'm just
trying to share my life of code that's
basically it man I try to share my my
perspectives on things try to share my
my experiences and just trying to get
better and provide you stuff provides
the best way best stuff I can I look 21
um all right
hey man I got no problem with sin Elton
John but it ain't on the get lit coding
code and jams playlist I promise you
you're more likely to see like the
yugioh trap remix the Kingdom Hearts
simple and clean you might see you might
see the what else would be on there the
Zelda sandstorm trap remix those are the
type of things you see on the play list
22:21 it's so I do have somewhat of a
babyface at times when I'm clean-shaven
but but also part of it is I have braces
right now so I have a the braces will be
off into five months and you guys will
tell me I hope I look old as um so
so we've been gone about an hour now
guys this is our every thousand
subscriber livestream quick shout out to
Ricky and Chris ox who are fellow coding
youtubers I hope if you aren't already
subbed that you go show them some love
we're all in this together right we're
all doing what we can we're all trying
to put out good vibes into the software
world we're all trying to share our
experiences and hope that they do good
and you know you have you have guys like
Chris who I want reversi media and
Derrick bonus and you know the new
Boston and we and you got John who's
Hugh yeah it started with software now

nothing left to go around with that
being said guys we do these every
thousand subscribers so so thank you
Chris for the suberino
thank you guys for watching and I look

promise you that much and we'll do this
again at 25,000 and we do give waste now
every Monday Wednesday Friday I want to
give you guys a course because you have
given me so much so thank you everybody
for watching thank you for being here
and I like to I like to end my live
streams with what I call a final thought
and and so I'll leave you with this in
regards to today's video today I talked
about my life for the last
two-and-a-half years my life for three
years and and it was it was awkward I'll
be honest with you so I it was it's
awkward sharing something that's
personal and part of I started that
video talking about how I was in a mood
I was I was feeling kind of down right
usually I'm pretty happy upbeat person
for the most part but everyone so I you
know we all get in our funks and so what
I did was I started free-riding I
started using started doing what I know
that could help me cope with whatever I
was going through at the time two months
ago and reflecting on on how far you
have gotten you know a lot of us may not
be where we want to be myself included
I'm not where I want to be but we have
to be glad where we're at and if you can
kind of accept the fact that that you
may not be where you want to be but
you're working hard to get there and
when you get there you get that that bit
of success or you get that that goal
that you work so hard for you're not
gonna be where you want to be either
because you know that there's better and
keep doing better and keep working
harder and so there's a quote that I
came across and it was in one of those
motivation videos but it really struck
with me he said the harder you work the
harder it is to accept failure so if you
guys work hard you won't take failure as
an option so hope you guys aren't taking
for
often I'm not I'm trying my hardest I
appreciate you all watching and welcome
to the 1000 new subscribers and shout
out to all the coding channels Chris
Hawkes traversing media Kristin leak
who's a good friend of mine she's doing
well so thank you so much for watching
I'll see you guys at 25,000 bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
