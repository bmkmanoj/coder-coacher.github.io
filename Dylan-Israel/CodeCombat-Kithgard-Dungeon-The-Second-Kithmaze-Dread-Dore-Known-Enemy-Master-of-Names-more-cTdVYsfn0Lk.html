back in the kids guard dungeon second
coming
kiss mace basic loop and while loops so
our basic syntax in while loops so
should be similar to what we've been
doing thus far navigate the maze okay so
it's almost exactly like the last level
so we're just gonna have to set it up a
little bit more in our own so if you
remember correctly we're gonna set up a
while loop in our wallet we're gonna say
a condition like if if some number is
equal to this run our while loop until
that number it's not equal this in this
case we're just gonna set true so all we
want to do here is say while this is
true move right our hero then move up
our hero because we were on move right
move up move right move down and the
whole maze follows that pattern so we're
we're good to go at that point
so let's go around and test our logic
move right move up we right move down
right right then I so pretty
straightforward it'll eventually hit the
end here we'll collect all our gems and
we'll be good to go very nice it looks
like we're getting a new item here our
fake fur hat don't want to get PETA
upset so we have our thought faux faux
fur hat I believe it's how you're
supposed to say
so our Davy Crockett hat here dread door
basics and tax want loops and strings
hi let's see what this does this gives
us more health so we're a little bit
tankier I have to say I love whoever did
the animations on this sort of stuff so
all we want to do is destroy the door
and then we want to get the chest so
we're not quite sure how many hits the
door takes so what we'll do is we'll
just set up a while loop and we'll say
hero dot attack and then we just want to
put door in there so just beat on this
door until there's an ax door to beat on
I am and get up give us our chess pretty
straightforward so no an enemy doesn't
look like we needing equipped anything
your hero must survive your self-taught
attack cry it is the same as enemy is
equal to cry itself to attack
okay so they want us to use variables
you see right here if they have a VAR
enemy one and every two enemy three and
then you just have us attack like this
so we can we can kind of follow the same
pattern once a look here in doubt attack
enemy three or Ursa we're gonna need to
talk them twice right now they take
three and they take two attacks to die
so I'll do it enemy three and since
that's all we're concerned about I
believe that should be it so attack line
TAC two TAC three nice so all three
ogres died
we're gonna get a new item here with
crude glasses looking pretty baller I
almost bought a pair of wear glasses the
other day I thought they were pretty
silent let's see this gives us a new
function that's going to allow our
object or our hero to find the nearest
enemy
so essentially we'll be able to target
the nearest enemy based off of this
function so does having it enter the
name we're gonna then store the value
all right cool
so you'll see here create a variable
call it enemy one now we're going with
our new function we're gonna find the
nearest enemy happens to be this guy we
don't need to know their names anymore
we then want to attack that guy then we
want to find the nearest enemy to attack
that guy twice and so here we'll say
look there's three enemies we want our
here to find the nearest one and then we
want to have him attack the nearest one
now there's probably a better way of
doing this in a wall loop
oh I was like what is that in here
aardvark alright so hero dot attack
enemy 3 right now we're not gonna worry
about doing this in a wallet worry about
that and future examples alright
pretty straightforward they give you a
lot of help on this one
collector Jam select your experience and
move on
lowly kitman so basic syntax and
variables we want our guide not to die
as in every objective collect the gems
and kill the nurse enemy
we will attack it alright so as of right
now they just want us to create a second
variable in the tacit so let's go ahead
and just copy pasta this over we'll call
it will change this to enemy two and
then we want to attack enemy two twice
that will get that will kill both these
guys let's see what we're a hit
hero returns two and then we can
calculate them so always is going to
return to our guy here so we can move
down move right move right so after we
do that we want to move down down move
right move right it's gonna run that
kill kill them both move down oh I moved
down too many times my mistake I only
need to move down once right move right
there we go so really the thing to take
from away from this video is being able
to store variables and understanding the
interactions that functions have with
objects so everything that we're doing
you're really thinking with a hero do I
not get this what happened
say nighty-night
saying I did not complete this all right
I don't happen there we go alright guys
so in the next video we'll be going over
closing distance and it looks like we're
getting close to the end so depending on
how hard this kiss card mastery is it
