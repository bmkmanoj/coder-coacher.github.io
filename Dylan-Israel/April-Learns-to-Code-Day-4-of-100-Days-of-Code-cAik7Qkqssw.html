we are on what they do are we on there
we're on day four for you don't count
day zero technically on day four so
we're on day four um when we stopped we
were working on JavaScript that's where
we're going to resume today what have
you worked on today to catch everybody
up
I just been working on my portfolio page
I'm really good a good chance to go
through what we had through yesterday
because you came home early and then we
went shopping afterwards so how much
time would you say you studied today why
I feel like as close to 30 minutes I
know you told me all right so you send
about hour and 21 I'm just trying to
catch a lie here no but uh all right so
you're gonna be saying I actually
started an hour in 30 minutes no I think
that's it yeah that's it yeah I think
he's study more than say I so um I said
we're gonna resume our JavaScript stuff
and you're going to continue working on
your portfolio and study javascript in
are you gonna try and get your
two-and-a-half hour soloing today do
another hour oh yeah no I'm not done
okay cool that's good to hear I want to
catch up on my notes from you from
yesterday and I guess I'll do today's
knows too although I don't really want
to do today's notes I know sorry
sometimes you got power through it the
hardest part is sticking to it
that's the hardest part of a software is
just forcing yourself even when you're
tired I am extremely tired but yet here
we are
you know all right so let's get start
we're back in basic JavaScript using
bracket notation so remember how we're
saying you could use the brackets of an
array to find defined
okay to find out what that item is like
the it starts at the zero index remember
that so you can do something similar for
a string where here what you're doing is
you can find out what the character is
of that string so you see how we have
our first name variable and it has a DA
on here a de a de and so if we did first
name zero what's going to come back Anna
no no remember that we're treating these
as characters so this is 0 this is 1 and
this is 2 oh so you don't need plus
signs in between those no no no this is
just a string yeah so um your your
string variables are set up so that if I
wanted to know just a single character I
could do that let's say you only wanted
to know the first character of a string
so make it make sense yeah make sense I
don't see you what oh okay yes make
sense like say you wanted to capitalize
the first letter of every word this
would be one way that you could target
it and check it right okay so if we
wanted to in this case we want to get
the first cat we want to get a capital L
from last name Lovelace
what would we attach to the last name to
here to store it into this variable
first letter of last name what would be
on here
using the bracket notation maybe a L so
it would be zero okay and the brackets
right yeah good welcome James welcome
Neil all right let's see here understand
string immutability
so one thing to note is you can't go and
change so remember we're talking about
string literals remember you're saying
what students in a string a string
literals and I say the same thing so
what that means is that even though we
can target to get the value of a string
like the first letter we can't actually
go and change it that way if we wanted
to change the string we have to change
the whole string d'Orsay won't say no so
that the example here say you see jello
world right so we're trying to change
that to hello world and we can't
actually do that by just trying to
target this it doesn't that's not how it
works we can get the value but we can't
set the value that way in the strings
okay
my way okay so you can only get things
you can't change things with the string
like the only variables can give values
yes so if we wanted to change this to
hello world what would we do to this
you create a new variable we can change
this variable right to be correct and
then we just reset the string like this
you have to reset the whole string if
you want to change it
well guess you're not getting anything
you're actually making a variable yes
we're not making a variable were
assigning the new value all right okay
yes
okay so yeah we've so far we've only
shown that hey we can only we can get
the first character but you may want to
get a different character in this case
what you turn in my chair all right uh
um so in this case we want to get the V
so what index would we get using bracket
notation which one would that be if we
want to get this V out of Lovelace -
good because it starts at zero right
bodacious you like that they have fun
little things only alright so this is
going to be an interesting one thank you
yeah he's crying he misses his mama you
mom in here okay at the doors over and
he misses me by the way Achilles yeah
Papaji
well out of himself all right so
remember how we we so we just got the
first letter right using zero now how
might we dynamically get the last letter
and remember we know how to find the
length of a string right and when you
just okay so there's like a shortcut to
this not a shortcut but like let's say
we don't know what a user's exactly so
so the way that we would find the last
letter would in our bracket we can
actually do equations as well as long as
it returns a number so remember the
length function y a dot length gives you
how many characters are like now why do
you think we need to have this minus 1
to get the last because character that's
right so even though there's three
letters in this this last and that the
length length is always going to start
at one two three right yeah so we have
to minus 1 to get the last character
[Laughter]
good job a you would not believe how
hard this comes like this for people
sometimes uh suggestion Jarek ass is in
teaching someone else how to code from
the bottom up Dylan how does this make
you look back on ways you could have
improved the ways you taught yourself
how to code
um one thing I would have done
differently Joshua that I've done
recently is I've hired tutors in my
experience in one hour you can learn the
ins and outs of things that may take you
five to ten hours I'd probably the
biggest thing which is why god when I'm
glad you like it yeah um catcha shit
which is why I I would probably change
that I would hire more tutors now at the
time I didn't have the money
right so that was the biggest difference
but in a perfect world if I did have the
cash I'd hire tutors um I would probably
I probably would have printed out more
cheat sheets as well um to keep track
early on uh lot notes like actual cheat
sheets that people have made so hey just
reminder sheets and things like that and
I'm gonna do stuff like that all right
um yeah let's uh let's continue on so uh
in this last name we want to get the e
of love lace um how would we how would
we get it want to get last names last
character what is what are we putting
inside here do you do that the same
formula isn't it yeah just tell me
last name dot length minus one good job
and I had a really weird thought last
night I thought to myself oh my god what
if I went blind I would have to knew all
this stuff by speech it's really weird
thought but that's where my head goes
when I think about boot camps I think
they're great man I think I I think we
live in a skill based job society and I
mean to give you an example go based job
society you think well technical skill
well there's very few jobs left guys
good-paying jobs and you have to have a
technical hard skill for most of them um
and that's why even though
April's an English major and you know
she's not going to go to a boot camp and
she's gonna be self-taught she'll do
just fine once she gets going why nots
in April to boot camp we have thought
about it um just we have zero debt and
it would cost
like 10 grand it would cost about 10
grand and honestly I think I can teach
her in a hundred days to get her going
not like teacher to be a full-stack
developer in 100 days but I think in a
hundred days if she sticks with it she
could get an internship and go from
there I've never bought a course there's
so many free resources I never bought
one so uh yeah even uh I heard Google
came out with a course - yeah all right
um
free free course all right so um if we
want to get this see how would we get it
well I get that last character do we
know how in this case we do but that
shouldn't matter we're using using the
same sort of that would be - too good so
hard typing up on hand after a full
day's work of typing with one hand what
how do you need to be to get internship
I've known interns as young as 14 hey
bit code what's going on 14 that's
pretty cool yep 14 can you imagine
oh my god yeah the guy was way better
than me is embarrassing all right my ass
is that that guy with the most things
like oh no oh all right so word blanks
so now now we're on kind of a this is
like a mini so you remember mad libs
yeah so we're gonna play a little Mad
Libs game okay so we're going to do
string concatenation now in this in this
case what we're doing is rimmer eyes
telling you what a function is so this
is an example of a function where you
can call it like this and you pass in
parameters these are variables basically
just data that we're passing directly in
they're not stored anywhere but we're
passing it in so that we can use it in
our
function okay and then we go over
function okay okay so a function is a
set of code that's reusable and the way
that we call it is with the name of the
function these parentheses and then
sometimes we have what are called
parameters which this dog lines up with
my noun and goes in order so that's how
you know what each one of these
represents let me give you a better
example something easier say we wanted a
another superchef should be up did not
go off it's there at least on my page
say
so parameters let's let's let's so say
we had this function called add hmm I
would try refreshing your page bit code
maybe they load in but let's say we have
this function called add now no matter
what code we put in here unless we call
add to run it will never do anything so
right here we're just kind it's like a
definition but we never actually say the
word it just is defined okay so in this
case when we have add as an English
major that sounds totally awful okay all
right so in this case we have num1 and
num2 there's a there's a link to donate
in the description as well I believe for
the stream labs I think yeah but thank
you either way man they'll sweat it so
we have these numbers no one in them -
and all we want to do is add them
together so we have this return what
this does is it gives us the value back
and the reason you may want to do that
is because you're going to use it for
something else but it's not holding it
anywhere uh no but kind of think of it
as it's just you're sending it you're
sending it back and forth to be used
it's really monkey in the middle
kind of like you may store this in a
variable so we're going to return number
one plus number two now the way that we
actually use this function or call the
function is we do it by simply the frame
rate our function name these parenthesis
and a semicolon after to let it know
that we're done with this piece of code
and say we wanted to add the number two
and the number three this would then
return us the number one plus number two
in this case would be five and we could
if we wanted to store it and you know
call this VAR total
into a variable like so now depends on
what your function is doing but this is
one way that we could do it are you
getting it no okay okay I need something
that what would you use it on the
calculator for instance so in this case
we want to add two numbers in the
calculator and now we want to we never
know how many times we're going to add
maybe we're going to add a game again
and again and that's why this adding to
three we could do total is plus equal to
two three and then we could call it
again and again and again and again and
so what we're doing this is this is this
is the bulk of programming you are
you're creating code that you can reuse
as many times as you want okay but what
is the difference from what we've used
prior to this like why do you need this
why can't you just have variables and
call them and the well you're going to
be doing all of that but you're going to
be doing it in here and so it's so that
you can reuse it because there's no way
to actually you know how like we've been
doing a little bit pieces like those
other pieces that we've seen you can
only use them once yes because we didn't
put them in a function oh my god that's
such a waste of code okay
well that's why you have functions this
is like IRRI cycle on a literal base
yeah so you use functions so that you
can reuse it yeah and it allows it to
call it so like let's see what school
signs mmm so let's say we wanted to when
we click add a called the add function
there's no other way for us to call it
on that click you have to define it's
interesting that they had to come up
with
function so that it can be continuously
reused from because you can't do it
otherwise that's so weird like so um
alright so let's now that we've kind you
kind of get the point of functions huh
yeah all right and function just is
recycle it it's a way for you to recycle
your code and use it again and again
yeah so like in this case word blanks or
add we can use as many times as we call
way cycle yeah and we call it just like
by its name right here okay and pass in
whatever parameters now they don't have
to have parameters okay so like maybe we
had a function called me out and all it
did was when we called it it played a
meows and right like it's just made my
day
yeah and so it wouldn't have any like we
already knew what the meow sound was
gonna be and so we put it in here and
then in me out every time you clicked on
something and so I do that for my
portfolio yeah what the fuck all right
um what super chat super chat is a way
for you to donate through YouTube it's a
it's like a donation thing it's like um
yeah that's basically the equivalent of
it's a donation thing yeah it's you you
can you donate and then your message
will actually come up on the screen as
well as it will its guide like you saw
how people subscribe I'll play a little
song and then your message will stay at
the top depending on how long hey 4k is
the way thank you bit code so your shirt
there's your super chat and also doctor
PC it's also uh will play your message
in here um I remember when you did that
I thought I was so cool but I don't get
to hear them because you
is on me okay what worked for me is like
math look at code as a new language oh
yeah no I'm most definitely trying to
I'm actually trying to learn a few
languages on Thomas like actual like
German and stuff so I'm totally relating
it to understanding a new language all
right it's just instead of learning to
speak it I'm learning to rate it which
is harder for me so in this case what we
want to do is remember how we had um
okay so right now for the word blanks
you can insert new parameters as you
recycle yeah it's a word blanks we are
going to so let's say like Mad Libs you
can make as many Mad Libs as you want in
the one if you if you could fill out the
form multiple times right um what's the
max age range for an internship
there's no max man it'll be harder if
you're older and it'll be harder if
you're younger you just got to go for it
man yeah you're gonna get uh there's a
saying in English classes that all of my
English professors have told me I'll get
like a thousand nose before you get one
yes but statistically there's actually a
statistic saying out there that after so
many knows you're guaranteed a yes it's
like what what is it called the averages
or something like that a lot of averages
yeah all right so we want to concatenate
last night okay so how would we do that
using result we have result and we want
to set this equal to and and we have to
have a space in between each one of them
how are we gonna do
so we want to concatenate
yes we never used result before just a
variable they created it's not it's
nothing special it's just but it's like
look what don't freeze are called
parameters this is wit remember this
one's dog this one's big this one's are
an essence quickly no I get that but
like you need do the plus signs I know
that so we have to I give you the first
one all right I get you guys I did it so
what is what is mine now in this case
and what is that parameter what is the
string value of that parameter say it
loud dog good and so okay but it doesn't
it doesn't have a space right yeah well
doesn't have like dog as its value yes
dogs its value think it's a thing cuz
this has a variable that's not okay
that's for okay so it's not a variable
but it has a new parameter to be used
multiple times
yes so it's a variable for the for the
image you just want it to be a variable
why cuz it's called a new parameter
that's not a very it's there it's on new
parameters as a parameter and what so
this parameter only exists while this
code runs it's like we're resetting this
is imagine this is a variable and here
we're setting it and then it runs in
here and then it's going I guess it's a
ghost killing me all right all right so
first eat always recycle now you tell me
does it even exist
I supposed to think all right so so far
we have dog and a space what would we do
next
why do we have a space because that's
what the it asks for it just wants to
have it all go out so does it not come
with spaces no it doesn't remember oh
yeah yeah yeah okay
okay so my adjectives and what is my
adjective big good now what are we doing
next
that plus line quotations with the stays
go another plus sign and you just
continue it like that good and was this
called again that we're doing right now
no no that remember baby that's just a
function but work was a string action
that we're doing that we did yesterday
and we're doing right now calm okay
concatenate on the string good and our
function is a bit of reusable code and
when we return result what's going to
happen here is this return light this
return word this is a special word so
don't it there's certain words and in
programming this is special we're not
blushing they start wars in programming
of course it is that you can't use
because if they're predefined as part of
the language right so you wouldn't
create a variable called function like
that word yesterday that I actually
meant return enter
No so don't use return don't use your
turn return so we return does is exactly
what it sounds like
it returns your variable so in this case
what is it returning which is white say
it's a fur dog quickly good dog big rain
quickly don't you want big dog ran
quickly
oh we it wanted us to actually put words
in here dog ba it is this isn't a great
example I'm just putting words in here
of test 1 and test 2 is not too fine
okay so they want
and because it's a function we can rerun
these things as many times as we want so
this is going to run it one time and
then this is going to run another time
with new new parameters
test wanna test you is not defined
alright so I'm going to reset this
because I think I think the beta is
fucking up right now
there you
cool so
we're on to a race this is exciting
arrays are a big deal I actually think
that I know a little bit about it but I
may be wrong all right
so arrays are lists they store so far
we've only been dealing with things that
store one thing right
really yeah so even though we're adding
those variables together concatenate me
at the end the result is just one long
string so you may be talking like a
paragraph now yeah thank you
so well no no in terms of the eraser in
terms of the string what you just saying
so when we add the numbers it's add just
four plus five plus three plus two and
you get one answer back
you get one answer you get one sentence
will you get one number in that case or
ones that one sentence it's not like you
have a bunch of values read or
a bunch of sentences now an array will
store a bunch of values so like right
here if this was a string would be john
xxiii however in this case it's john
john's its own value on the zero index
and 23 is its own value on the one index
okay
yeah and as because it's variable holds
one value erase whole bunch so you can
put a variable with an array an array is
a variable array can't and the rate can
be a variable you're gonna take a notice
by the way no because we got to fast I
don't want to write something that I'm
gonna miss understand so I like to go
back over it well if you misunderstand
it like we can slow down how are we how
can I help
I'm just gonna eat just gonna be here
watching me write shit down that's fine
no because I just do it when I go over
by myself and then if I need a
clarification alone I'll scale want to
kill you I uh alright so we've talked
about a race and kilowatt um so one
thing in a race as you notice we can
actually have different types of values
in there as well we have a string and we
have a number you're gonna have like
symbols and all boolean objects we can
even have another an array in there
which is a look of course we can why can
you how can you have another
how can you have another way in there um
like another separate list yeah so like
I give you an example so say we wanted
to see so what index is this a stream
know what index I don't know what is an
index the spot in the list a spot in the
array let's start yeah zero so what one
index is 23 23 is considerable number
what yeah 23 has its own spot what is 1
all right
and what is this new array 0 no no what
is what index is this new array good now
how do you think we would get this value
right here two point zero zero point two
close you have the right idea and then
this one it represents a 1 index of that
and this one represents a two index of
that so let's say we wanted to get that
one and we would we'll just calm it like
this we would say our it's Jordan
variable right or we'd use it and we say
our array what was the first index that
from this is index to get the whole
thing one two so if we just wanted to
return that array we could get it like
that now if we wanted to get and this is
referred to as a two dimensional ring
and so you can get into as many reps as
you want and so at work I've gone down
as deep as 10 what do you need 10
because you returned a lot of times what
you'll get back is what's called in JSON
which is just stands for JavaScript
object notation which is a long document
of data yeah sounds
and so it's stuff that comes from a
database and that has various things and
it gets more and more complicated as you
go down for it sounds fun
so in this case we have with we have is
it's it's a very complex thing when
you're just getting started but here if
we just wanted now we're on the 2 index
which gives us this whole thing now what
will we put in to get that final 2 to
point to take note there's no two point
two it's just remember it's just like -
so this goes for the first index which
is this whole thing that's - that leads
us here oh you put another two in
exactly and you just treat it like it's
another array which it is so when you
were gonna call like the tenth one you
would have to be like yeah exactly
yeah we're going pretty pretty quick
icecream truck tire you guys heard that
yeah we're both like what is that sound
that guy comes around like all the time
not have we once bought ice cream from
him I should have fucked up thing right
a serve ice cream yeah uh all right so
you see the Vans a little sketchy like I
like my life alright so the first item
in my array should be a string
so we'll put my name which is Dylan and
then the second item should be a number
this is all we're learning here is a
little my age all we're learning here is
that you can have multiple things in an
array 29 woof
um this is exactly what we were talking
about a second ago that we can nest a
one array into another yes so we'll do
the same thing I'm just assuming zero
something simple you gotta do it I
thought it was side by side huh what do
you mean side by side I thought the
other one you do with side by side I
don't understand you put brackets around
this one and then a second bracket here
there is no be a bracket there and then
space we have a second set right here ah
si si and look you can see how it kind
of lines up yeah I get it but I thought
the last one look like this know it like
you like you say that all right um so
we've talked about accessing a rate
array data with indexes now remember how
we were saying that you couldn't change
a string yes you're accessing arrays
that have indexes by very nice that's
what we've been doing when I said how do
we trace from this one to that one right
that's an index yeah so 0 index 1 index
2 index so where these are located in
the array yeah is there index spot so
this is a zero index this is a
it doesn't end apparently and then we
have the second index so when we call
our array zero right here we're going to
50 right 50 yes on the zero index is a
slash slash equals 50 a prenup no that's
a common remember the coments yeah yeah
this is just to let you know because
otherwise if you didn't have such an
excellent tutor here telling you about
this you may be confused since you get
it
good job ah see you don't need those
fellas no all right so my data should
equal the first value of my array all
right so we're in create a variable here
called my data and we want it to be the
first value of my array so what are we
setting my data equal to my array and
then using bracket notation right
what is the array value you could be
first a value of my ring
the first yeah if you're saying first
you want number 1 not 0
no because the zero may be 0
yeah the 0 index is the first value now
if I said I wanted the second value if I
wanted the or if I wanted the second
index and the 2 is gay
got my finger hurts all right um so
remember how we couldn't actually change
the character of a string using bracket
notation you lied to me we can change it
in a race weekend so you can't do it in
strings but you can do it in a race so
here why would you tell me that and then
take it back
nice so what I said was for Strings I'm
not taking it back it's still true for
strings but it's different for a race
why um
because of the way that it's too
complicated of an answer to keep it to
give you to give you the truth so if we
wanted to reset the value of just one
part of the array will you do that by
targeting the index so in our array here
in this example we remember 0 index 1
and X 2 and X so our array 1 index is 64
we're actually setting this to 45 so now
our array equals 18 45 million that's
cool yeah and so so the printout would
be 1845 99 yes that's the new evalu of
our array alright so if we wanted my
array to equal 45 $64.99
how do we change that we're changing 99
no $64.99 or correct we're changing 18
so how would we go about 45 yes it would
be easier good so we would say my array
myarray bracket 0 is equal to 45 right
so right yeah I'm okay
you sure taught the our rating up there
excuse me mm I thought that was changing
it
this changes our array we're talking
about my array Oh gotcha
all right
so we talked about this briefly and we
talked about having multiple arrays so
this is a two-dimensional right this is
also a two-dimensional array because
it's array with an array another
two-dimensional array and now a three
dimensional Reda mention already here
because the array within an array within
an array good and we would call that an
array
I would I will be very impressed if like
I can do this so what what are you tryna
if you can get I will be very impressed
if you can get that number twelve on
your on your first try so how you have
my my data right there what are you
doing to get that best
you keep talking
right
not there's another another bracket
thing on the end so you're saying like
this is that what you're saying yeah no
on the end it's part of that it's part
of the three so you have a four
dimensional right here in something that
we feel is a three dimensional are know
that no yeah it's a good trial oh wait
um so you were right and that you needed
more brackets but remember we had a
three dimensional array so we only
needed three sets of buckets so why
don't we start there okay what is this
you're right here of it that's this one
this one that one yes that would be
correct and then this one is yeah well
not that but you have to that's what
you're trying to get it's not zero
though it's not yeah so remember the
second zero would be this one
yes why are you calling this one one you
want this one I'm not that's what the
answer was I was expecting to change
those values did that confuse you
yeah okay I thought I was right uh-uh
all right so so now that we right so
this is right so this thing this is all
the first array zero and zero so if we
want to get to here that's the next one
what is it now follow the commas right
zero one two two three good and then
what is this to get 12 good so that
would be how we would get you made it
sound like I was so fucking far away I
was very close baby and software close
doesn't cut it
I get that well as in I was just it's
all about time you did good love it I
saw how do we get eight
I should I think you're right and I'm
wrong like I just fucked that up
yeah yeah you were right
is that a good it doesn't make any sense
uh there's a dark screen on yeah I
fucked up my bad
so yeah cuz that's why I was asking cuz
the last one that we call when you're
calling within was I'm tired I'm bad
baby
so I so tired that's a big excuse so
here like to get this one this is to get
this one it'd be zero index then to get
this whole thing it would be zero again
and to get the one two three so you're
right good job I was wrong so the actual
correct answer to get this number guys
is zero three zero okay that's how you
get twelve
sorry about that guys um sorry Achilles
say yo man I wanna go outside here
alright um so to get ate what it would
how do we date yeah the dark three theme
is only in the beta guys ah zero hello
hey big boy it's you up for you feel hot
zero for this whole thing okay zero for
this one we're trying to get one number
eight what we do need it eventually now
we only need zero no I know that
you know number it is rank you just say
- what wrong it's one cheer shut up it's
a trick question
right
big code it's taking me a second to
process this
so zero to one Wells wrong am I going
crazy
wait okay let's see zero zero one two
zero one
zero zero zero one two one you're
missing a zero or not it's not working
my boat am I gonna insane right now
zero this whole array
so Kevin you're saying to one yep am I
just being coming bad I shit I'm
becoming bad baby
I forgot we don't count this one why not
because it it's an array of objects so I
was right the first time and I got all
fucking confused ah you're right Chris
because you don't count that because
it's just an array it's not the zero
index oh damn it
you're the matrix yeah yeah I haven't
woken up anymore babe all right we'll
leave it on there
and then we'll wrap up right now so
we're about 50 minutes in you got to see
a full salary developer fuck up on an
array index enjoy that savor the moment
yeah someone's gonna send this to my
boss to be like hey hey you guys are
hiring it'll be me he's gonna put me out
of job like this I got a long day all
right baby so we had a little bit of fun
there um you got to see me struggle even
see even I you don't give my brain
twisted for a minute here there yeah I
know I see you rein twist all the time
so so I could not have been a better
response but any I think it's important
note guys um is that you know sometimes
you're tired you make mistakes but even
if you're not tired you make mistakes
um oh yeah most definitely I mean if
you're looking at a shaytanic code I can
only imagine
like I missed a syntaxerror the other
day like come on I know that's gonna be
me though that's why I really want to
get good at debugging is because I know
about that is like my weakest you may
because that's one of the highest hiring
rates for entry-level jobs this QA
engineering oh yeah so you got see me
struggling a little bit uh alongside my
love here um so what's your game plan
for tomorrow you want show up hey you
want show off your what you have fun
your for full-year only till it's done
yeah you just show what you got so far
oh you guys get a sneak peak about what
she's working on in the background I
believe you've set up your menu right
yeah so she got the white boards I'm
trying to start out pretty simple so
this is my menu and then this is kind of
like my links to all my other accounts
that I'm going to put up here ignore
that that's just something I was doing
and this is kind of like the color
scheme I'm trying to stick to so there's
that alright the show me show much you
have so far which i think is actually
pretty good um yeah I thought you were
going to tell me I was terrible or
something mm-hmm you showed to the
webcam so can you guys see that's her
menu off to the side so far that she has
oh that's good there it's cute um my the
hardest thing I was having with this
portfolio page is that uh I could not
decide I want it to look like and I've
looked at the example and this is the
example I know it's clean and I just
hate it it's not actually it's a bad
example is very dumbed down compared to
what it used to be right oh yeah I hated
it I saw and I was like this is stupid
who would make this so I was going
a bunch of portfolio pages actually that
some people would have like rated and
stuff like that and I was going through
them and I think I mentioned this
yesterday but I just I don't know I just
uh uh so much of it was just like blah
and you're like raving about it like oh
I love it good stuff but it's like now
I'm looking at mine and I'm like I feel
the same way so maybe it's just like all
in my head but I don't like any of them
to be honest I can't decide on a
portfolio page I'm just like waiting for
that like spritz of inspiration and it's
just not coming to me and well that's
why you design your own and in terms of
pseudocode we haven't really gotten
pseudocode yet um I think once we get to
the algorithms that's when we'll start
talking about pseudocode and once she's
worked through she's kind of already
doing it like I mean it's not really
pseudocode type you know drawing out
your picture but getting cusp getting
comfortable using white boards and
drawing out and visualizing it is is uh
is kind of how I would suggest for her
to do pseudocode draw it out
visualize it think about it and look at
it and that's that's really what the
benefit of pseudocode is for you and
when you're just getting started right
so when when we get to the basic
algorithms she's going to be that little
white board is going to be replaced by
my six-foot white board over there and
she's just gonna be staring blank eyed
at it and it's gonna be it's gonna be an
interesting experience for her um
because I'm not going to help at all
so I never do hi because you have to
really struggle through those things -
laughs I'm not gonna stroll just gonna
fucking fly to that he's gonna feel like
a dumb shit dad is that how it's gonna
be yeah and you're gonna have a unibrow
at that point why am I gonna have a
unibrow cuz I'm not gonna pluck them
anymore
is that it shit just put me on blast
like that hey I'm looking at dribble
calm these are actually really cool
um thank you again to bit code who's
consistently donated like $5 for each
stream which is dope because at a
hundred streams that continues on I'll
actually have enough for a four came on
or Anna for you five dollars out of face
so I appreciate that if you guys haven't
already make sure to join the Facebook
group code tech and caffeine the link is
in the description
we're over twelve hundred strong now and
growing by like thirty a day I think I'm
growing almost as fast on that you're
like go ahead dance we're going free
they're gumming pretty good um and
hopefully we can keep growing the
channel and the group and um and if you
want to support me you can don't you
need a 4k video card I have a 4k video
card I have a gtx 1080 TI yeah so um I
got a big a big boys video card um turns
out size really does matter doesn't
graphics cards those for sure
I think we've five pounds yeah this
thing is heavy
um but yeah yeah so uh what did I miss
everything
miss uh do you actually find pseudocode
helpful sometimes I sketch out real code
segments on paper and stuff for
complicated problems never tried to use
gioco really um I think everyone this is
the thing I think pseudocode like your
notes is it's if it's for you you can do
it in whatever fashion you want I kind
of write words out and arrows and
pointers and I mix in actual code but at
the end of the day it represents code I
know what I'm looking at so compendium I
would say as if you're working alone a
lot of us when we're learning we are and
a lot of times even if you're not your
people can follow your code especially
if you have the same level or your
pseudocode so for
me i i rarely write pseudo-code unless
i'm solving an algorithm um so I I think
just write you write whatever works for
you that's that's my advice
well don't worry Jordan it's all going
to be up man all these live streams are
up up every time but as always guys
Facebook group as I mentioned support me
on patreon comm slash coding tutorials
360 if you want support me there another
great way for us to upgrade the channel
4k and you know I want to actually get
some lights in here the lighting is
actually pretty bad half my face is dark
half my faces well it's all pretty pale
but happenin half of its half of its
paler than the other right um when we
move into and I evade yeah when uh for
those of you don't know where we're
actually moving in about five weeks four
weeks and exactly you know in four weeks
we'll be moving and I'll have my office
all to myself again so I can set up my
green screen and some lights and stuff
like that so I'm hoping to do that yeah
I'll be packing the house and moving it
it moves in four weeks man I'm hoping
this is no longer here or else I'm gonna
have to hire some guys to move um yeah
it's gonna suck Oh Compendium that was
yours I read I read the first paragraph
of it I I wasn't able to finish it
because I I was at work I just scanned
it I approved it and I scanned the first
paragraph so this is dope I'm gonna go
back and read the rest of it I'm glad
I'm glad that you did that though man I
appreciate you doing that stuff like
that I always really like I like hearing
about people's interests and and like
you know what happens in real life right
real life example so how's the finger
it's fucked up man they cut shit out
they cut
this is never good oh I don't know
I I go in Tuesday and all uh they're
gonna see make sure everything's okay
it's probably all right I just don't
know like it doesn't hurt
it just feels numb and it feels like you
know it feels like it feels like you
ever been stuck in a car for 12 hours
and you finally get out and shit's just
kind of like whoo that's what it feels
like like it hasn't moved in 12 fucking
days
well done i interviewed a guy and he
hung up after I asked the first question
me just be like I don't know that like
so here's a here's a funny story um now
I'll end on funny story the my good
friend van who's done my logo and and
I'm actually going to probably be
working with him on starting a developer
store and you know sell stickers and
mouse pads and things like that and
he'll design a lot of it and oh yeah so
he was hiring for his graphic design
shop he works at um and and the guy had
a great portfolio
he had a great resume he he talked all
the right things he had some good
talking points as I hired the guy and um
so like two three days in he's not
really doing what they expect him to do
but you know it's your first week there
no big deal so the guy goes he's on his
third day and he he goes hey I'm gonna
go grab lunch
all right cool no big deal drives off in
his car and then uh my buddy van gets a
text message that says hey graphic
design is hard by the way I'm not coming
back
and so I van thinks that all his job
references were fake
all his um all his uh oh hey Dennis
Thank You Man
Depp Destiny $10 favor Wow
thank you sir that's gonna go a long way
um
thanks for doing what you do man you
heard it there baby oh they love you yes
give him a zombie uh I should I should
make that more coding related well yeah
so the guy just bounced after two days
and like apparently his portfolio was
all fucked up and faked and his uh his
um his references were probably just
lies and I think he probably used
Photoshop one time as like yo man I can
just wing this shit um but uh that's my
graphic design story about the guy who
jumped out today's two days in three
days in um so again I want to thank you
know what I wouldn't feel right having
Dennis white super chat-up still um so
we're gonna keep going why there's a
donation up because it's not right that
part of the part of the cool things
about super chats are that it will
actually showcase your donation message
in the chat see you baby
so look like his will be to the top even
if more messages come you can always see
if you click on this thing what do you
donated so we'll go since Dennis donated
$10 will continue like kicking it for a
minute I wouldn't feel right not doing
it giving you a full advantage of a
super chat and it's not because I'm
selling out honestly it might be a
little bit because I'm selling out but I
do appreciate it man so thank you for
that he's a money whore he said I could
buy I could buy his hand in marriage I
did she was talking about she won is she
won a house and a hundred grand I said
yeah I'd marry you at that point and I
told him I'd say no thanks
all right so you guys are talking about
how how Cody interviews are are getting
harder right so here's a story from from
college I was in my is basically like CS
202 which is in at my school or my old
school it was your second your second CS
course
so you took one Java course and now
you're in that intermediate Java course
basically and in that class um in that
class the the teacher caught like I you
I showed up and like two-thirds of the
classes are there I was like look man
we're like three weeks in people usually
don't start drop until like the midterm
right and so what happened was
apparently 2/3 of the class was copying
assignments and like I don't know
muckman so maybe not everybody in here
is a CS major but typically when you
hand in your assignments you're usually
just sending files in somewhere but a
lot of times what you do at the top of
it you'll do a comment slash and you'll
put your name and sometimes the date and
the maybe the assignment name right and
so these stupid motherfuckers forgot to
change the name that was calming it out
and so yeah
2/3 of class failed instantly but I it
so that's why by the way guys that's why
those coding interviews are getting
harder because there's people like that
floating around that probably still
graduated by the way they just failed
them they cuz they're not gonna kick
them out of school they're gonna film
from the class and then they're gonna
let them repay for it next time and come
back so and it's a common thing by the
way guys it's completely common um like
I ain't really I was a little bit older
I didn't really know anybody um I had
two friends who I studied with and and
we helped each other out but we never
copied code not like that not like you
know everyone's my like yo man let me
just see this shit I got seeing an
action to understand it right and that's
understandable you have to lose
times but straight up yo man I do mean
even change by your name let's all hand
it in cuz you know at that point there's
no way of denying it by the way like
most of time you can write your code a
million different ways most of the time
there's 15 ways to reverse a string now
if 10 people hand in the same way it's
you know it's it's fishy but when you
don't change the name / / purses name
come on man come on
you got caught your hand got caught in
the cookie jar
um so that's my little story man um bit
code I appreciate you
Dennis white I appreciate you as well
man thank you for the support we're 15
dollars towards our first goal of 300 I
think we're at 67 now if I remember
correctly that thing takes a while to
update or knows we're at 72 if 300 is
pretty good
buddy now guys I appreciate you thank
you for the donations um I appreciate
that a lot
he does he he'll talk about it for the
next like weaker sound like we got this
donation it's good he gets really
excited about it and I won't stop
hearing about it for like it it's like
to eat it is van like this this is my
hobby and like I would love nothing more
fun who calls him or comes into contact
with him he's like Ted it's just like I
said this is the thing like I put so I
put a lot of time into YouTube because
one day I would love for it to work out
do I think it will probably not I'm a
very niche niche area and I gotta get
creative but it's like if you look at it
objectively even though it's going back
into the channel we made $15 an hour I
got to tutor my girlfriend for $15 an
hour and I got to hopefully help some
people in the process and I'll probably
make like two dollars in ad revenue off
of it but I appreciate it Matt I
appreciate it and it's cool let's cool
it's a cool thing right like I I would
love nothing more than do this every day
you see a microphone in the background
yeah that's an old one oh I use it
April uses it on occasion but yeah guys
I appreciate it thank you for watching
and patreon Facebook group all that good
stuff see you next time long and prosper
cut long and prosper guys good long and
prosper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
