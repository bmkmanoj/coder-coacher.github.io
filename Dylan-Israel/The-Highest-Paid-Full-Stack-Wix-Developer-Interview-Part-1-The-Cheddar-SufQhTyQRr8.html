Dylan is actually at work today so we
have Dolan here and we're gonna ask him
all about his backstory and learn what
it really takes to become a Wix
developer a little recon I appreciate
you having gone along on the channel
today so Dolan where did you grow up man
Dolan comes from the streets like grew
up in the streets learned in the sheets
that's how Dolan makes his money Rico
you may be a little young to understand
with Dolan means behind the sheets but
Dolan started from the bottom got to the
top all right so don't look how did you
get your first clients you have such an
in-demand skill set as full-stack wicks
the clients come to you or at con Dolan
you're always talking about debt Chetta
if I quote you directly what exactly
does that mean the chatter of the bread
the money the cash money the D money the
dough lon
and the D for was the deed for don't
long stands for a lot of things so
stands for don't it's a sturdy money and
as far as ladies are concerned stands
for dough long I'm sorry - long - long
is an acceptable term as well so long -
long Dolan's D can stand for whatever is
needed when the time is right
Linux PC Mac Google Chromebook which one
is Dolan's favorite stones a man of many
skills you can use any operating system
but typically don't long will use
whatever one its installed on the public
library computer
oh so PC Dolan doesn't want to tie down
your viewers with technical terminology
billons a man of the people for the
people by the people
Elon Musk you see human who the Elon
Musk
Tesla just the car I don't know a Tesla
car
Tesla no no it okay well moving on who
is your biggest inspiration don't want
Dolan Dolan trails his own path Daniel
don't lon grants own dreams ain't
nothing but that D Dolan out there
getting that chat again that breath I
should have known that that was going to
be your your main source of inspiration
what's the best piece of advice that
Dolan can give to the viewers to be on
Dolan's level there's only one thing
that you can do and it's just live that
wakes life you gotta you gotta just
embrace it to the fullest hit him with
the wicks life sometimes let them know
what it's all about just let it all hang
out just make that capital D that
capital Dylan long make it big proud and
live that flamboyant
Chetta bread lifestyle using the Wix
full-stack Wix get skill set all right
so what are your parting words for Dylan
subscribers let's get one thing straight
here Rick huh
I let Dylan use this channel this is
Dolan's channel these are Dolan
subscribers and because Dylan has such a
nice couch Dolan allows him to preach
all this nonsense that he has over here
he ain't talking about wigs and that's
the only skill you need alright but to
my subscribers they already know keep on
getting that Chetta keep on getting that
bread and living that Wix life okay well
