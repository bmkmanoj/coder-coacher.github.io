skills that you need to become a
front-end developer in 2018 the ones
that are going to be pretty much
mandatory if you work in any role in
front-end development so as always we
have our super classified very well
detailed list as on the back of a home
listing I was looking at a while back so
why why do I feel like I could give some
advice on this I think this is always
important to know where your advice is
coming from and why how this list came
to be well for one I'm a front-end
engineer I so I know what skills I use
in the workplace I also recently
transitioned jobs so I can tell you what
skills I saw on resumes having spent
about three months doing research as
well as just being somebody that follows
the software industry to software space
with the YouTube channel with the
Facebook groups going to meetups coding
all the time it's really just a passion
of mine I follow it in and very in a
very deep detailed fashion because I
care about it I and especially recently
when I was you know three months ago
looking for a new job and seeing what
was out there so I think this is a
pretty realistic list of what you will
need as a developer and I'm gonna break
it out into two parts we're gonna break
out the first part which are the
mandatories the things that aren't
really up for discussion as far as I'm
concerned and then we're gonna break it
up into the optional the things that you
should have will only help you and are a
little bit more abstract down the road
so first and foremost HTML right if
you're a front-end web developer you
need to be familiar with HTML you need
to be understand what the elements are
that are in HTML what the attributes are
and just be comfortable with that the
next thing is CSS right
those that HTML how is it going to look
how is it going to feel is it going to
be good UI or bad UI and UX based off
the CSS that you have these are the the
there's kind of really three main things
that I think everyone can agree on with
friend development so you have to have
HTML CSS and the third one JavaScript so
what does that mean does that mean that
you need to be comfortable with vanilla
J's to a degree you need to know
JavaScript
you need to be understand the language a
lot of the language how it works what
the basic aspects of it are the four
loops the variable types dynamic types
in terms of the variables you have to
know some of the gotchas right that go
along with JavaScript cuz it's a bit of
a wonky language you have to understand
what array methods are available to you
what string methods are available to you
you also have to understand how to use
them so javascript is super crucial do
you necessarily have to have be a master
of vanilla Jas Dom manipulation vanilla
Jas if you're not familiar with that
term basically means the original
JavaScript manipulating the Dom I
personally don't believe so but other
people may disagree with that and the
reason for it is in our fourth item here
you're gonna have to know a front-end
framework one of two basically you're
gonna either have to be comfortable with
the latest version of angular or you're
gonna have to be comfortable with the
react and some of you may say well what
about view well in all honesty or ember
there's no jobs in comparison to react
an angular and view or react and it in
comparison reacting angular there's no
jobs in view there's no jobs in ember
that's not to say that you don't have a
friend who got a job in amber people
like to live in this world of absolutes
what I'm saying is that you're better
off learning where the majority of the
jobs are which are angular and react and
and using that but you're gonna have to
know a JavaScript framework it's just
it's just the reality of situation and
it should be one of these two and this
goes to my earlier point about Dom
manipulation about not necessarily
needing to be super comfortable with it
in vanilla JavaScript that that's more
so if you're an angular developer in
react a little little less oh but part
of manipulating the the document that's
handled by the frameworks that's handled
by the library and people people will
will kind of get upset in the
comments-section reaction on a framework
it's a library well when I have to use
react and then I have to install
something to do Ajax calls then I have
to install something to do state
management redux and then I have to
install you know other s
continues my limited experience with the
react is that as I continue to develop
and react I found myself installing
library after library after library - at
which point you then have a framework as
far as I'm concerned but you're gonna
have to know angular or react and the
Dom manipulation is a lot of times a lot
simpler and a lot easier to handle when
you're dealing with States and data
because you're using these front-end
frameworks that don't really require you
to have mastery of Dom manipulation in
vanilla JavaScript so the the fifth
thing is good this is pretty much a
standard at every job you ever going to
have you're gonna be working on teams
are going to be sharing code there's
going to be multiple repositories where
you're gonna have to be comfortable at
posting code for others your review and
sharing code to to get your what I'm
trying to say is there's gonna be
multiple people working on the same
project and get is part of that process
and you're just have to get comfortable
with it if you're just getting started
there's no shame in using the UI a lot
of developers still do write I have
taken myself off that and I could say
that as long as I was posting daily I
everything's very clear to me on how it
works and what it does and and I just
didn't originally put in the time and
the effort but you can do it through the
terminal and it's pretty straightforward
as long as you just sort of actually
devote the time to learning that a lot
of times as developers especially in web
development things are changing so
frequently so often that sometimes we
look for shortcuts and get I feel like
it's one of those areas where we do look
for that shortcut and sometimes we kind
of shoot ourselves in the foot but
you're gonna have to get comfortable
with version control as a whole and get
is the the main one kind of used by most
teams so those are the I have one more
actually and this is a soft scale and I
harp on this all the time and most of
you won't even most of you will say
whatever on this last one and it's
probably the one that's going to hurt
you the most out of this list is
communication you need to focus on your
communication skills you need to have
good communication to get a a role as a
front-end developer the reason for it is
you're going to become
indicating with the back-end developers
you're gonna be communicating with the
team you're gonna be communicating with
your project manager your business
analysts the stakeholders you're gonna
be gathering requirements at times these
are all things that require good
communication and is probably one of the
top skills on here and a lot of times I
get it man we're all as developers a lot
of us are on the geekier set aside the
awkward set aside a lot of us are
introverts I I definitely fall into that
category but you're going to need to
work at it that doesn't you're gonna
have to come out of your comfort zone
with this go with your communication if
you're bad at it you got to work at it
if you have to go and spend a little mud
money to enroll into a speech class to
put yourself out there and just get out
of that comfort zone it is probably one
of the best decisions for you in your
career and I highly encourage you to
focus on communication so the next
things are what I would say fall into
that optional I don't really like the
optional word what I'm going to say
instead is these are the you should have
these and they will definitely make you
stand out to have a better chance of
getting in a role so whatever the the
adjective for that is someone leave it
in the comments below because it's not
coming to my mind this is what you
should have so first I would say
bootstrap a lot of a lot of
organizations use bootstraps column grid
system for their for their mobile side
of things for their responsiveness and
just stylings right if you're doing the
in-house application you don't
necessarily need to do a ton of CSS
there's no there's no reason why he
can't use bootstrap I use it in a lot of
my projects just because I'm not too
worried about CSS I enjoy the logic
aspects of it a lot more so I highly
encourage you just get familiar at least
with the grid system of bootstrap and
it's okay to get familiar with some of
the UI elements and the components
available for you so you don't have to
reinvent the wheel so I've encouraged
you to learn a little bit about
bootstraps are currently on version 4 -
beta - - or something like that so check
that out and one thing a lot of you guys
may have been saying dylan how dare you
for our second item here in the second
part of the list how dare you not
include jQuery I do consider jQuery a
little bit optional a lot of roles and
that doesn't mean that jQuery isn't
widely used I look at jQuery as now
web design skill set because most of the
time now a lot of roles will be having
you do angular and react in very little
jQuery and I feel like web designers or
some web developers have to do a little
bit more than they could before and Jake
whore's not gonna be what let helps to
land you a role should you be familiar
with jQuery absolutely and I you know I
when I started out and was learning
development the first framework I used
first library I use jQuery it has a lot
of functionality it's at one point in
time it was a great way of doing things
it's not what's going to necessarily
help you land a role nowadays but it is
I guess what I'm trying to say is
between angular react and jQuery angular
and react beat it out tenfold and jQuery
is something that you can devote a
little bit of time to and get familiar
with how the library works you know in a
week or two and build some projects in
it and that would probably be enough to
get you familiar with jQuery so I would
encourage you to to be familiar with
jQuery as one of your additional things
to make you stand out so the next is
testing this is something that is often
overlooked and it's definitely something
overlooked by a lot of a lot of
developers at who are professional
developers it's also overlooked by a lot
of people who are trying to become
developers and break into the field
testing testing testing in angular they
use karma karma and Jasmine that's built
in directly to the angular CLI so if you
start a new package it's there it's easy
to set up you go and you start writing
unit tests tests um in terms of karma
and jasmine or jasmine rather it's
really easy to test your functionality
and to test your components and the test
your functions this is something that
very few developers take advantage of
how much it will make you stand out as
an employee a potential employee a lot
of workplaces do what's called
test-driven development so essentially
you're you're running your tests or
building tests before you actually write
your code so that you can test in code
at the same time as well as have tests
for after your project is complete those
same tests to make sure that if someone
goes and refactor some code or somebody
and updates add a new feature that we at
least have some tests to make sure that
stuff doesn't break and this is
something that's that's crucial in
front-end development they also have
back in testing and and they have a
bunch of other types of testing other
than unit tests such as a end end
testing where you'll actually mock a
user going through a screen I don't
think you need that for work what we're
talking about I think just unit testing
with Carmen and Jasmine would be more
than enough to kind of show that you're
a little bit unique another thing that
would make you unique is sort of wire
framing this is something I harp on a
little bit as well about things that
very few developers do you go and pick
up maybe a free there's some free sort
of tools I personally use balsalmic
which is like $70 for a year in my
personal projects and that allows me to
wire frame out to essentially design and
mock-up the UI in the UX and gather
requirements for other other people that
I'm working with sometimes as a
front-end developer you'll be doing a
little bit of requirement gathering it
depends on the organization and how big
of a team it is but often times when
you're just getting started you'll join
sort of a smaller company where you're
doing a little bit of everything right
and having the ability to showcase that
hey I can gather requirements and like I
visually represent them in mock-ups and
wireframes that's a great skill to have
to make you stand out so another skill
this this kind of falls into a little a
little bit of agile methodologies and so
agile is agile and scrum and agile and
Kanban all these are all sort of
procedures and practices for how
software the software development
process works when you're actually
working in the real world and you'll
have sprints and things like this and
all these sort of keywords that we're
gonna be throwing out right and there'll
be ticketing systems that help with that
such as JIRA and confluence and then you
have V STS which is Microsoft's version
bootleg aspirated and you know Bugzilla
which is a free ticketing system but
what I'm trying to say is you should
probably brush up a little bit on agile
methodologies scrum and things like that
just because you will see it on a lot of
job apps and you should be you can put
it on there you could spend a weekend
reviewing it what it is
is how it works and educate yourself
about that and make you stand out quite
a bit so that's my list for what's
required and what are not optional but
helpers will call it helpers help
helpers that you should have on your
resume to help you land that that job to
help you become a front-end developer
this is really what I think you the
bare-bones minimum you'll need in 2018
to be a front-end developer so I hope
you found that helpful as always guys
don't forget to comment like share
subscribe support me at patreon.com
slash coming tutorials 360 we also have
the Facebook group at Co tech and
caffeine I appreciate you all I wish you
the best of luck and if you if you agree
disagree let me know in the comments
below right I'm always trying to educate
myself I think this is a pretty solid
list in my opinion but that's why I made
the video cuz I thought it was good but
if you think it's wrong let me know
alright bye hey baby what skill do you
think a front-end developer needs in
2018
