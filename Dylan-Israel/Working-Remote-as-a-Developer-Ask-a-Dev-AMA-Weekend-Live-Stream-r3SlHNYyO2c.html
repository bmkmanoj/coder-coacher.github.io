thee weekend live stream so today's
topic of choice for those here Oh
so today's topic of choice so for those
who don't know every weekend I try to do
about a one-hour live stream
sometimes a little longer sometimes
little shorter but usually it's about an
hour and I try to answer one question or
have a topic at the beginning of the
video from a comment from a subscriber
and then I go in and bring up the chat
about 5-10 minutes later and answer all
the questions in there so today what
we're gonna be talking about is a
someone in a recent video commented on
my freelance video yesterday I did a
video talking about freelancing and they
said what about working remote and I
have a little bit of a take on working
remote and the reason it came up in the
video because some things sometimes
people don't necessarily want to work
for themselves they just think that's
the only way to work for your the only
way to work from home right is to be a
freelancer and have your own schedule
well that's not necessarily true
although there is additional freedom
that comes with essentially working for
yourself the the freedom that a lot of
people are looking for is to work remote
so what does that entail and what is
that what does that mean what are my
thoughts on it well remote is a and by
working promote obviously I'm talking
about working from home right we in and
webdev and software we can work anywhere
in the world anywhere a lot of the
developers that I work with to our
contract employees or excellent or they
they work in different countries they're
traveling all the time
they're you know working from co-working
spaces really just interesting stuff a
lot of times so um it's a very common
thing but why why am i against you for
some people and why wouldn't I want to
do it well
couple things that we have why we have
seen and stats will base this up and I
encourage you to obviously go and do
your own research not just take my word
for it I'll have any of the stats on
hand but a working remote you'll
typically get paid a little bit less so
people say you know what I'm okay with
that if I don't have to go into work and
I have to dress up I don't have to do
the the person-to-person thing I'm okay
getting pelo but let less also you'll
have less opportunity for promotion
statistically speaking why are they
you know usually remote developers
there's there's no moving up from there
you know I mean like you once you're a
senior remote dev you're gonna stay as
senior Emotiv it's gonna be much harder
to to increase that salary as well as to
increase that position which is equally
as important and three especially when
you're starting your career off as a
remote developer you're gonna be
learning less yeah that's kind of my
thoughts on it I personally would not
for those first two reasons I fir the
third reason would not want to be remote
positions and when I've talked with
recruiters in the past they've always
been very confused by this but as
someone who believes that a lot of the
moving up is being there in person and
is making sure that you you have that
you have that FaceTime I think it's very
important and that's something that you
can't get as a remote developer as well
as learn collaborating you can of course
pair program you can of course you know
share code and stuff like that but it's
not quite the same as being in the same
building being there and stand-ups and
the Sprint's in person and going from
there and that's kind of my thought
about it is I really for all of you and
it's always the dream right a lot of
people want to do freelance I've never
done freelance before a lot of people
have worked remote or one of our remote
have never done it and they certainly
walked wrong with working remote and
often times as a bug on Monday I'll be
working from home because I have to run
some errands during the day and a lot
companies will work with you you want to
work one two days
from home no problem at all
most companies are ok with that you got
obviously can't assume that but I guess
what I'm trying to say is if you're just
starting your career I think I think the
what you have to do is I think what you
have to do is have that face time and I
think you'll learn more in the first
like five years of your career being
there in person then you then you would
be in a remote developer and honestly
most remote positions are one of those
things where they're really looking for
senior developers developers who have
already proved themselves that if you're
getting a remote job as your first job
but maybe that's your you know one year
experience you're probably not getting
paid that well you're probably not going
to advance your knowledge and skill set
as much as you would other positions but
that's that's just my two cents I'm
working remotely is a great thing though
I mean I tell you right now just the
idea that hey I don't have to drive to
work I can stay at home or wherever in
the world right and go from there
something that's exciting and considered
but um that's my thoughts on the remote
dev and how to get a remote job it's
really what the question was about
really get a couple of years of
experience if you're at a current job
and you want to leave for remote roles
just ask them to change you to remote
sometimes after you've proven yourself
and you've you've shown your skill after
being there in person they're much more
willing to let you be a remote developer
because you're able to go and and say
hey look I you know my work ethic you
know what I'm doing you know what I'm
capable of I like being here but I need
to be remote and sometimes they will
work with you but uh something
considered all right so let's uh let's
get some questions here hello to
everybody by the way a lot of you guys
said hello I so hello
what's the smoke it's just the essential
oil diffuser that's all it is shout out
to our boys in Romania
uh my goal is to work remotely in the
Philippines if I may 50k and live there
it would be a dream I do intend to work
on-site initially though yeah I mean you
should be able to get 50k remote
couple years experience no problem at
all you probably make a lot more than
that to be honest um so I wouldn't be
too worried about it
how to start and handle a project from
start to finish
every projects different but really if
it's a player personal project I would
say try and think out bits and pieces of
the project and this is for in any any
development project try to think out
what the components are you know you
have your header you have your main
application like think of it in the
html5 semantic elements right or you
have your header the main a side article
those all elements all came about
because they essentially divs were there
that were always being called you know
ID header and the reason I bring that up
is you need to kind of have the same
mentality of how can I break this
project down into smaller components
smaller pieces and then execute it and
then as you are starting that and in the
start you're kind of izing and maybe in
your head and wireframes and user
stories whatever it is you're devising
how to handle that and as you execute it
what you'll be doing is you'll be
building it and then you'll be
connecting them piece by piece
so Paul Hannah says yo Dylan your
channel has been great to meet well
thank you
good news after eight months of coding
and total udemy courses for month coding
boot camp you tutorials I just got my
first job offer and I'm taking it
congratulations sir
feels good I have no doubt
my channel has grown a lot we are
growing by about 23 24 hundred subs
right now
pretty exciting how's the new computer
loving it it works great works like a
charm
waiting for the black-robe so I got a
great video coming I'm actually filming
it this week and I have the script
written the not to video yeah so this is
gonna be how to not be a coding god and
I'm gonna teach you how to be a Wix guy
that's kind of it's kinda that's kind of
it so it's gonna be it's gonna be good
it's gonna be good
i i i've been writing some good
one-liner at least I think they're good
any advice for a 13 year old developer
don't forget your younger audience hey
man I am impressed if your 13 year old
and developer what I would say to you
tank happy is that or any of the younger
individuals is you are na you are in a
unique position in which you can chase
the dream you can you can instead of
spending your time playing Call of Duty
and League of Legends and doing all that
you can instead devote your time and
energy to a side project that you can
help grow and mature and start making
passive income and have a five years by
the time you're 18 have a phenomenal
portfolio phenomenal skill set and
phenomenal certificates under your belt
and I would encourage you I would
encourage you to take the time this time
of life and this is this is by the way I
don't expect any 13 year old to do this
but this is what I would do knowing what
I know now if I could tell my 13 year
old self these are very hard things to
do of where I basically just told you 13
year old to spend what would be
equivalent to about 40% of your current
life span that you have lived to say
look prepare yourself over the next five
years
and from there go and study everyday go
and start a side project that you're
passionate about and if that one fails
start another side project and continue
to build it up get a little bit of
passive income that would be my advice
to you is to start something and
continue to grow it and if for some
reason that fails to start something
else and continue to grow it so that's
kind of that's kind of my thoughts on
that what changes can we expect in the
coming future of web development I'm
starting learning web dev and if you any
changes coming around the road how
coming prepared for that so you're
starting learn web dev really what you
need to just focus on is JavaScript HTML
CSS or the trifecta right and as you get
good at these basic skills right and
this is very true for like people who
are trying to get into selenium I forget
what it is but the etherium contracting
language that's used all the time
a lot of times for you to pick that up
you just already have to be a developer
relatively quickly not that it's super
complex it is complex its own way
writing blockchain and stuff like that
but when you already have skills
programming skills learning a new
language or learning a new framework or
learning a new how build tool works it's
not gonna be very similar to a degree
and you're just have to pick it up
so as you immerse yourself into the job
market into the skillset into the the
culture if you will of coding and
software you'll slowly see these things
creep up right you'll slowly see like oh
well I started you know six months ago
view right mate literally views
exploding if you're following you know
blogs and YouTube channels and the job
market and then you start seeing all
this stuff of you you might say oh I
missed our learning view for instance
it's just about staying on top of it
really and that's that's really the one
thing that I think I would advise you
guys who are in this stuff is always be
continually working on your skill set
right so that could be a couple
different ways that's not only like oh I
need to learn a new language I need to
build a new project I am currently in
school about two three hours ago I just
got done with my
first course I'm going or mice excuse me
my second course I'm doing it my goal to
progress my career this year is to get a
bachelor's in software development
I'm doing a course every two weeks
currently and it's a rate that I think I
can continue and that's just one way
I've in these first two courses I've
gotten some web dev certificates from we
call it from certified internet web
specialists which is part of the course
curriculum these are things that I'm
doing this year to progress my career -
progress - in college ink when in
college you don't really get skills but
we can print it to learn and get skills
so but anyhow the point I'm trying to
say is that if you are one of those
people that are like look I'm just gonna
learn to code and a year two years I'm
just gonna coast it you probably aren't
meant to be a developer
now there's other technical things that
you could do like quality assurance
project management business analyst so
you could get paid very well for in the
same industry in the same space but if
the idea if your idea is that hey I'm
just gonna do I'm just gonna become a
dev and then I'm gonna stop once I get
my death job and a lot of people do by
the way a ton of people do and and those
are the people who you know stay out of
company five six years but the the
rockstars
the people who companies want let's do a
guy's job hopping cuz they're there
they're the guys who are hardworking are
worth more than what they're getting
paid a lot of times and that's really
who should be and that doesn't mean you
have to job hop it's just a simple one
simple you know exaggerating example but
the point I'm trying to make is that if
you're in if you're in the industry and
you stay on top of what's going on in
industry you shouldn't be worried about
what changes may come because you are
part of the 10% as always learning part
of the 10% that is always grinding to
continue to grow so
so oli 2017 is a very common thing of
hey I open a text editor it's blank and
I'm freaking out I don't know it to code
so that goes back to my previous
statement and it's a very realistic
thing I think it's one of the one of the
more common things where people sort of
panic at the oh my god this is so big I
don't even know where to get started and
they open up that text editor that's
blank for the first time because before
that you're probably doing like websites
or you're just doing like maybe an
algorithm where you're writing ten lines
of code at most at a time my advice to
you is just to break it down into the
smallest pieces you say okay what is it
that what is one what would one function
do I have a click function it needs to
add something to an array okay cool
that's one thing that I know I can know
how to do I'll break it down all right
what I have to add something to the
array what would I what would I do from
there well I need a parameter any
argument right to add whatever it is I
want you adding right I need an array is
this gonna be a local scope de Rais it's
gonna be a global scope - right start
breaking it down piece by piece and then
it becomes a lot more a lot less
overwhelming and a lot more manageable
when you're just starting now
mangle it Bangla door is the Silicon
Valley and yeah alright how's WG doing
it's good man I mean it's a quick degree
program which I like right so like like
I mentioned I got two certs and two
classes done in one month and I'll be
doing my third class I'm starting it
today probably maybe tomorrow I'll take
the night off
of that I have to do YouTube stuff you
know from thing so do you think what I
think of nanodegree I did the react
nanodegree I didn't finish it I didn't
do the last project but I really enjoyed
it I thought it was an excellent program
I will say that the feedback is the is
why you do something like that supposed
to have a certificate that you feel like
you can put on a resume but the the main
thing that I would say is that you don't
need to spend five hundred dollars I
think you could probably get just as
much value going to udemy spending a
hundred dollars on five different
courses and just knocking that out and
doing quite well but I really enjoyed it
I would I would recommend it but five
hundred dollars to a lot of people is a
lot of money it's a lot of money to me
too especially in buy a course for ten
dollars right and I found an ideal house
to you guys eventually like to buy so
the housing thing is kind of up in the
air right now I want to buy a house but
I was really hoping April would have a
job by now and that's that's been one of
the sort of scarier things for me is to
make that big financial commitment on
one salary even though we can afford it
relatively easily as long as I'm
employed so it's kind of going on the
back burner and until then also I'm
paying for school out of pocket right
now so that's you know another $800 a
month basically what I've decided is to
pay off all my debt
I bought the computer I had two months
it's basically a three month loan paid
it off I'm paying off my car which is
only about two grand
so I April I have zero debt and right
now we're just kind of trying to decide
what to do for
there so it looks like we might just
rent a house for in the short term and
decide um what to do but I we make a
month a month on our lease here and if
she gets a job then go back and look for
housing know how to find time between
school and work to learn and really code
not just reading Doc's I mean it
there's always time it's it's hard
though right because so a lot of school
programs have you waste your time in
class when in reality you don't learn
anything in class you're gonna be
teaching yourself online you're going to
be teaching yourself through YouTube
through your demo courses and you're
just really wasting your time in class
doing meaningless assignments and
printing lines for your first for
programming classes in college but it's
gonna be hard if you're working I've
worked full-time and I was like I and I
and I I worked I so I worked full-time
for the most part and I was going to
school full-time and I didn't have the
time because I was doing assignments and
all this other crap so you may you may
not just have the time to be honest with
you doing both that I have I ever
adventure in the world C and C++ in C++
i did a college class in my current role
i'll be picking up c-sharp to do some
back-end so visual studio code is the
text editor of choice
do you still use var and win no you
should never use var in your codeine
anymore that's the that's the gist of it
just constant list do you recommend
pursuing Davis science career or web
career for older people who are just
starting I recommend you pursuing the
career that you want this is not a
career that you necessarily want to
pursue pursue for money is not a career
that you necessarily want to pursue for
job security all those both the both but
oh but both those come along with it
this is something that that you want to
pursue because you like the environment
you'd like the career itself to be
successful in it so if you are more
attuned to data science or you're more
attune to web development I encourage
you to take both either one now I will
say I will say that the data science
career and web career have different
barriers of entry you might have a
harder time getting in data science job
without a at least a bachelor's than you
would a web dev career statistically
speaking is a new JavaScript course
coming since it's new computer so I am
going to be trying to knock out a good
portion of the course this weekend I'm
basically my game plan is takes school
off tonight take school off tomorrow and
then hit it back on Monday so that's
going to give me enough time to film the
YouTube video see how to not be a coding
god videos and then it's also going to
be enough time to to to some time to
work on the course so you look dinner
I'm losing weight now if there's one
thing I'm not doing it's not loose I add
I'll tell you guys the story so we have
some clothes at my work that uh so we
have some clothes at my work and they
needed to make some shirts for
the CEO for for something and they asked
if I I wore this was like on Tuesday
they asked if I were a large and then I
went into the the designer room where
they have all the clothes all the merch
and all that sort of stuff right and I
said I was like yeah all right cool
what's what's up hey can you try on
these shirts and I've not like this is
not in like single man summer
presentation all right and I was just
like they're like you can go and change
shirts the bathroom but that's just like
I'll just take it off right here right
and so so that was um but I did so it
was one of those things where like I
just like I got a I got start work on
the ABS again cuz I was like I'm feeling
a little self-conscious about this right
now like I don't feel weird about it but
I just wish I was in better shape had I
known I was gonna be trying on shirts
for people oh well yeah that was like my
Tuesday so that's interesting
how's the block blockchain training
coming along
I haven't I haven't started studying
blockchain yet I have to do my degree
then I have to build some courses do all
this er
blah Chan will come around when I
graduate which I'm thinking if I so if I
continue at the pace of a course every
two weeks I should graduate around
September maybe uh earlier August should
I also start using templates if you're
talking about like template strings
ten-foot literals yeah I don't really
use fetch for anything and classes from
here on I use classes all the time I use
typescript classes you should you should
leave es5 behind you definitely want to
be coding in the latest and greatest
that's this kind of it set up some
compiling tools to take care of that
sort of stuff
but I so like when you use typescript
you're oftentimes using classes that
they've defined you're using observables
all the search stuff and it compiles it
down for your angular projects so I
would say yes you want to always be
using the latest
technologies it's much better than not
how can I find clients besides friends
and families well there's sites devoted
to that there's people are looking for
people to build things and Craigslist
you can go to web design shops and start
working for them and go from there I
mean honestly there's a lot of web dev
shops that will be there to - that have
jobs and sometimes they have - they're
like oh well we don't have the bandwidth
to do this or we don't have the the we
don't we don't that you know it's not
enough money for you know art for what
we charge and so the you can ship it out
them so that's one way of getting
clients oh I've had that at places I've
interned at before
my favorite content on create iron you -
well isn't that nice
what is your opinion on MongoDB verse
SQL I I mean I am personally a fan of
JSON databases because it's JavaScript
object notation right so it's very
familiar which is MongoDB obviously as
SQL and I don't know I I I prefer
anything that looks more like JavaScript
and so I'm biased but in terms of actual
jobs there's probably 10 20 fold more
jobs on SQL when it comes to databases
and MongoDB how do I choose what
technologies use for a new web app well
if I'm Billy a new web app it depends
why I'm building it typically I would
build in an angular because that's what
I work in and I want to build that skill
set now say I wanted to build up a react
portfolio I would build a reactor
portfolio I want to work in
cybersecurity shoji software engineering
sounds like a pretty good idea to me
what else would you do there's probably
a software engineering computer science
and then there's everything else so I
think it's probably pretty good best PHP
frameworks you say with a s there's
really only one good PHP framework
that's laravel if you're looking to do
PHP should look at later well how's my
weekend going it's going pretty good man
I uh I had canceled our two gym
membership so that's gonna save me about
fifty dollars a month I also then went
and got a 94% 94% on my final pass that
course no big deal just 94% I then I
then went to Ikea so it's been a pretty
good day so far everything considered
and now I'm doing the live stream this
is probably one of the highlights of the
day and then I'll be I'll be doing some
videos today I'll be doing some courses
course work today this weekend is all
devoted to work and because I enjoy it
and it's time for me to do it it's the
time and it's gonna be fun so life life
is good I am currently in school yes is
Ruby dead or dying uh I would say yes a
ruby developer may not say yes um it
really just depends on who you ask I
would say that in terms of Ruby in the
front end and you it's always JavaScript
in terms of Ruby on Rails
I think there's it's dying may be the
wrong word is it stagnant I think
there's an overwhelming yes and that's
the problem for newer developers
stagnant is just as bad as dying and I
think you could see that based off the
like go go like right now if you just
want to know if something's dying go
right now on to zip recruiter go on to
LinkedIn and whatever those technology
jobs are Ruby's probably a full-stack
developer look at full stack developer
jobs look at a hundred of the first full
stack developer jobs that got released
in your country for the last 24 hours
and what you'll see is that zero to five
of them have Ruby on Rails and so it's
really one of those things where you can
hope that it's not not dead not dying
but
you
alright guys I am back I don't know what
happened I got a I got booted out of my
own thing that was rude uh so I think
we're good to go
are we good together is the is a video
back all right cool we're back my bad
guys I'm not quite sure
we as trick to Jeeves would say we back
once a motherfucking in oh yeah but yeah
so the Ruby dev struck the Ruby devs are
salty know um uh-huh
can you school projects as part of my
portfolio you can use anything that's an
impressive portfolio project so you just
say it's a learning project if they ask
you if they ask you directly it's just a
school project say yes no problem with
that but yeah so I I mean that's that's
really the one hard way in my opinion to
find out if something is stagnant or and
there's there's jobs skills like charts
that you can look up on and indeed and
compare right so like if you were to go
to indeed right now and you know what
let's even do that right
let's do that real quick just to make a
point so if we're to go to indeed oops
indie I'm spilling shit over here indeed
skill search job skills all right let's
see here all right so a skill search you
are able to need skills chart there's a
way of doing this it's been a minute
since I've done this uh give me a second
feel to figure it out but there's a way
to indeed compare skills
their jobs let's see I remember this is
it skill third I've done this a million
times or what they'd have to be uh
compare what is it I've done this skill
search now that this isn't what I'm
looking for skill indeed skill change is
it track all right I have to have to
look at it another time sorry guys but
there's a way of there's a way of
checking of actually searching on indeed
to where you can see the search results
by the amount of jobs and and gone from
that my apologies for not being able to
pull it up on that instant but I've
shown I've talked about it in the past
what if someone can't get a job after an
internship should sell should that
person go for another internship I think
you should I mean what else are you
gonna do are just not gonna work so like
I mean if you can't give job take
another internship take that as a resume
experience build it up build up your
skillset while you're getting that
relevant experience and maybe you get a
job there
schuyler and PHP or Python or JavaScript
it really depends on what it is that
you're trying to accomplish have I ever
felt imposter syndrome yes I have my I
mean this is something that's pretty
common with a lot of developers and it's
one of those things where oftentimes we
don't know where we stand with other
developers especially you're just
getting started if you want to feel good
about yourself as a developer it's
really easy to just go to meetups
and it's one of the things that I have
found that helped me get over my
imposter syndrome is you go to a meet-up
and you can tell that if you're better
than about not and I don't mean this in
a negative way by the way cuz I think
meetups are great and most but most
people at meetups are people looking to
get better and our beginners and
typically if you're in the top 10% of
that you should feel fine you should not
have imposter syndrome and that's one of
the things that helped me overcome it
also just the in recent times where I
had multiple offers multiple job offers
before I took my current job that really
gave me some confidence that okay maybe
I can I can relax a little
I guess what admit ups meetups typically
do it depends on the location and the
meetup but a lot of times someone gives
a presentation about a technology about
a library a language or a topic and then
there's usually free pizza and swag so
at the end at the end of the day you get
a free meal sometimes the free stuff and
it's great to network the last meetup I
went to was about nodejs and blockchain
and and reacted
abstracting react component so I say and
what that what was interesting about
that was that there was three different
companies vying to get developers they
all of the three people that were
talking there
stood up said hey I just want to say
that we're hiring for this role if you
want to come get your resume give me
your resume
I'm the hiring manager this and that and
and I think it's a great way for you to
be introduced to people who are actually
gonna get your resume so something
consider no one's saying going to meet
up to show off but it puts it in
perspective because as a working
developer you go and you meet people who
are not working developers and you say
okay well and then you see these you
know people are giving these talks are
much better than usually but sometimes
you see the people giving talks to you
like I give that talk and then you start
thinking maybe I'm not as shit as I
think I am so I think it's one of those
things we just have to be honest with
yourself and you know you've coated so
many projects but I have a certain point
that it's one of those things where are
you gonna be the best developer in the
world like numero uno no but are you a
good developer and you should be
confidently say yes what's your honest
opinion on learning digital marketing
before I learn HTML CSS and JavaScript I
know a little friend with digital
marketing
I mean digital marketing is a great
expanding field it's also a great
position be remote it's probably what I
would be doing if I wasn't in software
do you have to learn digital marketing
to do front-end development no but it is
a great skill to add on to things
if Rico can't releasing this stuff they
did look at that your boy might be doing
some of this this weekend um oh no they
didn't nevermind
sad they really some of it did they now
they didn't I don't like this I got
excited for a second my bad so uh part
of the beta curriculum yeah yeah I know
I got I thought the homepage was
different anyhow
although leisure donates to go extinct
you meant that's appreciate it um I
notice these projects seem really over
so is that really the bar for being
ready in those technologies for your job
it's the bar for you to learn those
technologies and then go and build other
things is my my opinion of the bar but
also it depends on what your what you're
trying to do right everything every job
is different and oftentimes all you need
to showcase what it is that you're
trying to all you need to showcase to an
employer is that one that you're eager
to that you're passionate and three that
you're always learning and if you show
those things and good communication for
for and like those first three things
are all kind of one so really two things
that you're learning and you like it and
good communication you have those two
things a lot of times for these junior
level roles for these internships if you
can show some projects if you can show
that you've been coding for six months
every day in one way or another those
are the type of people they want to hire
those are the type of people I would
want to hire
so are those projects basic yes will you
be building things that are more complex
than that usually not always I build a
lot of very basic stuff sometimes I
build a lot of basic crud tools um but
I have the skills to build those
credulous because I did took the time to
build these basic projects at one time
to be familiar with building my own
things and and and being able to start
you have to start somewhere right and
you can kind of think of these basic
projects as the foundation where ever
company applied for you feel hesitant
pursuing once you went in for the
interview yeah when I really needed a
job I applied to AMC and I got the job
and then I never showed up because I
didn't want to work at the movie theater
so the AMC in Torrance you heard I
apologize this is my official apology
because there's a dick move on me for
accepting a job and never showing up so
I didn't want to work for you I'm sorry
I needed the money I decided to deliver
pizzas but he was rude I should have
called and said no thank you
I declined but yeah it's exactly that
mentality right you have to crawl before
you walk so um what's the salary range
is based on language what do you what do
you suggest pays the most
your salary range will be highly
determined by you so that's my answer to
that and I don't think it matters based
off there are languages that pay
slightly more than others but I would
say that in terms of salary what you're
looking for is your salary range will be
high lead to turn by you does
writing a prime number really relate to
front end I don't quite sure what you
mean by that
streaky I'm making basic stuff forget up
do job scare if its original yes they do
100% you got to be unique you got to be
unique there's nothing that is more of a
turn-off than seeing the same weather
app same calculator the same to-do app
that every other applicant had done
people want to see custom code they
don't want to see something that they
know that you could have googled or
watch a YouTube video on to build that
sort of stuff and that's the reality of
it so of course they want it to be
unique hi I'm a junior IT student I live
I am completing my BS many people say
it's hard to find a job with Justin
yesterday I was thinking about getting a
certification you have any suggestions I
suggest you build a portfolio you can of
course you get a job with a degree or
without a degree but you have to treat
it like a job while you're job searching
in terms of certifications in software
there aren't any that are unless you're
looking for like Java certifications
there it's really hard to to go with
that I would say focus on internships
focus on projects I do I still deal with
HTML CSS even though I work with
JavaScript yeah
what are the way it's so dealing you
said if you're able to prove that you've
been working for some six months it
would increase the chance gain DEP job
let's say so what are some ways to prove
it well your github is a great way of
proving it that actually tracks your
commits it quite literally has a chart
that shows every day that you code it
that's a great way having projects to
show is another great way I have a
youtube channel
it shows my passion having a blog is
another way writing a book building a
course there's a million different ways
going to meetups giving talks at meetups
volunteering through code.org all these
sorts of things having a very great
LinkedIn to showcase all the things we
just talked about expanding a basic
project is great as well if you take a
basic project like oh hey I want to
display a table and then you a table of
some API data and then you build custom
charts you build authentication always
taking it to the next level there's a
great great wave going about are there
digital marketers that the company I
work for so I don't necessarily want to
talk about the company that I work for I
will say that we have about three or
four hundred employees I believe at
corporate and so we probably have ton of
people that do a ton of things I do I
finish my voting up I did like a month
ago before I started school but I
haven't touched it since what made you
choose web development over something
like programming video games a couple
things one I didn't want to do
programming video games because I wasn't
something I was passionate about I enjoy
playing video games but I've also
programmed video games before I don't
like it too the industry as a whole is
very cancerous from everybody that I've
talked to that works in that industry
there is their stress out of their mind
all the time trying to meet deadlines
and
underpaid in comparison a lot of times
and three when it comes to front-end
development or full stack development I
think there's probably more jobs it's
really hard to kind of get your foot in
the door to anything but it's a little
bit harder in the the programming of
gaming does in front end does the
front-end developer need data
visualization skills such as free
coquettes the data visualization is kind
of a very strange certificate basically
what that cert is on on free code camp
is hey let's just add something to with
the react and absently with d3 do you
need two three four all know do you need
react for all may be so reactor angular
its data structure mandatory for web
development yeah you shouldn't you
should understand how data structures
work and how to you build a a good data
structure for your needs
do you have any degree our shirts I have
zero degrees I am working on that though
I have I am currently enrolled in a
software engineering course I passed my
second class yeah me in terms of certs I
don't have any certs of merit I have the
free code camp front end certificate if
you count that I have the certified
Internet web specialists and advanced
web specialists I forget what the new
courses that I just did but I went today
and I took that course basically the way
that you passed the final four this one
web dev course is that you go and you
get this hurt through certified internet
web specialists so I have that as well
yeah and and Ramsey brings a very good
point that so their sites like Glassdoor
and if you want to see what the industry
is like go ahead and go ahead and check
out you know what the people at
Glassdoor are saying
these gaming companies and it's insane
it is absolutely and say and I by the
way I've talked I've interviewed people
who work at these these companies
they're always talking about crunch time
inthis and working late hours and be
underpaid and there's just so much
shadiness going on and it's it's just
rough so it's not necessarily an
industry I ever wanted to Raul Sanchez
Dillon thanks for all the inspiration I
reach out to a company I looked up to
and CEO met with me and wants to mentor
me and add me it's in turn nice man
congratulations on that and good luck
with everything man that's really good
yes I mean sometimes see that the reason
that you got that internship was because
you reached out you showed your
intellectual curiosity your hard work
probably and when you reached out and
that you're eager and that and you you
want you want to succeed there's a lot
of people in this chat there's a lot of
people in general who work who can't
figure out why they aren't getting jobs
why they aren't getting internships and
the the truth of the matter is because
you're not working hard enough
it's because you are spending 30 minutes
a day coding instead of 3 hours a day
coding it's because you're not going and
building out your projects you're not
taking your github seriously you're not
taking your literally you're not taking
your portfolio seriously you're not
taking any of it seriously you're
learning and you're not taking your
project seriously you're not taking your
job search seriously and you're not
putting in the time that it takes to get
your foot in the door and if you do you
will succeed it's that simple
it is hard to hire hire people who fit
that category it that is true for for me
to sit down and tell you that nine out
of ten of you probably aren't coding
three to four hours a day and in that
you aren't doing your own projects
you probably don't have a portfolio site
your LinkedIn is just created you
haven't actually gone through and done
anything with it your github is bare and
barren alright and in terms of learning
you may even be learning the wrong stuff
you don't have a udemy course you're
going through most of people are doing
not what they need and those are all the
things that in my opinion you have to do
and then there's a bunch of other things
that are supplemental that would be
great but when they're going to
interview people none of you have to
have skills you have to show all of it
you have to to be if you have the whole
package and those are just some you can
do it but you have to put the work in a
lot of times people just aren't it's
hard don't get me wrong man it's hard no
one's saying it's easy but you can do it
it's just hard so put the work in every
day and I say this I feel like every
live stream because a lot of you what
you want is a better life what you want
is an interesting career what you want
is a good good solid job that you can
make good money and have good job
security and to do that to go from
beginner to I have a job I'm gonna say
it like I say every live stream feels
like hitting out code every fucking day
until you have a job okay that's what
you need to do you don't need to do
anything else yes shit shit you gotta
eat eat you gotta sleep sleep everything
else is optional you come home tired
from work not a good excuse don't care
if you work two double shift you're
putting it in your time okay you have to
have that mentality because this is
something that you have to build
momentum with in your learning process
so code everyday until you have a job
you will get one code every day several
hours a day but
I'll say this again next livestream and
people may think I'm joking
ha Dylan doesn't really mean code to
every day for 3-4 hours no no I truly do
mean spent 3 or 4 hours every day I
don't care if it's Christmas I don't
care if it's your daughter's birthday I
don't care if it's your son's birthday
you could celebrate it do you nominee do
you know how many Christmases and
birthdays and Valentine's Day that I
couldn't afford to pay for or that I
didn't celebrate with April because I
was grinding it out gotta grind it out
man it's that simple
and that means that you have to take a
back seat to the other things in life
and some people don't like that so
people all right fine
that's fine but that's why if you're in
that 10% that's gonna do it do it every
day don't have a job well so when I say
code every day that could include meetup
second being at actually writing code
watching videos but also you need to
apply too if you're actually feel like
you're job-ready me apply to about 50
jobs a day that's my advice
50 jobs in it
I shot a big webdev
project doing two months I committed to
it should I try my best or MIT that's
impossible
uh well are you working with a company
at a company or it's just like a
freelance projects that's two different
things it's a point to using that
input-output event emitter and angular
when you could use a Services State
management and grx instead well so the
at input at output yeah you can
technically send everything with
services and I I'm not super familiar
with the the third-party ng Rx right
other than I import observables for me
but the out the input and output and
emit a vending minute it serves a very
specific purpose of we are sending data
to a component and from a component and
then we are admitting when that happens
and services have a multi functional
aspect to it most the time you'll be
using it to hit ajax ajax calls and
stuff like that i personally and
services so services as a whole are
designed to be used by multiple
components that's why it's a service so
oftentimes you're just passing data from
one component to another and if that's
the case you probably want to use input
output and event emitter but you could
in theory do similar if not that
identical thing
yes 50 should reapply jobs that require
degree even if you don't have it agree
if you think you're qualified yes both
my jobs that I've had in software
development have said degree required
order very degree preferred you know
what I got I have a high school diploma
you know I have
that's better than a degree hard work
that I can prove not just like oh I'm
I'm hashtag hashtag coke got hashtag
hashtag grind at you know 11:00 a.m. in
the morning at the at the Starbucks
right no I have projects I have skills I
have passion - oh and that makes you a
very attractive attract very attractive
to companies that say hey here's a guy
who codes who's enjoys it and and goes
from there so I I guess am I still
getting I'm getting my degree cuz there
is value to it there hundred percent is
value to it
because even though it's the hiring
manager who may like me it could be the
HR person who doesn't want me to be
management doesn't want me to get
promoted right so it there's value
there's always value is their skill
value usually not so is it better to
code four hours a day or code ten hours
a day for a few days then take a few
days off it is always so I say code
every day three to four hours because
you need that continual update and
that's the same way with schooling so
every day I wake up - Saturdays and
Sundays if I have a test like I passed
my test I'm taking a day and a half off
every morning I get up guys and I spent
an hour and a half I show up to work
about hour an hour and a half early and
I study for my my courses I get off work
I study an hour hour and a half for my
courses and then I continue every single
day because it builds on itself you need
to focus on this
until you get that role and go from
there
but yeah you should definitely do it
three to four hours every single day but
is much better than just putting in ten
hours and burning yourself out is it
possible a full-stack project and two
months yeah I mean every project is
unique but I would say that if you don't
feel like you can you should probably
reach out to the company to say look I
don't I actually think I took off more
than I could chew how do you celebrate
after fixing a bug area that you've been
trying to fix for a while
I usually if it's at home I usually
scream at the top of my lungs I am a
fucking coding god and then in the
background I hear April's say yeah baby
you are is something like that that's
usually what do you ever get a masters
yes yes April nice current agreement is
this I will well yes or no it is a
possibility it's not a hundred percent
that it's going to happen so my current
agreement with April is I'm getting my
bachelor's at which point she can go
back and get her master's at which point
I we will discuss me getting a master's
at that point and that will be based off
a few things will based off be off how
much passive income I have because part
of the reason I'm going back to schools
more money do I even need more money is
it worth the time and effort in energy
or is my time better spent building
courses writing books working on a
YouTube channel because I am putting in
a time investment to school right now
not only if if I graduate within a year
is it going to cost me $7,000 I am
putting three hours a day that would be
going towards writing a book it would be
going towards finishing my courses it
would be going towards YouTube there is
a time investment that goes along with
it
so that will need to be a discussion
that has to happen use it bet because
there's a very realistic possibility
that three four years from now that if
I've everything's going well with the
courses books the YouTube channel that
my time is better spent there then
actually going and getting a master's in
in creature science what kind of
projects you work on the help you get
job my youtube channel my website
cooking tutorials 360 calm was building
angularjs was my first chester project
that was really helpful as well as my
hackathon projects a how old am i I am
30 years old
300 photonic Starling Krypton a lot of
languages out there never heard of
Pathan
how does Roku wear karoku is
software-as-a-service basically what
that means is they give you a place to
launch your backends and use it that's
kind of how I would think of Heroku so
alright guys we've been going about an
hour I usually like to end my live
streams on a quick note a quick sum to
something and I just want to say this so
about ten minutes ago I talked to you
about what it takes to be a good
developer what it takes to be in that
top 10% and about 90% I'd say don't make
that category and actually what you've
seen this could be a variety of reasons
is that around then about 15 people have
left since I've said that because
sometimes people can't handle the cold
hard truth and the cold hard truth is
that it's hard to get a developer job
but there are ways of doing it and you
have to put the work in and if me saying
that and saying that you are you know
most people aren't and that upsets you
there's an issue there because it's you
should objectively be able to look at
yourself in the mirror and say am i
meeting mike my standards of what it is
required and am I being successful
if you're not being successful then you
need to raise what your standards are to
accomplish your goals everyone's goals
are different but if your goal is to be
a developer be well-compensated
in that aspect you're gonna have to work
very hard you know it's I don't think
I've ever said it is easy but there is a
level of work that all of this takes and
you should be very open and honest with
yourself that if you have that work
ethic if you have that grind and if you
are actually going to stick to it it's
very easy to work hard for a month it's
very easy at least in my opinion it's
very easy to work hard for two months
three months but that's about the max
most people can do work every day for
three months I've been working every day
for about three years - one or two
vacations that I've had where I've been
working towards my future every single
day for about three years and my goal
has been to do it for five years
essentially and I probably will continue
past that because I actually have really
sort of enjoyed life more that I've been
more and more productive but anyhow the
point I'm trying to say is that you have
to have that mentality is that I'm going
to work every day then I'm one step
closer to my goal and if it happens that
after 90 days I'm not at my goal do I
stop taking a step closer or do i stall
stagnate and not try and accomplish what
it is that I want out of whatever my
goals and dreams are a lot of times
people do right they they fade back into
bad habits they they veg out into
watching you know instead of instead of
on a Saturday on the weekend watching
two hours of TV ain't nothing wrong with
Netflix right we all like to Netflix and
chill as the kids say but you watch 12
hours of Netflix and then you've wasted
a day and not only that you probably
burnt yourself out looking at a screen
it don't want to do it the next day so
what I'm trying to say to you is it's
easy to work hard for short periods of
time
it's much harder to be consistent in
life and work at things on a day to day
basis and if you do that you do work on
a day to day basis you will accomplish
what you want it's never no one's ever
gonna say it's gonna be easy no one's
gonna say it's everyone's going to
succeed but if you do stick at it and
you do continue to pace yourself on a
day to day basis day to day that means
today means tomorrow
it means the next day it means until you
get to your destination you're moving
forward you will get there it just takes
a lot of hard work and a lot of
commitment so that's my final thought
for the day guys I appreciate you and as
we like to say don't forget to comment
like subscribe share support me on
patreon comm /co notorious 360 I
appreciate you all thank you again to
our donator earlier who donated $2 it is
I know a lot of you are students a lot
of you are in transition to new careers
and and new horizons and money often
times when you are students and you are
trying to transition your life it's not
something you have a lot of so I do
appreciate it when you decide to
financially support me and the channel I
love doing this YouTube stuff and you
know what I love I love money as well
and so it is always nice when that
happens but I appreciate you guys so
much thank you so much I will see you
next time don't forget to watch Monday's
video because we got the new how to not
be a coding god bye Dolan himself coming
out so look forward to that guys I'll
see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
