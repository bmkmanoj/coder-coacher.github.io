and for each section of four loops in
PHP a loop is kind of just a theater
eats their code this case it looks like
we have a variable leap then we're
running leap into while it's less than
this for every iteration is equal to
leave plus 4 and then we're going to
print it out so you see how it increases
by four um pretty standard same thing as
a normal for loop at ten are like any
other for loop brother looks like it
wants to film the code so for I and then
we need to bracket it off the house
where to run the for loop essentially
and you save and submit you can see it
goes two four six eight ten and because
if it would increase by two when it
increased by 20 in till 11 it's not
going to run in and print out 12 all
right writing your first for loop you
want it to write it for the thing
increases by 10 so 4 and then standard
conventions I is equal to 0 then we'll
say while I is less than 100
oh I is equal to i plus 10 and then in
here to echo out sweetheart I and that
should work just fine so whatever is in
PHP is going to ass an issue today so
we're going to fresh the page insert our
code we just
oh so in this case we forgot our cash
money let's see if that's the issue it's
refresh
and you can see now that it is oh it
will do less than or equal to and that
should get us to I so now that wants us
to I'm just going to see what's going on
here just so about when you use a for
loop ADIZ a while and do well now in
this next section you can see that
they're adding some CSS styling to it
instead just printing out these numbers
and languages it's styled so that it
looks nicer that's kind of cool so check
out the code as we see how the length
the laying variable take some value
shell one by one then echoes elements on
the page so you see how it's pretty now
echoing out the HTML with it so that's
why you get the numbers right here it's
going down and then on the onset is
remote we're moving it in the process
with using out for each this case we're
going to be fixing the for each loop
here for you should rates through each
of the items in the array here and bam
I'm learning PHP cool stuff I like for
each loops so much easier if you're just
going to print out everything on line 8
there's an array called yard lines right
a for each of the iterates through the
rain that goes each other all right so
for each that work have to declare what
we're going through we're going to go
through your lines
first to the beach superior has passed
so we'll just say y el 30 yard line it
should iterate three my echo touchdown
nada go on to echo this so echo Grove IL
BAM the 50 the 40 the 30 just wanting
the 10 touchdown and I was four loops
pretty quick stop's SPH visa it's very
intuitive so far it's just after now use
a question IRA cash my sign so next
section we'll be doing while loops in
PHP there's a little preview of what it
will look like a little more CSS style
going on with it so see you next time
for loops</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
