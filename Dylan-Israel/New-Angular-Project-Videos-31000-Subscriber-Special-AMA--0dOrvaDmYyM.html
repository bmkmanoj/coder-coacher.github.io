how was life I'm uh we're about to hit
31,000 I figured tonight was a good
night as any for us to do our subscriber
live sure so for those who don't know
every thousand subscribers I do a live
stream and occasionally I do them on the
weekends although I think I'm thinking
about coming out the weekend live
streams and just doing these and
converting all the live streams over to
the actual twitch channel twitch.tv
slash coding tutorials 360 throwing it
out there some cool stuff that I'm
excited to announce I'm going to be
doing some project videos again like I
used to with if you remember back in the
day we used to do some projects on free
code camp so you know small stuff like
quote machine projects and I'll probably
design my own movie for it but this week
and I kind of wanted to build it's been
a while since I did some project video
so uh on Monday we'll have maybe even
nah Monday I was gonna say on Friday am
i release it early but I shut I don't
have anything we're filmed for next week
so on Monday we will release the first
angular 5 build a quote machine project
that would be what the projects will be
built in isn't angular so if you're
interested in that sort of stuff and you
like projects and you want to you wanna
build cool stuff I'm gonna try to put
out one a week we'll see what a week is
a bit maybe one every two weeks this
first one was quick and easy I did in
about a day but uh I don't know I've
been wanting to do more project videos
so that that's what we're doing now
that's a little note about what's coming
up on the channel starting next week
kind of kind of miss June it man when I
was building this last course
it was very a new course no uh-oh I do
have a I will have a new course but what
I'm talking about right now it's just
stuff to come out on the channel for
free for those of you guys who you know
not everyone has ten bucks I can
appreciate that so maybe it will give
you a smaller course it gives me a
chance to try and swindle you into
buying the udemy course yeah I mean I
gave you just a little bit just the tip
of the course as they might say so yeah
I give you a little a little sneak peek
build an angular project and if you like
it you can always support me and buy the
little bit more advanced course although
it's a very entry-level project but I'll
have other courses coming out I am I
have I'm working on like two other
courses but these are projects that are
gonna come out on the channel for free
might even do it to do app I might just
do a to-do app for you guys just for the
comical value of it yeah so it'll be
it'll be fun stuff start integrating AP
is a little bit I'm this last project we
actually use an API it's just a single
get call but we do so you'll get
introduced to services and things like
that oh you like the angular course
Thank You Man
any loose way better than Jango after
taking that course yeah it uh it has a
learning curve like all things but yeah
yes so uh for uh for those of you who
are interested in in that sort of stuff
I'll have projects coming out on the
channel for you these will be projects
that I think this one was a whole a
whole we call it a whole hour-long
something so it's not very long but it's
definitely doable and they're
entry-level projects just receive a see
if you're interested in angular I know
when I started trying to learn angular
like a year ago there was nothing
but I like to do these live streams
every every 1000 subscribers to say
thank you to the thousands describers
and welcome back to the other 30
thousand how crazy is that
I means 100k the dream were nothing but
pretty pretty happy with 31,000
continuing to grow it's been a journey
if I have a thousand videos before I
have a before I have a hundred thousand
subscribers I'll be pissed I'll be
honest with myself but we're trying
we're trying right we got we got keep
grinding like like anything else why why
angular overreact well for a very
practical reason I've I was in angularjs
or angular one developer and now I work
in angular at my current work I've also
played around a little bit in a react
and I I mean I got I got a job in
angular I don't know else to say there
are a lot of roles in RAC you can learn
react I wouldn't I wouldn't advise
against anyone learning either I think
they're probably the they are the best
front-end frameworks that you can learn
but I definitely think that it would be
a excellent thing for you to pick up
yeah a lot of people very interested in
react there's a lot of great jobs in
react right now a lot of a lot of people
who are jumping into reactors there's
been a lot of growth like a lot a lot of
companies are using react that are
hiring right now so I wouldn't blame
anybody but there's just as many if not
more jobs in angular how long does it
take to learn JavaScript is it that is
it is that really hard as hard as most
people say um I personally think
JavaScript
I think we're people to get and I say
this is someone who did Java and Java
and my college coursework but I
personally think job is easier that's
just my two cents about it very
JavaScript but part of it is that when
it comes to JavaScript you're not just
working with with the language you're
also working with a front-end you're
working with something that you're
working with so you're working with HTML
CSS you're also working with a browser
code right so you have to make them so
it works in all browsers although that's
not so much an issue anymore you're also
working with with frameworks right so
you might need to pick up jQuery you
don't need to pick up should worry
but you definitely gotta pick up for
hector angular and then you have to you
have to so you have to be able to mold
it all together in one which may be hard
for a lot of people so that often times
you're not just writing JavaScript
you're writing a lot of different things
when generating a new project with the
angular CLI how do you prevent it from
automatically initializing a local git
repo that makes it hard to push full
mean projects you probably just delete
it just go into your wherever the get
file is and delete it I don't know I'm
so bad man I never push my code if you
guys see me pushing code it's because
I'm looking for a new job that's you'll
just see you'll see like you'll see like
nine months of code automatically going
up and then you'll you know your boys on
the job market that's it that's a
telltale sign right there for me is that
I get that github together I have so
many projects I haven't pushed out this
is that I think I've I know I have five
react projects and five five node
projects and then like five full stack
main projects I just haven't even pushed
out
yeah I'm really bad about it
um I should do it though I supposed to
make a tutorial and get for you guys
this weekend but just thinking around
four but see you demand for net jobs
where I'm at
yeah man all the back in devs with my
work use c-sharp and nut nut and E no
days off a what did do Andy yeah man I'm
tired today I'll be honest with you guys
I don't I don't know why I couldn't tell
you I I've been I've been going hard for
a little while
so so it's one of those things where
kind of to push the right get commands
to get web interface so I used to use a
GUI and now I use commands and I
definitely recommend you picking up
commands just because it really isn't
that hard once you get accustomed to it
you just need someone to walk you
through it for ten minutes and then it's
pretty straightforward is you really
only use the same five or six commands
as like true that you really do just use
the same five or six that's my two cents
on it but
I don't even know what to say that man
do I notice that there are three main
web sacks Java Oracle c-sharp / asp.net
and everything else is over source uh
yeah I mean I don't so I mean I don't
really focus too much on it I mean you
have Python sack you have a you have
lamp stack you have mean stack you have
the Java stack c-sharp all that stuff
there is just depends on what you want
to go for and what it is that you're
trying to do I would say that this Java
and c-sharp stacks are really focused
more towards CS Kratz
mainly because that's what they teach in
college not to say that you couldn't get
a job but you're gonna be going against
more traditional software developers
when with those stacks I've been
starting I started coding for six months
out do you think it's advisable learning
a little bit of back in our show by
looking at frameworks like react or
angular what's up back-end we're talking
about here I would say if you've been
studying for six months and you haven't
done any reactor angular and I'm so I'm
assuming web development by that
statement you should be jumping into
reactor angular building react or
angular projects that when you finish
your first one continue building them
certifying for jobs internships whatever
you can get that would be my advice
now if you just want to build like a
simple node back in with MongoDB and
Express okay take them on doing that so
I try and have monthly goals for what I
want to be as a developer it's actually
something I'm going to start doing it's
doing like a goal update on the channel
I don't know I've been thinking about do
you guys think this is a good video so I
saw I saw Kristin leak and if you
haven't watched her YouTube channel I
encourage you to go over there and sub
to her she's does a little bit of UI UX
but mainly focuses on like health and
what health and how would you put this
development like personal development
and uh and and she was doing like a
monthly goal update about what she how
she worked towards their goals and
updated what her goals are how she
worked towards them and I was thinking
like would that be an interesting video
would you guys want to know not
necessarily my personal goals but my
goals as a developer how I'm working
towards them what I accomplished this
month as a developer I don't know if
that's something that people would be
interested in or not just so a once a
month video we do you what do you do
your first week in a new job typically
you are introduced to people you have a
lot of onboarding you know you got to go
through the you gotta go through a
couple training sessions you have to you
have to you have to you have to go and
learn the stack a little bit you'll feel
kind of maybe they'll give you a project
maybe they won't you get a custom with
the tools how they work with what what
libraries are using you just kind of get
eased in that's basically it have you
ever done the engineering truth
strategies set in a short personalized
video after so many application who do
you think's been telling him about that
I've told Matt that this is idea to do
for years years but yes I have
do I have a Simon gameplay this no I
don't that's the only one I didn't I
finished the free cocaine fronting test
application and that's the only one that
I I ditched after that which by the way
I heard that it's supposed to be
released on 25th
good-evening Sebastian do this which if
so your boys going to be knocking out
free code camp tutorials for like a
month and a half what can you do after
completing the free code camp front end
certificate you can look for a job you
can build your own projects is it enough
to get a job it's just one tool for you
to help you get a job what's going on
crazy it's not that the certificate is
going to get your job what's supposed to
happen is you're supposed to have
learned skills getting the certificate
that you can then go and educate
employers that you have skills with
educate yourself rather to show to
employers and that's supposed to be the
process free code camp is just a tool
for you to help gain those skills
directly illegally just not anymore I
played for several seasons though in the
past do I practice any sports no
honestly guys all I do is work in code
right now so that's kind of that's kind
of where my life is that I I've said
this before but I told April about three
years ago that I was going to spend
every day for five years working and
we're about three years and I have about
two years left it's been going very well
and I'm tired but I can make it two more
years the game plan is to buy some
property pretty soon and so right now
we're investing in working hard can I
explain observables and rxjs well rxjs
is the library
searching for angular and observables
are kind of like how you put this as
herbals are oftentimes observables are a
way of getting your data back I want to
say where essentially you listen for win
that route the data in that route from
that route changes and you subscribe to
it and then you can just call that to
come and get it again it's better
explain with an example so putting
together portfolio you can show the
perspective of all employers to the next
step after you don't with certificate
yeah men having a personal portfolio
site having a github all that sort of
stuff do you believe that the free free
code camp fronts are correct them is
enough to look for a job it may be I
mean I got one before I finished it but
honestly it depends so much on you are
you doing things outside of it you know
I was building my I built my website in
angularjs I was learning frameworks I
was learning get these are all things
that aren't covered in in the free code
camp curriculum is April looking for a
job an IT sort of she's leaf or project
manager rules she just finished a couple
classes on project management and it has
to take some certification tests and
then she should be able to get a role
pretty pretty fast hopefully
that's the game playing anyhow she's
gonna take her test in the next few days
but she said I live in California not
anymore I did the bulk of my life left
I've been in Florida for about a year in
three months but the rest of my time
listing Los Angeles California area
uh yeah I'm uploading new projects so
the first one that I'll upload will come
out on Monday it's just a random quote
machine and angular fun little project
for you guys to do start to finish one
video I uh I'll probably do I don't is
there something you guys want me to
build I didn't really enjoy rebuilding
the project I've done before it makes it
so that it's quick and easy
are there boot camps for other
industries yeah man there's like casino
dealer schools there's bartending
schools there's uh there's EMT programs
we ever tried for the big four probably
I've been interviewed by Amazon in the
past they've reached out to me I didn't
pass their their second technical
interview but I I think I having gone
through the process I think there's a
shot that I could do it
also reading like I get the I get to
LinkedIn emails right hey we think you
should apply for this job I read those
job descriptions and I fill out a lot
more of those categories than I did
before and they're not nearly as
intimidating like you know when you look
at especially when you're just going to
start you look at those job descriptions
and you're like oh my god
no one will ever hire me it's not it
doesn't feel like that as much anymore
when I look at the jobs for Google and I
look at the jobs for Amazon and things
like that they're all skill set I'm
familiar with or I'm working on or I
have and then it's a-you know I have a
I've some things that aren't on there
but I I would be considered I think if I
if I applied in a year or two I I think
I can confidently say I may be I may be
really hard to get the job but I could
eventually get a job there just because
I almost got a job at Amazon so that
that's sort of what I'm also based in
off
I wonder if I should pick up Linux
I'm zoning off man I'm getting tired
family would I recommend doing the free
code camp back in certificate I would
recommend always learning if you want to
learn node if you want to learn express
you wanna learn MongoDB filner Mongoose
yeah it doesn't hurt it's a great way to
expose yourself to back in we're just
getting started school on Kevin
what was a technical interview like well
there's multiple phone calls and then
there was an algorithm testing then
there is the algorithm of tests on the
phone
should we go through interesting
websites uh
try to replicate by ourselves it's not a
bad practice it's not something I've
ever done I personally prefer building
projects because you'll learn just as
much so really you might learn to be a
little bit better at web dev or web
design than you would web dev which is
more JavaScript based in my opinion
Kevin what are you thinking about these
light this light coin games lately white
Linux it's a skill that could help you
that it does nothing but help you
it's how I look at it with with Linux
it's like look at you job maybe not but
it might make it might might could it
might make an employer like you a little
bit more which might get you a job it's
kind of like Windows or Mac for your or
what I don't know it's what the UH it's
one of those things were just nothing
but help you if it's a skill you have
and so it might be worth the investment
I guess is what I'm trying to say like
no one's gonna care that you use Windows
or you prefer a Mac but some do care if
you have a lint if you're familiar with
Linux how you know you're ready to apply
for jobs uh I personally knew when I was
able to build my own projects when you
build your own projects you should be
able to get a job reactor angular first
just learn one and start applying for
jobs and then whatever your job has
learned it in more detail
what did I do at my job I build stuff I
built stuff and I fix stuff I do a lot
of greenfield development building
projects from scratch credit
applications admin tools client-facing
widgets whatever is needed
it's going on Casey
oh I couldn't make my headphones work on
Linux so effective if angular users
webpack to compile and I know angular
and what compile means can't put wetback
on my resume spend an hour watching a
web pack video then put on your resume
that would be my advice at least you'll
be able to talk to it talk about it I
personally prefer JSON databases over
relational databases I'm not familiar
with bit code how do you prepare for
coding interviews I did a video talking
about that top 5 ways top 5 ways to
prepare for a coding interview
relational databases are not underrated
that most companies use relational
databases I personally think JSON
databases are just easier to work with
because it's much more like Java Script
so that's my thing
everything that's javascript is bad
because it makes my life easier and I
can get it going much faster
closures aren't that hard if you really
someone sits you down and talks to you
about it I give you an example of
closures oh no I understand sequel has
look I'm not saying sequel is not the
superior database I'm just saying
sequel and get me a JSON database
favorite text editor is a Visual Studio
code for sure
yeah
you
I was listening a podcast about life
philosophy says he doesn't sick goals
rather he sets up systems and life that
leads him to his ideal sounds like he
sets goals and has ways to achieving
those goals which is at least how I
think about it so like goals are nothing
but empty words unless you come up with
plans of action to accomplish them so
keep that in mind you can have goals
everyone has goals and dreams what are
you doing to accomplish those goals and
dreams on a daily basis if you're not
taking one step forward to your goals
and dreams then they're nothing but
empty words so that's how I interpret
his philosophy which essentially if that
is how he's essentially saying that I've
kind of say my same same stance just
once a thanks for your videos I've
dabbled coding my teenager years but
gave up on it for a quote-unquote real
job ten years later you know you have
other youtubers that inspired me you and
a few others thank you man
I am what I do not what I say yeah
and I get it man it's easier to talk the
talk and walk the walk then then to walk
the walk right it's kind of like the old
the old thing is the be rich not look
rich oftentimes the people who are
buying not I said this today I'm still
pissed off about this I was at
McDonald's like a month or two ago and
the guy was making fun of me at the
register about the crack on my phone
and meanwhile he pulls out an iPhone X
plus or ten plus where the newest one is
so yeah man check this sweet thing out
it starts telling me about how I gotta
get a new phone because that thing's all
I I couldn't stand the crack on it's
like you're a idiot
you spent three weeks of your check on a
new phone if there's a month's worth
salary some that you definitely
should not afford kind of not afford on
a McDonald salary and it's just all
right man that blew my mind playing out
the point I'm saying is words are cheap
man but actually going out there and
doing what you say you're gonna do is is
something entirely different
he was totally he was totally slamming
on me
I'll be honest oh my phone is pretty
bootleg it's got a big ol it's cracked
it's got a big old purple line that a
little
for $90,000 you can buy a house in Tampa
in the area maybe nine Tampa but in the
surrounding area you might be alone in
the right part of town or the wrong
pretty you look
laughter with the bin van nah man he
said he's just a young guy it's too dumb
to know any better I don't have the
energy to I don't have the energy to uh
to educate him you buying houses or
condos neither one I'm buying new plexes
or apartments
have I had a chance to check out
traversing medias JavaScript course I
have I have watched his video which made
me halt putting mine out because he has
like 22 hours of content in it and I
have five and I'm not done with it I
have about two more hours of stuff I
need add but then I got to do projects
and whereas just make it hard to compete
man that's Frankie Howard to me so yeah
I am excited for that course very much
so
do
ootek mmm oh on YouTube yeah I do
I don't watch too many videos that guys
put in work I don't know what he's doing
it's hard to keep up with these guys man
that's probably why I'm not growing as
fast as I do I like traveling yes so
when I first got down here we did a
little bit traveling nothing too crazy I
went to Europe I went to Cuba on some
low-budget trips and country to ourself
but right now the reason that we haven't
gone anywhere in the last like six
months is we're saving to buy place God
man my arms are looking skinny look at
this man I'm looking like I'm looking
looking like a like oh my god I got twig
arms oh I need the NEA start pumping
that iron yourselves then but yeah so
we're not trying to spend any money
right now we're in the let's buy let's
buy a house with my investment property
stage
you
to Brussels I got like a ticket for like
275 or 300 bucks round trip I went for
like three four days even my
girlfriend's clowning on me in the chat
right now go to bed baby
god I always use arrow functions I it's
just so much less to write in so much
cleaner
isn't it creepy that my girlfriend who
is in the other room watches this the
stream why we're here
I think strange movie flirting next
month anything relevant I should know oh
one look around for rents because
they're all over the place they'll
typically be pretty cheap so I would say
just find something to find something
that is that is within your price range
and then find something 100 dollars
cheaper and then to the food sucks
that's all I got your food and Florida
kind of sucks it's taken us a while to
find a few good places there's not any
Mexican food which is something that uh
that I that I missed from California
our people Florida as bad as you know it
says um it's hard it's hard to say that
there's a lot of at least in the areas
that I've lived in there's a lot of
poverty and drug use so that's really no
different than Los Angeles so I don't I
don't know it's kind of the same it
depends on where you're coming from
though does anybody know what that's
about on John's channel is it just like
hey we are men and we're being manly is
that what the whole like let's take your
shirt off thing is this simple program
does
it's it sure that Florida is full old
people that's definitely too sure we got
into restaurants we've looked around and
we're the only people that are like 30
and on their Android and salary is not
as good for DES it depends honestly guys
your salary depends so much on you and
how hard you market yourself and how
what you're willing to accept so there's
no Florida No
it's cold it's a little chilly lately
it's not like freezing cold
yeah I mean I think we at all if we all
didn't have to work I think just out of
pure boredom and having a better sleep
schedule you would actually work out
codex I would recommend that you just do
courses
and here's the thing whenever you give
advice everyone's gonna have criticism
so like I could say this is a smaller
Channel most the advice I give and I
stay away from controversial topics John
I would say just less so and he's much
more forceful with his opinions than I
am for the most part on those
controversial topics and that's just
naturally going to lead people yeah you
have their greed or you disagree and so
you're gonna get criticism anytime
advice as part of it you're gonna get
criticism we're talking about John saw
Sean miss simple programmer do you like
the idea of create your own business
yeah I mean part of the reason I like
YouTube is the fact that I I get to do
what I want I don't have to worry about
other people's
have a good one Kevin staying true to
the brand of coding I mean that's what
this channel is about but John's channel
he death you talks about software he
talks about development but he can
definitely make the argument that he's
taken away he's gone in a different
direction slightly but you can't really
blame him for doing that because this is
channeling do over the hell he wants
right
when's the JavaScript course coming I
want to add two projects to it so I kind
of burned myself out on that project
probably not for another two weeks
it's got like great videos on it though
it's got about 140 videos on it right
now I still have to do more content for
it I want to say John's marketing
Johnson mixture of development Jones a
mixture of a software development
personal development a little bit of
marketing and investment so he's a lot
of all that what's up with me and
YouTube what do you mean so here's the
funny thing I'm actually so I am doing
more not to videos I'm working on a new
intro for it it's gonna be the new the
new hotness the new fire look forward to
it
look forward to it I have a custom intro
that I'm building for the not to videos
the oh I'll just give you a hint of I'll

top top ten ways not to put a ring

a girl is dead so anyhow guys I
appreciate you all I'm gonna couple
after a little bit short because I'm
tired man
we're almost at 31 K I wanted to do this
video I look forward to the new projects
I'm building in angular 5 or a current
version angular just so that you know
it's something I wanted you to do if you
want to throw out some ideas for
projects over the next five minutes I
look cuz I'm gonna do a little little
outro as we do a little outro I'm open
to ideas for projects cuz I want to
build something new but you know so I
like to leave you guys on a final
thought that's how I like to do this
stuff and earlier we're talking about
goals earlier we're talking about plans
and plans of action and goals and they
go hand-in-hand goals and plans of
action and every day you wake up if you
really have goals that you want to
accomplish one thing that I am always
very concerned about is my brother has
this one day I'll get my together
one day I'll care about making money one
day I'll care about this and if you
already have these goals it's kind of up
to you to to to work towards them daily
one day is always by the time one day
comes you're already gonna want what it
is that you're trying to accomplish so I
encourage you to set up you probably
already know what you want out of life
at this point maybe not how you're going
to achieve it but you need to start
working one step at a time to
accomplishing your goals and if you're
not you're gonna regret it later on in
life angles when they're when there's no
plan of action to actually accomplish
that goal it's nothing but words and so
I hope that if you do have goals you do
have dreams that you have plans too
accomplish those and not just think
they're gonna happen because they won't
you have to work hard and you have to
set up a game plan and work towards it
with that being said guys I appreciate
you I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
