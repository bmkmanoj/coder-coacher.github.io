can't um all right um so you haven't
unfortunately been able to get any
coding in today yet so there's not
really much to update on from yesterday
right no I just haven't been feeling
very well but you're gonna code after
this yes good all right so let's get
back to where we were at yesterday in
terms of the JavaScript now we go to
beta free code camp calm your notes you
know book
you don't have it you go too fast for me
okay Neal Floyd welcome fair enough fair
enough
all right so actually if I need you to
just go back to the video I'm good
all right so here we are put on my
glasses
so up here all right
so keep your nación for we go some like
bringing up a really coffee I got the AC
you doing
I cool so I'm changing if-else
statements the last time let's do a
little bit of review so last time we're
talking about if statements then we're
talking about Elsa SH and then we're
talking about else statements explain to
me what all three how all three interact
an if statement is to find out if it's
true or false in and if it's true what
happened friends okay and then if you
have an if-else statement elsif was else
if and there's an if-else no there's a
else if okay else if statement is well
just kind of like so you can have an if
statement and if that if statements not
true then there's the owl's and then the
else would run yes
now what about the else if the hell's if
I forget that one so the else if is an
if statement that only runs if the if
statement above it fails and so if it
goes if else--if else--if how does it
different from what you said because you
said a health statement
I see what it's art its art right so so
an if statement evaluates if something's
true or false and then if it's true it
runs that code next an else statement is
the last statement you only ever have
one else for each if bundle and that
will only run if everything else fails
if all the it fails if all the else if
fail it will run the else okay okay so
you can have an if an else if and else
yes and so it will only run the else if
all out all else fails say I did that I
and so uh um and else if runs if the F
above it runs so if it goes if else if
else if else if that third else if the
if and the two other else's all have to
fail for it to hit that third one the
third just else else if yes no else
there's only ever going to be one else
for each bundle okay you just study I
thought you were talking about an if
else if and else I'm talking about
understanding how they all work together
so in the example where I have an if
else if another else if another else if
if to get to that third else if for the
fourth one these first three have to
fail okay I get that okay yeah all right
so we're gonna go what about the elves
by itself else won't run unless they all
fail so if all like say there's five
total okay okay leave looking at me like
that for
jah-el all right so so in here the the
big welcome welcome the the objective
here is to so you shot everyone off your
hand no sure I don't know you're holding
it front I was looking at it it looks
pretty bloody still
get away from me yeah David yang welcome
welcome
Krishna Jordan all right so let's let's
go ahead and chain some of these
together so the first thing remember
logical order if we're checking and we
want to see how large a number is
starting from smallest to largest
um if we're doing less than if we want
to do largest as small as we do greater
than in this case we always start with
an F right and so we always start with
an if in JavaScript in any language
which you're using a if statement
what of course you're gonna use if you
using an if statement do all stay with
start with it no in in a conditional
statement you will always start with an
if and never in Elsa for an else yes
how'd the doctor visit what it went well
let me see I'll show you guys real quick
before we dug back into if you can see
here I you can see they took the
stitches out of my wrist I can't see it
what are you doing
they took the stitches out of my wrist
there and then my finger it's a little
bloody but uh they took the stitches out
of there so the bandages are off and now
it's just gonna take a couple of weeks
to heal but all in all it looks like the
procedure was the success and you all
won't be calling me nubs anytime soon
alright um anyhow let's get back to so
in here in start with the if statement
or say look if our parameter that we're
passing is less than five we want it to
return tiny else--if because we're if
that one fails we want to have another
one that goes else if the number is less
than ten we want it to return something
else and the elsif will only run if the
number fails right so if the number six
it will return small
else if again if the number is less than
15 will return medium it's only going to
be that if the other two fail else if
else if the way where you can't go whoa
else it is lesson one good hand all
right so else if the number is less than
twenty we're going to return large right
and then now for our last one because
it's because now we're saying for all
other cases that doesn't match this all
all our statements here all our cases
fail we have an else that says this is
basically for everything else and in
here we're going to return
huge you're missing if same interpreter
no remember it goes oh yeah okay so
let's let you um if I say the number
three what's it gonna be
and if I say 21 what's it going to be
huge
good and if it's 13 medium good all
right and that's because on 13 this is
going to fail this is going to fail and
then it this one's gonna pass good
all right basic JavaScript golf this one
I remember doing back I don't know golf
and so it was confusing so it might take
a second so part strokes will be numeric
and positive in the game of golf each
hole has a par meaning the average
number of strokes a golfer is expected
to make in order to sink the ball in a
hole to complete the play depending on
how far above or below par your strokes
are there is a different nickname your
flow your function will be past par in
strokes arguments return the correct
string according to this table which
lists the strokes and order priority top
highest to lowest all right so this is
this is a good example of putting it all
together so right now they're giving you
they don't really tell you exactly what
to do we have to these are all our tests
that need to pass and we have to write
our logic so that this does work and and
this is what's kind of to dive a little
deeper than necessary this is this would
be a great example of test-driven
development so you pat write tests that
that these would pass for fashion a
living we take questions at the end of
the sort of tutoring session so just
hang out for a little bit and if you
guys have any questions you're still
here we'll answer them for about 10 or
20 minutes all right so um par it's the
average number of strokes and strokes or
how many it took write down your thing I
understand that correctly all right so
um should the strokes so we could start
stroke if it's strokes strokes is less
than 1 okay so I'm going to let you
guide this one so if strokes is less
than 1 or equal to 1
equal to 1 it's a hole-in-one
returned hole-in-one
oh cool so let's run that see if that
pass so it paths for our hole-in-ones
so that's good we're on the right track
so now what do we do for a win it is
eagle what is this what it was the next
statement so ego looks like it but what
it wouldn't tell me the code that I need
to write I don't know is it going to be
an else--if yeah because if it's not a
hole-in-one and and remember we're
talking about logical order so we're
starting from the okay so you don't want
to use just a bunch of statements no the
reason you don't want to use a bunch of
if statements is because it would run
them all and you could actually
theoretically hit a bunch of them when
you don't want to so it makes your code
faster and it also is better because you
could get multiple results when you're
not when you don't want to and it could
change your code because maybe maybe
instead of returning a hole-in-one we
actually set strokes to something else
to another value and then it hits
another if statement that it sets it to
another value again so we have an
else--if here um and what we'll need is
so this is saying if strokes is less
than or equal to power minus 2 it's
equal to eagle see I don't necessarily
like that they actually write this out
here like that but you you see the table
here so what do we what do we write in
the cell statement well there you have
it
three which I find interesting but it's
probably because a lot of people don't
understand what a part two is because
all the other ones so in this case is
strokes is less than equal part minus 2
we want to return you only can run this
real quick to see that it it works so
all right cool more of our tests are
golden
these are passing for our eagle now what
about the next thing would be another
elsif right so we're checking if so if
it's not a part two and it's not a
hole-in-one I guess I'd be a birdie
which is in my eyes like a part or years
of them I don't know golf but in my low
strokes everybody go gone Milo we're
doing last year come on buddy well all
right come on
you're lying daddy's left um so if
strokes is is exactly equal to par minus
one now the reason we're doing exactly
equal is to check two values what are
they two things rather see if it's true
or not true to being true our statement
we're checking them it's true but we're
using triple equals the strictly equal
operator to see the type and the value
now we this could pass with a a double
equals but it's just better your pass
and strictly equal value my lay the
down
all right so return everybody I don't
know if you guys can see this but I got
a cat over here rubbing his head on my
 hand as I'm trying to type all
right so returned birdie all right so
now we're going to do another elsif
right because we're going to see if
strokes is actually equal to par because
I know that if strokes is equal to par
is the average right right and strokes
are me too
so if it if if that we're just going to
have em returned talk I'll get your butt
out of my face
all right um else if you see we're
running quite a bit of code right now to
get what we want sometimes it goes like
this
there's other there's a there's other
things called switch statements which
we'll look at soon it will kind of be
like a nil safe but different you know
so else if the strokes is equal equal
the par plus one we want to return bogey
which apparently means you almost you're
just below average as I understand it
else if that desperate go home
this is ROK's is go home don't you wanna
go home what are your home are you too
good for your home alright so if you get
plus two it's called double bogey and
finally in our last statement it's gonna
be an else statement right because we've
we've eliminated all the other cases so
it can only be oh yeah it could only be
returned go home
exclamation point my logo kill the
seagulls there good boy alright so here
we've now set up a small algorithm or a
small can you call this algorithm if you
want a small function that based off of
that will calculate golf score as long
as we put in how many strokes and how
many
how what the par is yeah and that will
tell us what we got and we'll never have
to rewriting it wasn't something calling
like we did like we would normally write
here where we call this function and if
this was like a web application these
numbers here would be inputs that we
would we would get the value and then we
would paste them into here if you will
and it would then run our function to
give us a return cool cool cool super
cool so now we're gonna I thought they
might be going with this so now we're
going to be talking about switch
statements so I've also done this like
twice so uh I know I usually know how
they structure these things Milo get out
of here he never comes in here except
when were filming he's like he knows
what I love you have TV ah you do BRR
yeah cat uber can't do oh alright so
there's these things called switch
statements which what they do is it's
kind of like a shorthand shorthand if
statement that checks for particular
values um so in this case no it's just a
different way at the end of the day um
and if you it's better to write a switch
statement instead of a bunch of if
statements if you're checking for an
exact number or exact thing so if you
have a bunch of if statements you should
probably use a switch statement does
that make sense
it's just better suited than issue you
could get serious or a bunch of else if
statements uh a bunch of if else if
statements
because then they're all chained
together right so you should look into a
switch statement the way the cash should
I was on the show we kind of does he
sure is a channel with his two brothers
yeah maybe I'll I'm a cat coding section
I do have a video where I tried to use
the cats at a coding and they come out
very well I might relieve a release a
blooper reel at one day just my
look Wow yeah there you go good boy
alright so in this case the way that we
set up a switch statement is we use this
word switch and we pass in the the value
that we're checking so let's say we have
a variable that we're checking in this
case it's the parameter Val we set use
the keyword switch Val and so what's
going to happen is is we set these cases
these are kind of like our if statements
except we're checking the value so we're
going to say case and let's look at our
test so case 1 means if the value is 1
we want to do some stuff in this case we
want to return alpha or actually we want
to set answer is equal to alpha
sir is equal to alpha so make sense so
far
so in our switch statement we're
checking up parameter so let's say this
is 3 nothing would happen yeah right but
if it's 1 it's going to set the value of
answer to alpha okay so it's very
specific yes
we're checking a value of something and
seeing if it matches the case okay could
you do a less than and greater than
equals stuff and switch statements yes
although typically that's not how why
you do it it's usually like when you
have a set amount of outcome so like we
could do like case 1 minus 2 and it's
negative 1 it returns alpha so we could
do it like that as well um but you're
usually you're not checking you're not
you could do it but usually you're
checking for a specific value in a
switch statement most of the time so
here we have answers equal to alpha now
we have to use this break keyword the
reason that we use it is because
otherwise it will keep running all the
cases it doesn't know to break out of
the switch statement yeah now the next
thing that we can do if we can have as
many cases as we want we have case here
so in case 2 if the so if the value is 2
what we're going to do is once that the
answer equal to beta and we have to use
a break statement here as well or we'll
keep checking the answers and it's the
same sort of stuff is the reason you do
else ifs is so that it doesn't reset the
value here it's not an else--if but
they're essentially all ifs and you have
to break the cycle to switch state the
switch by using the break keyword
otherwise we'll go on indefinitely so
it'll just keep
going over case one yes sorta just use
bring that's it that's just good let's
use a break uh but um it will not
necessarily keep going over a case one
but it will continue going through the
rest of the switch statement so if we
have a hundred switch statements what
this break keyword does we haven't used
it so far but what it does is it breaks
out of a loop it breaks out of your if
statements it breaks so we haven't got
two loops yet but say we were looping
from ten times where we're going to run
our same code ten times it's called a
for loop and in there are it checked an
if statement when it hit five we set our
value and we knew that that was all we
wanted we only wanted to go till we hit
five but we had to run it for ten for
some reason we would use the break
keyword to break out of the loop and so
in in that if statement so that it
wouldn't run the rest of the for loop
and that's what's going on here all
right I get it it's new stuff I get it
hi so case three and here we're going to
say answer is equal to gamma and then we
have to break out of it and see if they
have less use I don't think they have a
CC fault
and so we'll just set case for they're
going to introduce in the next section
alright so there's also a default
similar to the else but we haven't got
to that so only so answer here is equal
to Delta and let's go ahead and break
now alright so what so uh in our switch
statement if we have a value of 3 what
is our answer
gamma yeah good and then we break it so
that if forant if we set answer to 4 for
instance or value to 4 it wouldn't
change our situation change change our
objective but break takes us out of the
switch statement that's what it does
same thing with for loops and while
loops and things like that but we
haven't got to that yet all right so we
just covered a switch statement now
there's a default which is essentially
the else of switch statements where if
all our cases fail we use a default and
go from there okay so default is the
default value of all the cases fail so
this thing else yeah alright so in this
case what know so in this case we have
our switch statement
and we pass in the value that we're
checking in this case it's Val and we
have a case which in this case is a a
the character a and we are saying hey if
a is there our answer is equal to
happen an example of this is maybe you
made a test and yet a b c d or e yeah
and if they didn't put one of the
answers the default might just be zero
like and you're just the answer if it's
correct you get a point if it's not you
don't get a point or you get negative
points and if you don't answer at all
you definitely don't get any points
right so that's kind of how you could
look at a switch statement is kind of a
multiple choice it's essentially a
multiple choice with a default if you
don't answer the question or it doesn't
match anything so in this case answer
here for a is for Apple do another case
oh and then we break right and then we
do another case my little you are
driving me nuts one B in this
case B is equal to the answer
okay the answer ya see this like
standing on top of my hand right
now uh I feel like I want your hand to
be better daddy so in this case the
answer here B is for bird B yard and we
have to break the switch statement again
and then we have KC
so if our vowel is C it's the answer
here is going to be cat and so we break
that's right and then if we don't do any
of that stuff we use a default statement
here and we say answer is equal to stuff
and there's no break cuz it's the last
one you can't use a break if you break
on the other one but it wasn't the last
one yeah was now the default wasn't the
last oh so you don't use it on there
traditionally you always use it girls
don't need breaks no but I believe I
believe it's good convention to have
breaks in there but it's optional I'd
have to look up if it's a current good
convention or bad convention to write
that in there buddy where do you look
that up Google that's Sachs the Stack
Overflow I I don't know I couldn't tell
you I saw multiple identical options to
switch things we can make that website
so let's say that remember we had all
right have a good one now
remember when we had Wars and hands and
things like that
yeah remember the worst sure yeah so
let's say we wanted to get a number one
or two and we wanted our we're okay with
either number and it returned the same
thing so in an if statement we use or in
this case we would actually just set up
multiple cases and then just have a one
set of logic and then one break so in
this case we little bit more specific
there's no so if let's set up our switch
name again milah
alright buddy you get in the way so
switch sooner switch statement here oh
you're so in the way by little you're
just totally in no way if our case is
won our case and then we want check we
want four one two three to return low so
instead of writing a bunch of low return
low return low break break what we can
do is case one case two case and on the
last one case oops
case three and in here we can say a
result our answer is equal to low
capital low and then break well we're
going to do that next but this is this
is an example of having multiple cases
with only one return cool so now if we
wanted to do case four five and six
these are all supposed to be colons and
semicolons yes
semicolons ends things in this case a
cult is it's very rare that you're going
to use colons like this it's really only
for switch statements and then later on
for objects and things like that most of
the time when you're organizing code
you're going to be using brackets switch
statements are a little unique in that
fashion so here we're going to set our
answer equal to mid and finally okay
seven okay or better yet right we learn
default so if it's not mid and it's not
and let's not forget our break right
don't forget to do seven through nine
but we we can base off what's going on
here if it's not one two and three and
it's not four five and six we can
default it too high or actually no we
can't because what if they put in
something that's not bad right so I was
taking a little bit of Liberty with what
they were asking well let's say we put
in hello is still going to return high
which you may behind you is okay seven
case eight case nine and here we're
going to set the answer is equal to high
and then because it's not a default
we're going to use a break let's run
this make sense
checking a bunch of values in return if
it's any of those for returning the same
result can you strengthen switch
statements yeah use strings use
boolean's you can use any type of
variable we just did a single when we
said a is if it's a character a sample
remember that yeah that was a string so
here we are going to replace this if
else if block with the switch statement
that's the task right now so and you can
see that when they're all kind of
similar like you can see when you'll
need to switch it switch it up so we
have this Val and all we're doing is
checking the Val throughout the whole
thing this is a good indicator that
you're probably should have a switch
name and then we have a return answer
which we can leave it there as well so
in our case
Samuel feels and Josh just wait like 15
minutes then we'll answer questions guys
so here we're going to create a switch
statement which remember takes the value
that's in here and it examines it and
then we're going to write a case and
we're going to say look if this case is
Bob we're just going to line by line we
want to go ahead and set our answer
equal the Marley and then we want to
break all right
we're now converting our yeah
but I don't see how the switch in this
case like why would you use the switch
in this case why not just leave it with
the bow my answer um and right now it's
a matter of preference it really is a
matter of preference what comes with
switcher else if I'm not going to be a
matter of preference I'm what are the
extreme differences what are the
benefits what is it I mean that right
here if you have I'll read what it says
here but it really is a matter of
preference so if you have many options
to choose from a switch statement can be
easier to write than mini chain if and
else if statements so it really just
depends on the user and what you prefer
I personally very rarely write a switch
statement but that's also because I'm
not in a situation where I'm writing a
bunch of if analysis if I if I was in a
situation where I'm writing something
like this and it's simple I would switch
it to a switch statement but not every
if and else if can be a switch statement
it depends the one you want to use it
baby that's the truth not everything is
even though there's there's multiple
ways of doing it in this case and so
what we're showing is how to convert one
if else to either Chris Leon says that
they're faster for longer lists which is
also true so like if you have a big
if-else ah on the in the back ground
it's faster okay thank you forgot about
that Chris making me look bad um so in
this case our come the next part is we
have the answer
I know it's true true in Java that
switch statements run fast analysis I
don't know if it's true in JavaScript it
probably is so
so we're instant the answer here equal
to the ant oh no oh this is the answer
sorry mr. right what I was looking at so
the answer and we're so this is equal to
42
so we're just converting this over line
by line and throw our break in here and
then we'll have case 1 and you see how
we have multiple types right not a big
deal
and we're saying the answer here is
equal to there is no ok so just to get
this straight so like if the value is
Bob to answer is Marley so the for case
if Bob is the value yeah and the answer
is Marley correct that's what's
happening so the switch is taking
whatever's in here it would seem shorter
because it's passing the value equals
making sure yeah cuz it's like ok and
Bob okay Marley here in the if statement
it kind of feels like it's saying okay
we got Bob let's see if it matches up
with Bob up it's Bob okay Marley as long
as it makes sense all right so we have
case 99 and we want to say the answer is
equal to missed me by this much there's
no objection like you can't write Tom
and get the answer
it'll just come back what nor undefined
uh and we'll come back anything unless
you set a default same thing with your f
in else's it'll check them all and then
it won't do anything because none of its
true unless you have an else and or
unless you have a default okay that's
okay say nine and else they're not else
is a case
seven we're going to say the answer is
equal to eight get the job seven eight
nine and now we can go ahead and get rid
of all this I always thought that joke
is really like scary just gross
so this the one thing is I this is
probably easier to read than the rest of
this oh yeah it does the same thing but
at the other day it's probably easier
eat and it runs faster so it's getting
rid of that and then we run our
statement and we're good to go
Green take coach in the yon 50 minutes
hmm no we go at the 15-minute mark
so here you see that all right so we're
going to be showcasing how we can use
the return so when we return something
we can actually pass river out with our
statement checks like if we say one is
equal equal to two it will say true or
false
the other term false there right we can
do the same thing we return statements
simplify our code so we have this if
statement we're saying look if this
number is smaller than this number
return true so if a is smaller than B
return true else return false because
it's larger than B or in that case is
equal to B could be equal to B still
return false so what we want to do is we
want to get rid of what we have here and
instead we can return we want all we
want to do is return a true or false
value so we can say we have one line of
code where we say return what do we want
to turn a less than B like that and it
will return true or false and we've
eliminated code and now it runs faster
so this would be a great example of
refactoring
Lucia all Club
oh man on the new code
oh so fun
this is interesting so this actually
chains together so the new code all
we're doing is for returning a less than
B we're returning the value this returns
okay so you don't need and you don't
actually need and if statement not in
this case no how would you know what
cases you would need in it they were it
would depend on complexity if if all
we're doing is one statement if if all
we want this function to do is one thing
like let's say we want it to add them a
plus B it would return a plus B in this
case we're checking for a boolean value
is a less than B it can only be two
things true or false
okay so something that simple we can
write like this yeah um I mean what you
could do is a true/false game and I say
and we both write down something and
that's that's bad exactly all right yeah
well what we could do is let's say I can
guess your card in a deck of cards and
so you pick your card I write down a
number and then we compare the two
values are they equal if they are return
true if it's don't return false you but
that's that's the point maybe is you can
make anything you want and sometimes
there is things where all you need to do
is find out all you need to do is find
you need to know how all the tools are
here and so this is showing you that you
can return things like that
all right
modify the function AB test so that if a
or b are less than zero the function
will immediately exit with a value of
undefined
okay so here is asking us to a simple
test here so if a is less than zero or B
is less than zero what we wanted to do
is return undefined if not if neither
one of these is less than zero we want
it to run our this math function this
math data we have this math return arm
and you'll see that we have undefined
it's not in quotes because it's a type
right Egyptian that's just refactoring I
know that's not refactoring what this is
is this is the kind of this is to set up
a statement so that our logic here
doesn't break so the reason that this
would break here is you can't take the
square root of 0 unless you start
getting into like theoretical
mathematics and things like that and
there isn't because it's not real
 math there isn't like a math
library that can handle that really now
that I'm aware of but it's traditional
math you you probably have two special
things so in situations like that
instead we're going to check hey if our
values that work we're going to break it
our values that will break it return
undefined and never hits this return
because you can only get one return in
each thing that you're doing it breaks
us out of this function
all right counting cards ah this is a
long one so we can we can break here
error this one um let's see all right
guys I'm gonna stand up real quick
are you really that fat that this thing
ain't going up no one
alright guys so uh any quiet I know
somebody some of you guys ask questions
uh someone's asked if Rico camp was a
good place to start to be a developer so
I do a video I did a video called is
free code camp worth it and I answer
that in detail in about ten or twelve
minutes and I highly and check encourage
you to check it out - these live streams
is my most recent video and it answers
exactly that what you did just moving it
oh my gosh off center and bottom bothers
me um but yeah let's see there's another
there's another question
what do I think about team treehouse I
think you get a lot of videos that you
probably could get for free on YouTube
but at the same time there's a lot on
there for a relatively good price um I
personally so I actually sign up for
team treehouse a while back and I didn't
like what I saw but I was also very
early on uh in it so I was looking for
something more like code Academy than
videos on team treehouse so Joshua JSA
Dillon if you could go back to yourself
when you were starting your cs3 what
advice would you give maybe change the
web design instead of doing CS um no I
don't think I would do that ah I could
see how that's but that would be
beneficial to change my degree to web
development instead of computer science
but I probably if knowing what I know
now and this is a big if because
obviously you can never know what you
know now I would never have gone in the
first place that would be that would be
my honest college choice I would instead
have gone to a boot camp and done the
self-taught developer out which I've
been very sick not very successful but
much more successful in my personal life
cuz of it that would be the route I
would go and but with that being said
not everybody not everybody can do that
route it takes slip it takes a different
like colleges for certain people and
self taught us for certain people boot
camps are for certain people and not
everybody can go down the same route so
you have to decide what's best for you
now that's that's just how it would be
for me at least oh man
big boy are you happy you're up so high
I've had to refactor that out of other
people's code more than like yeah you
have to uh as a developer refactoring is
part of the process right so it's always
it's always something I believe there's
one more question that got asked early
on let me see my finger went well ish by
the way stitches are out hurt like
to get a pulled out though let me tell
you man because of scabbed over all the
sir stuff Dreckman free code camp for
want to be deaf I think free cooking
it's a great place to get started and
you have to you have to go you have to
go from there
Nick fan deck so I want to see my
comment in chat there you go man stop
breaking things well um I want to see my
compass totally your world-famous now
Nick Vandenberg um alright so there's
not too many questions so I will shall I
leave them with a final thought do you
want to leave them with a final thought
here watch Jerry Springer Oh God
Jerry Springer you ever Jerry
Springer now Tommy Lauren his final
thoughts like in Jerry Springer
Jerry wood so after all the shenanigans
would happen on Jerry Springer Jerry uh
kitten yeah uh so which programming
language did you find the hardest Scala
which is a functional programming
language was the hardest language I ever
had um I didn't enjoy it I liked it I
don't remember any of it now Dylan do
you have a preview of the upcoming ask a
deaf yet which ask a dev is that
uh so I have so much right now guys I
have about I've been filming videos
daily
Aska devs that I'm going to put up
probably this weekend my finger is you
know if you guys can see this but it's
pretty nasty still the stitches are out
of here in here so I've been kind of
holding off I've been a bit tired as
well but uh starting Monday I'll have a
video for the next 30 days on top of the
livestream yes that's the goal so you'll
be seeing lots of Vasudev so I might
even get around to it sooner I'm just
handling some other stuff in the
meantime how tall am I I'm six feet tall
we got another kid he isn't like me
doesn't like the essential owner she's
here daddy turn it off buddy I didn't
know you didn't like it hey buddy
what you doing um
God don't tear my PC down to you
it's another cat attack over here guys
got Tito and my little um just regular
JSON and react that's okay
um react just takes practice and Jason's
come pretty naturally once you dive into
it a little bit yeah it's good to get
it's good to get it is a great benefit
to get good with JSON because all the
web development a lot of it is dealing
with API switch come back in JSON format
as well as sending objects in and out
which is very JSON task as well well
good I don't know he's looking about the
deep dive is awesome I love Lily is
white like goodness like nose done yeah
this is the fix Scala just grab some cup
see just your scalp you're struggling
with iterations on JavaScript you mean
like for loops iterating through for for
loops and stuff
my suggestion is draw it out draw before
loop out draw actually draw out what
value for each iteration supposed to
happen and eventually you'll kind of
understand it I think it wants to get
down let's what he wants to do is afraid
to make the jump man up Milo I coming
you strapped the cats up here on this
standing desk just iterations in general
draw it out then um really like to get
yourself a white board and we got one
right there I got one in the corner over
there and I got like a six-foot one
right there I use white boards all the
time for a lot of different things in
coding and iterations are great for that
everybody so what you need to do is
understand that each one runs one time
right and then see
each value every step of your code walk
through it if you're if you have one
iteration and there's a if statement
another else F and F write down the
value next to your pseudocode and run
through it and eventually by a second or
third time you'll have an understanding
of how the iterations are working within
your code don't just expect when you're
getting started that you're going to
stare at the screen and to get these
things it takes practice and it takes it
takes learning I guess is what I'm
trying to say which is why like April
and I are sitting here I'm doing these
lessons going over and she goes and read
works through it and even then there's
still issues right and so you need to
not only do this we have to do other
things as well
drawing it out that's not Michael that's
April's code over there and so that's
just with HTML um sorry guys um I
appreciate everybody watching this
tutoring session if you will and what
are you gonna work on tonight um just
catch up on nukes
uh continue working on the portfolio oh
yeah of course so right right now April
is re uh back Milo right eating one of
those deities yeah right now April is
reverse engineering the portfolio page
on free code camp while doing the
JavaScript section at the same time and
then when she's done with the portfolio
page we'll do what we did with the
tribute page which is refactor it and
we'll also at that point I'll introduce
her to a text editor which she'll do
future code iterations in and and after
that we'll then get into get version
control and I'll show her how it works
and I'll explain the concepts to her and
what you're supposed to do with it
but that's kind of the game plan moving
forward
so it's
the meantime while she was working on
that we're going to continue going over
some subjects in JavaScript just kind of
introduce her to these my big thing with
software is you need to learn by
reference your nook there's so much to
learn in so many many languages
libraries and frameworks that we need to
learn it's not to memorize stuff which
is one of the the fortunate things about
school is all about memorization for the
most part is you actually need to learn
by reference because as a developer
you're googling things they want on
Stack Overflow
every single day and and you need to
just remember that this was a thing
basically that hey how what is that
thing I was looking for I'm trying to go
and do it
um so this is day seven day eight and
it's been a good thing compendium who is
Aaron if you cut the livestream we
interviewed him about technical
interview the video will be up in a few
days says I have another on-site
technical interview lined up for next
week they are supposedly emailing me a
specific date time good luck man ah I
imagine it'll only take one or two
interviews before you get hired thank
you David and if you guys want to
support the channels so that we can get
upgraded to 4k content that's a 4k
monitor I'm trying to raise $300 and
after that 4k webcam as well so we can
do better after day thank you uh and you
can try relearn maybe they're ready um
but um you can that be appreciate it's
for me on patreon and don't forget to
join our Facebook group code Tech and
caffeine I'll work over I like 20
members a day something like a 30 on a
good day
Oh dead cat feet just like that all
right baby you want it you wanna you
wanna say it good long and prosper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
