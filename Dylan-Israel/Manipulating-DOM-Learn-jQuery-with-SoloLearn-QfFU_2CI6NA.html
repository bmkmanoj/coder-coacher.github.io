back in solo learned doing jQuery
manipulate the Dom now last time we
talked about this a little bit and what
that basically means the Dom is the
document object model there's a nice
chart here but basically it just means
that you treat the document the HTML
document is what it's referring to and
then all these stuff that goes down is
the objects and you interact with it
that's basically all that means now what
kind of structure does the Dom have it's
a tree structure so what if you have the
document that roots down to the the HTML
tag which then roots down to other
things and so you have parent and child
relationship which basically means like
a UL has an Li within it and that's kind
of what it refers to don't mind it my
cats tearing stuff up over here guys I
Dom traversal as we just basically talk
to you hmm and the body and the h1s are
contained within the body etc etc now
elements I share the same parent are
called siblings jQuery has many powerful
tools for Dom traversal the parent
method refers the direct element for
example if we called the parent on here
let's go ahead and see it in action
because I haven't actually used the
parent method quite some time so we're
checking the parent of our paragraph tag
which is going to be the div element so
what's happening here is we're saying
look grab the parent of this tag and set
some CSS to it that's pretty cool don't
leave that close face our facebook group
code tech and caffeine go ahead and
check it out in description below if you
want to join a nice Facebook group now
what is the parent of the P element I
believe it should be this Li because
it's nested within
so see how it's nested that's how you
know it's a parent now the parent method
can only go up a single level apparently
so if you wanted to get all the all the
ancestor elements or the parent elements
you would then use parents you can also
get the children as well as the siblings
the next one all the siblings there's a
lot of these parent children that's
really the bulk of what you're gonna
need to do so if we want to call the
Heian item so we're studying a very
we're setting a variable here called
items let's start there and we want to
target the div element and call hide
method on all the siblings so siblings
and then we want to so we're storing
that value in a variable the item we're
targeting and then we want to go ahead
and say items dot hide to hide all that
div siblings
so eq2
the index number structure 0 so the EQ 1
dot text so if you only want to select
one at a time
you can use EQ which is kind of
interesting so we have alert the
paragraph EQ 1 so I starts at 0 so that
this is the first one so I believe it
should output won't be the reason it
does that it's just like an array starts
on the zero index so if you were to
break this paragraph tags into an array
you have paragraph 1 Earth's index 0
which is a index 1 which is being an
index 3 which is C for moving elements
you also do the same thing with remove
so sit let's say you want to remove an
element from the Dom or basically from
the page you can do that like so so
remove fill-in-the-blanks to remove all
siblings of the element with the ID text
so go ahead and pass in this your
selector hash tag text and we remove I'm
gonna select the siblings dot remove and
we can do it just like that in one
statement you don't need to break it up
in a variable it's helpful to break
things up into variables because that
will allow you to target it for other
things if needed so the empty method
will remove child elements from the HTML
so if we say div dot empty what this is
gonna do is visually clear it out that's
essentially the gist of it clear the Dom
so fill in the blanks to empty the
second child of the element with the ID
nav so we're gonna first go ahead and
store the value that we're looking for
which is nath and then we want to get
the children siblings know it's children
and then we want to target the second
one and then we want to empty it oh the
second one would be the the one index
excuse me so again that's the ID nav and
then we're going to get the children and
then we're gonna to get index one and
then we're going to empty it there we go
and let's jump into the module for quiz
how many siblings is a paragraph element
with ID Tech's have in the following
HTML this is interesting because I'm not
sure if it counts the IV text I believe
it should have two siblings because here
they're within the same scope here of
this div if you will so I'm gonna go
with two there we go
fill in the Mike select the first child
so we have to put in our jQuery selector
tag and then we want the first child of
the element so that's the index zero and
then fill in the blanks to remove all
the children of the paragraph tag so
select paragraphs children and from
there remove them and last but not least
what is output of the following code we
want to alert the paragraph parent so we
we have a paragraph tag here the parent
of that is the div and the siblings of
that div is the paragraph zero dot text
which is one I think that's right
oh my god all right so select the
paragraphs parents siblings which is a
div here okay so the paragraph tags
parent is the div its siblings meaning
it's at the same level is this div and
then go ahead and output the zero index
which is two here so re should be two
there we go oh that was a little bit of
a lot going on in that makes sense
though so we saw basically how you can
use parent child siblings to target the
Dom add the dog at two zom remove from
the Dom and all this other great things
sometimes you may just want to get
values as we saw earlier in
they're moving forward we're gonna do
events these are gonna be kind of cool
to make your page pop out a little bit
when you click something stuff happens
when you hover over stuff stuff happens
