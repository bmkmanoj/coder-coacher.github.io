about technical debt sort of what is it
why it exists and the harsh reality of
most of the time why doesn't get
resolved and why doesn't why don't you
ever pay that debt right so that's what
we're gonna be talking about today hey
guys I know a lot of you are trying to
get entry-level jobs internships get
land those junior level roles way up is
a company that specializes in getting
those entry-level roles I've been an
affiliate of theirs in the past so if
you're interested in checking them out
there'll be a link in the description if
you sign up I get like 75 cents it's
completely free no credit card required
again they specialize in entry-level
roles so I think it's pretty cool thing
there's not too many companies and job
boards that do that so check them out so
what is technical debt we should start
there right because it'll make a little
bit more sense for the of you who aren't
familiar with it so technical debt is
essentially items that you need to
complete to make your code more
efficient to make your code better more
readable more understandable but doesn't
necessarily have value to the business
right so let's say we built a feature
and the feature works it just it works
for they're very finite purpose but it
doesn't work in the sense of it's the
most efficient way possible it's the
cleanest way to write the code so that
when new developers come into the fold
it's understandable and it scales
properly right so businesses are very
focused on the now and then and that
kind of leads us to the why why does
technical debt exist usually technical
debt exists because unrealistic
timelines are given unrealistic wireman
sir given assumptions are made
communication is poor and the developers
sometimes have to cut corners to make
deadlines and you have this debt this
technical debt that you will have to
solve or somebody else will when the
time comes the the unfortunate thing
about technical debt I mean it's really
all unfortunately right so
and you'll deal with this in your career
a ton and a ton and ton is that often
times that debt is never paid and the
reason for it is it's hard to convince
the business when you already have a
working feature why you need to go back
and spend you know 20 hours reworking
something that that you already gave
them they're like no screw that Dylan
just build us this other feature we want
right don't we that thing's already
working don't touch that so B and I get
where the business is coming from so and
most developers do which is why very
rarely do you have tickets created for
technical debt very rarely do these does
this ever have like an official like oh
yeah you know the business wants us to
go back and clean up this feature
efficiency maybe some technical debt
that you actually go back and take care
of right so if something's running a
little slow that could actually be some
of the technical debt you take care of
once it becomes a problem for the
customer right and for the business but
technical debt is a weird beast because
it is something developers care about
more than the business but developers
don't choose your own work most of the
time so when technical debt does get
solved is usually the developer has an
hour or two it's like yo I'm gonna go
clean up this this API I'm gonna go
clean up this project and they finally
get around to doing it but the business
itself it's kind of neutral on it there
if not in the other direction um and
again four requirements reasons for
deadlines reasons you know every
developer in the game has had someone
show up to them and had scope creep
happen and then before you know it your
two-week project is really a four-week
project but you still only have the two
weeks and then you say okay well to do
this you know you talk to your manager
or something it's like to get them what
they want and the time that they need
these are the corners I have to cut I
have to make it static I can't be
dynamic I have to do this this and that
so one says okay we'll come back to it
basically it's the we'll come back to it
and fix it later with
problem is that almost never happens and
it it's a it's a very strange part of
being a developer because as a as a
developer you always want to build the
best you should I should say all good
developers all the battle ones we'll
just going hard code everything and make
it bad for us hard-working developers to
code the best thing possible anyone
could deliver the best product and the
best product oftentimes is a long term
solution but long term solutions that
are dynamic and and work well they often
times are a little bit more complex in
nature because you need to plan for you
know future iterations and and how this
is going to be used by other
applications and you might be doubling
the length of the project when in
reality the immediate project you're
doubling the length of the immediate
project I should say while in reality if
you look at all future projects you're
cutting that time by 2/3 but it's very
hard for for a lot of organizations
before we're thinking like that because
there's so many oh well this is a
one-off we're never gonna build another
app like this we're never gonna deal
with something like that again and
before you know it you're back at square
one six months later rebuilding a very
similar application that that because
you had all this technical debt and you
didn't rework it you know you might be
doing it then if in if ever or you might
just be building something brand new
when you could alter this existing
application or if you built it the right
way well with less time constraints
could happen it's a very interesting
dynamic because it's almost a very
political game when it comes to
technical debt because you have to two
parties really you have a a business
side which says I don't care how you do
it I don't even really care to
understand how it's done all I care
about is that the features that I need
for our customers for our clients are
there that they work and the the you
know you have developers like I want to
give you these features
do don't think I'm hoarding them over
here but I want to make sure that when I
do give you these features are built on
something that can easily add more
features and well and then you have the
business who's like we'd only want more
features gives us features we want oh
yeah I'm like well if we build it this
way we can make it so that we can do
this again really quick and so you have
this very back and forth where the
business gives you a set amount of time
and then the developers have to find a
way to make it work out and a lot of
times that just creates technical debt
I've had it at every workplace I've
worked at where you're like hey we need
something out in in six hours on this
thing that you're working on because
they want to launch it with this other
stuff like six hours like you for real
six hours yeah just hard code anything
that you have to we don't care we'll
come back to it I mean there's
situations where it's not like oh well
you're being lazy or it's just like all
right well this is what things are done
right now so let's do the tactically
it's very surreal in that aspect and
it's a it's something that one of the
reasons I want to talk about these
things like this and I hope it doesn't
come off as a negative thing when I'm
talking about technical day I I'm moreso
referring to just a part of the business
and I think it's I think it's it's
helpful to talk about things that I
didn't know existed or terms that I
didn't know existed before I was a
developer technical debt is one of them
scope creep is another that'll be a
video in a week or so I had to refill in
that video because I I was I filmed it
right after something happened with
scope with a bunch of scope creep I was
kind of salty and I tell you what if if
you guys are ever thinking of creating
like an online personal brand and that's
something and you're still an employee
right you know self-employed one thing
that I can you know we're going off on
tangents but one thing that I can sort
of recommend for you is that when you do
do videos where you're sharing opinions
that you keep the personal out of it out
of the out of your your statements and
don't complain about it right so you
know am I very happy with my
company most of the time yeah are there
times that I'm not like yeah any
employees kind of frustrated with the
workplace of course and when you have
those moments don't put them in a video
and if you do put them in a video don't
work don't release it then rerecord it
after you've calmed down a little bit
right so a little personal branding tip
there it's just come off more
professional as well so I don't consider
myself the most professional guy in the
world but I do think that there is a
level of professionalism that that
should be should should be respected and
that is of course what happens in house
stays in house you know what happens in
Vegas stays in Vegas most of the time I
am so technical that is interesting in
that fact because I had no idea that
this was a term what it represented and
every every job I've ever had has sort
of had this because there's timelines
right and we got to meet those deadlines
uh deadlines I have a I should do a
whole video about why I think deadlines
are funny things but yeah so that's
technical data in a hole it's really
just creating work items that aren't
real work items for the business but are
for developers that come from maybe not
being able to build the product that you
want for the business or having too
short of time to build that product and
then the business is not caring about
fixed and has already works right so
you'll experience technical debt in in
your life and you know what I'm I'm sure
there's a couple developers who are
screaming about just having horse
stories of technical debt in the back of
their head please feel free to share
those in the comments and make everyone
smile and laugh you don't have to say
your company or where it's from but I
think it's I think it's be worth to
share it so please do
as always guys thank you so much for
watching the video don't forget to
comment like subscribe share support me
on patreon all that good stuff I'll see
you next time bye
today we're gonna be talking a little
bit about technical debt what is it why
it exists and sort of the harsh read
what the are you doing over quick
