back in solo learn HTML in the html5
section let's go ahead and dive into it
here so in html5 you want to use the
doctype declaration HTML the meta the
character encoding process a little bit
easier by default is utf-8 a lot of
mumbo-jumbo don't worry about that
so first thing to do is declare that
you're working in HTML like so so it
looks like that there is some API stuff
as well drag-and-drop audio and video
history geolocation web messaging lots
of new features html5 which is cool
image is not new images already been
there so apparently we're only halfway
through with how much stuff's in this
course
this is last section through my metadata
embedded interactive heading phrasing
flow and sectioning 7 new main content
models cool HTML content html5 content
models are designed to make the markup
structure more meaningful for both the
browser and the web designer
how many content models does html5 offer
a blueish 7 right metadata is a content
that sets up presentation or behavior
for SDC's almost gonna be found in the
head of the content alright sorry we
ever script our links or meta our title
base bed even better do video all that
sort of stuff interactive headings age
group I didn't I've never heard of age
group I have to look into that cool so
my data goes in the head content models
flow content contains majority of HTML
elements elevate that would be included
in the normal flow of the document
sectioning content defines the scope of
headings content navigation footers so
now we have article a side nav and
section these are new elements to kind
of keep track of your stuff so let's see
here
heading section in there cool
it was in bed right yeah in bed and
phrasing which content to Kenny's almost
all of the others did maybe I didn't
understand the question
flow there we go flow alright the html5
page structure so you have your header
nav is where you put like your
navigation for the site in the past I've
used like a div and then just call it
menu so now this is how we're gonna do
this you also have the article which is
the web page main content section which
is devided section of the main content
and then the footer cool so these are
all really nice things that contains a
branding like a logo header so this is a
generic one obviously you have to follow
this but this is a good thing to use
moving forward so it starts with the
header and then you have the nav and
then you have the article and you have a
section and they have a footer header
now footer so header so in the past we
would define a header like this exactly
what I was talking about now you don't
need to do that anymore you have your
header the header guideline is supposed
to be used inside the head inside inside
the body
I guess inside the body and the footer
element is usually the very bottom of
the page social media icons privacy
policy contact information sitemap all
that sort of stuff you can now use the
footer element instead all this is
pretty intuitive as long as you know you
use it so the nav would be our menu or
navigation here or such as this we're
used to nap so rearrange section
generate shellfish all right so we have
our head is still where all the
documents go header note the nav and
then we have the footer right let's say
I think the nav normally would
so you have your head header the navs
and footer is that right huh I've
seeking that the navigation will go
above the header but I guess it's all
preference article element
self-contained independent piece of
content that can be used and distributed
separately from the rest of the page or
site forum post magazine or newspaper
blog entry comment widget so the article
element replaces a div element that was
widely used in HTML 4 along with ID or
class when an article element is nested
the inner element represents an article
related to the outer element for example
the blog post comments can be a article
elements nested within the article
representing the blog post all right
so instead of just oh so this is
replacing the div not entirely still
used to do this much as you want so
section is a logical container of the
page or article so basically your
articles have sections within them is
what's going on no you go back it makes
sense to separate Cindy so although that
you don't can only be used inside the
article element it seems like that is
what they are used for so that was where
my my mistake one aside is a secondary
or tangental content which could be
considered separate from but indirectly
related to the main content this type of
content is often representing a sidebar
so a side is kind of like the sidebar i
guess when a site tag is used outside of
an article tag its content should be
related to the surrounding area okay
secondary content
the audio element so in html5 there's no
standard for playing audio files on the
live page the ho5 audio element
specifies a standard for embedding audio
on a web page so you can do audio and
then SRC and then if you have controls
it allow you to play it and then this
content right here it looks like if it
fails will display that the second way
is to use source element inside the
audio element and just to do it like
this so you can do a couple different
ways right so basically you can do
multiple sources except it'll do
whichever one works best so alright we
have our audio tech and we need to say
the source of the audio cool you add
controls to it as well see how we have
controls the text in between audio text
is for supporting multiple audio types
we're not support for it for not
supported browsers excuse me you put
multiple audio types in there when atras
find obvious explanation is ready
without asking for a physics information
so you can auto play music or something
like that you can auto play and loop it
so you really can get annoying flash
back to those old flash sites I repeat
that's actually controls auto play so um
I don't think repeat was there
it's the loop yeah search it doesn't
exist nice the video element who was a
lot going on in here so videos I imagine
will work somewhat similar to audio so
you have your video you're applying
controls you're setting the source
you're also studying another short
source element here and then you have
the text if all these fail
same thing with autoplay and loop
rearrange code so we want everything to
work
we have video with controls and I should
be good I want to play the mp4 mp4 first
so we have that first as well cool
the progress element holy I don't
know about this the progress element
provides the ability to create progress
bars on the web the prior someone has
been use headings paragraphs or anywhere
else in the body specialized how much of
task has been completed max restaurant
how much of the work and task requires
in total see progress status this is
cool I didn't know this so you define
the progress bar and then so I got I
forgot what was x value
okay so you just create the progress
where you sent the min value for it to
start off at and you set the value to
so--but so this looks like it will set
it to 63 at this time web storage API an
html5 web storage web sites and store
data on the user's local computer before
you should fault you had these
JavaScript cookies Vantage of doing this
is it's more secure faster stores a
larger amount of data in store today is
not sent with every server request
stored in cookies and you have sent
session storage and local storage when
talking about web storage local ver
session session storage destroyed once
the user browser closes the web browser
local storage stores data with no
expiration date this is this right here
is important if you're going to try to
use this is you need to be familiar with
basic JavaScript in order to understand
me use this API so you have session
storage and local storage working with
values this is extra web search or both
local session stores are very simpler
and similar local storage you can set
the story to value so you set the item
and then you get the item and then you
remove the item and then you clear the
item removing all values ah
so set so basically you're setting a
variable it's a key value pair right so
you're setting a variable locally the
key one has this value when you want
that value you're gonna go get it and
when you want to remove that value
you're gonna use it as well and then
this will remove all the values Phillip
links so firstly study the value right
well so fill in the blanks to clear all
the values stored in local storage and
store a using key B so local storage dot
so we want to clear first and then we
want to set a so set it be day there we
go
geolocation so you can now use
geolocation in html5 which is nice
something that we've done in free code
camps open weather API so what's your
location if I you can get the user
location navigator dot geo location dot
get current position keep in mind in
chrome since chrome 50 this will be
disabled if a site does not have HTTP
credentials for their site so it was the
mandatory parameter
vacation presenting data so this is an
example of how you might get back the
data you would get the geodetic and
civic geodetic I guess is longitude and
latitude Civic is easier to read for the
average person
drag and drop API the drag-and-drop
feature lets you drag an object and lets
you grab an object and drag it to a
different location to make an element
drag we'll just set Drago attribute to
true that's so cool that this is so easy
I thought this was gonna be much harder
so you see a lot going on here right now
they have some JavaScript well
apparently this is much harder but
because they're jumping into the
JavaScript aspect so this may be
something that's a little a little uh
you may not necessarily be ready to jump
into this if you're just starting with
HTML yeah same thing here cool how many
times case um five elements we fired
multiple I would imagine cool SVG so
scalable vector graphics so basically
this is just an image that can be scaled
to an infinite size without change it
like it doesn't matter it's a type of
file format for images where you can
scale an image to anything that you want
and you won't lose any quality because
of the way that's designed so you have
to basically just use SVG so we have an
image and it's my SVG scalable effect
the vector graphic and to draw shapes
I got see this I don't know if they're
talking about so let's go ahead and run
this so so you can draw you get
straight-up draw a shape with a circle
here using a circle okay that's pretty
cool but you have to define the SVG
container it would seem with a height
and a width that makes sense so CX CY
the radius if you want to fill it and if
you want to add an outline of a circle
cool so we define our circle we have our
CX we have our CI we have our radius and
then we have our was a color no it was
fill and then we want to close our SVG
nice you can do the same thing with a
rectangle it would seem and just call
rect as well as a a line lines to get a
little bit more in detail it seems here
a polyline carry so they've had it a
little bit easier for you to do awesome
things so have our line oops
no so there's no closing tax for these
either so I'm gonna say this is probably
y1 and I want now let's go let's go back
so in the line we have a x1 y1 and then
a hex - no why - okay
gave our lime fx1 why sooner y2x tubes
and ry1 you have multiple you basically
have the corner that you start in and
the corner that you end it so you have
ellipse and polygon so you really create
a whole ton of here that's really
what you need to get I know I'm going
through this pretty fast but uh what you
really need to get from this is just
being aware that these things exist and
then when time comes where you think
that it may be useful obviously you'll
go and look up the documentation a
little bit a little bit more that's Paul
Janos which is really what I like about
solo learning is it it has it has some
great examples and it breaks it down
pretty clearly for you
exposes you to a lot so you can use
animate as well so attribute name from
two to Freedent and and I should
definitely use indefinite so create
animations use animate path element is
used to find a path
let's go ahead and try this and see what
it does I'm not quite sure how this is
different than animate
huh I guess there's actually drawing
things out but you're joining it on your
own tank so this is basically you
drawing something out on your own thing
this or it gets a little complicated I
look at this man what is going on here
uh but you can define basically create
your own path what shape is indicated by
this oh my god that's it let's see
alright let's go back let's see if we
can see this so move to line two
horizontal line
I was a Z Z was close path I think it's
just a line
Oh
sorry trying so move to line 0 then line
109 100 I don't know I I generally have
no idea I don't fully understand this so
we'll just try circle triangle square
there we go as the square I couldn't
tell you why and honestly I don't fully
understand what is going on there it's a
you just got to sit down and study it
for a little bit let's see here
so the HL of canvas is used to draw
graphics that include everything for
simple lines of graphics so so you have
to use JavaScript with this as well
and you can see how a lot of this HTML
stuff is kind of leaning towards using
javascript quite a bit which is cool but
not exactly HTML at some point if you
were kind of making a distinction it's a
two dimensional grid with the exit why
start a lift quirk excuse me so it
starts in the upper left corner drawing
shapes so you can draw a shape as well
and then fill it a lot of stuff going on
here so this goes back here so x y w8
width and height right there all right
so the X and y coordinate followed by
the width and the height so that's 20 -
oh that's with then height whoops SVG
versus canvas so canvas already drawn
out programmatically it's done with
pixels animations aren't built-in SVG's
are part of the pages Dom oh I didn't
know that drawing is done with vectors I
didn't know that cool
what's the cam just kind of nope in
canvas trying to stone with pixels I
believe that's correct
there we go canvas transformations so a
canvas element can be transformed so you
can line it you fill it and put a font
to it you can move it with translate you
need a whole bunch of stuff with this
canvas that's pretty cool rotate is used
to rotate to html5 canvas so you're
drawing on canvas then you can rotate it
like so a lot of these things are very
complex in the now that we're getting
into it a lot animation based right and
that's cool I'm guessing it's in degrees
listed here value must be in radians so
it's in radians all right scale method
scales the current drawing takes two
parameters the number by which the image
should be scaled in the x-direction
y-direction so if you want to scale it
like so you do something weird like this
let's kill html5 forms so a lot more
stuff in forms so Forbes have always
been kind of a pain but you had to do
them and now it looks like they're going
to be a little bit easier in html5 so
you have a form you have a label for the
form and then you have input you can put
ID a name and type is equal to text
let's see so we have our form type
actually the input type then we close
our form you know there's also new
attributes there's something called
placeholder where it will fill it with
sample text until you know somebody gets
there and you can put a label for what
it's for so it's directly linked in this
case label is for the same name here
notice how this is a different than the
Heidi autofocus attribute will let it so
when the page loads automatically this
is auto focused already
let's see your fill the lakes auto focus
on the input so input name and and
create a place to look it's placeholder
and then we will go ahead and put auto
focus as well for its required fields
you can also put required in here so
that it turns a little red so aim mofos
fill this out it doesn't actually
say that that will be in HTML six you
can see color date daytime email month
number range search tell time you're a
week these were new added ones new add
new new input types rather so these will
function a slightly different depending
on what you're putting in you have also
input attributes form action whole mess
of things right regular expressions oh
that's cool you got the pattern in here
so input type text which by the way this
is something I will probably use later
this week but in actual regular
expression to work with this alright at
my workplace I mean to designate the
user name field as required
focus on the username when the face
loads so we want to use her name
so you want to autofocus did not
out-of-focus so designate these are name
field as required look ready backwards
so this one's required and then this one
will let be focus one that loads forms
part to the new search input type can
use we use grey surface so you can use
this to create search box using the type
of foot search so if you wanted to
create a search box you set type we
closed search pretty intuitive and then
a list of predefined data options and a
search field so kind of like a drop-down
but not really right so you're already
assigning the value here a lot of times
you may see like options that you've
already searched for that's probably
being used there and just dynamically
generated so fill in the blanks
associate the input from the data list
so we have input type is text name is
color
what is colors ideas colors let's just
equal to colors got it so you have to
sign the list and the ID is color data
list colors
cool creating more fields some other
input types include email URL and
telephone number so alright cool so it's
a cool thing about this is it recognizes
it and when you in mobile and when you
click on like an email it will pull up
something like Gmail like click on the
phone number pull up like phone number
which is really nice planet I guess and
then six questions for not even a
question for each section which choice
is correct HTML element for playing
videos as video cool the canvas element
in html5 is used to draw graphics which
kitane contains the navigation that
would be nav which tag excuse me such as
storage stores data for the duration how
many sessions I believe it is one so it
closes on the browsers done which shape
results from the following code oh my
god this is a line that goes from X 1 y
0 to X 2 so that goes down so this is
down and it's black and then we have
another one that
starts y1 was just 50 and x2 I think
it's a plus sign wait
alright so we're going down I got that
much we're down and over and then here
50 yeah I think it's plus sign there we
go fill in the blanks to turn off auto
complete requires that the password
field oh I don't remember what this was
but I'm guessing it's autocomplete is
equal to off and then we want our input
type to be password and then we want it
to be required nice so a whole mess of
things that we blaze through there a lot
of the graphic stuff too cuz no time
like no need to spend the time doing
that until you actually are required to
do that what you really need to go and
get away from all these sort of solo
learn courses is what's out there when
the time comes that you're gonna need to
use it you need to have it kind of on
the back burner saying oh I'm ready to
dive into this I remember this one thing
I learned a solar and I can now make it
require field I have these all these
things and then you go look at the
documentation in detail then that's
really what I think you guys should get
from these so learn courses that's what
I get for get from it as well if you
pick up one or two things from here that
later on you use you just continue to
become a better and better web developer
