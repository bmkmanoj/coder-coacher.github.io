talk to you about code CAD amis ready
program where it's for basically there
freelance website development
I'm guessing they might expand this down
the road but it's basically a nine week
online course and I've got a few
questions about it and I thought I'd
share my thoughts real quick cuz I think
there's some there's some benefits to it
and there's some disservice --is the way
that's packaged that I think could
provide provide a little bit of context
for those who may just be looking for
like a quick fix to get their foot in
the door the one thing that I really
don't like about this more than anything
else is how they're marketing it as
freelance web developer site development
to be a developer you really have to
know JavaScript or be familiar with
JavaScript frameworks and they don't
talk about that at all in these nine
weeks they basically cover HTML CSS and
it's a it's a little bit misleading and
you're not really gonna have very much
success being a freelancer knowing just
that and I that's probably my biggest
gripe with it but let's go ahead and go
over it piece by piece and when you talk
about what's in the course and we'll do
it more detailed dive they do have a
syllabus here and I highly suggest you
check it out just so that you can kind
of do a bit a little bit of research on
your own I have reached out to them and
say hey can I take this course for free
and I'll do some videos to evaluate it
they haven't got back to me but I would
love to do that so because right now I
can obviously only give my opinion about
what they have presented but as a you
know a salaried web developer I think I
might have a little bit insight of what
that so what what do you get from this
course at the end of the day you get a
little code CAD me credential kind of
cool right
everyone loves getting those credentials
myself included that you can put on your
resume and you your will be an HTML CSS
command line plus get in design
principles
this command line and get
they probably could have left that out
and put JavaScript in here and it
would've been much better now it shows
here what you'll be doing over these
it's nine weeks right
so HTML which is good CSS is good
command line and get uh-huh
you could have skipped over that not
really gonna be all that helpful layout
is good so there's not a lot of great
layout things which is basically another
way of doing responsive design and kind
of organizing your code using CSS and
flexbox it's just a really good I like
that this is in here
responsive web this is great also you
need to make things responsive for
tablets and phones design principles
also good probably not as appreciated as
it should be more CSS libraries and then
projects now what are you what is was it
cost cost five hundred dollars which is
a lot in my opinion for what you're
getting offers they expect you put in
about ten hours a week that doesn't mean
you're gonna be getting ten hours a week
of help by any means and it's about nine
ten weeks so for five hundred bucks you
are going to be doing basically ten
hours of work a week I personally think
your money would be better spent buying
a ten dollar udemy course for each one
of these and using that to follow their
syllabus so let's talk about their
syllabus - real quick before anything
else so their syllabus they talk about
what you know introduction HTML setting
up your text editor this is something
you know a lot of people use maybe code
PIN when they're getting started
that could have some benefit but what
you're really gonna get at value-wise
out of this is having a working
portfolio and having projects now these
are offline projects they say right here
where is it offline projects what that
means is you're gonna be getting very
little help and you're gonna be doing
this on your own most of the time that
is really what that means and that but
if you can't and the you know follow
along you should be able to do these
projects and so you have one project -
project 3 project 4 project this chrome
dev tools that's cool so you get to see
how to use the developer tools that are
built into Chrome
that's actually really helpful I like
that a lot that more projects
this is all gonna be based on for you
really is how well and how much time you
put into each one of these projects more
projects it's nice you're getting
introduction to get I don't think you
really need the command-line aspect of
it for such a basic course I think it's
kind of just adding something in there
to added in there
they have responsive design flex box
more projects more projects let's see
here
I wish I wish they would get rid of all
these projects that were kind of not all
super relevant like secret agents
applying incorporated like I'd rather
have more realistic projects or some of
these like this one's alright for a new
glasses site okay like that's a good
project with this one they should
probably put things in that are actually
going to be more relatable designed lots
of stuff going on design bootstrap so
you'll be learning about bootstrap I'm
not super stoked that they're gonna have
you jump right into a library when
you're just learning and that's what
this is designed for but a wire framing
is good and cuz I so the what you're
gonna get out of this is really an
introduction but I just want people to
know like you're not gonna be a
freelancer and you're most definitely
not doing web development you're doing
web design at the end of the day and
you're not gonna be a web developer
after these nine weeks and this whole
name of it freelance website development
is really misleading it should it should
be something like front-end web design
or web design this is a whole web design
course this is for web design not web
development and I think people's time
and energies might be better spent
saving their $500 and maybe buying a
following the syllabus for the most part
and taking those projects building them
on your own and actually following
guides on YouTube or udemy and going
from there and if you really want to
spend five hundred dollars hiring a
tutor for like fifty bucks an hour one
hour a week that's really that's really
my advice that's my thoughts on it I
hope they reach back to me and I can
kind of
go through the program on my own and
give you a much more in-depth but for
what they have here it's so misleading
in this this freelance website
development but hey if you if you decide
to try it and you come across this video
and you're you you complete it reach out
to me I'd love to interview you and talk
to you about it so that we can get a
first-hand experience this is their
their new program they're trying to do I
would expect to see much more of these
moving forward but that's my thoughts
about it I hope you guys found it
