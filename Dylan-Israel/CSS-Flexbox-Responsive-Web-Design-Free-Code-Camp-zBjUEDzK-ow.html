section doing CSS flexbox if you're new
to flexbox I've used it a little bit
what it basically is is a different way
for you to organize and make your
website responsive if you're used to
bootstrap and using a column grid system
this kind of a different way of doing
that that's how I would explain it
those are lot a lot more to it let's
just jump in and see what freako games
got in store for us so you'll see right
we start off with these two these two
boxes here we have box 1 and box 2 and
what we want to do is we want to apply
the CSS property flex on it which allows
you to use other flex properties to
build a responsive page all right so
let's see here so we're going to use
flex and excuse me display flex so if
you're not familiar with this don't
don't sweat it we're both going to get
better
I've actually used libraries that have
kind of implemented what it looks like
we're going to implement now angular
material has a great library that does
that
oh I'm sorry whoopsies so we're actually
applying the Flex to add the box
container here that's my fault there I
was wondering why I didn't change but
you'll see now we want it to essentially
fit them both in there we're kind of the
way that we're organizing our code is
that if it can't fit flex it together
right so if we were to change the width
to this to a hundred percent or let's
try 75% and we're to run it you'll see
that it flexes them together l1 takes
over more than the other and the reason
that it doesn't just go is because it's
not it's not like a block element we're
not treating it as a block element but
it's just over overrode that so am let's
go to run this to see what we're working
with we got a lot of things oh here's
our boy Quincy doing a shout out to his
Twitter what we're going to be doing
here is adding flex to all the following
items set up here so we're going to add
flex display flex to all of these
basically which is Center and to save
ourselves some time what's going to
copypasta this
so there's header then we're going to
add it to profile name see profile name
alright
we're then going to add it to the follow
button we are also going to add it to
the h3 h4 footer or ch4 oh it's already
one of the same and stats cool let's run
this one more time and you'll see now
that these are all kind of getting
meshed together right where we're
flexing them all in if it can't fit it
will fit and the only things that's
stopping it are block elements and and
things like that and you know you'll see
how it works
little bit cleaner than alright so other
so with there's flex direction use the
Flex Direction property to make a row so
similar to bootstrap where you have
column and grid you then can create a
where you would have rosin and lexical
McGrew rows and columns you can add a
direction to treat like a role or column
so if you so far we've been flexing as a
row which is why we haven't had to set
the property but let's say we want to
flex things vertically we would do
something different so here we want to
add the Flex - direction and the default
by the way is a rope and and we want to
give it the value of row - reverse all
right so this is row - reverse and let's
see what happens when we run that
actually stick this out real quick
before we do anything else so I want to
see the original and so it looks like
this our box one here is the blue and
the Box U is the rip so with the Flex
Direction it's actually going to slop
the spots which is interesting and kind
of cool
so the header and the footer and the
tweet embed example as we have here have
child items that should be a ranch as
rows using flex direction as the CSS
property flex direction to both the
header and the footer so ever header and
insert the value darrell so it's going
to set flexed direction what we want to
do is basically create rows imagine that
each one it'd be better if we had some
background color this to kind of really
hammer it down but flex direction when
we set that to row and then we're also
going to set flex direction of the
footer to row so this is a row and then
this top part is a row as it already
kind of looks but we're kind of
hammering it hammering it in a little
bit add the Flex test direction grow now
you nothing changed but this is also
going to help it be more in the next
couple sections I'm imagining will help
to show you how it responds differently
based off these flex directions that
were setting so use the flex direction
to make calm so so far we've been
talking about just rows now we want to
talk about columns now add the CSS
property box container and give it a
value of columns so we remember we're
back on our basic example here where
they're just side by side getting kind
of jammed in and what we want to do now
is we want to make it a column so they
stack on each other because remember the
default row but if we want them to stack
like this we can do that also
so we're back to our Twitter example now
where God does you really have 84,000
likes
I bet it's gone up I don't even think
this is an API call I think this is
hard-coded good the tweet the tweet
embed header and footer use the Flex
Direction property earlier with a row
value similarly the items in profile
name should work well call alright so
we're going to add the Flex direction to
the headers profile name class which is
right here and we want to make it a
column now remember right now it was a
row so what happens we make it a column
let's do that one more time so before
I'm going to take it out of here and I'm
going to show you so that I think it's
very crucial to see what's wrapping this
in the profile name section so you'll
see right here we have this where's our
profile name so our div class right here
profile name what's happening is we want
to have this treated as a column because
we want it directly under the name
Quincy Larson so for this section right
here we're going to set the Flex
duration the column so that normally an
h3 and h4 would go left to right because
they'd be different block elements or
however it goes but what we want is for
it to go underneath and so we're going
to set the Flex direction to be a column
that's what's going on here
alright so in this example we now have a
third color so nicely' flex items within
a Flex container do not fill all the
space in the container it's common to
want to tell the CSS how the line is
spaced out the Flex items in a certain
way fortunately we have justify content
property it has several several options
to do this but there's some important
concepts to understand so remember that
the side by side left to right top to
bottom flex eivin's main axis or several
options on how to space flex lines
justify content center flex start flex
end so flex start align two items to the
start of the Flex container which is the
left I guess usually for a column this
pushes items to the top so if it's
column with flex that start is top
starts top to bottom a row is left to
right flex end is the reverse space
between a length item to the center of
the main axis alright space around
similar but the first and last items are
not locked to the edge of the container
alright this is going to be something I
feel like I get the flex and flex start
and the space between space around it's
race between up yeah I feel like to to
fully get these two like this you are
pretty straightforward we're probably
going to have to play around with it a
little bit let's see what's going on
right now so an example help show this
property and actually exactly what I
just said
all right adding CSS property box
container element either the CSS justify
content so we have this just to five
dash content and again notice that we
have this flex property in here as well
the display flex give it a value of
center bonus try to other options for
the justify content property to see
their differences so let's see what
happens alright so again let's go and
look down at what we have here so we
have a background color let's go
on and what we want is to take our two
containers and flex them to the center
that's what we want to do we want to
justify the content so that they're
centered that these block elements are
centered here cool
so latest challenge sowed an example
just by content property and it looks
like we're back on the tweet embed from
sweet this problems going to be applying
to lighten the items to the profile name
element now remember down here we have
the profile name class which is Quincy
Larson with those ELISA add the CSS
property and set the value to any of the
options from the last challenge I
forgetting what it was
flex I actually wanted to be flex the
the left one which was flex start
because this is a a row the flex start
would be to the left so we're going to
go ahead and do justify that's content
let's start right now let's run that in
the sea and I don't think anything's
going to change because it's already
justified to the left but if it was it
and just adjust to see what it looked
like we can do flex was a flex end and
it should go ahead and swap it to the
right what does it look like at this
 oh because uh if this is a this is
a column so if this was a row would have
done that but it's not going to go
anywhere this way so the only one that's
actually going to look like anything
happened is Center which looks it's
going to look bad oh I take it back okay
so I'm understanding this more I'm
thinking that it's adjusting off this
this is actually adjusting based off of
its overall container so you'll see here
is it centered it amongst these amongst
this row here ah I get it now cool I was
thinking I was going to just the
the the container but it was actually
adjusting its parent element an example
I'll show the CS property in action
alright so aligned items is similar so I
give the line items before and I thought
this was kind of similar to justify
content justify content is the Flex
items along the main access for Rosa
main access is a whorls on the line and
then the vertical line for columns
CS offers the align items property
okay so some of these flex values are
also available for a line items flex
start flex and center stretch which
wasn't in the the justify content so
sent succeeding stretch stretches items
to fill the Flex container all right and
then baseline aligns items to their
baselines baseline it's a text concept
think of it as the line of the letters
that sits on I'm not quite sure what
this means but uh hopefully we get to
use it so example it shows this property
in action add the CSS property align
items to the box container alright let's
see what's going on here oh I don't
remember if I ran this yet so let's go
to - all right so we have hello and
goodbye and then we're going to have a
line items and what we want to do is we
want to let's let's actually play around
with this so let's see what baseline
does I think it's important kind of when
you have questions as to what baseline
is supposed to do and of course make
sure you spell things correctly spelling
just like math is hard and you'll see
that these actually align on the same
text level which is cool I like that and
I like okay so it is a guy who I sounds
like we want to put it on the same line
and we'll go ahead and do center and
I'll drop down all the same so it
actually aligned this section to the
center of the page versus the container
so we're going to go on to the more
advanced example now where we're going
to use the display line items property
in the tweet embed so at the CSS
property align items to the headers
follow BTN all right so we're going to
add this class here and we want to set
the value to Center and just for fun
we're going to run it after each time
that adjusted we're going to adjust the
h3 and the h4 so I'm not quite sure why
the background went away
so let's actually look at the CSS we
have this follow BTN I see so in our
header we wanted to flex to the center
which is where that follow button is and
so we close down which is why we lost
that background we lose it but the the
sort of empty space when we have zero
margin and zero padding on it we only
got the five pixels here for the actual
button which is why it doesn't go
straight to it
so if we actually commented this out for
whatever reason you would see that it
lost even more padding let's go to
comment that back in Nice
use the Flex wrap property to wrap a row
or column so flex wrap is cool because
say you know that you want something
when it hits the edge after there's like
three items in your list you want it to
wrap down below and so you can do that
with Flex wrap so no wrap is the default
setting mean it's not going to drop down
below so wrap it means it will wrap left
or right so if it goes up the edge it
will then go down to the left side and
then keep stacking until it hits the end
again then go down again and then wrap
reverses right to left alright so in our
box container again we want to go ahead
and set Flex - wrap - really good to
just wrap now keep in mind that the
width of each one of these boxes is 25%
so what should happen right now is each
one of these boxes to the yellow should
take up this first one in the green and
the black will drop down below right
here and right here so it's going to run
that and you'll see that I wrapped it
down to the bottom and as we were
talking about before if we wanted to
wrap reverse it would it would do that
as well now that that's really helpful
because if you set up like a like a you
could set up a cool like like I've done
it before where I've set up a picture
where it goes four squares across and
then we wanted to kind of wrap down and
always be looking a certain way flex not
wrap is really helpful for that
alright so use the Flex shrink property
to shrink items
oh I haven't used a select shrink before
so so far all the properties apply the
Flex container the pairing of the Flex
items however there are several useful
properties for the Flex item the first
is flexed shrinks like shrink takes
property numbers as values the
higher the number the more it will
shrink compared to the other items for
example if one item has a selection
value of 1 and the other selection value
of 3 the whole with the value will
shrink three times as much ok that's
interesting so say we have more
important we've been dealing with
containers so far
the only thing we've really done is kind
of handle how items within our Flex
container interact and now we're going
to start messing with properties on on
the children or the items that are
nested within our parent element or the
container and by the sounds of its Flex
rink is as the as things get smaller and
smaller we want certain parts of these
to shrink a little bit more than the
others and in here we're going to in box
one assign a flexural property of value
of 2 all right so we're going to have a
in box 2 like a shrink and by default it
looks like the Flex rink property the
reason we don't have one here is by
default it is set to 1 meaning that
there's not going to be any sort of
abnormal changes so when we set that and
we run it you'll see that one takes up
more space together and this is only if
there's not enough space right so in box
1 it has a 100% width and in box 2 it
has much less so that's why that's going
on there ok cool
now who's 50 and 50 it be they take up
the same amount of space and so it looks
like flex grow is the opposite of that
controls the size of the items in the
parent container so by default flex grow
has 1 and then the larger the number the
more it grows
so the box one element should have a
flexural property set to one all right
or actually
it looks like there's not a default
value for this one so we're going to set
flex - grow to 1 and then we're going to
set for box to have the growth of it to
be twice as large
doesn't look like it actually does
anything in this instance maybe it will
in a better example use the Flex basis
property sets the initial size of item
all right
the preview example included Flex basis
help demonstrate how the Plaxico
property where it's the Flex basis
property special initial size the unit's
used by Flex basis property are the same
as the other size properties you can use
pixels and percentages etc the value
Auto size is items based on content set
the initial size to the box settings use
Flex basis so our boxes right now the
reason that even though we have
background colors and Heights is because
they have no width and so we're going to
set the width instead of setting to auto
or something like that what we do is
we're going to set a Flex basis to 10m
let's go ahead and run that real quick
and that's going to set the initial
width of the box and then we're going to
do the same thing of box number two here
except our Flex - basis it's going to
have a 20m here which will take over as
well go
all right now we're on use the Flex
shorthand property another one I'm
unfamiliar with so at the CSS property
flexible talks one inbox - all right
so remember we're going to add we're
going to make me so that they have flex
like default they don't have them right
so oh actually excuse me gift box when
the values suic
ah okay okay okay so remember how you
used to you can set padding to the whole
thing of five and I'll go to every area
or you could do five it goes top right
bottom left or clockwise so five to the
top padding ten to the right padding
five the bottom padding and then ten to
the look less padding all this or so so
you can do something similar in here
instead of having to find a bunch of
placeholders what we can do is we can
set a Flex property in our in our child
and we'll set to it goes what or does it
go give values the Flex crows to so the
first one goes to grow the second one is
shrink and the third one is basis so
we're going to we're going to set box
one to grow by to shrink by two and set
of initial size of 150 pixels now we're
going to box two and we're going to set
the Flex here for all three properties
and in the one we reset it to start out
row by one shrink by one and start by at
150 pixels that's what we're doing right
here nice
so the order property is going to allow
us to state in what order should they
appear in our Flex container so in the
current order if I understand what it's
saying is it's going to actually
reorganize our HTML to a degree so we
have box 1 and we're going to set the
order of that equal to 2 excuse me
and that's going to move the box to the
right and because I'm guessing goes left
to right unless otherwise specified and
order 1 is going to move to left so the
boxes should swap very nice so the final
property is a-line self this property
allows you to adjust each items
alignment individually instead of
setting them all at once all right so
the reason you use the line self is
because float clear and vertical line do
not work on flex items I wish I knew
this I was trying to vertical a line
thing for about an hour the other day
but this is great this is like free coke
I mean chooses some new stuff all the
time
um a lifestyle success the same values
as line items will not override any
value by line items add the CSS property
align self to box one alright so we are
going to say aligned self
and we're going to set that equal to
what do they want Center and then we are
going to set this one to flex session we
run it well it should be centered and
one should be to the end now rule
reflects session down and over and
center and all that who there's a lot of
good stuff Matt um so that was the
section was that the the flexbox section
I can't wait to start using this I what
one thing to note is do not fall into
the habit of just using like bootstrap
or libraries it's something I've done in
the past and I've suffered for it when
you when you know that when you after
taking this make an active effort that
when you're doing these projects here
