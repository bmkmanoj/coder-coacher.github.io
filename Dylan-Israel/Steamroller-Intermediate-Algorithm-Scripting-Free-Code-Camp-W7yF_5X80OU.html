gonna be going over steamroll over a
steamroller on free code camp so I'm
actually gonna do this video a little
different way than before cuz I've
solved this but because of the way that
your code compiles on here it wouldn't
accept my answer so I'm going to show
you the way that I solved it first
before I essentially changed my code
around a bit and solved it a different
way it's essentially the same thing just
in various formats so what we're trying
to do is get rid of everything that is
an array we don't want it to be nested
like this and then we're gonna add it to
our own array so we should just have the
one array with the values in it that's
all we're trying to do so the way that I
did it was like I created a simple for
loop zero is less than our our late all
right plus plus so this is gonna iterate
through the current array
I had an if statement here that it's
gonna say if it is not an array so if
array dot is array so if it is not an
array on the current value here we're
gonna add Susan we're gonna push to an
array so the way I did it was I created
a global variable here and I used
recursion so this should work and I even
tested it on the site python tutor
javascript will run through all the
iterations so you can see it that it
worked there but because of the way this
is written unfortunately the site that
is it doesn't it doesn't give you the
checkmark so that's why we're gonna be
going over this in a different way so
all we do here is we want to go ahead
and push through the array so we're
gonna say one or a dot
are I so you'll see right here cool so
we add it to the array else we want to
use recursion go ahead and steamroll
your a like so and then we want to go
ahead and return the one array now we
run that you'll see that we get our
value one two three four
unfortunately this doesn't work because
it's going to run multiple tests at the
same time and then our array it's going
to get a little crazy so I think if we
run it again oh no that seems to be
working so yeah you see that it's
working it at the very least we should
get this checked off unfortunately that
wasn't what we did so real quick we did
a global variable here we then ran our
array passing a parameter here we
iterated through that and then if it was
not an array we added it to our global
array and if it wasn't array we then
recalled the same function using
recursion and we iterated through that
array until it was done so we're gonna
use recursion when should use it
slightly different because unfortunately
this won't make your code go through but
that's how I originally solved it now
let's go ahead and do this so what I
ended up doing here was essentially
using recursion but unfortunately I like
my solution better I think this gets
unnecessarily complicated but perhaps I
don't understand it fully so why it
doesn't work or why it works now what if
they don't like the answer so yeah we
essentially do the same thing we create
an array we're gonna go ahead and call
it a1 array again so we're gonna create
an array it's not it's not gonna be
outside our original function and then
what we want to do is just call the
function we're about to create on it so
we're gonna create a function called
flatten
we're going to pass in that argument so
let's go ahead and create that function
flag so what does function flatten do so
function flatten is going to take in and
are an array like we did a second ago
we're then gonna iterate through that
array now we can use a 4h on this if
we'd like to switch it up and then we're
gonna run a function on the item that's
in here so we'll go ahead and just call
it r2 and let's go ahead and get our
brackets right and then within here so
this is basically the set up everything
else concept wise is the same so we're
gonna say if if it is not an array is
already our current r2 so basically our
are our brackets I from earlier if it is
not an array we want to go ahead and
push it to our one or a so let me say
one array dot push that value r2 else we
just want to go ahead and flatten again
tell us when our art and the reason that
we do this originally is because right
here is because otherwise our code won't
run so it's good ready max I succeeded
uh this is art - excuse me
and then we can go ahead and return our
R - excuse me r1 array all right so now
when we run this you'll see it very nice
everything works now what would happen
if we commented this out would never
iterate through anything our one array
would stay empty so I hope you found
this helpful again this was a secondary
solution I kind of like it's essentially
if you can kind of understand here and
the fact that you need to reuse
recursion this is the the if-else
statement if it's a if it's not an array
if it is not an array we want to add it
to something to hold that value else you
want to then run our our function here
so I just did it using recursion this is
kind of the same thing except a little
more complicated and I'll let a little
less clean if you're just kind of new to
the game so hope you guys found this
helpful
