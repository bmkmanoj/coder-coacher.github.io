mic is not muted this time let's go
we're we are gonna do a little bit of
styling the bare minimum I'm not the
best at styling I I don't really it's
just not my thing but I'm gonna show you
the few things that I do just to kind of
clean it up so the where I usually start
us start by targeting the body so let's
go ahead and set a background image and
you can set a URL here to where the
image is that now if you're hosting your
own image definitely go ahead and do
that I'm just taking this from a site
called unsplash I'll be making a great
resource site for web developers pretty
soon and this will be one of the things
I highly recommend I'm not sponsored or
anything by them I've just been using
their content for quite some time we're
going to set a font family to lobster so
lobster is not a default font so you'll
notice that it is not working here oh it
is I imported it last attempt here so in
our header we imported the the font
family from Google's API where they
store the fonts fonts like good life
guys so that's why our phone is working
so we got a nice little font going on
here change the color so it's a little
more easy to see we also want the
background - sighs to cover the whole
thing so we don't have to worry about
anything not being in frame and all that
sort of good stuff so that's our body we
basically just are doing a little bit of
the bare minimum again
the next thing that we can do is go
ahead and let's target our header here
again we use a hashtag to target IDs so
lose our header and within here all we
want to do is create a background and
we're gonna use rgba this is gonna allow
us to do the color and if it's
see-through or not so the last one is to
see that we're inside at 0.5 and you'll
see we can kind of see through it quite
a bit we're gonna add a border to this
as well first thing that comes first is
how first thing in border comes is how
how thick do you want the border what
color and what style so we're gonna do
solid and make sure you spell border
right so uh another one is dashed
there's one or two more so I don't fully
remember what they are it's on my head
we're gonna go back to solid that's all
we're gonna do for right here actually
we're gonna curve the corners as well
I love curved corners I don't know if it
looks better I just there's something
about it
that is just so mean I don't know you'll
notice we have these images that are not
looking as sharp as I want them to be
and they're all multiple sizes so we're
just gonna change those to a hundred
pixels you change the width:200px
they're all squares for the most part so
everything's looking much more
reasonable all the other ones that were
a little too big the next thing that I
want to do is make them a circles the
way that you can make anything into a
circle is by setting border radius to
50%
and again make sure you use the are
inboard dirt the second one so there's
our circles that's all we're gonna do
for images now if we had other images
that we were inserting into our HTML
we'd want to create a class and not just
target all images if you remember
correctly we also made it so that
everything in here is using some
bootstrap classes so we're gonna target
those bootstrap classes we're just got a
little bit of padding all these are a
little too close so we're gonna add
padding of about 10 pixels and this is
gonna give a nice little space we can
actually probably even go to maybe 5
pixels so add 5 pixels padding and
remember each one of these is a row so
we want to target the rows and add a
background and some color to them as
well so we use the dot because it's a
class we're gonna set the background
here same way we did before now looking
back because our two classes are near
identical this would have been a good
example of how to use sass so in future
videos I'll try and do that
get everyone kind of caught up with how
sass works so we're gonna set a border
this as well so white and then Saul
now why is in our background setting
here
oh because we didn't come here so
there's our background everything's kind
of touching we don't really like that
but before we change that let's go ahead
and set the border - radius - 25 pixels
because I like those curved corners
there's that and then let's go ahead and
just add a margin - bottom - about 10px
here if anything we can actually go
ahead and just set this whole thing the
margin let's see how that looks
and so that gives us a little space in
here a little space in here and
everything is kind of evenly spaced
let's go ahead and check this out in the
full page view so here is our page not
too shabby we have we've completed all
the user stories and this is really the
bare minimum that you should do when
styling a page but I hope you guys found
this kind of helpful again style it as
you as your preference is but as always
guys thank you to everyone who's
supporting me on patreon thank you for
the likes the subs and the comments and
the share is it all really helps a ton
and I'll see you guys in the next video
which will probably be the tic-tac-toe
game so keep an eye out for that guys
thanks for watching
hey guys thanks for watching the video
my good friend Matt an engineered truth
has a three-part interview with Quincy
Larson the founder of free code camp go
ahead and check that out and still get a
lot of really cool stuff thanks for
watching and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
