free code camp in the intermediate
algorithm scripting bonfire where are
they so what are we trying to do here we
basically have an array with some values
in it and we need to compare this as our
sort as our collection we need to say
hey does any of that match our key here
or our source so that's what we're gonna
do they give us a couple haslam property
and all this other stuff I didn't do it
that way I definitely looked at that
documentation for probably close to two
hours before I figured out that that's
just not the way I'm gonna be able to do
it so let me show you how I did it I use
filter they really seem to like filter
and I think this is like the fourth or
fifth time that I've used it so what did
i do I declared a function within filter
because if you remember filter takes in
functions and then I put my code right
in it so if you if you're not familiar
with filter go ahead and check that out
under I think it's under strings raised
I think it's a race raised so check out
the array documentation so what I did is
I did a for loop in which I took our
source so for I in source on iterating
through our source and then if the
source is equal to the item return true
if it's not returned false it's a simple
and then return the array so what did so
let's do that so we're gonna say for the
variable I and our source so for that
for us or out of our source here what do
we want to do want to put a if statement
we just want to find out if there if
it's contained in there so if if our
source hi is not equal to
the item remember the item right here
the item that we're passing in item I we
want to return false and then here we
can just go ahead and say right spot we
can just say return true and it should
all work so let's go ahead and run that
and it looks like it's working so let's
let's kind of go over in the comments
here what it is that we did and why this
worked so let's put let's even start at
the top for this function where takes
larger input collection and compares it
with the selection needed any source so
we're just kind of saying what are we
doing with collection of source so here
we're gonna use filter and return true
values
and you can see right here that it did
work if you're dying right here so we
compared which one has for last name
Capulet oh this one does and then you
return just this part of it
so here check values and source compare
with item return false return true we
can take this out so I hope that helps
kind of explain what's going on and
where art thou so we take we're taking
in a larger collection
we're searching through our source data
Capulet and last for the last name
Capulet and we're saying look list for
any time that for any time that this is
true that Capulet is equal to our source
or our item returned return true if it's
not returned false so as always comments
questions constructive criticism of
anything like that is appreciated hope
this video helped and I know they're
getting a little bit harder so
explaining sixteen lines of code that
took you hour and a half in about five
minutes may not be the best but I hope I
hope it helped all the same and I'll see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
