follow bit closer gentlemen welcome to
our weekend livestream normally do these
on Saturdays hence the name Saturday
weekly but uh I'm not quite ready for
bed and I kind of want to do a lot of
studying tomorrow so I uh I'm uh gonna
do it tonight I got the energy I got the
time congratulations David on your
interview going well I wish you the best
of luck in your endeavors hopefully it
all works out for you uh Ricky the homie
how is everything going with you Ricky I
know we haven't talked a little bit we
got the the og the original gringo as I
like to call him Jordan is here welcome
for a friend and then we have foster ID
I am well how are you sir so just got
back a little while ago from from we
thought just got back from the movies
and you ain't big at all what does that
mean like I haven't been lifted oh I
haven't been lifting that's the truth
we're doing it live it's
to switch it up the on occasion and and
I'm wrapping up my first course it's
been fun it's a tiny little course but
it's part one of about probably a 10
part course but I'm releasing them for
about five dollars peace over time and
it's been it's been fun making it I'm
gonna continue and learn as I get better
I have a cool project that I'm gonna set
up in project 2 it's a lot more
complicated than project 1 but that was
kind of the idea so uh Earl Dixon says
I'm looking into I'm looking into
getting into code I've started watching
your videos too enjoyed free code okay
I've got a pony's code every day and
start building projects as soon as you
feel comfortable actually probably
before before you feel comfortable it's
probably the the real answer cuz a lot
of times you'll never feel comfortable
if you wait if you wait you'll always be
waiting
but maybe dive into a little bit a
little bit sooner than maybe you are
ready this is a a webcam that I'm using
for streaming I use the same camera for
everything for the webcam the videos oh
I inspired you to the tactical
JavaScript oh thank you sir and best of
luck it's it's a it's gonna be a journey
as you continue to tackle 8k see what's
going on man another og am I thinking
making her what Hey
so a lot of you guys may not know I
Drive a three cylinder car it's a beast
of a car I got the glasses I got the I
got the braces but as if I wasn't a
Ladykiller enough I now have the rubber
band actually not bands rubber band but
yeah so Killman killing it
so it has a little bit about what I've
been up to I've been kind of out of it
for about two three weeks a little bit
of a sit with sickness but I'm feeling
better I'm remote evaded I'm working on
stuff I'm wrapping up this first course
and I've been loving my job I've been
learning so much about angular and
that's gonna be my focus moving forward
I'm working through 26 our angular
course and I've had a little bit of
craters block I don't know what it is
but I've had trouble coming up with
video ideas but yeah so I've been
putting out videos but this next week
might be the first week without three
videos of the following week that I put
out so uh we'll see what happens I'm
sure something will come up now as the
week ends here I have plenty of time to
think
let's hear learning Ruby on Rails
enjoying model-view-controller with
JavaScript like mean and Merton seem
daunting to configure any tips on where
to learn there's a lot of great one-hour
tutorials on node and Express that's
really that and and MongoDB I have some
basic tutorials building projects in
about 5 5 projects building like URL
shorteners and and uh God how it file
uploaders and things like that and that
uses MongoDB a users know to uses
Express and uses angular J s and it's a
pretty basic project and in an hour we
touch on a lot of things like routing
and and setting up your your Express
package or Express application and so
you that might be something to look at
but I would really just watch one our
tutorials on YouTube on each one of
those letters and go from there what
does the rubberband do essentially what
happens here is my teeth because of the
braces have shifted my jaw so the
rubberband basically pulls my jaw back
into place a little bit more
oh yeah joining
so I finally did that wireframe video
for you if you like the wireframes
they're part of all my courses I'll be
working on did you start any of the
exercises yet what exercises are you
talking about actually exercising I did
workout once one and a half times last
week
but yeah sat on the weekends we go to
the gym now I've started learning since
June I feel like I'm not getting a more
probably impostor syndrome before I have
a job you definitely have an imposter
syndrome before you have a job I barely
started back in do you have any advice
just code everyday build projects do all
the basic aspects of trying to get a job
good LinkedIn good github portfolio page
good resume prepare all that sort of
stuff so it's definitely something to
think about and handle all that do I
believe Linux is the future no but I
mean I think there's a place for Linux a
video on if your start web dev in 2018
with language framework so what path
will take that's not a bad idea I feel
like that videos been done but I can
always add my two cents to it it's not a
bad video to make
so one thing I spend a lot of time
thinking about is my future and how I
want to progress in my career and I
think I might go get a degree in
management to move into upper management
as a developer later on in life this is
something I've been thinking about cuz
that I don't know that I would want to
go back for a CS degree but I would go
back to school for if I could get into
an upper management role down the road
and so I've been thinking about that
which is interesting because this first
time I've ever really thought about I
mean I think about going back to school
all the time because first time I've
ever thought about going back not to
finish a CS degree but to get a
different degree so I've learned the
basics HTML CSS JavaScript and basic of
bootstrap what should I have learned
next please give me a path you should
probably pick up a front-end framework
either react or angular and you should
definitely build some projects in what
you've worked with so far if you if you
haven't you thought of making a udemy
course yeah I actually am wrapping up my
first one right now and and go from
there so senior dev lead dev architect
dev is the goal yeah so I'm talking
about stuff like management information
systems so roles that are going to be a
little bit more debt dev heavy but also
to be a tech lead to I mean I'll be a
senior death in a year or two so I'll be
a senior dev in a year or two but I'm
talking about going past that you know
tech lead lead dev architect that's
still most of the time you're having
you're in a management position for that
stuff and and you can you can kind of go
from there so I mean that's kind of what
I'm thinking in the thought process but
yeah so the udemy course that I've been
working on is it's about five hours of
content so I'm super big but it's only
five or seven dollars and
I haven't released it yet I have a
couple more things that I want to add to
it
but by the end of this weekend I'll
definitely be done on one of my videos
for next week will be announcement video
talking about it how I structure my
courses and what I'm gonna be doing
within and moving forward
so definitive guide to CSS edition four
do you recommend I haven't I haven't
reviewed CSS for or any or the
definitive guide but I do recommend
always educating yourself so is it
normal if I never get a call back from
jaws I apply to yeah you have to apply
to a lot of jobs to get that first one
reactor angular now that angular
released a new version angular fine
that's what I work with and the new
version wasn't any groundbreaking
changes it was basically making the
angular CLI which basically was a quick
build and some chill system tools faster
and it was also some minor updates to
their HDTV package um let's see here
say hi Tito I am
you want to learn programming where can
I start if you're interested in web
development free code camp or who's
probably a great place to start
what are you thoughts on functional
programming I think it's interesting I
think that we've kind of been doing
functional programming for a while in
react and now you have other languages
like Scala and trying to define clear
principles for functional programming
obviously when you're dealing with like
typescript and classes and
object-oriented programming it's one of
those things where where it's less
functional but it's more about what this
is I mean it's object-oriented at the
end of the day it just feels a lot
better than object-oriented Java so I
don't necessarily like I did
object-oriented John you know to us man
I understand programming much better and
it's not that it's that hard
understanding object-oriented
programming it was just that my teachers
were so bad like and never I really I
remember to this day people asking
questions and them not giving answers
and saying don't worry you'll learn
about that later and never learning
about it never because they didn't want
to answer it cuz the concepts that you
are today actually but they were so bad
oh man there's one or two that I liked
but I like them as individuals but as
teachers they were bad teachers that
doesn't mean they were bad developers
but they were bad teachers it seems that
business analysts and project managers
are expected to learn programming now do
you think the reverse is true with
hardcore coders so I would actually
disagree with you at least the H that
it's expected of bas and PMS to learn
programming does it help will it'll help
you land a role absolutely is there
gonna make you better in your job
absolutely do a lot of project managers
and business analysts rx coders
sometimes yes because they either
development was it for them or they
burnt out
it happens but I want to say that the
industry standard is I just say you have
a much stronger job path if you do I
know front-end development basics where
to start learning back and start
building back in for your front-end
projects so if teachers are good they
want to have been teachers that's funny
you say that there are some good
teachers but I would say that I would
say that as somebody who wants to be a
teacher eventually I don't it's hard to
say it is true like I I said in my
interview for my current job that I
believe that 9 out of 10 teachers should
be fired and the people I were
interviewed were kind of shocked that I
believed that and we kind of talked
about for that for five minutes but I
surely do believe that if your boy was
like Prince not principal but the Dean
if your boy was Dean of the computer
science college division he'd be
cleaning mother house maybe 9
out of 10 people would be gone I don't
care I'm gonna I'm gonna ask him to
explain to me a for-loop an if statement
and if they don't do what I consider
adequate job on an if statement and a
for-loop gone baby if you can't explain
the basics you're gone I don't want the
technical base I don't want the
technicalities I want you to explain to
somebody who's never coded before how to
get started yeah yeah you get these
technologies check questions a lot you
create a social media fly first finding
our ideas or means today Cyrus where
other people can shine me on what's
working for that I mean I have the
Facebook group that's why the codec and
caffeine is for you know we have 4200 or
43
members over there people commenting and
sharing their experiences and stuff so I
mean there is that I'm 28 years old I
really want to want to start and make a
career switch do you think it's possible
and job for me at some point I have no
prior coding experience should I go to a
tree with tree house or freako camp
they're not really equivalent stuff and
you should probably do both do your own
Duke do blog posts do courses on udemy
do everything in between but you should
definitely just be coding daily so how
do I get started with crypto currencies
you can buy on exchanges like g dax or
or uh coinbase speaking of which what's
the coin base doing right now there's
curious what bitcoins at bitcoins man
Bitcoin dropped a little bit and that's
skyrocketed again depending on cult
Steel's bootcamp at advanced bootcamp
courses I think they're probably very
very very good I haven't really taken
them or if you viewed them by I know a
lot of people are love them quite a bit
how do you stay focused
I just set priorities of what I want out
of life I've not done that and I've been
very unhappy so I don't know mani it so
the answer is seriously is I got rid of
all the distractions I could I got rid
of all my gaming systems I uninstalled
all the games on my PC and I kind of put
myself into a situation where was sink
or swim it and I understood that I
created a one year game plan to drop out
of college and when I did there's no
turning back when I pulled the trigger
on that and
here we are
when you say kodály what do you mean by
that I I'm a beginner so what do i code
I always try to follow some tutorials on
YouTube and code while watch the video
yeah I mean that's one way of doing it
you could also be doing interactive
tutorials but when I say code daily I
truly do mean write code every single
day until you have a job and not like Oh
code eight hours one day and then
nothing it's better for you to code two
hours every single day than eight hours
in a single day or ten hours in a single
day 14 hours to single day you I'm
saying to 5 2 3 5 I agree code 2 to 3
hours a day every single day build
projects do you Demi course to do
YouTube Shore else do free code camp
whatever you want to do but make sure
you're always having fun you know you're
gonna get frustrated but when you get
stuck it's okay to ask for help but also
make sure you always have any fun so you
can jump between different stuff maybe
you're solving algorithm fly code
fighting get stucked all in here like I
can't do this anymore so you go and
build a project for free code camp or
you get you sit you you can't really
fathom how to finish this project so you
go and you continue udemy course always
have something to work on code every
single day have you looked at the
western governed University that's why
I'm thinking about the software they
have an information technology business
agreement master's degree all the
schools I look at are cheap as I
don't really care where I get my degree
from it's all about just getting that
piece of paper so I can go and get a
masters so that I can get some architect
rolled down the road you took a break
for free code game got your first
freelance job nice man did I learn art
architecture along with coding you pick
up architecture as you code it's a very
interesting process because you find
yourself architect in your own projects
and slowly you're architecting larger
projects you're helping you're working
on other things so
it's one of those things for you you do
pick it up over time and you get better
and better the more you code
I don't have any interest in mod menus
my next big interest after I sort of
dive deeper into JavaScript and into
angular is blockchain blockchain is what
I want to learn next April any luck
finding a job yet no she does start
school on Monday
she has a couple certificate programs
that she's working on for project
management so uh any advice for getting
your first gig on up work or other
freelance site you better charge
damn near nothing and you better have
portfolio work and work experiences back
it up if you don't have any work
experience just have the best portfolio
you can and a portfolio site so be it
will so Betsy so the biggest problem for
me when I watch YouTube I think yeah
okay I understand but I have to apply
those things on my own I have salutely
have no clue how to this is a common
problem this is actually how one of the
one of the things I'm trying to
integrate into my courses so the my
course that I'm building at the end of
the course I then give you features with
wireframes that you can add on to this
project that we just built because so
many people get so caught up on how like
they watch the tutorial and they're
building it it makes sense right I'm
typing the code I'm explaining it you're
going along it makes sense you're like
in that moment you completely understand
because someone just walked you through
it now I'm giving you another feature
with this code base you already have now
augment it now add additional features
and part of that is trying to help you
overcome that I guess without having to
have you start a new brand new project
which which can be a little bit
overwhelming can you explain the basic
point of a getter and setter yeah so a
getter and a setter really refers to
object oriented programming and and so
object oriented programming let's just
say give typescript and angular for
example because that's that's what is
going to be the most relevant right so
let me actually pop this out so you have
these uh think of a variable right and
say you want to get
the variable that would be your getter
and so a getters point is I want to get
this property if I have a variable
called popsicle stick and it has earth
puffs that's a bad example I have a
variable called X and X stores a number
of five if I want to get five I call the
variable I go and get that value now if
I want to then change the five I want I
want to set the value of x - 6
that's your setter so get you're getting
the value set you're setting the value
and that really the only real difference
to that is you just think of the
properties as variables you're just
resetting the value and you're getting
the value as you would with the variable
except in this instance you're dealing
with object-oriented programming now
that's that's getters and setters at the
end of the day so so one other thing
that us was a constructor what's a
constructor a constructor an
object-oriented program and you're
basically recreating things you're
recreating objects to have certain
properties that have certain variables
if you won't think of that way and the
Constructors main job is to say hey when
I create this new object this is what I
need to construct it's going to be
listen we'll give a very basic example I
have an object of dog if I was to create
a new dog would be some of the
properties it would have it would have
probably four legs we're gonna assume
that note no legs were missing on this
dog
it probably had a tail it probably had a
nose and maybe a name and when we
construct that we it would have a legs
property and it would store how many
legs it had four and they would have a
tail property and it would store how
long it is or one and so a constructor
basically will just construct a basic
you're constructing that object and
properties it's supposed to have on on
initialization right
what do you mean deeper in JavaScript
oh I just mean to have a better
understanding of JavaScript and become a
better JavaScript developer I've said
this a couple times but I believe that
10% 90% of the time you use 10% of the
language and I just want to get a better
understanding of JavaScript what was the
bug in your angular four printer brought
back project I mish I broke some
database settings in the firebase that
was my bug house the youtubers
subscriber alert light bulb knowing I
haven't had a chance to start it on in
I've been I've been working on my course
I want to though I really do I think
it'd be fun
with vanilla Jas before moving on to
react node or something with vanilla J's
I mean really you just have two vanilla
J's really refers to Dom manipulation on
top of knowing JavaScript right that's
usually what that vanilla part is and
honestly you don't need to know very
much because react may be a little bit
more in react but if you're talking
about angular all the Dom stuff is
handled in angular so I think I think
you probably as long as you understand
the core base of JavaScript it's okay to
move on to other frameworks what do you
think about platforms like office 365
SharePoint site core should I forget
about the flat flier and learn how to
code first what do you mean forget like
you want to build things for office 365
I don't think I fully understand what
you're asking can you think of any
social places find meetups other than
Facebook meetups calm that's why I would
get a lot of my stuff
I'm new singing can you please explain
what a portfolio site is so portfolio
site is kind of like your online resume
for a no that's better bad way it's it's
a way of showing what you've built it's
a way of showing websites that you've
built it's a way of showing projects
that you've built to people who are
interested in hiring you
it's your portfolio right it's a website
that you build Dylan see Israel calm
right and that's not a real website by
the way but you basically have links to
your projects images showcasing your
best work
you enjoy the comical outtakes thank you
man I'm trying I'm trying to keep it
keep it fresh keep it fun
don't configuration can't get past it to
programming hey well maybe DevOps is for
you down the road
happy Friday to everybody by the way can
I sing you happy birthday no have I ever
placed rock Raffi I meant do you think
I'm just a poser
try to act cool can you donate me $100
above that I'll sing you happy birthday
um not that it's worth $100
how long does someone need to with no
coding experience to land a job as a web
web developer one two three years
it honestly varies by how quick you pick
it up how confident you are how how much
you studied in that time the amount of
time I study in one year is probably
triple what the average person studies
in one year I would say you know when I
was trying to be a developer I was
probably putting I was working a 40-hour
job and I was probably putting in 40
hours of studying a week and maybe a
little bit more it just really depends
if you want one answer a year maybe yeah
yeah if
if Jesus was a coder what language would
you use je s Jesus script so uh should I
go ahead and complete the form of the
website that you mentioned a while back
where you take some quiz and I find a
job find a job finding your little why
not I think you're talking about triple
bite they're still harm - it's
completely free I can tell you right now
they didn't I wasn't good enough for
their standards so it's gonna be hard
but it's not impossible what do you
think of the transition from angularjs
to angular 5 happy Friday easier bday if
someone's birthday someone's chaste
birthday it's not my bday my bday was
two weeks ago so uh angular just saying
angular 5 it's it's a complete rework
there are basic things I carry over
knowing angularjs will help you with
angular 5 but it's definitely not
required but it's it's a rough
transition but if you if you build
couple projects and courses and and now
there's so many more materials out for
angular I think I think you'll be
alright yeah I mean I used to play
Starcraft all the time should we limit
how often we use bootstrap in our
projects this is something I've
struggled with and the answer is I don't
really know I use bootstrap almost every
day at my work
I'm in my in my current course that I
build I use a little bit of bootstrap
but in future courses I'm gonna move on
to angular material I'm gonna move on to
someone told me UI kit so on and so
forth so I the answer is I really don't
know if I could be any world of warcraft
class what would you be hmm probably the
warlock warlock was always pretty dope
you could still have minions so then you
could teleport around and warlock or
mage one of the other just the magic
classes I kind of want to play wow again
man it I just I'm afraid I'm afraid of
what it would turn into God it would be
you guys want to see any more coding
videos probably see that much just
degenerate dealing playing World of
Warcraft how often do I talk with Madoff
engineer truth I haven't talked with him
too much in the last week or two but
usually we talk you know three four or
five times a week but this week's a
little bit different
we've just been kind of doing our own
thing lately how vitals Jake wearing
your projects I haven't touched jQuery
in pretty much a year jQuery I only
really use when I studying development
I've never really used it in a software
environment - maybe two or three lines
of code here there what's your absolute
favorite thing about coding i like that
every day I'm doing something different
I like that I enjoy it's a job that I
enjoy for so very practical reason I
like that
coding has given me a lot of opportunity
I also but the main thing in the working
world I just enjoy it because I can kind
of play around with it and it and mm-hmm
I play around with it and continue to to
build stuff on my own that's really it
at the end of days I like to build stuff
and that requires you to think
differently every day and that's the fun
part in my house my friends are trying
to pull me back into or where the work I
was like nah dog I'm clean what's the
biggest challenge you have faced in
coding recently or all time
I don't know forcing myself to work in
PHP maybe favorite childhood memory damn
we're getting deep um
so every Christmas I every Christmas I
watch home alone too and it's something
I started in my childhood and it's
something I do to this day sometimes I
watch home alone one also but I would
say that's probably one of my more
favorite memories is jQuery really dead
or dying it has been in the roles that
I've been interviewed for or applied to
so I would say in a web web design
there's probably more jQuery than
anything else and web development is
definitely a stream laughs sweet that's
our Gemini going through the things here
but I'll check right now
you
do you think Java will be replaced by
Kotlin I honestly don't know I follow so
little of Java I I want nothing to do
with that that language that was one of
my coursework was in and it's probably
not that bad it was just a bad point in
my life
No
you
hey James I'm sorry man it says here
that you donated $4 thank you so much
but I can't seem to see the question if
you wouldn't mind saying in chat I'd be
happy to to answer it to the best of my
ability um jQuery is not dead but many
people are barriers to say they're using
it because of bullying uh I mean I'm
gonna try to bully anybody I just can
tell you my personal experience I've not
interviewed for roles that use jQuery
good I do also use jQuery yeah of course
I could but I would say that it probably
leans more towards web design jobs than
web development jobs any plans on making
a video about how you go back and learn
programming knowing what you know now
what's important it was off me
irrelevant that is an excellent video
let me go ahead and copy this and I'll
yes I will make that it is now a plan I
appreciate the ideas because I've been
running out so thank you have I looked
in the cold steel's courses on udemy I
haven't detailed looked into I believe
program with Eric has guides on both of
them reviewing it angel
tough to follow so it's just want to say
I enjoy your channel a lot very informed
in much less thank you instead of drunk
developer that I never saw anything of I
never did a drunk developer series would
you unless you're talking about
something else what do you think of
small group tour three on google stream
or whatever you call it it could be like
devonee's yeah I mean I have no problem
doing that it's just my main thing is I
have it's gonna be hard I don't like so
what part of why I like YouTube is I
it's my own thing I'd have to pull
myself
accountable to anybody else's schedule
and it keeps it fun it keeps it fresh so
that's why I'm kind of hesitant to do
partnerships on stuff like that should I
get an internship after I graduated with
the CS degree I would say you should get
an internship before you graduate with
the CS degree and get a job when you
graduate with CS degree well flash ever
make a comeback know Google has disabled
it in its browsers by default and it's
done baby and good good riddance what
are your thoughts on learning technology
software for Internet of Things this
hardware I'm working with honestly I
think is any direction you go in James
as long as you work hard and you
understand the field then you stay
up-to-date on the field in technology or
software you'll do just fine what do you
think of Linux oh I think it's a great
thing to have on your resume I don't
think it's the end-all be-all
but it is a it is a skill to be familiar
with Linux especially if you're going to
hardware and want together Dhananjay
suit how you going how you doing man
thank you for your lessons how do I
become excellent at coding code every
day and do video courses and don't waste
your time on books a lot of my
motivation to learn web to them and came
from watching other youtubers stuff
coding jobs I'm thinking that there they
are very dumb if they can get this job I
sure as into I hope that I
motivated you in a different way I don't
want I don't want you to be like look
man this idiot Dylan can do it I for
sure can do it I'm trying to motivate me
miss slightly differently worst
childhood memory I got stung in the
balls by a wasp as a child on Christmas
is that a Christmas or Thanksgiving and
it was that the family members you know
50 are there and I was at my aunt's
house and I had to have my my legs up on
like a pillow on the bed with a ball
with a bag of ice
on the balls why everyone with downstair
was laughing if I make a portfolio I
wish to the main things be projects
experience things that stand out is Los
Angeles a hellhole
it is for me high rent high taxation
crackheads on every street and traffic
like you wouldn't believe
uh why is the loss why was the last
minute near your your testicles a window
was open and I was standing up and
peeing as we all do as as men right and
a wasp flew in and I saw it and they
just landed and then BOOM um yeah that's
what happened and then I I think I got
it must have been like eight or nine and
I remember my they just blowing up and I
had my mom's a nurse so she's like
alright let me see it and it was the
most uncomfortable thing ever
and she was laughing the whole time
she's I'm in pain and they're like
triple the size that they normally are
tomato red tomato red and she's laughing
her ass off he's like slow motion but
yeah so that happened and do you
stackoverflow you way past that I mean
um I mean I don't post on Stack Overflow
by hey I definitely read about it did I
tell Matt this yeah Matt knows about
I've known Matt for 20 years it's for
sure come up in conversation that's not
an exaggeration literally 20 years
I'm 30 and I've known Matt since I was
ten maybe nine can I still have kids I
hope not
so far I'm bad in a hundred -
twenty-four it's the braces
at poorest was thirsty
and when it should I stopped playing too
many video games probably uh 26 maybe 27
26 maybe three to four years ago
I never played 10-6 or tribes
what does age have to do with marriage
do you wanna console yeah I have a
PlayStation 4 Pro I've nest an S classic
and Super Nintendo classic I don't
really play it too much I think just buy
a new game I've only put about an hour
into it it was near automata
my seat will get corrupted there's no
scar I know I've told you guys that man
um
what group two coins am i into just a
theory my coin in big claims a pristine
good shoe that studies just fell out job
she has the chest the project manager
searches take starting on Monday as a
software channel this might be the only
video that should actually get D
monetized right a jam Pires was legit
man I think I said did I see something
that they're bringing Age of Empires
back I think I saw I beg Li remember
seen a trailer that they're making Age
of Empires for I'm worth a few Miller I
did I absolutely wish any comment on
Ruby on Rails in 2017 I think you should
probably learn JavaScript instead
there's more jobs
I know that their family new superhero
origin story about lost boy and it's
gonna be like his father as a child on
Thanksgiving that's stunning the balls
by loss if forever altered his firm and
now his children all can fly um I'm not
any good at Starcraft now uh
I pretty much played Protoss because
they're the easiest in my eyes anyhow
there's no js' bone no Ruby yeah I would
say so
how will VR development up going is
going to affect web developer you
overlap besides videos and games that's
interesting thing I don't think it's
going to affect it too much but it could
be somewhere where we replace monitors
with headsets but I think we're so far
off from that it sucks so much where
those headsets for more than 30 minutes
at time
what do you think about Russ I actually
coded some programming or some
algorithms and rusts way back in the day
for a job and it was interesting I don't
think there's too many jobs in it so I
wouldn't necessarily learn it for that
um would you say you're sinking into
your groove at work are you feeling
comfortable I most definitely am feeling
comfortable I love the people I work
with and the environment and any things
have transpired from the date of hire um
surprisingly transpired I feel like I
have to go and be more assertive I would
say with certain team members of mine
instead of just sorting playing back
that was surprising I don't want to have
too much into because it may come off
negative I don't I don't want that but
uh on a yeah I'll just say that Ellie
about that would you become a Navy SEAL
I've always want to join the army
there's something that I wish I did when
I was 18 and did waste all my time in
college so
it's coding so important to our economy
that most jobs will survive an economic
collapse
it's a coding specifically important I
think coding is one of the best skills
you can have for the job market I want
to survive in economic collapse probably
because those jobs are still gonna be in
high demand I have which point can
convince myself I'm ready to apply for
junior developer jobs well I would say
probably around the time you can build
your own projects I think we can all
agree that the best language is
JavaScript which I think it's a
universal agreement we don't need to
actually discuss it we all know is sick
truth and every other language great in
its own way but not as great as
JavaScript it won't just we'll leave it
at that
right
weakly it's freelancing hard to do yeah
it's extremely hard to do all right guys
it has been a pleasure I'm getting a
little tired now this has been Saturday
weekly on Friday I usually like to to
end my live streams with something
positive maybe a little bit of knowledge
leave it with some final thoughts and
earlier somebody asked me somebody asked
me what was my favorite childhood moment
and what was my favorite our worst
childhood moment and I told you about
the Christmas video and I told you about
the untracked the tragic wasp event so
let's go ahead and take that question
and we'll apply to what was the the
worst moment of me learning development
and what was the best moment and we'll
start with the worst first so the worst
moment really was in a moment where
anyone did anything for me
to me or at me oftentimes see the worst
moments and our lives are those that we
we create ourselves where we are the
ones kicking ourselves why we're down
where we are the ones who are
questioning the decisions that we've
made and and there is a moan in my life
where you know I dropped out of school
and I was I was working towards being a
developer and continuing on and studying
and
feeling like a loser is the only way I
could I put it I just you know just
absolutely crushed on the inside and
trying to hold it together and apron I
had been going through a breakup at that
time but I was really just feeling like
a loser
and questioning myself and just really
feeling sorry for myself and and being
very unhappy about where my life was and
the decisions that I made and and how
things have turned out and I this moment
was one of the worst moments of my life
and nothing happened it was just another
day where I just wasn't happy and it
wasn't like there was some triggered
event but it was just I remember the I
remember being in the I remember being
in the my little I've called an
apartment but it's not this little
bootleg crack house that I was renting
and just everyday for like this one
particular week going home and just
crying and being devastated and just
feeling awful and being upset with
myself so that was probably the worst
moment when I was learning development
just because I felt like such the
best moment was probably when I got my
first developer job that was the best
moment there's been a lot of good
moments but I think that for me was the
best one which was about three four
months after after the the bad moments
and I kept with it right so like I you
know I had that rough week I still
studied every day maybe not as much and
not as good but I definitely did and
then I just remember getting that first
contract
I didn't counter I didn't want to
counter I just wanted that developer job
I've been working so hard for so long if
that developer job and I got it and you
know I had to give my two weeks and that
sucked cuz I like the people that I
worked with and is it's always
uncomfortable but I got my developer
role and I was so happy oh my god I was
so happy it was like I had made it I oh
my god I grinded I grinded I grinded I
grinded I grinded I had my doubts I
fought through my doubts I grinded I
grinded I grinded and I got the job I
got my foot in the door and I was
killing myself to get there and I was so
happy so happy still very happy but that
was probably the best moments for me of
my Dilla
developer career partially because it
was my first job but partially because
you know I saw a game plan I gave myself
a year to get a developer job I got in
nine months around six months I started
doubting myself and feeling like a loser
and you know you know April kind of put
me back together a little bit and kept
on kept on truckin and and you know it
paid off just sticking with it and
grinding it down and you know there are
ups and downs in life and everything
even something as simple as coding but
so I guess I guess the reason I answer I
talked about this it's just because I
what you guys ever to think that it's
just you having hard times when you're
learning development and you're changing
your career and you're making me because
these are big choices right these are
stressful choices where you're leaving
careers you're starting stuff and you
know it's it's hard right I I dropped
out of school I took a technology
trainer role so and it wasn't a lot was
on my plate
nobody nobody nobody believed in me
other than April and nobody thought it
was a good idea besides me you know is a
little bit of indication so I'm just
sharing that because I just want you two
guys to know that you are going to have
rough patches it's just be prepared and
grind through it and all that sir so
that's best and worse allow for so with
that being said I hope that if you're
trying to learn to code you stick with
it you study every day you I got 700
videos on channel help you out I
appreciate you all thank you so much for
watching look forward to our live
streams every Saturday sometimes Friday
night if I'm busy on Saturdays and we'll
have another one next week I think we're
about halfway halfway to 30,000 so we're
at like 29 five we do an extra live
stream every 1000 subscribers thank you
so much see you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
