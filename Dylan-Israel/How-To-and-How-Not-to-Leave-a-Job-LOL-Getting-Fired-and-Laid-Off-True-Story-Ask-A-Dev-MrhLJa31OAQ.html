about three different things actually
one how not to act when you get laid off
or fired this is it's equally as
important my voice squeaks I think it
equally is important to leave a job with
class as it is to be fired with class
right to be laid off and there could be
a lot of reasons and in all reality if
you're good employee in today's tech and
software world you really have zero
chance of getting laid off because they
need everybody they can now if you're a
bad employee this is for you
but if you're getting laid off anyhow
because the project got completed the
the they decide not to hire you at the
end of your contract whatever it may be
let's we're going to talk about how to
leave that with class then we're going
to talk about what not to do and then
we're going to talk about how to do
research for a company and the what not
to do is a wonderful story from a
disgruntled employee where he posted a
fake job posting for his old job so
we'll get into that so if I were to get
laid off from a role for whatever reason
chances are that it's not because I was
doing something shady or illegal it just
didn't work out right it was a company
where maybe I was a good vibe for them
or maybe maybe it was a situation where
my contract was up so these things
happen right but it's it that doesn't
mean that it has to be the end of your
working relationship with that company
it does in the short term right but the
way that you need to handle it is
completely different how this gentleman
handled his and in this case he worked
at a digital SEO and a marketing company
and social media company one of those
everything sort of small business
companies we do your websites we do your
SEO we do your social media one of those
types of types of guys called oh my god
national in Plantation Florida but if I
were to get laid off what I what I would
do is I what I would ask for a letter
recommendation now assuming that you
didn't do anything shady and we're
assuming that everybody here has a
functioning brain that they're not
getting laid off because they did
something bad now often times even if
you are a bad developer you can get a
letter of recommendation oftentimes it's
just maybe they were looking for someone
more senior and you were on the junior
and that's okay you know people have
bumps in their life and although they
may be late letting you quit or laying
you off
they understand that right so let's say
let's say that something awful happened
to April she got hit by a car and now I
needed to take care of her and I was
emotionally distraught and it was
affecting my work and like it just went
on and on and on I'm talking about a
week I'm talking like six months in and
then finally I said look man you're
killing our project we understand that
you're going through some personal
things it won't just move on but that's
a dramatic situation but you guys get
the idea there are bumps in life where
you know you can maybe emotionally
change as a person it affects your work
and they'll be they'll understand right
they am you want to still have them as a
reference still have them as a contact
get a letter recommendation and you just
want to say I understand smile nod say
you know maybe maybe say is there
anything I need to do to change your
mind I really value this job whatever it
is normal people things like this is
stuff that I think it's common sense
we've talked about it because people out
there people out there in the world that
don't have it right just do a normal
thing treat people how you want to be
treated right that's really what it
comes down to you can you can relate to
their side the argument to of where
they're saying you know what we gotta
let you go because X Y and C X Y Z are
usually pretty reasonable stuff if you
haven't done anything abnormal right and
so if you're just getting laid off er
essentially fired because of maybe you
weren't the best at your job or maybe
the personal stuff in your work quality
change you do have the hey can I get a
reference letter be on good terms and
leave right
collect your unemployment you know like
those worst things to license collect
unemployment all right
I've never collected unemployment but I
would be very happy to tell you that
much I so that's how handle it handle it
like you would expect somebody if they
were on the other side to handle it like
an adult like something that like maybe
three four years later you've got more
experience whatever personal dilemma
that affected your work is gone and you
could reach out and say hey you know
this is where I'm at this is what this
is how much I've improved I see that you
have this opening companies are willing
to rehire employees even if it didn't
work out the first time you know if some
time is passed you can show that you've
matured as a developer and as an
individual or whatever the issue was
that as long as it wasn't too crazy
right like so the other thing is before
we go over this beautiful letter I'm
going to read it word for word and it
just is a smile on my face or you stuff
like this
the other thing is that do your research
about a company write off if you don't
know that there is a a site called
Glassdoor before I ever go and interview
with a company I actually looked them up
on Glassdoor
and typically a the way that it works is
you can see what jobs they have what
salaries people have posted so let's say
that you're interviewing for a role and
it pays $20 an hour maybe that's a good
amount for you but if you're if you're
potentially thinking of leaving or let's
say you're making 40 in that you see
that the range on there is twenty
twenty-five four people have worked
there you may want to bring that up
earlier on into the conversation or you
may not even want to have that
conversation because it's not a
realistic possibility for you to take it
you also see interview questions so that
you can be prepared for that I'm more so
talking about seeing the reviews or I
see what people have to say about the
company you'll see you know what the job
is you can narrow it down by job as well
the pros and the cons now in this case
they have a 3.9 I treat glass door like
a tree Amazon most of the time where I
don't order when I buy on Amazon I just
filtered by four stars and above I don't
order
if it's if it's not there and I don't
like to interview our companies that are
below that now 3.9 you know there's a
little bit of leeway if it's a good job
right so I might go okay check it out
but I would say that you should normally
put more emphasis on the most current
reviews in my opinion because we don't
care people are treated great in the
past we're talking about the president
right like how are people feeling about
it in the present so you can kind of
scan through here see the job that
you're looking for
and go on from there so before you get
this room before you are a disgruntled
employee because you've got a low-paying
job or you worked with somebody who has
no business running a business right or
has no business being a boss do your
research on the company make sure that's
a good work environment this is
something that April personally suffered
from at a job
first job she got out of college and she
she really hated but she worked it for
quite some time because we needed her to
so that we could pay the bills right but
it was an awful company if I were if I
had thought to look it up on glass or at
that time I didn't so I encourage you
guys to do your research before you
apply to a company because you don't
want to invest you know sometimes
interview goes on interviews go on five
six weeks and I will say that the one
company that I put the time and effort
into into a which it was rated out of
about a thousand different reviews on
Glasser has a 3.5 rating that half a
star below what my normal rating is I
made that exception they actually burned
me in the same way that all the reviews
said that they were kind of shady in and
so a lot of times you you know if you
don't want look at signs that's on you
but at least you have a resource to see
what may happen so another I've said how
you should act in an interview and how
you can do your research make sure that
you don't feel like you have to act out
let's go about this gentleman right here
I might do there might be some graphic
words in here these are my words I just
want to read about the frustration and
sometimes it's equally as important to
talk about how not to act as how to act
so here we go this is for that same
company word for a you it's really funny
is I went on their website and they
actually have this
roll that they're hiring for so I know
the student got laid off right they're
looking for this guy so they're looking
for a wordpress developer designer slash
developer compensation not nearly enough
to put up with the nepotism of a massive
ternary employment type full-time sat
wage slave compensation again because
compensation wasn't enough once before
peanuts
department web farm reports you
incompetent and lazy power whores who
like the sound of their own voices it's
not how you should act just keep this
advisor you can think it may be
sometimes just don't don't say anything
so just laugh yourself so oMG national a
failing twenty five-year-old marketing
advertising for that was inherited by
incompetent CEO by the name of Jesse Lou
bar is seeking a qualified wordpress
designer and developer to exploit this
is a key position that will be
responsible for a body by horrible web
practices and standards designed to
defraud thousands of small business
owners in America the designer /
developer will have the ability to will
have the ability to work you know right
on a wide range of victims businesses
throughout many different industries
this is a critical position as where we
look to exploit our web department in
form like conditions compared to India
and China don't worry there's free
coffee that tastes like cheap dunkin
donut leftovers ex a successful
candidate must demonstrate a solid
understanding of obedience towards the
dictate dictate to dictatorial
tick-tick-tick tick-tick-tick you guys
know I'm trying to say dictatorial oh my
goodness a owning class they almost
listen they also must be able to show
examples of their previous work and
must have experienced in designing poor
websites based on the WordPress platform
we maintain a specific standard here we
like to read the salt level is over 9000
boys and girls the salt levels over
9,000 are so essential duties and
responsibilities I would post the link
in here but I imagine this won't be up
to long so that's why I'm reading it off
to you guys design visually sickening
non-creative websites within WordPress
for the width
use of unsafe virus prone plugins
developing customized elements on new
and existing WordPress websites that
were built by someone who is employed at
the company for about three months
before before being churned out like
butter manipulated comprehensive library
of bias prone unsafe WordPress themes
and plugins given the project
specification I think the best part
about this is if you just took out the
sarcasm in the salt this is probably a
pretty close to what the rest of the
resume with the Java app would look like
right so troubleshoot poorly written
sometimes outsource PHP my sequel and
CSS issues related to an environment
with a ridiculously low retention rate
of creative labor produce unoriginal
website mobile site layouts and execute
layout revisions designed by port
designer whose creativity has been
slowly and systemically killed over the
last year's be extremely obedient with
slovenly and slave-driving internal
project managers following detailed
commands and working within our statics
use of proprietary CRM effectively and
efficiently for an embarrassing loading
sum of money we like to think of our CRM
as Salesforce forgotten little autistic
brother Lou that's a little something
qualifications exploitable obedient in
fear management and job losses multiple
dependents see above reasons a
willingness to just bend over and take
into the daily work environment Oh OMG
nationals office is a place where
creativity comes to die our company's
houses several cubicles separated farm
like offices at our headquarters in
Plantation Florida this position is for
desperate local dentists only
compensation was hiring this is a
full-time position with a slave starting
wage and expectations of a full stack
developer interested applicants should
submit their resumes to Josh early a
hard-headed imbecile that takes pleasure
in reassuring himself of his own
sexuality and I I love that he actually
is putting people's name in here no
shame please do not call it we do not
dis as we do not like listening to the
slave it
applicant has previously applied to a
similar position because we would joke
we would still encourage the applicant
to submit their application as we could
potentially exploit them again hiring
process overview do the expected large
volume applicants qualified individuals
as determined by their willingness to
eat a stroke or peanuts will be invited
in for a pre-interview and interview in
the same session all pre interviews will
consist of a ridiculous aptitude test
process that will take a total of 360
minutes and it's absolutely nothing to
do with through slave role those who do
not meet the minimum threshold will not
advance and will be kept on record for
future exploitation those who do meet
the press' threshold will then be given
a formal interview that discusses the
next steps don't forget to bring your
own lubricant of choice if you do not
bring your own lubricant will spit on
your hands okay so it don't look at
though when you get laid off I like this
right so that's a little bit of fun
there ah the gist of the what I want you
guys to take away I'll be other than
that last one liner which you know he's
been you know he's thinking the whole
time how am I going to work does the
whole the whole lubricant thing into
here that was and he's like I'm going to
end with that I'm going to end on
that that's gonna be a great ending so
what I'm trying to say guys is do your
research on Glassdoor about companies
see what the pay is what the cultures
like you know obviously use your best
judgment and if if you do get laid off
if you do get fired and assuming that
you're not a complete imbecile for
whatever reason act accordingly tell
them thank you for the opportunity I was
glad that we were able to work this long
together ask for a letter of
recommendation
ask if you can use them as a reference
whatever it may be a lot of people will
work with you um you definitely don't
want to talk about about the willingness
to just bend over and take it amiss
daily that's not a way to go out
so um let's give away a course right
that's what we like to do on these
videos let's give it away of course um
and um why don't uh why don't we use the
word slave wage what it's slave wages
well I was going to do peanuts peanuts
is better slave voyage might be
offensive will do peanuts so if you want
to be eligible to win a free course I
believe it's we still have one more game
course or a Python course that will give
away don't forget to like the video
comment with the keyboard as well and be
subscribed I'll see you guys to the next
video thank you so much for watching
this highly educational fun video we got
to have some fun sometimes right
