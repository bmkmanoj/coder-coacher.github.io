html/css I just want to make a note
right here is that if you're looking to
support them support uh the gentleman
who made this site only about a year ago
you just got about 300 shirts that he's
trying to sell at $24.99 their their
american apparel whatever them American
Apparel shirts are made out of some sort
of fancy continent that's overpriced but
good cause just throwing it out there my
trust me man I i'm i've been debating
whether or not to buy one not because I
don't want one or the price or anything
it's because I'm just broke so anyhow
eight five and CSS we're almost done
we're in our last ten here and if I
remember it looks like we're gonna we've
been using hex coats to shade which are
the the hash tag and then the the color
elements so dark gray is just one one
one one one
and that gives us a dark gray not too
bad so next we're gonna do RGB which is
red green blue so in this case well we
have to use the abbreviated hex code
which is pound f-series era which isn't
red
so you know there's also a few
abbreviated ones for the main colors
here we are
so we're doing RGB now so when we do
that it's still background - color or
background - color
well we actually put in three values for
our red our green and our blue so a zero
zero zero it comes out black so it's all
the way cranked up each each setting
goes up to 255 and bam there you go so
255 is the white black is zero so your
body should have a red background so if
we want red it's red green blue so
change that and there you go
we got red
your body should have a green background
so same same concept except now we want
to give you the green one nice and same
thing here is now you want to give it a
blue one cool and we're you can also mix
color so this is kind of a less this is
just say I prefer the hex just because
that's typically easier and quicker to
type in but you can also do it this way
so what I'm trying to say here so 165 so
it'll give us our mix there you go
then let's see we have RGB 128 128 which
will be gray
let's see here oops 1 128 128 alright
oh I think we're done we finished there
right there because now we're in
bootstrap so that was our first HTML our
first class our first section H else
next we're doing responsive design with
bootstrap so that's pretty quick weave
that was all pretty much the same thing
we knocked all nine out in about three
and a half minutes so what to look
forward to next is we are going to
design boot straps made by the people
from Twitter it's a completely free
stylesheet and it's used a lot because
not only is it free but it's also a
responsive meaning that it will just to
your menu will adjust your images will
adjust your whole page will adjust based
on what how many pixels are the size of
your device so look forward to that this
one's only about two hours according to
this then we get in a jQuery and
JavaScript but so far I would I would
definitely give this this HTML CSS you
know a thumbs up man I really liked it
so I'll see you guys in the next video
and as always questions comments
concerns and anything constructive is
always appreciated
mostly thanks for the likes and the
comments let me know if I'm doing good
I'm learning
hopefully you're learning still this is
a field we all need to be learning in
and if I'm ever missed for brick if I
ever misrepresent something because I'm
just like I said I'm learning let me
know and if the videos you find them
helpful let me know that that really
goes a long way so I'll see you guys as
always in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
