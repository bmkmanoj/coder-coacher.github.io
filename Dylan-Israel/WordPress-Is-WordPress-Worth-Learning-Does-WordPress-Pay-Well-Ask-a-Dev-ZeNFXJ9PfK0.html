about should you learn WordPress this is
a question I get quite often in live
streams I thought it's about time and I
film a video kind of addressing it we're
gonna go in a little bit about my
personal experience with WordPress I
have done some WordPress development
we're also going to be talking about my
internship when I was doing WordPress
and an experience I had with one of the
developers there and then also we're
gonna be looking most importantly at
some stats about salaries of WordPress
developers what type of jobs they go
into as well as about six or seven other
stats to compare it against right it's
all relative so when you look at
WordPress and look at PHP JavaScript all
these sorts of things how does it
actually how does it actually rank in
terms of these other similar skill sets
Before we jump into today's video I just
want to do a quick shout out to chime
this is actually the bank that I've been
using for about two years and if you're
interested in there's a link in the
description I really love them a lot
part of it is there's no monthly monthly
fees no overdraft fees I know when I was
broke getting going down negative three
in the balance and then getting charged
a $35 fee when I was with Chase just
really pissed me off so there's no
overdraft fees or transfer fees they
have about 24,000 free fee free
locations and you can you can look it up
on the app it's real easy which is more
than your traditional bank you can get
your cheques up to two days early when
you set up direct deposit and if you use
the link in the description and you do
set up direct deposit you'll get twenty
five twenty five dollars in your account
and just so you guys can see that I'm
not like PSN I'm logged into my account
right here and one other cool feature is
if you have this turned on they have a
sort of round up your change feature and
that that's cool in itself but what I
really like about it is they will
actually match 10% of the round up so
you'll see right here I have this round
up bonus for 94 cents basically they
rounded up ninety four nine dollars and
forty cents and then they gave me ninety
four cents on top of it not gonna make
you rich by any means just a cool little
feature so if you're interested in that
and you're looking for a new bank check
out the link in the description below so
before we jump into the stats I'd like
to just kind of do a little bit of
storytime about how I got my first
internship so about three years back I
got my first internship two hours away
and I would make it $12 an hour and
drive two hours there two hours back and
there's a wordpress shop I didn't know
any better at the time and I took the
role and to be honest I really didn't
learn all that much it was just money I
felt like and some resume experience but
I did learn about WordPress and a lot
more detail I had used as a user to
maintain blogs for a data center easy to
do staff writing for and essentially
what was going on was there's basically
a three or four man shop and the the
developer there had been the WordPress
developer had been working for the same
guy for 11 years since he graduated in
the college now he at 11 years of
experience was making $65,000 in
California by the way to put this in
perspective so enough to feed a family
not enough to really do very well and if
you consider the other directions that
you could have gone and just to put that
in perspective you should be making more
than that two years experience or so as
a traditional developer so when you
compare where let's say I'll be in 11
years compared to where a wordpress
developer would be in 11 years
statistically speaking you're gonna be
much farther than 65 Kay and I can say
that without going in too much detail I
am farther than that at every single job
I've ever had as a developer so let's go
ahead and jump into the the stats little
bit but I wanted to share that because I
think that just from a personal
experience and it could be different
right maybe maybe that was just one guy
who makes bad workplace decisions but it
doesn't look like that's the case so
here what we the site that we're on now
include the the link down below
it's called pay scale what pay scale
specializes in it's fine now what you're
worth is right and what we're looking up
today is the skill WordPress what is for
what jobs are they most common in and at
what average rates of pay and you'll
notice one of the things that you'll
actually note that I noticed instantly
is that when you look up WordPress yeah
you get web developer web designer
front-end developer or web designer and
developer so you want to stay away from
this designer stuff all these designer
jobs web designer does for the most part
are gonna be automated by WordPress
they're getting automated by Wix and and
all those sort of easy to deliver Web
Design jobs because what you want to be
is a developer not a designer and but
there's nothing wrong with design but
sometimes people stick in web design now
there are people who make a lot of money
doing very great designs but it's a
little bit of a different niche than
what is actually going on here so you'll
also notice that there's webmaster and
managing editor now these have nothing
to really do with development which when
you start seeing skills that bring out
other jobs that are closely related you
need to start worrying about that in the
software space and that's part of the
reason that you see these at national
average salaries so low for this skill
set you know fifty one thousand for our
national forty three thousand like why
even bother for the eight thousand you
just get envira you can't raise a family
and most places on forty three thousand
so M so the reason I bring this up is
look at this senior web developer with
WordPress in there at sixty six sixty
seven thousand so let's look at other
other items by by comparison in these
cases we're going to be looking at
JavaScript we're gonna be looking at
Java we're gonna be looking at Ruby
we're gonna be looking at Python we're
gonna be looking at PHP and c-sharp and
the reason for that I figure that's a
good you know six different languages
you're saying well it's not really
compared you can't really compare
WordPress to JavaScript oh yes we can
because as someone who's
to become a developer that is what
you're taking on
you're saying that I'm going to learn
WordPress over JavaScript over Python
and if you do do that good man there's
probably WordPress developers who make a
lot more than the average without a
doubt they've probably got very good and
all this other stuff but I'm just saying
statistically speaking based off the
average this is the info that you should
know so let's go ahead and just jump in
this JavaScript so our green chair was
at 43,000 I think we could probably say
that the average between all these jobs
probably about 50,000 or so we're on
there maybe 50 to 53 JavaScript
developer when we search for the skilled
JavaScript what are we starting to pick
up we're picking up software engineer
we're also picking up software developer
we do get that higher pay web developer
one that they that was also a crossover
right senior software engineer senior
engineer front-end developer software
engineer so for something like this
you're you're seen and this is by the
way that just see where this is twenty
seven thousand or so people reporting in
WordPress we have two thousand people
are reporting so take it for what it is
but that it's people self reporting for
the United States that's where this is
all coming up as a current as of October
2017 so we can say at the very least
that this is probably more indicative
since there are twenty seven thousand
reports in these jobs so you'll see here
front-end developers slash engineer and
then you go okay well why is this one
fifty six thousand and why is this one
sixty eight thousand same exact job but
the skill is what I'm talking to you
about so you're making probably about
twenty percent or seventeen percent more
money in the same exact role by learning
JavaScript and also you have the ability
to grow in a in more directions that are
going to be more profitable right on
here web developer then front-end
developer in this sixty eight thousand
on JavaScript it's higher than every job
in WordPress and no money's not
everything behind just talking about
about the ability to provide for
family and things to consider when you
are taking your time and energy to
devote to a skill and you have so that's
just JavaScript okay let's not our pond
that too much because we all know that
I'm a JavaScript guy and you're doing
your bison JavaScript man you just live
only looking the JavaScript off right or
whatever trolls say so here we go Java
I hate Java so we'll bring up Java so
you can see here in Java eighty one
thousand sixty nine thousand one hundred
fifteen thousand hundred three thousand
seventy four thousand seven thousand one
hundred seventy four thousand I think
every job here beats the WordPress
developer right yeah every job is higher
than the jobs that come up when you look
for the skill WordPress compared to Java
alright that's alright we'll continue on
maybe that's maybe that's just to flukes
maybe it's just to I'm not a fan of Ruby
either man uh if it's Java Ruby I'll
take Ruby though so let's say Ruby Ruby
got eighty five thousand one hundred
twenty two thousand hundred nine
thousand seven two thousand sixty nine
thousand sixty two thousand sixty one
thousand all right so notice not as
great as Java or JavaScript but still
quite a bit of a better skill set and
more room for growth right we have a
junior software engineer here by the
time you move up to a senior software
engineer you've more than doubled your
income on average so a lot more room for
growth why the other jobs in WordPress
you're talking about going from in
best-case scenario best-case scenario
you're starting at forty three thousand
a wordpress web designer all right every
word so you start at 43 at best case you
get up to sixty six as a senior web
developer five years later assuming that
you jumped into web development and and
did some developing there so you have a
much better career by not going into
work first so okay okay you know what
Dylan three four three that's that's no
creek that's no good and by the way just
just so you guys know I pulled these
pages I popped them up in tabs I don't
even look at them before I film this
video because I knew without even having
to see them that all them were going to
be better than WordPress but that's okay
maybe maybe I'm wrong right so let's see
here Python eighty six thousand ninety
six thousand hundred nine thousand
thirteen thousand people
reporting you know so the thing with
WordPress guys is a lot of times you'll
build a template you'll send it to them
and then they're done the people
WordPress is so easy they manage it
themselves they can't get a lot of
customizability but 99% of businesses or
small little businesses they're like
mom-and-pop sort of stores maybe it's a
furniture store or auto shop or whatever
and they just need that website and one
maybe contact form to send emails with
someone's interested in their products
and WordPress you're playing right into
that and there's nothing wrong with it
per se but you're not doing the best
thing for your salary so now we get to
the dirty dirty PHP and you'll see this
is a little bit on the lower end
53 77 64-61 80 but still not bad right
it's still not bad about half the the
web runs PHP I believe is what I read in
a stat don't quote me on that birthday
so there's a lot of PHP out in the world
it's unfortunate PHP is disgusting so uh
that's just my personal opinion uh I
guess that was a little too opinion I do
not like PHP as well I'm trying to say
but WordPress also a backbone is PHP so
if you are going to learn WordPress may
I please just say learn PHP instead or
as you're getting your internship in
WordPress continue to study PHP and get
a PHP role somewhere else that would be
my advice and finally we just pull up
c-sharp 75-67 103 97 61 but you also
notice that every every category we've
looked at has had only developer jobs
engineer roles developer roles data
analyst is falls into that category as
well well meanwhile we go into PHP and
we have this very strange outlier of not
only lower money but also these two jobs
in here that have absolutely nothing to
do with like real develop it managing
editor webmaster so I would encourage
you guys to do your own research this is
just one site right you're gonna find
the same thing a million other places
but maybe maybe you don't believe me or
maybe just don't like facts
that's okay too right but you're you're
gonna be putting yourself in a you're
basically gonna pigeonhole yourself your
career because a lot of times what
happens is people go and they do what's
easy and WordPress is easy right you'll
get going and you'll find work and maybe
I'll get even some some easy content
management work and from there what
happens is a lot of times people won't
put in the time and the energy to learn
outside what they know because and then
they the you know they've capped
themselves a fifty sixty thousand dollar
salary that when you could be making 120
B much more in demand and if you ever
get laid off you get a job like that
better benefits more more PTO all that
sort of stuff working for better
companies so my advice for you is to
stay away from WordPress it is not the
best thing that you can do to spend your
time on so I'll include the links to to
the WordPress in here and I include all
seven it's too much time but I'll
include at least so WordPress and
JavaScript one so you guys can kind of
look over it and see other skills on
here that you may be interested in so
thank you guys so much for watching the
video don't forget to comment like
subscribe share support my pack patron I
don't only want you like I want you to
smash that like button as
Ethan and helo would say I appreciate
you all I wish you the best of luck and
if you are learning WordPress and you
think I'm wrong tell me why I I mean I'm
not opposed to being corrected I'm
trying to educate myself as as much as
maybe help educate others and share my
opinion about these things I don't
really think anything I've told you is
opinion today I think what I've shown
you is that based off of one resource
admittedly but I've seen this at other
sites but based off this one resource we
can say that the money is less the
amount of people reporting is less so
and the jobs here they're they're not
web development jobs for some of them
which is scary so things to think about
thank you so much see you guys next time
bye
baby would you still date me if I was a
wordpress developer no quick shout-out
to device plus comm if you're interested
