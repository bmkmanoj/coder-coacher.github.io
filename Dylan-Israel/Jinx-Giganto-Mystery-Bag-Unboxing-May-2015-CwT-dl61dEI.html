talking about jinx cons mystery bag
mystery heard on tone edition and I was
a big fan of their good to canto bags
and they changed up before they used to
be 2999 such as 30 bucks and you got
ninety dollars worth of stuff and it was
just kind of a grab bag they didn't
guarantee what you would get you would
just put your t-shirt size in then that
was it so what was so cool about it is
that it really was like you would get
accessories or you just get close your
combination now it's forty dollars and
you get a guaranteed peace out where two
t-shirts and two accessories and I was
like last year I loved it so much I
ordered three of our order one and two
more so it's from about 90 bucks plus
shipping and whatnot if you don't know
if you're a loyal customer like I am you
eventually or in jenks gold for every
purchase which is basically their own
currency and you can save money so I
really have loved jinx calm forever I
have great respect for their them as a
business because when I emailed them
when I was streaming a lot they gave me
codes for 10 t-shirts and they sent they
sent 10 of my viewers hearthstone
t-shirts so i was really i thought that
was really cool them and so I've always
spoke very highly of them and I was
little hesitant when I ordered because
there's ten dollars more this year but I
said okay let's let's take a gamble and
hopefully will be impressed but I i have
to say i'm kinda have mixed feelings
about it so let's go over what I got and
you can be the voice of reason perhaps
and make your own judgments and I'll
just give you my interpretation so um
this shirts actually assured i got from
one of the cagando bags last year you
can see i have some of the jinc stickers
on the mini fridge in the back there and
the poster up in the top right i got for
gene at jenks not in a good got go back
though and a one of the cool things
about this year is they actually send
you a bag that it holds all the stuff
and i opened everything up this is take
number two so I just
wanted to do a better run but uh so uh
yeah you get a cool little back and it's
like a free durable bag I don't know
what I would use this or some sort of
burlap sack but um I like it enough that
uh this is one of the highlights I guess
this is a good idea and this is better
than some of the items I got to be
honest with you so let's go over let's
go from worst to best I guess let's do
it that way and if I'm doing it that way
you can see that I kind of don't like
what I got and so the first thing i got
was a titanfall uh like bracelet rubber
band thing um i really don't like this
um I I don't know I just should never
wear it and I don't play titanfall but I
mean that's a gamble you take when you
order these bags but I I know I still
don't like it um I wouldn't like it even
if it was like a league of legends once
I have those I get them for you get them
for free at events and stuff like that
so something like this is just like nope
no one wanted to buy it on your website
I get it I get it um it's okay I used to
give these to my subscribers uh I my
subscribers would rather like top
donators and stuff like that with their
bc b pca memberships and whatnot so it's
uh like they saw this guy couplet i play
work I've are used to and ok yeah
whatever these are as far as accessories
go are a major down step than the
accessories I got in previous bags like
the other side you know I'm talk I used
to get like a portal to wallet and I got
action figures and oh I believe a book
so you got you know cooler it says these
are like dollar two-dollar accessories
you know and will actually look at the
what things cost on their to compare to
make sure got our 90 dollar value so you
also get stickers with everything and as
I said I do this in order I like these
stickers you know I have ton of them
more than I like these so put that in
perspective
so the first thing I got the next thing
that I i really wasn't too big of a fan
on oh I like this I'll wear I'll wear it
um was this world of warcraft a brewfest
shirt and you can see it's kind of it's
kind of cool it's I would have loved a
better world of warcraft shirt um well
we're it's it's blue so I like that it's
blowing up black God knows I have enough
black shirts that's why you leave your
phone or your film a video that's okay
um the next thing I got and this is only
better because it's a sweatshirt is this
little pull over and it's pretty light
um I'll wear it I'll probably wear
tomorrow but this is what the bulk of
their they say the bulk of their costs
in my bag come from and I just don't buy
it so I'm not I'm not a huge fan of it
but uh there were so many cool
sweatshirts that you could have got that
you get this one and it's just kind of
man I guess it's the way to put it so in
the last item I got was the diablo 3
shirt I like this much better um decals
pretty big but uh I'd wear it uh this is
my favorite item so far our fake
favorite item throughout it and we can
go over what we got in here and I I will
tell you that I do think their previous
backs had a much better value I remember
added up one bag and it was like a
hundred twenty dollar value on their
site so the pin is two dollars just pull
up the calculator let's do that man
let's let's really get it official and
we can show how how things have just
gone downhill I guess so let's see here
we got the pin at 199 the next thing we
got was the titanfall are meant for 799
which is just a load of crap
if you ask me so uh no wonder these in a
Cell it's of a 99 we got um the diablo 3
burning premium t at twenty one point 99
and then I believe the the other t-shirt
I didn't pull it up was 2199 also 5396
and then this forty dollars is a bit
insane um doesn't have a hood to pull
over and it's their own brand at thirty
nine ninety nine so we we hit our 93-95
so after shipping and they did it my my
coupon either i made a mistake cuz i
make mistakes or they made a mistake but
i do know it said I'd save fifteen
percent and it wasn't applied so I'm not
quite sure why it wasn't but um for this
to be their own brand and I get 93 95 on
a minimum $90 order I have to say I I
think I got ripped off and i don't i
don't necessarily i was i was hoping
that I would get this and I would
reorder like I did last year and there's
so many cool items you can get not this
one thank God I wouldn't want that would
but uh I don't even play half life but I
would love the half-life 1 um like a
boss would be cool but my I'd give this
a thumbs down I'm so sad to say that but
uh I would have to say I would have to
say guys that I would not recommend it
this year I'm going to I'm going to have
to give it a thumbs down and
for fifty dollars after shipping and tax
and to get the I got and I'm pretty
I'm a pretty fair guy I think when it
comes to like these subscription boxes
these mystery bags and stuff like that
but uh I'd say be warned this time I'm
sorry to say that I'm a huge fan of jinx
but maybe I'm wrong if you guys think
I'm you know cuz half the bag is
basically this I don't think this is
worth forty dollars and you can
basically if they wanted to they you
just make this ninety dollars on their
site you know this is it they make their
own prices this is their own brand I
don't I don't like it at all and maybe
I'm being unreasonable maybe I'm not but
uh I won't be ordering any more this
year and i'm kinda you can tell by my
voice a little bit i'm all bummed out i
really was looking forward to this and I
or I just ordered three other shirts
actually like they have a shirt mystery
back for 2199 and I got three great
shirts and I would do that ten times
before I would do this mystery bag again
this extra ten dollars thirty-three
percent increase and the value I got I
don't believe they may say it's worth
93-95 I don't feel it's worth 93-95 and
that's it so beware I'll be leaving an
unpleasant but nice comment on the
Jake's website so i hope you guys take
take this with a grain of salt and if
you think I'm wrong let me know on Raw
in the comments I'd like the video share
it and get your own and maybe it gets
better maybe yours is better than mine
