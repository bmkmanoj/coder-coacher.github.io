five things that you should be doing to
teach yourself how to code not ten a
five just five and you can do it you can
do them today I'm trying to be funny I
got nothing for the beginning of this
video just do these five things you'll
be better off to teach yourself how to
code these are all things that you can
start today and continue on and they're
all things that if you want to be a good
developer and not just a developer they
should implement into your lifestyle
into your day into your work all these
sorts of things let's go ahead and dive
into it so this should be a gimme but I
assume too many things there give me
four people's and you should not ever
assume anything anymore in life so here
we are code daily is number one and I
mean that you're like oh you just mean
to code no no I really do mean please
code everyday and it doesn't necessarily
have to be that you're actually writing
code but do something that's related to
you learning to code that's really what
it is at the other day and although when
you're just getting started yes you
should be actually writing code every
day and it's unfortunate because to me
it's one of the few things that I think
a lot of people don't do and it always
hurts them and what I want to say is
that when you're just starting out -
learning to code is one of those things
that has a momentum to it and you need
to fully immerse your life and self into
it especially in the beginning stages
before because that is the crucial part
where you're now putting it all together
so please please PLEASE code daily and I
just don't know what else to say you I'm
not this is an advice that only I've
been giving you know we had oh if you go
and look up engineer truths video when
he interviewed Quincy Larson code Daley
code day almost anybody will tell you
this is something that you're gonna have
to do and that's why boot camps have you
coding for so much in a three-month
period and you come out with developers
who are
most most of them can code I encourage
you to do if anything from this list
please just do that if you're trying to
learn to go number two is build things
this may sound silly this may sound
crazy but I know when I started to learn
web development I never actually built
anything I just did I just followed
tutorials on the internet I just fall on
YouTube for instance I just did coke
atom II tutorials I just did free code
camp tutorials and it wasn't until I
actually built some projects through
free code camp it all started to click
it I I'm a big believer in in - in
building things and which is why I'm
structuring the courses I'm building to
just be projects where you're building
projects and you're having to put the
logic together and see how you're
actually using it right part of the
reason that I hated school was this all
theoretically you never actually got to
build anything never actually got to
touch anything
and for me I learn hands-on and that
means this hand needs to be on this
Mouse and this hand needs to be on this
keyboard and I need to actually be doing
something for me to be learning how to
code and I think a lot of people are
like that so build things and it it
could be small projects that's really
all I'm saying is you don't need to
start today building out the next
Facebook or Google or whatever
people want to say all right what you
can do is just build a calculator and
not follow a tutorial just figure out
how to build a calculator and then when
you do that build a slightly more
complicated project build something
requires an API so you're interested in
Instagram and you just want to have your
Instagram photos on your on your
portfolio page so you don't have a
portfolio build a portfolio all just
whatever you want to build just go and
build it stop watching these tutorials
being built and not that they're bad I
serve great but oftentimes people never
actually build anything on their own so
please build your own projects as is
number two number three is a long-term
side project
like this this is something I will
mention in a hundred videos and 99 out
of 100 people won't do it but I'm still
going to mention it please please please
start a side project of some type it
could be a social aspect one like my
youtube channel it could be a blog
it could be a uh you know I have 29 I
have a video where it says 29 side
project ideas I have a whole list there
but start a side project start something
that's going to keep you interested
start something that maybe you can make
a few bucks from you know it's always
easy to learn something when it's
returning you money at the end of the
day so you're gonna go back and do it
even if it's just a little bit so please
start a side project and it could be
anything it doesn't necessarily have to
be hard coding all the time but it is
something that I think and it doesn't
necessary
that's okay start a different side
project I encourage everyone to have at
least one side project that they're
working on for their entire career
really and it's one of the ways that you
can keep the passion alive just our side
projects please and it's great for your
portfolio as well
number four is courses video courses
we've mentioned them a couple times so
far and people are always asking what is
the best way to learn to code and
oftentimes it is to build your own
projects but in order to build those
projects you have to know that certain
things exist right
you have to know like okay well one
question that I got from my girlfriend
when I was trying to teach her out of
code is what am I gonna use a for-loop
for that seems dumb so instead of
explaining to her what like what a
for-loop is let's just show her an
example of how we would use a for-loop
and that's a great thing about courses
usually you not only get introduced to
concepts but oftentimes they have
projects in it so you're seeing examples
of how you will build something out
piece-by-piece how all the parts relate
and go on from there
a video course and people always ask
like courses are books I will tell you
that in my personal opinion that I think
courses
books out tenfold that's my personal
opinion
part of that is that web development
specifically is changing very rapidly
and it's just hard to keep up I think
you can get 10 pages worth of blogs and
compare it with 200 pages in a book and
the 10 pages and the blogs will blow it
out the water because it's going to be
relevant it's gonna be up-to-date and
it's gonna have great content and I feel
kind of the same way about video courses
in comparison to books not that books
are bad and I don't think anyone I think
I'm like on books there's a lot
of great books out there on software
becoming you know John has a couple
Johnson mez has some great books that
will help you in your software career
but they're not necessarily hard code
books if you're talking about how to
learn angular how to learn Java books
are a little bit of a strange way to go
about it in my personal opinion some
people will disagree but I think in
terms of time spent for return on that
time spent the courses are much better
for that but that's that's probably a
separate video topic now number 5 I have
a like 5 things written down for number
5 but what I'm really trying to say is
immerse yourself into the community
start hanging out with other developers
start meeting other developers get
involved socially if you want to become
something oftentimes you need to
surround yourself with that something
right if you want to become a developer
it helps have friends who are developers
who are interested and passionate about
the same thing who when you're
struggling on something silly or you
know whatever it is that you can reach
out say you know what man I don't
understand what a API is I know it's
probably not that complicated I know
that I'll up hit it eventually but I've
I've been hit it I've been hitting it 10
for 10 hours now I just don't understand
what it do this is by the way this is
something that's happened to me and an
old co-worker of mine Ethan I was
sending some emails back asked him he
showed me in 30 seconds what an API is
what I'm doing and then BAM
things start clicking right when someone
it's not that the concept is hard is
just sometimes you don't even know where
to begin and also it goes back to that
path
when you start going in meetups and you
become part of the community and you
start sharing these passions on Facebook
groups and you start getting not only
does it help you stay up-to-date on the
field and let you know what are some
great resources to recommend by other
developers it's just another great thing
that will help you stay passionate and
help you do these other things we have
the list it's gonna when you when you
are enjoying this and you're you're
passionate about you're going to code
daily you're gonna go start a side
project but you're gonna build things
you're gonna do courses right and so it
kind of ties it it's the glue that ties
your learning process all all together
and helps you enjoy what you're doing
right if you don't enjoy learning to
code you're probably going to not learn
how to code and it's going to be
miserable even if you do so please try
to jump into the community and however
whatever is fun for you really just fun
and makes it enjoyable so that you enjoy
all this and YouTube for me is my way
that I do it right I I go to meetups
when I can and hackathons and and you
know I get interested in a bunch of
million different things but for me my
number one thing that I like is YouTube
I have the Facebook group and the social
I like the social aspects and I think
that you once you get to and a lot of
people are like well I don't know how to
meet developers and I don't know where
to meet them and you know there's
meetups and all that sort of stuff but
at the other day if you're the one
developer in a city of one you have the
internet with Facebook groups and
YouTube channels and everything else
that's out there to help you get that
glue to tie it all together and stick it
together so these are my five tips to
make sure that you can learn to code
effectively and I hope that I actually
haven't said anything that you weren't
aware of but I hope maybe you having
someone tell you these things that are
true
these aren't opinions at this point this
is actually just truth and there's
probably other truths on how to learn to
code but these are probably on
everybody's list in my opinion I wanted
to make them very broad for that reason
and all of these things you get started
on today
on a sidenote look forward to the five
things that you're doing that is
teaching you not to code in a in a in
the following days video and that's
gonna be a fun one so look forward to
that
as always guys thank you so much for

subscribe and share support me on
patreon and all that good stuff I'll see
you in the next video bye hey baby
what's one way you think someone could
learn to code you're always helpful baby
quick shout-out to device plus comm if
you're interested in the latest IO tease
hacks do-it-yourself projects revolving
