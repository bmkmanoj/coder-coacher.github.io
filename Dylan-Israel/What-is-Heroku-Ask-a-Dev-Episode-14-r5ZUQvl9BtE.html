talk about what is Heroku and what can
use it for now
I'd been hearing people mention Heroku
for quite a bit I finally looked it up
and discovered what it was and the
reason I wasn't too familiar with it was
up until recently I was only familiar
with front-end development and when
launching my front-end applications that
were just using basic HTML CSS
JavaScript I never had the need to have
a back-end and that's really where
Heroku kind of simplifies life so let me
let me jump to it real quick and you'll
see right here we're on Heroku and what
basically it is is what they define its
platform as a service or Pass paas paas
and what it allows us to do is it'll
basically launch our application that
has a back-end in my case I'm going to
be using it for nodejs nodejs is a great
note in Express is great to have a very
simple and easy understand JavaScript
based back-end where I can create
endpoints a restful api s and things
like that now they have other things as
well Ruby Python Java Scala closure and
I'm sure they'll expand as things go on
but what it basically allows us to do if
we look at this timestamp micro service
is Roku will host your back-end and your
front-end in this case this is an
example from the free code camp
timestamp micro service that uses Heroku
zap and it allows us to if we were to
copy this defining URL in their case is
time-stamped
- MS Theroux cout app and then pass in
you know ours is a URL here where it
takes in a string and then converts
converts it to a eunuch State and a
natural day but this application that
does this with the backend that returns
this JSON is a Heroku hosting that for
us basically and so why would we use
Heroku instead of going about going
about and setting up a node.js server or
something like that
well for one when you're setting up your
back-end project
it's great to have things on your github
and it's great to have information like
that available your code available for
people to see but it's even better to
have that and then have a live working
version for people to interact with now
you can do that if you have a GoDaddy
site like I do you can see right here
that anywhere from five to eighty
dollars a month but you can also just
have it done for free on Heroku and have
a simple link to go and test out your
applications it's a matter of preference
this also doesn't include your regular
hosting as well so a lot of us are a
little bit strapped for cash and you
know not necessarily email it's five
dollars a month plus hosting not
necessarily the best choice to do if you
don't have any money so Heroku is a
great way to launch your your functional
web application just showcase it and
then just link to it in your portfolio
so that perspective individuals can view
them and go from there and again I I
haven't actually launched it myself yet
I'm about to walk myself through it but
that's essentially the gist of Heroku is
a platform for you to launch your your
air front-end and back-end application
and you'll see you know they have
various ones as well if you guys have
any other questions definitely leave
them in the comments below and I'll try
to get to them as soon as I can and
