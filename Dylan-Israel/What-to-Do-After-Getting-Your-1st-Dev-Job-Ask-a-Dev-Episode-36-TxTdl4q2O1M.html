full months now as a salary developer
anyhow professional developer and one of
the things I've really thought about was
what do I do after I get my job after I
get my big break right like so we're all
in the grind we finally get that get our
big break we worked hard we got it we
got our junior level role or whatever
role it was as a developer and how do we
continue from there and this is
something I think is really important
and if you don't if you don't think
about it and you just kind of you know
set a goal so like oh I just want to be
a good developer but how and what what
does that entail and how do I get to the
next level right how do you go from a
junior to a mid-level and mid to a
senior you just don't think oh it will
happen it could happen you know five
five years down the road your senior
developer but how do you make sure that
you're going to be an interesting
candidate and a good senior developer
this is something that I've thought
about so that if whatever happens maybe
it doesn't work out or it's not the
perfect fit for you that you're prepared
to go elsewhere or or increase your
money you maybe don't get the raise that
you think you are and your game face
slightly below market value and you say
 that I only get slightly above
market value how do we do that what do
we do well for me it was always
important to continue learning and that
that's a blanket statement but what I
well let's start where did where do you
start when you first get your big break
right
the first thing I did was I made sure
that I was okay at work whatever
technologies I worked in at work I made
sure that if I had gaps in it and you
will write so I had only worked with
angular for about a month and only on
one project before they hired me and I
had major angular - angularjs caps and I
made sure that that was my primary focus
once I got hired I was focusing on
angular getting my HTML CSS make sure
all the basics were covered for the job
make sure I could
function in the jobs face in the role
that I was hired to do I wanted to make
sure that I was at the level I needed to
be and whatever it is what there's
always going to be a technology or a
framework or a library or a database
that you're not familiar with there
always be something that you're not at a
proficient developer level and it was a
couple things for me it was my sequel I
didn't really touch my sequel quite some
time
it was angular and so that was what I
focused on I wanted to make sure that in
terms of my professional work I was in
the clear I was good to go and that
should be your first step now what do
you do on top of that cuz for me it took
me I say about a month to about a month
and a half to really get to where I felt
okay now I still nervous don't get me
wrong like I had nerves out out my
 asshole until about four or five
months yeah but I felt like okay um
based off the other developers I'm
working with I think I'm one of the
better ones with what we're what we're
doing and I think I understand it like I
can I can work with this stuff I'm good
I can work with this stuff at home and
at work right so once I hit that level
where you know you're always gonna run
into bugs and things like that and you
know these little gotchas but that was
what I made my transition to focusing on
new technologies now you're saying well
why why are you learning new
technologies what development is a very
fast growing and fast changing software
department if you will or sophomore
software is genre category and you have
things like where one framework ain't I
work in angularjs angularjs is on its
way to becoming a legacy techie some
could even argue that it already is and
with angular 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 being out and I'm
sure 5 &amp;amp; 6 whenever they come right and
a lot of work right now is in roles
where you're actually going you're
they're taking angularjs developers and
they're training them in angular 2 to
convert most of the time in old
angularjs app into an Electra so I
started thinking about
what technologies would what I do I need
to learn and I started playing around
with front-end stuff and I this I
courage you do the same right and the
reason I say wait till you're you're
comfortable right because you have to
secure your job numero uno right make
sure you're good at your job
numero dos if you own or two on the
ladder of importance is you need to
secure your future you need to secure
your skillset you need to secure your
money right and so there's more money
typically especially for newer
developers in the newer technologies and
web development so you need to if
there's a and before you go worry about
the money you need to make sure your
full stack developer I think I think
that is really what and I didn't think
about this at the first because when I
got hired I was a front-end developer
primarily with little to no back-end
experience so why what I've spent the
majority of my time on recently and as I
realized this and took me about two and
a half months of learning before I
realized that I was going in the wrong
direction it was just part of the reason
I want to make this video as well so
that you don't do that you don't waste
you and a half months right you know we
only have so much time to learn outside
of work and you need to use it to the
best year ability so that you could be
as successful as possible for me I spent
about two and a half months kind of
playing around with different front-end
libraries and it occurred to me that I
actually never fully learned the mean
stock I never moved on to MongoDB I
never moved on to express a node and I
wasn't really a fully like I could work
in the backend network and I was working
on skills out there but I wasn't really
a fully functional mean developer and
that was always my goal and so I started
filling in the gaps because as I've said
time and time again from every every
survey you'll read about 10% of the jobs
are for front-end 25% are for back-end
and 65% are for full stack developers so
if you want to make sure that your
future proof you really do need to be a
full stack developer because that is the
hole and probably those front-end
back-end developers are full stack
developers to begin with right and so
that really is how you get started they
hire you know how you the the biggest
asset you can give to yourself going
from a front-end to a
full-stack developer and so that was
what I made sure I focus on and I'm
currently even getting better with I'm
building out you know the backend
projects and things like that on free
code camp and building a portfolio in
that that kind of goes on to my third
point of once you have reached that full
stack status where you're a mean
developer myrn developer out of rails
developer whatever it may be you need to
you need to think about what's next
because you can't you need to upgrade
whatever legacy tech you're working with
in my case it's angularjs you need to
upgrade that to another framework
another front-end framework you need to
kind of keep everything fresh when it
comes to your technologies now this
isn't it this isn't a must this is more
if a if you always want to be able to
hit the job market at any time or a
relative nice amount of money the idea
the idea is supporting that being that
newer newer tech is going to have less
people learning it which means there's
gonna be a less supply but there's
there's probably gonna be less jobs at
to begin with so it's a supply and
demand sort of thing and I tend to
believe the supply is lower than lower
than the demand which means you'll get
paid slightly above and also you won't
be phased out so much right so because
you're gonna be on that the the the
curve if you will and this this kind of
goes on to this these are some sort of
plus points is I'm a big believer in
personal projects to do these things my
personal project is obviously my youtube
channel although I do have some others
that I'm working on slowly but surely I
plan to release a course or two and I
plan to you know do some projects and
learn some other languages and things
like that
but the gist of it is the TLDR version
of what you should do after you after
you get your first big break right is
one fill in the gaps of your knowledge
at your current workplace that's that's
crucial above all else next if you're if
you're not a full stack developer that
is that is the the the biggest thing
that you have missing if that's it you
need to that is above anything else in
your life is get that full stack
status right you uh why would they hire
two developers when they could hire one
right and it's like you're that one and
you want to be you want to be equipped
to be that one and when opportunity
comes knocking you need to be able to
answer the door and if you aren't a full
sack developer you're only gonna get 10%
of the opportunities for that
potentially the other thing is learning
new technologies is really great
especially web development JavaScript's
change it every week right that's the
joke is like a new framework comes out
every day and it feels like it like it
sometimes personal projects so these are
things that I think are kind of
important I think it shows character
right and I think it I think it makes
you an interesting candidate and it
makes you gives you something to talk
about in your interview which makes you
stand out a lot of times granted you're
gonna have to have the skill set and you
should but if you're an interesting
candidate and they think they can work
with you and you're passionate you might
be able to beat out some more qualified
candidates they don't want to work with
and I think personal projects are a
great way of doing it and it's one the
one things I think helped me get get my
start as well but um I hope you guys
think about that and if you disagree
with any of this I I'm always trying to
learn right and I try to share whatever
my whatever whatever has worked for me
and my experience and not necessarily
give advice but just say what I'm doing
and why I'm doing it and if you think
I'm doing something wrong let me know in
the comments below and if there's
something I left out that you think is
really important
go ahead and and let me know as well
definitely fill in the gaps learn new
things start a project start interesting
projects and a lot of this a lot of
great things guys about being developers
you have a lot of a lot of opportunity
to start your own things that could
actually make you money down the road
you never know what little side project
that you start in you know 2017 and 2020
is making you you know five six thousand
dollars a month or more or you know just
a couple hundred bucks it's it's an
interesting industry we're in and I
you take advantage of that with that
