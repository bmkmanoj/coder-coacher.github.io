jumping into components interacting
lesson this dot props now just uh heads
up I'm gonna skip through a lot of the
information but there is a ton of stuff
to kind of read through on this one it's
very complex
props themselves are kind of easy but
when you're interacting with various
components and passing props into other
components that's really where it gets a
little confusing a lot another layer of
depth so props are basically when one
component to another information gets
passed from one component to another I
kind of think of them as parameters
passing between objects that's how I
think of it whether that's correct
technically probably not but whatever
makes you understand it so the way that
you declare props is this
docprops/thumbnail.emf in this so that
we can see it so basically we just want
to see a string of it and then we're
gonna go ahead and inject it into our h2
element here
is that like so he's going to run that
and then we need to go ahead and render
it out so react Dom render and what are
we rendering here we are rendering our
component props displayer
and where do we want to output it we
want to go ahead and output it at
document dot get element by ID at the
look at the ID app so assume in its
spell misspell anything which is about
one in three times I feel like I
misspelled something so right now you'll
see right now our prop is empty hence
why it's not coming out with their JSON
I think we'll take care of that in this
next section the way that you pass a
prop in is you'll see our greeting app
here and we're basically kind of
assigning a parameter or a prop like so
so this is the name of my info this is
top secret info and then you'll see
right here you can also set a object
that takes in an array you can get very
complex with this stuff if you need to
put in a boolean value so if you want to
just pass a string as quotes if you want
to pass in like a boolean you're gonna
wrap it in curly brace the same thing
with a numeric number as well
let's go ahead and jump in to give my
prop a given value of hello so we're
gonna pass in a prop to props displayer
here and we're saying my prop is equal
to and because it's a string we're using
quotations I love
and remember her past this is coming out
as a JSON object so we're gonna see the
key value pair here like so
on line 12 you'll see a prop called
Roberto being passed in how could you
make that name show up on the screen so
what we're gonna do there is we're just
gonna type out anything like we normally
would hi there
comma and then curly braces and in here
we're gonna say this remember this kind
of refers to the object that we're
working with in this dumb prop stop name
you're gonna be using this a lot with
your props this stop props always so
just it'll be one of the things you'll
have to know about react this stop props
stop name and it should output hi there
Roberto oh and make sure you put in the
correct prompt there we go so you're
gonna kind of see how we can kind of
make this dynamic now if we wanted to
change our values here like so you could
simply instead of Roberto we could play
the coding tutorials 360
and they'll say hi there coding
tutorials 360 so props not too
complicated when you're dealing on kind
of a simple level like that but once you
dealing passing in multiple components
from one component to the next to the
next it gets a little hard to keep track
of everything I actually don't think
they do a very solid job with how they
do the second half of this but with that
being said I am still new to react so
maybe I don't know what the hell I'm
talking about
oh so you'll see right here we're
passing in our render here or passing on
a name everything we've learned so far
it just kind of warns you about props
and prop here so a prop is our name this
dot props is so just basically keep that
straight that's all your wishes a pass a
prop to the greening component instance
from an app component instance if app is
going to cause proper greeting that
follows app it's going to render a green
screen is going to be rendered by
another component it needs to use module
about exports in greeting Jas delete
require react Dom so because we're not
doing anything with the ingredient we're
just gonna pass it to app we're gonna go
ahead and get rid of the require yak
dong and then what do we want to do here
and remove this as well because we're
not rendering it remember what we want
to do is just go ahead and export our
component if it's called so that's all
that's going on here
what's the Saran a little quicker
all right uh so app can't pass a prompt
to greeting beak until app dot Jas
imports the variable so if you remember
correctly we just do it similarly that
we did before where you're going so far
what do we want to call it I'm gonna
call it greeting is equal to and then we
want to require that component
what's the component that we're
requiring it is greeting I think might
be dot slash free
all right there we go and then in a pas
add a greeting instance to the apps
render function immediately under h1 h1
with attribute name give reading
attribute name so in a pretty greedy
instance in the apps render function so
here we are in the apps render function
and we want it to be underneath the h1
h1 okay so what we want to do is just
create an instance of our component here
our green component and then we're gonna
get passed in a name here oh it doesn't
in the name with a name of name I think
this is Lotus awesome to see her name is
equal to name I don't think we have
passed it in the prop to the natural
hi their name I don't they ended that
correctly I did so right now we're just
hard coding this basically it's not
actually inheriting the prop quite yet
it's still prop it's just on inheriting
it like we would normally use for that
so or it is rather but we just haven't I
don't know why I didn't do it name so we
passed the prop from one component to
another access the prop from the
receiver and phony and rendered it so
now it's basically saying that we're
gonna be doing some more stuff with it
let's see here so select green ejs you
can see greedy now expects to props this
stuff props name this stuff signed in so
it's showing us this if statement here
is saying if our prop is equal to false
return go away else return this stuff
props me okay
so showing us how we can do a little bit
of logic here look at greenie until you
feel like you understand how it works
inside apps render function so let's go
and jump into app here a second prop of
signed-in in green okay so in green here
we're gonna go ahead and add a new prop
called signed in and then we're gonna
set this equal to and remember because
this is a boolean we are going to use
the brackets no quotes or set it equal
to false now when we set it equal to
false it's gonna change our text based
off that
when it finally runs yeah I guess so
when it's eco fossils they go away
perfect to which they say how rude I
mean honestly alright so a change in
value have signed in to make headline
display a friendly green greeting it's
just basically showing us we can set
this is a true now and it will it'll go
ahead and change it back now this this
example you probably have like
authentication token that would do this
but do something similar and it would
give you a value of thought
authentication it's correct and then you
would be able to display a message you
wouldn't hard code these things but the
principle behind it is valid all the
same
so you can also pass event handlers as
props as well so we're gonna look at our
talker Jaso vent handler is anything
like on click on hover any sort of thing
like that
so in talk Jas you'll notice right here
we have this on click this dot handle
event let's go ahead and jump into
talker Jas as we're instructed you'll
see it's going to output 10,000 blah
blah blah's and an alert now what we
want to do your great talk so this
properties object pass to react on
credit class so it tells us that oh hey
we can look at example Jas and you'll
see right here this is exactly how we do
it
this is handle oven so what we want to
do here they just say button on click is
equal to forever working this and then
the function so this dot we do that
incorrectly yes I did so I forgot we're
dealing with a function and not a string
so make sure you do the curly brackets
this dot talk I'm going to run that
so this button is passing in the prop on
click this top
if it runs eventually uh alright let's
go back here let's not handle event this
should be correct so here
talkers have a property named talk make
sure oh excuse me
we actually meant to put this in the
talker application so we're in the
render here
I believe that's what we needed to do
here let's look back yeah I see we pass
oh sorry is that what they want us to do
make sure that talks value is function
you know I think we got it right I
believe we were correct the first time
let's go ahead and throw this in here
real quick run it and then if it is
incorrect we'll go ahead and examine the
oh whoops all right so this is correct
what's going on here is that this is
outside of our function here whoops
sorry about that guys so what we we just
know we're all right now what we need to
do here is simply treat this like
anything else we would this so we're
gonna say talk colon and then we have a
function right BAM so remember our our
talker here is actually taking it has a
talk function that's a a parameter or
property rather and then we're passing
the on click event into here
there we go
so you want to pass talk down from there
to button I think we already did that so
it wants us to give it food is equilibar
inside talking gives a funny attribute
all right so foo is equal to bar to our
button so we're passing the bar prop any
prop so we're passing the the foo prop
that happens to be equal to bar here yo
y'all need to chill out on coke Academy
right now bro
eventually
so we're passing in at prop your goals
fast talk down without sugar attribute
me it really doesn't matter here's a
list of names that you can't use check
that out
most of them you'll probably already
know so we want to keep the attribute
the same but we want to change what
we're trying to do here to bar it looks
like
so just are you going to change the
parameter here the prop rather back to
talk
there we go and what should the
attribute values should be the
information you want to pass to a
different component that's basically
just saying this is what you're gonna
want to pass inside of the render
function changer at your value to talk
so we're simply gonna take change our
value bar here to be our sort of dynamic
value with this dot talk so we're just
passing in the function here so if we
change this blah to react is so great it
would say react is so great ten thousand
times
all right excuse me while I take some
pain pills for my wisdom teeth
just take one Tylenol
all right uh great you now pass a
function for from from talker down to
button all right
he goes over then you can on click on on
hover since you named you're actually
talking can pass down your you can
access your passed down function via
this doc props top in bunny is so
similarly how this is not talk in but
not J yes when we want to access that we
want to go ahead and assign it looks
like a on click that's going to be equal
to excuse me this dot props got talk
yes I'm still here cook out of me my way
if this doesn't happen to you I would
love to know it seems to happen to me
all day long why I'm doing this
in button - yes
you add an on-click attribute to the
renders function button
there we go all right last minute about
naming things when it has prop is you
just sue there's two names that you have
to choose the parent component class as
opponent component class defines a
function and passes along look at talker
GS on line six to eleven so we have the
art talk we chose the name it talked the
second name that you have to choose is
the profit of the name they will choose
to pass the event handler the same thing
is your attribute name the last exercise
in name was also talked as shown on line
14 these two names can be whatever they
do follow certain naming convention if
you're listening for a click event than
you you'll name your event handler
handle click if you're listening for a
key press event you'll name it handle
key press the prop name should be the
word on plus the same event type if
you're listening for a click event that
the prop is on click so it's basically
just telling you about the naming
convention so dr. Janice changes event
handlers name for talk to handle click
go ahead and run that
targets render function change the props
new props name from talk to on click go
ahead and pass in the on click like so
chase you're probably defect that I have
handle name is now this don't handle
click so this dot handle click we're
just changing our code a little bit here
and then we want to sleep button jeaious
it's expecting a prop name on click so
we need to go ahead and change the prop
and it's a name we're just gonna head to
change this on click kind of just
showcasing what we did really making it
known that if you change one thing
everything else has to change as well
it's typically the case of the
programming and then one major source of
confusions name on click a special
meeting but only on HTML like elements
I think this is just a lot of like
telling you what on-click means some
stuff so
go ahead run this and I think we're
probably done with this page if it ever
runs there we go
a lot of information here going on about
the naming convention and how what it
means it's just an arbitrary event name
it doesn't actually do anything special
because we're dealing with JSF
doo-doo-doo-doo alright so every
components props has an object named
children this stop props what children
returned everything in between the
Konitz opening and closing JSX JSX tax
so this stop props children love a blob
of the block alright so what's going on
here is in our list is where you want to
output some stuff so we're gonna be
rendering some some things here yeah
alright so when we run this you'll see
that we have two lists titles
if it overruns
so you're gonna see two titles here well
you're not actually gonna see anything
else that's gonna be part of the problem
so here's our title here I don't really
know
yeah here so these are our H ones but in
our UL here
we're not displaying anything now if we
want to get all their children we would
display it like this this top profs dot
children so now when we run this it's
gonna get the children of the parent
element and go ahead and output this so
you'll be using this a lot it kind of
goes owner parent children and owners
kind of a new thing in terms of how to
think about things well it's really just
one level above so here we have here are
two favorite musicians and it just kind
of gives us a little bit more
but it's basically taking the children
of this array and then outputting it
that's what's going on right now all
right take a look at the button
component class here we are the only
passing any text is a button nothing
happens here so this is our text this
stuff props text but we don't have a no
one's passing a prop in so it's just
being displayed as a blank but now
giving us a lot of stuff so let's go and
run this and you'll see that what a sad
Texas button
there you go now inside of the object
pass to react crate class so inside here
is that our component we wanted to find
a function all right we now I do that so
we're going to define a default prompt
this is a function and this is something
for what I've been told you do quite
often in case of a prop isn't passing
you'll have these default prop functions
so we're gonna go ahead and set text
this text our text is equal to I am a
button it's better run that now this
will be overridden if we actually pass
in a value so this text only inherits
the text prop inherits this default
record before them fun to get default
props
that's a function if you just separate
render with a comma okay Oh whoopsies
so we actually need to return this I
don't know why setting as a variable so
returning this and we're just returning
a key value pair here called tense so
it's gonna be the same as our as our as
our problem there we go
I made this same mistake last time
but now when we go ahead and given give
our button component and react up wrong
don't react don'tdon't render we go
ahead and save text is equal to and
we're going to make it an empty button
again making it sad again as they say so
when you assign a prop in the component
this will always override any default
values that you have in here so like I
said there's a ton of stuff in here we
kind of place through it a little bit I
probably need to review the event
handler aspect of it a little bit more
but uh basically the things to take away
is that when you assign a prop in the
render it takes it takes over the if
there's a default value you can assign
default values and that you can pass in
props from component to component and
the thing to keep in mind is you have to
use the same name and then each parent
element has children elements you can
access as well so lots of lots of stuff
in this this last one and up next we're
gonna be moving on to something called
this state which I use today in a free
code camp project to use the AP and API
project and it was difficult so that was
with api's I don't know if this is gonna
