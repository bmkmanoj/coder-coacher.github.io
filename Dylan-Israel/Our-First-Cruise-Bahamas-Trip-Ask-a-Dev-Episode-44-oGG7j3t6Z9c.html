trip our cruise April I treated
ourselves to a little Groupon we saw
where we got to go on a two night short
cruise to the Bahamas it was I believe
like four hundred and fifty dollars
total so not too much but uh you know we
have an up until recently haven't taken
a vacation in five years so it's nice
that we're able to do these things and
part of the reason you know I do these
weekend things this one because even as
an employee developer you know I get 14
PTO days that's like a day and it even
even that which is probably more than
most still not that much time off you
think about it for 356 days you know I
think 250 you work right so yeah so I
try to do shorter trips and one of the
reasons that we take them is I have a
tendency to burn out it's always been an
issue of mine being someone who is not
happy with where they are in terms of
YouTube in terms of their their income
in terms of their career
so you folk I at least in my case I
focus so hard on working on these things
and getting to where I want to be that
sometimes before I know it I burn out
and so April makes me take Saturdays and
spend time with her and so like that but
I don't think that we do is uh we take
these short trips and this Bahama cruise
is one of them so I hope you guys enjoy
it
see a little bit of our first cruise
together neither of us has been ever
been on a cruise and it was pretty good
experience I think I'd go on a cruise
again just a nicer one at the end up
into who day well it was fun I hope you
guys to enjoy it enough if you you know
have any cruise horror stories leave
them in the comments below
we're live okay so
we're on our way down to Miami to board
the cruise ship I just got my finger
surgery I'll show it after this just a
heads up can be pretty graphic until
like 1:00 and not surgery but Bernie
burned in a like this playing in it in
an hour
on our way hopefully going to be an
uneventful but a quick three and half
hour drug plan
all right we're looking for you one one
four is this it right here I think this
is it they're supposed to be something
in the door all right baby
so we're in our room we got it I can
open that hard yeah we have a
state-of-the-art flat-screen not
philosophy and curved screen this is
vintage maybe you want to show everybody
our view yeah sure it's a really great
abuse saves at all yeah just I love it
hey we should necks I bring a poster mmm
all right let's check out the bathroom
hey I like other space so I'm gonna huh
and showers not too bad it really does
remind me of just a bigger version on my
dad's boat
they give it like a nice day like
Bahamas mamas
so you don't think when you drink it
it's one of the cooler things about the
cruise ship is they have complimentary
room service now there's only a few
items so you can see we got cheese
platter a vegetarian sandwich and a
turkey club sandwich for other than the
$3.00 delivery charge
pretty dope to get the free room service
yeah
so the sign set teens only but I'm a big
adult so
this is an example one of the ports that
you can pull into from Florida it's only
about 55 miles to jump up both you
pretty much ago the Bahamas whenever you
want which is pretty cool
all right so let's look at some of the
pictures at April and I have from our
trip here um oh by the way I spoiler
warning uh uh I said earlier I was going
to show off some of the what happened to
my finger here so this is from that day
right this is before we leave for the
trip here we have to burn it off as
before I got the surgery this was just
my weekly burn session I did for about a
month very very pleasant uh-oh
see what else chill accent in our super
fancy room here high school had a really
good time on this it was a nice
experience so when we got on there April
for the first day you can see she's
holding my monster there as I take a
picture April for the first day is
actually nauseous on the boat
unfortunately so we had to go outside
and shed to kind of recover see what
else
Debbie neon light glasses that people
were buying like the one weird thing
about the cruise was that everything was
an upsell they were trying to get you to
buy so much stuff in it to be honest I
spent more on the boat and while I was
on the crew so I spent about $450 for
the entire for April and I total to go
on there and between I got April to spa
treatments and you know we bought a few
caffeinated beverages
and we got a fine dining experience sort
of thing a six-course meal i'll show
pictures on a second i spent about $400
on that so i guess almost as much so in
total the trip cost about 850 bucks for
the two of us
luckily let's see where are we uh oh and
we also played that includes bingo as
well so we spent 60 bucks on two nights
of bingo total so we didn't win anything
I never win anything at bingo I know I
play other than fact that they were
doing big on a cruise there's a you
might recognize some of these from the
thumbnails askin stuff so I just take
pictures wherever I go places now for
thumbnails April with her that's her
boat hat right there she's very happy
about that boat how it almost flew away
four times taking a picture on the tour
bus so some of the video you saw was us
on the tour bus so that was a really
good time we got these things uh there
it was like a lobster conch this is on
the island in the Bahamas
we're like like one of the delicacies
there is that this conch meat which is
like the shell meat and sometimes a
deep-fried so that it's a combination of
that and lobster that we got this is me
well that's the bad picture let's get
another one this one's a much better
picture which is also used as a
thumbnail but uh that is when I uh
April was really worried at this point
because I was down us about I was down
seven hundred dollars and I brought it
back I ended up making $500 to the trip
so it was about to be a much more
expensive trip than I you said that I
intended let's go ahead and see if
there's any so this was our like
appetizer
pretty fancy we never go to fancy
dinners like this but I always try to
treat April when we do go places because
I'm hard to put up with that's the
honest about truth is I am a pain in the
ass at times and I have my faults and so
that's why i you know i got her the spa
treatments because
you know she was there when we couldn't
afford them massage each other's back
like but uh so this was this was
interesting then I got alright so a lot
of the on the menu I didn't even
know what I was ordering this is like
some uncooked beef ah is actually really
good April got some like a shrimp
cocktail and by the way that bottle of
sparkling water didn't wasn't included
with everything they had to go ahead and
get that and cuz of it was like 20
bucks I am I'm no I'm not I'm not bitter
or anything uh then we had she she got a
nice who is this this was a tomato so
that red is actually tomato mushroom
mozzarella appetizer nice little Caesar
salad and this was the main making
anything so funny thing here is April
got filet mignon and I got steak right
and I'm eating this on like Dan this is
so good
and it was it was delicious you know so
even though our sights were correct they
actually mixed up our stuff and April
was complaining the whole time how hers
was overcooked this like this and
so we ended up having to switch and I
was needed hairiest
the whole time and then hers was much
better than mine with an apricot
cheesecake and a cheese platter for
dessert and then a little bit of the
winnings and we ended up going to a
comedy show although I don't think I
actually got a picture it was pretty
good I enjoyed myself but all in all
that was our trip and it was nice man
it'd been a our last trip we went to
Cuban let me tell you I promised her for
how bad of an experience I was I would
take her somewhere else and that's kind
of how the trip came about uh so Cuba
was a little bit rough I'm glad we went
glad we survived but it was it was a
rough experience that was more of a
learning experience than it was a
relaxing let's get back to our feet
vacation experience but I had fun all
the same so the mall was great I wish I
know so reflecting upon cruises
if I'm lucky enough to be that
financially able to I'd love to go on a
much longer cruise and the two days was
kind of not enough he's a good
experience I couldn't believe how much
money I spent on the actual boat and I
wish I had a picture of April's face
because the lowest point I ever got I
brought so guys I am I don't gamble
often I've gambled about twice this year
in a year
i gamble when I go on vacation so that's
kind of how I justify gambling okay
we're on vacation with Stefan I brought
a thousand dollars to spend on this trip
and not to gamble with and spend and so
there was a moment where I was down nine
hundred dollars and I was down to my
last hundred dollars and April was
sitting next to me quiet and as still as
I I don't know if I've ever seen her so
scared that we were about to lose a
month's worth around is why you should
gamble by the way um and if you do
gamble be be aware that that you know it
if you gamble only what you can afford
to lose I guess is what I'm trying to
say is that if you bring a thousand
dollars like I did you that should of
course no way affect your lifestyle you
should no way affect that your bills
being paid and things like that so that
money I took with me was for us to treat
ourselves and me to treat her and I just
happen to almost gamble it away but
there I that was that would be the
picture that I wish I had from this trip
was the sheer shock and disbelief of
 Dillon like I said I wasn't
looking I Raceland Elena it was a great
trip I had a lot of fun I it was sad to
see the Bahamas was so ravaged by the
like a you don't really see too much in
there but a lot of the islands up
at least a Grand Bahamas island because
they got hit with like three hurricanes
in ten years and it just destroyed a lot
of the islands a lot of the businesses
are shut down but all-in-all I really
enjoyed my the cruise the tour
the food was good I definitely would go
on another cruise if I can yeah just you
said just a reminder not to get burnt
out in the process of life and and when
you can do take those trips to do reward
yourself because you may not always be
able to do that and you know the
memories are good things to have because
they keep you focused and they remind
you of how great things are when you
when when they don't feel like life is
all that great so just stay focused stay
motivated guys I appreciate you all
