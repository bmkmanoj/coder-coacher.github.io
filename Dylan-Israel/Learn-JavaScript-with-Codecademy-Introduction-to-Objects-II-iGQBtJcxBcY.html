objects to introduction to objects too
so let's get started here finish the
James object by adding properties to it
so you can see you've down below we have
some properties his job should be
programmer and married should be set to
false so person vari james so we're
gonna set job to programmer and we are
going to set married to the boolean
false now it wants to secrete a new gabi
object using the person constructor so
we'll say hard Gaby equals purse take a
new person and we're going to set the
name just our job a student and set her
married status is true problem with my
syntax there we go
so just three different ways you
basically do the same thing okay and
speak method to the person constructor
this dot so we're adding a speak method
to the person constructor so we need to
do it in the actual class so we're gonna
say this dot speak equals function and
this function is going to do some stuff
what is it going to do whenever you
speak is called it should console dot
log hello exclamation point
BAM there it is user dot speak hello
take a look at the partially defined
James object complete the speak method
such at the last two lines editor will
cause hello I'm feeling great and how
long I'm feeling just okay do you print
it in the console so let's see here
speak then we have a function apparently
this is a different way to define a
function so get a hand here
out of parameter such as made between
the parentheses the speak method should
be directly print to the console and not
return anything so let's do it like this
it doesn't want us to take parameter all
right so we'll put mood and then we'll
say if that's mode if all right so we're
gonna say if mood is equal equal to
great we want it to do some stuff so
console dot log and we want it to do
hello I'm feeling great
else console dot log hello I am feeling
just okay and just to note that this
should work but we probably would want
to put just okay if we were actually
writing this out
and another elsif statement or another
if statement rather because we don't
have a really a default statement for
this we should but that's not the
default one so you know take a look at
at the James object completes a job with
DeSoto I'll print out the console ha I
work mmm hi I work at so let's include
our I work a say let's include our job
here so we're gonna have it console dot
log and it's gonna say hi I work as
whoops that's not what we want to do we
do first job
then on line 14 change the job for James
to super programmer so we're gonna say
James job and then we're gonna put
equals super programmer it's the same
Smith hi I work as undefined
I work as a program
okay so apparently you don't want us to
do it like that
let's see if this works
there we go I think the original issue
was just the spacing right there so you
can see originally goes how I work as a
programmer and then when we change his
job super programmer how I work as a
super programmer take advantage of the
abilities variables with bracket
notation in line 7 set a property string
for the first property in James I you
good job property so line 7 a property
we're gonna say this is equal to the job
properties so we're gonna see a property
Ziggler chainsaw job and then it's gonna
say then print James job using bracket
notation and a property so console.log a
property I think that's what they're
asking
did you do you have a variable a
property between brackets
so I think I may have declare this
differently than how they wanted so
we're gonna do it like this James and
quotations Jacques for the bracket
notation you have a variability property
between brackets set the first property
name of James
so I'm not sure what they're asking here
I let's see here
racking notation
so far my property of property so let's
go to the Q&amp;amp;A for him let's see what
exactly they're asking here so we were
on section five so let's go ahead and
pick
so see here fire james VAR a property
equals job okay so they wanted us to do
it a little bit different so what we're
basically gonna do here is set a
property we're gonna take the this job
keyword and then we're not actually
gonna call a property where called james
bracket property i don't know why you'd
do this but it just seems to me like
more work today what are you gonna do
i saw in lines three to six we have an
object a number and a string in that
order complete lines seven to nine so
they'll print appropriate types of
variables print should print object
should print number should print string
what all right uh so that number the
string
object
now let's just see if this works I think
we're gonna have to call that job I am
an object my name is string make sure
you completed the console dot log
statements correctly and let's save that
job see if that that's what they want
use the type of iterator so in this
first one apparently
what's the type of operator notice it
just want me of a single variable
nothing else for instance
okay so this is basically just the type
of it's just telling you that's why I
was reading this is a little bit weird
yeah what type of object it is so we
have an object a number in a string
that's basically all the type of does so
you should finish my object by giving it
a name property all right
make sure that my objects the last sign
will hurt false and I won't give it
we'll just call it Pizza poker guy and
it doesn't so this is my object has its
own property and it's we're checking
doesn't have a name yes does have a
nickname no so that's false
remove the console dot log statement
write an if statement that checks to see
if suitcase has short straw for me if
suitcase dot was it as own property and
then do we set it how do we said it I
think it was probably in brackets here
there's own property shorts do some
stuff
turn true
so if sue gets the last Shores secretly
go to true you want to do some stuff
what is it that we want to do we want to
console dot log suitcase dot shorts
then if you're saying we've always false
set the shorts property anyone else
suitcase shorts equal
booty shorts I don't know why it's the
only thing I can think of right now so
see if this works there's a problem with
Dirac syntax so let's see here
so if suitcase has on prop for me so
let's go back because I wasn't sure
about how they declared it so I did
single quotes shouldn't matter though
just go back object
suitcase on property shorts we don't
need this equally close to true
so suitcase as it has the property
shorts
and that's equal to goes true
console.log suitcase shorts el suitcase
that shorts is equal to booty shorts so
where are we messing up here
have his own property
unexpected token else
oh you know what there we go our
brackets are off so suitcase uh short
equals booty shorts
now reasonable I need to set this true
as it's checking if it's true by default
I use a Ford - in loop so print out the
properties of alright so we're gonna say
4 I'm gonna say variable i for VAR i in
our object here and we're gonna say
console.log i yeah this should be good
and then it goes through each iteration
and you get all our values here where
this actually gets the key
right another for in loop but this time
for the value of each property in NYC
alright so we're gonna say for our value
and NYC console dot log I'll see my C
value
and I think this will work object it's
not a function all right
they're real just use the wrong bracket
so you see right here once we put in the
value which is this our full-name mayor
and in the bracket notational then
actually go and get what we're looking
for make your own class circle all right
by building a constructor for it so
we'll say our circle equals the new
object it's gonna have one property
radius and then we'll say take one
argument for the initial radius
oops alright so I tried to we have to
create circle for so before we create an
object I was creating object we actually
need to create the circle so function
circle it's gonna have radius and then
we're just gonna say this dot radius
equals our radius I think they may want
us to actually declare a radius for I
don't know this works so to fix this
start add line 15 add a bark method for
the Snoopy object so we have Snoopy new
dog beagle buddied up bark you just you
can make it just like the bark method
for buddy or typing whatever you want
for noise a sort of wolf so basically we
just need to create a bark method so
we're gonna have Snoopy dot bark we're
gonna say for this object Snoopy or
better yet I'm not sure this will work
cuz it's not what they're asking we can
actually probably say this dot bark and
we can do it in the superclass so this
stuff bark equals function
and we want it to console dot log woof
so it's gonna say mr. Matt and bam it
works so what basically happened here we
could also have done it this way but
instead we did it in the superclass dog
which Snoopy is a dog and that way this
still works you could also have just
write wrote a custom function that works
that would work only for Snoopy make a
person called me with your own name and
age print your name using print person
name so we want to create a new person
so we're gonna say I save our me equals
new person and then we're gonna say
pizza poker guy and we're gonna say age
27 and then we're gonna call on print
person name and we're gonna put me in
there as the parameter and it should
print out my information me it's not
define me as a lowercase BAM there we go
it only prints up the name so up cuz
they only ask for than you okay so
everything's working click and move on
so this is just kind of showing us what
we were working on I take a look at it
if you need to review it
adding the L method to the cat prototype
so that all cats can me out this is what
we did with the barks we're gonna say
this dot you know equals the function it
looks like it doesn't take any
parameters and then in here we are going
to console dot log
meow and then call this method on for
each cat so we have a chess tire and a
Gary its are gonna Shire seems like a
weird name for a cat but you know
whatever
Gary yeah and we're good
so those are two meows so let's see here
we are creating a class called animal
alright so hi there guys like what do we
start with psyche so we have function
animal
is to be capitalized function animal has
two parameters name and legs out num
legs so this dot name equals name this
dot numb legs with numb legs and what
else
next change the prototype of animal and
add a method called say name
prototype all right
let's look at an example here so dog dot
prototype dog bark equals function so we
are gonna say animal dot proto type dot
why don't we what we want to name it say
name and then this is a new function is
it taking any parameters
and we are going to say console.log
hi my name is
hmm so let's take out name the brackets
around name unexpected token
so if animals our prototype equals
Oh penguin let's see if that changes it
No
and one dot prototype dots a name equals
hmm so it looks like weird unless we
need this semicolon
and now I think we may have made mistake
here okay so let's go ahead and take a
look at some of the Z actually let's see
if this works I don't think it will all
right so let's go ahead and take a look
at the forum see what's going on here
so we were on 16
oh is it this dot name okay that makes
sense I think that's what's going on
here no
all right so we had a missing bracket
here we need a semicolon there we've
seen this after argument list missing
after argument list hmm so let's go back
and look at this example here
so this got named numb legs function
animal dot prototype dice a name comes
along this dot name bar penguin
all right so let's see
soon after argument was
it's not name equals name
name them legs we have function it looks
like that's correct
hi my name is I don't know why we have
this plus here it's not the air we're
getting though so this is oh it might be
 we put the plus in the wrong spot
there we go
hi my name is Captain cut little syntax
mistakes always hit you right so create
a brand new penguin class constructor
starting on line 11 so here we are gonna
say what do we name
so we're gonna say far
so we're gonna set it equal to new
penguin what so small bird equals new
penguin
so it's an animal so I should have have
a name we'll just call it calm flight
I'm know why and the number of legs are
two and girona don't so still include
the animal if it's very same name with
last few lion sister so cannot say name
and then we'll do small bird same name
make sure you properly define the
penguin constructor
penguin is not defined
barri the company goes into pain one
yes all right
oh maybe we need to create a same name
so we'll say England
what am i doing around here alright so
we need to create a same name method for
penguin so I thought we could inherit I
guess we're creating a new penguin
therefore we can't inherit it
so let's go ahead and copy this real
quick so we don't make any typos
I've been angling to make sure you
probably defined the penguin constructor
okay so let's go real quick cuz
obviously something's not clicking in my
brain here we are on 17 of 20
here's 17 of 30 rather
all right it's cold marching penguins
oh I think I want us to create a whole
new so let's do this so we're going to
have bar angling and excuse me function
ah
all right so function pain Glyn it's
gonna have a name numb legs and then we
are going to say just dot name equals
name this dot dot legs numb legs and now
let's see what's going on here here's
the message can I read properties say
name of undefined
let's do it like this let's say this dot
say name equals function in our function
we want it to console dot log and then
we can just go ahead and do it like so
make sure you properly define the
penguin duh prototype the city okay so
they don't want us to do it like that so
we have this
we have penguin here's the message can I
read property say name function comes
along looks like the air here's a
message type
can I read property say name of
undefined
hmm
oh we deleted our small birds so let's
create a new penguin object so our small
bird equals new penguin and then bird I
don't have two legs I believe it should
work now there we go
hi my name is Bert stumbled a little bit
there I thought we were gonna be using
the animal class when it looked like we
you're just using as an example that's
all
alright so create a new penguin class
alright just did that so function
penguin from there we want to give it
some parameters should only take a name
parameter okay
so we're gonna say this town name it
goes name and so if we're gonna say this
dot numb legs we're basically
hard-coding that all paying with sexy
legs so we don't need to put in there
and people shouldn't be able to change
that
all right and so we want to set the
Penguins class all right so we're gonna
say penguin dot prototype is equal to a
new animal
so we're basically saying I believe
we're saying that the penguin is just a
class below animal cool we didn't
actually do anything with it so create a
penguin object names of penguin and have
them call the same name so basically
we're gonna be calm yet because we're
saying that penguin is a prototype of
animal we can now call upon the same
name function of animal so let's create
a penguin
so our small bird equals okay new
penguin in there we're gonna give it a
name so bird one and that's all we're
gonna give it it's gonna now we're gonna
say penguin thing called penguin Oh name
it penguin rather so penguin
stop saying name and as I say prepare to
be amazed
damn it all right uh
after your code from last time Korea
object called penguin
that's a cute all right there we go I
now be amazed
all right create an emperor class and
make it inherit from penguin
all right so function am cur gonna take
a single parameter name I'm say this dot
name because name and then we want to
say the prototype it was a penguin dot
prototype he goes yeah new animal there
we go so so ah
so we're gonna say Emperor dot prototype
equals new penguin
we have to put the brackets yes
all right so I now create an emperor
object and print the number of likes it
has so now that it's inheriting this the
number of lakes we should be able to
print it out so far they want us to name
it grand new emperor object instance to
any naming like test so our test it goes
new and Emperor no just put its
photograph GPG and now we want to
console log out test dot numb legs and
this should give us the number two BAM
amazing all right uh let's see how going
up the prototype chain works we were
justifying some classes inheritance
patterns Emperor inherits from penguin
Chand herons from animal please without
modifying any other lines
22:24 completely console log statements
appropriate responses should print
waddle-waddle so where's waddle waddle
so in this case we want to print out
so we have it one my Emperor so I am per
dot sane and then should print two and
then we're gonna say my and per dot numb
legs
now we're gonna say my emperor dot is
alive let's see if this works
cool lot of waddle - and true basically
it's just saying that penguin it's a
prototype of animal an emperor is a
prototype of penguin therefore emperor
is a prototype of animal meaning that
even though we're creating an emperor
which we can access all these other
functions declare a third variable
called my age my age uses a star the age
of john of the john objects of john dot
age cool so it looks like we're gonna be
doing a little bit of review real quick
so create object gilliam using the
person constructor so far John equals a
new person now we'll just set his name
to PPG and instead of 27 next try to
print his bank balance so so john dot
bank console dot log
john dot bank-balance and this should
print out 7,500 I'm fine
hmm
we're able to access it but it was
undefined that's interesting so have we
included some liquor from last time but
we have added meds at all called get
balanced then on line 17 modified get
balanced later turns bank balance so
this guy get balanced equals function
you'll return this dot bank balance
actually I think we understood bank
balance so I returned bank balance then
on line 17 cranny very well call my
balance so are my balance instead of to
John's bank balance so John got good
balance
and print my bounce so my 14 should
print undefined it says so we want a
console.log my balance so we should get
undefined and then we should get 7500
private methods create a method called
ask teller so function ask Taylor
without within the person class let's go
back so so you have far
that's teller equals function
what is the person of their choice or
return balance I said so return return
balance
this means that it returns to method
itself and not the result of calling
that method so you should not have
parenthesis after return balance okay
ah because a stellar returns a method we
need to call it to make it to make it
any use this is what far my balance
equals my balance method so save us a
Steller's not a function
all right so we have an axe
your menses should resemble how we
defined get balance last time you should
use this dot ask teller okay so it's
we're not actually creating a function
it sounds like so this not a stellar
don't declare a stellar with the
variable okay
create a new variable create a new
variable called my balance
so bar my balance that calls a stellar
with the password one two three four
we need to call it on a class so we're
gonna call it on John can't just call
the a stellar the way if it doesn't know
what this is class specific examine the
languages object three properties are
stirring whereas one is a number use a
foreign loop to print out three ways to
say hello so for our value in languages
check to see if the property values the
string will say if I don't remember
there was the see here if Tyco buff so
if typeof is equal to a string console
dot log languages bracket value and that
should give us hello Bonjour and hola
double equals thanks fix-it token
so if typeof value
looks like you printed for when you
shouldn't have
okay why did we print four
there we go because there's evaluating
the English French not a language when
Anita evaluate that so there's our hello
Bonjour Ola I have to say hello method
to the dog class so this dot say hello
April's function
now by extending its prototype take that
out of there so we're gonna say dog dot
proto type stop say hello equals
function
and then within here we're gonna console
that log
hello this is plus
let's read this stop read + dog and that
shirt
let's go to retriever in fears you say
element that's in property lock console
hello this is uh free
oh and a space there we go
first let's see what type of object
prototype is do this in line 2 and save
it to your prototype tree so
our prototype and let's say object dot
nice let's first see what type object up
prototype is alright so all they're
asking if it goes well you should
realize the object further site itself
is object and since all objects have its
own property it's pretty easy to check
if you listen line six and bar has on
so proto type type dot has own property
let's see here
are we checking the prototype type and
it has its own property see with the
object proto's we should use type of
object prototype
and I'm just gonna look this up this is
confusing me it looks like they want us
to run circles around this and that was
line 29 so mad at I can't take is out
what really listen to me all right
apparently I'm not the only one I
thought this was obnoxious
so type of object on prototype okay
that's what they were saying in the
example so we're gonna find out what
type of object it is here there we go
so type of object I approach I have is
object and then it's gonna return true
because I guess it has an object
property I'm not really sure like I said
it looks like it's just gonna shine
through us in loops really understand
that what's going on in the background
she won't spend more time on that I
could really care less about it on the
personal level so now modify the student
report class to that no grades will be
printed on the console in the floor in
loop
however it gets UPI should still
function properly and last line modify
the student report so that no grades
will be printed to the console for the
for in loop
they just want us to change it you
should be changing public variables this
decade
let's see what happens when you run this
so wha-ha-ha four to one the overall GPA
is 223 only a single thing should be
locked to the console
overall GPS okay so we only want to log
we want to make
so we don't want the student report you
just take that out it still logs it
properly it says that make sure that
grades 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 are private so let's I
don't remember how to make them private
so let's look that up real quick
apparently this guy doesn't good
all right so I don't understand the
plane this either let's see what's going
on here so we have all right we return
this this is fine we have a new report
she's good and copy this and see what
the difference is because I can't see it
naturally so let's get everything back
in there all right so we still have our
function we still have our grades so he
changed these two variables oh this
makes us so that can't be accessed
that's smart
okay so that's what we need to do so
when we do this this becomes public I
guess when we want to do it private so
see if we just I think we can give her
this for loop and we'll just do some
changes of cars so that they're private
and the only thing public will be that
this got get get GPA make sure to modify
the provided code so let's go ahead and
just cut this out
and we'll just put the farther back up
there
alright I'm just bringing this in here
I'm done with this one right now let's
see here I still don't understand what
what's going on here so we changed these
the variables so they're public you
still shouldn't be able to get out so in
here we have this that's just our for
loop we're saying a student who are in
type of it's not equal to a function
hmm this his work so it's just this
example code to see what's going on here
so that works
okay well I have to come back and look
at this another time but so far we
finished our introduction to objects to
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
