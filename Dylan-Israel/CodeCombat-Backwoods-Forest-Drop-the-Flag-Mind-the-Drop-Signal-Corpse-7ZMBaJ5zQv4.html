backing in code combat in the backwoods
forest let's go ahead and jump in spend
a while since I've played this see what
we got
jump right in so we wanted to feat all
the Eggers with traps so before and
collect all the coins so before using
pick up flag use build XY to build a
fire trap at the flags position a coin
like fly all right cool so we have a
wall loop we're saying if the flag build
at sea here here it up build XY fire
trap and let's go ahead and look at the
documentation real quick this has been a
moment
and let's go ahead and look at flag real
quick hmm flag X is not defined so we go
ahead and create a variable here called
the VAR flag X is equal to flag dot
let's see flag top position dot X dot X
and then our flag Y is equal to flag dot
position dot Y let's go ahead and run
this to see it some of this oops I gotta
turn the sound on which is where there
you go let's zoom in a little bit
trying to make the map a little bit
bigger
so we want the flag
alright let's a minute and drop a flag
at suji
so it looks like we have an
automatically setup our wallet to
collect coins
build traps and move to location
kind of preempt the traps looks like we
can build a couple that time no no I
don't think we're gonna get there in
time all right so we made a mistake
there we got to submit it one more time
and we just got to build the traps
proactively with the way our logic is
setup
now we'll use multiple flags here so we
can queue them up oops and also we don't
want to kill our self like that with the
traps
Oh No oh my god they worked I thought we
were gonna walk on the chopping block
heckle let's continue on see what else
we got up in store for us next we are
mind the trap for the win so it looks
like we have to flip this
it has attacking cleave so we're
probably gonna have to use leave quite
often so you slags just so you don't run
over the mind okay so pick up the flag
so we're gonna say hero dot move X Y in
a save time we're not going to straight
variables we're gonna say flag dot flip
position dot X in flag dot the position
dot Y basically get the x position x
coordinate get the Y and coordinate then
we're gonna say if the distance let's
see how do we do distance again
it's the if/else well five never sent me
so fine there's enemy
so just simple so if there's an enemy
and if a nested-if statement
so if there is an enemy and if arrow dot
find nearest is a fine nearest enemy
actually
we won't find the distance to so you see
right here we have a nice thing let's
create a variable actually since this is
getting a little complicated so we'll
call this VAR distance we can follow the
example right all the documentation and
then we're gonna say if you distance is
equal to the hero dot distance to the
enemy that we are defining so here we're
checking this and we're gonna pass in
distance as our gift parameter we're
saying like if the distance that's exist
but we want it B is less than 10 hero
dot attack the enemy it's gonna submit
this and see what happens
modesty
so it looks like oh it looks like we we
forgot to pick up a flag let's see here
pick up flag okay so we get rid of us
here at us saying we're gonna say
instead hero dot pick a flag and we're
gonna pass flag in there and then we're
saying if just since and I'm gonna do if
cleave look at the documentation right
now we're say like if the heroes and
we're calling is ready and what what
does this mean we're basically seeing if
our cleave attack is ready and then
and then why our else statement here so
if it's not ready but an enemy exists go
ahead and just attack in your Sena me if
it is ready go ahead and cleave this
guy's and submit this I think this
should be it now
go ahead and go right in the middle of
it and let's continue on to signal
course for the win so we want to defeat
the ogres let's see what we need to do
for this use different colored flags
until you're tell--you're here to run
and cleave alright so if the green flag
is go ahead and pick it up and so that's
gonna move our guy and pick up the flag
so pick up the flag moves it so we don't
have to find fly and pick up like a same
thing and then else if it's black and
it's ready to cleave go ahead and cleave
so we're gonna go ahead so you see we're
doing and uh two two statements if the
flag is black and it's ready to cleave
so we're gonna say here o dot leave and
at this point I believe we can just
cleave in general was just some cleaver
around and then else nearest is the
actually a let's go ahead and pass it in
the nearest enemy since is already set
up for us and then we want to else
attack if the distance is less than ten
and cleave isn't ready in this case we
will say hero
attack and almost eight nearest I
believe this is it we just have to do it
correctly now so we have G was just move
and B which is black
so I just got murked oh so let's go
ahead and so I think our logic was okay
I think the guy just got stuck on trying
to attack a single guys let's go back
and see if we can buy an item so we have
four thousand five hundred fifty six and
it looks like at the end of the day we
were just gonna interact by some stuff I
think are damaged okay I just think we
need to be a little tank
I'm not ready for that
riveted chainmail and let's let's it's
been a while so so put this in
perspective for the win how much help do
we have how we check that so we are a
warrior I'll just throw as let's see
I'm not gonna toast the staff so we lack
arena travel version there we go
warrior
little-ass pretty good maybe we should
buy the most badass ID we can get which
looks
Isis the dragon play let's go ahead and
equipped our dragon plate let's go back
into this real quick for the win and so
our previous chest plate gave us 50 HP
so we're about to get so tanky all right
let's see what we can do here boys and
girls for the 10% of you that are moving
and our code should be already good to
go there now tanked up a little bit so
black is to cleave greenest so go ahead
and
here we change our car yeah this is more
game stuff my good stuff
so our logic was good I'm like the
desert world if you're strong enough
like I'm right here or the wind yes all
ogres collect all the coins all right
cool
oh I think we're actually a good place
to stop we'll continue on in the next
