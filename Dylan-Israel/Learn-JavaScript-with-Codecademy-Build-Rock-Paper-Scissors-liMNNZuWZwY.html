making a rock-paper-scissors
classic two-player game so everyone
should know the rules of
rock-paper-scissors so it should be
pretty easy to understand logically what
we need to do so in this case we need to
declare a variable called user choice
alright so just let's say to make a
global variable so we're not going to do
we don't actually do anything with it
we're just being input so far so the
next thing clear variable called
computer choice and make it equal to
math dot random you're not familiar with
math dot random and Java generates a
random number usually takes some
parameters we'll see here it goes print
out a few choices I can see I'm at sup
I'm gonna work so we're gonna call
console.log and then we're going to call
it computer choice step isn't mean for
the game just useful for learning okay
so we'll say a rock ok and then you can
see that it prints out a random number
in this case it looks like it somewhere
between 0.99 and all right so yeah it
looks like it's between 1 and 1 and 0 if
without parameters a nap so under your
existing program if-elsif-else statement
if
so in this case so if computer choice
so yes computer choice and if you use an
all right so if computer choice is
greater than point three three point six
seven six six actually if this is Java
this is probably not there we go
I else computer choice for everything
else because we've coverage basis is
equal to our semicolon and let's save
some code
I choose paper and it seems like it's
working so next we're using the compare
function we carried out real code from
the previous section but it is a comment
leave it there for now all right so
we're not going to use that so below the
comment declare function call compare
we're gonna say choice one comma choice
inside this function if statement if
this one is exactly alright
fixer okay inside our compare function
under the existing code writing else if
we wanted to do something else
I'm sure you brackets right
and inside the else's statement right an
if statement
if choice two is equal equal scissors
the turn wins else turn paper all right
so we got a lot of brackets you if
you're curious if you did it right you
can always click on it and so you see
right here these ending practice match
up so it should work
all right there's a problem with our
syntax all right so
choice along is equal to choice to
return there's always a time good let's
face is out so we just see your stuff so
choice one choice too all right so that
looks right elsif space out choice one
is equal to rock if your choice two is
equal to scissors you want to return
Rockland's else return paper ones
so let's throw it so I call and see if
that fixes it I don't think it will
choice 1 is equal to chose 2
Brooklyn's paper or hands okay
so that goes like that
all right so
we need to think what what you need to
do here was to take our bracket out we
didn't actually want it in this house
I see is it what's it
okay so let's go to the forums see what
we're doing around here it's probably
some simple air
I was a very helpful keep it going
what's the name of the section build
rock-paper-scissors
all right choice we're gonna take one
more look
we have if choice 2 is equal to 6
else return paper once what is going on
here
all right let's alright looks like we
are missing the bracket I'm not quite
sure what they show us but at least we
understood the concept to a degree so
inside the compare function under the
existing code right now the else's
statement where the condition is choices
going to be
I'll sit choice to do some stuff in this
case paper
so it's also right if statement so if
choice and everything all right under
your own code using the same structure
as a fast to exercise finish off your
function we need to use variables use
your choice a computer choice uncomment
the first lines of code by deleting so
you do multi-line start slash slash call
your function
so we want to call our function and pass
them use your choice of a previous cell
in this case our function if you
remember way back when we started this
compare and will probably use your
choice
let's go papers shooter goes rock
so we got all the way here we did it we
finished our rock-paper-scissors game
and only about 39 lines of code go
scissors this time the result is a time
so greater when scissors pyrolysis I
share it as always and I was pretty
quick we stumbled a little bit on that
that bracket but a next section it looks
like we're doing four loops in
