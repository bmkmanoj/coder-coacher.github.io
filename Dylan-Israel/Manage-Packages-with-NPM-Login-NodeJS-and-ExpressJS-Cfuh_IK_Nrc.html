in managed packages with NPM from the
free code camp back in certification
program doing nodejs and Express yes so
what we're gonna be doing right now is
the login section if you want to pull up
the menu it's how to NPM will get this
third section right here login and then
you'll see right here we're gonna learn
it gives us a brief paragraph about what
we're actually learning so when doing
NPM we actually need to create an
account through NPM jazz comm which is
we can do through the command line
basically right now now if you don't
know who you are we can run NPM who am i
but since we're not technically logged
in yet and we don't have an actual
account I don't think this will actually
work so let's see that but this is one
of those commands that you want to keep
track of so you notice it didn't work so
we're gonna instead going to add a user
so another command that we want to keep
track of so NPM add user and so our
username we'll go ahead and just put a
coding are with you CT 360 your
shorthand and then password
and then email go ahead and put your
email in there and then now let's see if
this will work in p.m. Who am I I don't
know that it will oh this is not no man
good not so there we are so now that
we've actually created an account you'll
see that our username CT 360 is coming
back not to be confused with the file
path sorry that might have been a bad
example and then we can go ahead and
verify that we have completed this
challenge so what to take away from this
one that you'll need to create an
account when working with node and using
NPM and to the two kind of commands that
we learned one how to see who you're
logged in as and two how to create an
account with that so moving forward
we'll we'll do the next section and keep
it moving but as always guys don't
