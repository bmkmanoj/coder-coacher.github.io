about are you too old to learn how to
code it seems to be a question among
older individuals who are concerned
about it and we're gonna tell you why
you're not and maybe why you are you
don't know maybe I'm just gonna on
all the old people today it's not gonna
happen you're not too old Tia TLDR
you're not too old let's dive into it a
little bit deeper as to why so since
you're never too old to learn anything
it's a good time to do a shout-out to
the hacking reloaded temporary bundle if
you're interested in game hacking how to
hack a car penetration testing security
on iOS or Android and all that other
good stuff click the link it in in the
description below again this is only
good for about the next two weeks but a
pretty good deal at the very least for a
dollar you can get five or four books
and a coupon and as always you'll have
the option of choosing who you want to
give your money to if you want to give
it all to me you want to give it all the
charity today's charity is there's two
different ones but you're you you split
it up so that you can donate to a good
cause as well so if you're watching this
video probably worried that for whatever
reason you have it in your head that
you're too old to code or that you're
too old to break into the industry or
you're making up excuses and you know I
always excuse this it sounds like I
don't understand because I do right I'm
about to turn 30 next month and about
half the people I work with are younger
than me
they're you know around the 25 age mark
and they have more years of experience
than me and they are much better
developers than I am and they're you
know they're they're killing it right
they're doing they're doing good and
it's great to be around people like that
so I understand you know feeling
intimidated at times but at the other
day if you're thinking I want to be a
developer what's the alternative when
you have to really think about what
you're going to do and I wanted to show
this article including in the link below
but here we have an 80 year old woman so
automatically what this says to me that
if you're 82 and over
give you a pass we I speak for the
coding community and say if you are 82
years or older kind sir or ma'am
the to the grandmothers and grandfathers
out there 82 years older the coding
community gives you a pass about being
worried about being too old if you are
81 years or younger man up woman up and
start coding all right so stop worrying
a lot of times the worst things in life
are the apprehension so in this case
though any other reason I bring this up
I think it's a great example of showing
that this woman started using using
computers at the age of 60 so she never
touched a computer till she was 60 then
she built her first app at the age of 81
a game that she wanted to put out on the
market and really inspiring I encourage
you to to watch not only the TED talk
but also read read the the very brief
synopsis of it so why do I bring that up
well I just wanted to give you a good
example of somebody to say hey I don't
care how old I am I'm just going to code
uh I'm going to build what I want a
building will be churning but let's just
say that you're not 18 you're 40 or
whatever and you're you know you have
kids and a wife and a husband or a
mortgage and all that sort stuff
here's thinking making a transition now
why are you trying why are you trying to
jump careers it's the first place and
the question is because the answer is
either one because you don't make any
money or two because you're unhappy
right and it could be that you're
unhappy because you don't make any money
that's that's fair so what's the
alternative is the alternative to stay
unhappy
it's the alternate or say you know what
I am just gonna keep doing what I don't
want to keep doing right and as I've
said time and time again 70% of
employees hate their job 70% the
majority of people in this country hate
their job hey there's very few things
that I could say I actually hate hey
people hate their job and why am i
emphasizing this fact well because you
go to work five out of seven days out of
the week traditional
and eight to eight plus hours a day
that's assuming that you're not working
overtime and assuming that you're
getting fairly compensated in all that
sir sir
so the alternative is you stays
something that the that you're clearly
at some point unhappy with why did I say
we'll tell how you know you're unhappy
well if you were very fulfilled and
happy in your current job and role why
would you be trying to transition to
another role usually people change jobs
because they're unhappy maybe their
current job doesn't give them benefits
maybe they'll make enough money to have
a family maybe they want to be more
mentally stimulated maybe they're burnt
out on doing whatever it is that they're
doing right and when you think about
okay well I'm I'm 40 I'm 50 looking to a
career change is it is it going to be
hard everything's going to be hard stop
looking for guarantees and this is what
I really think it comes down to is stop
being afraid of investing your time and
energy into something and and being
afraid that it may not work out stop
worrying about that and just get started
just get going and I could tell you from
my standpoint when I when I stopped
going to school and I decided I was
gonna go the self-taught route
I remember thinking like how scary it
was but there was no turning back right
I'm diving all in I'm the only person I
thought this was a good idea everyone
else in my family probably soon I was
gonna be a crackhead on the street or
something I don't know what they said
but you know that never sounds like a
good plan no one believes you until you
do it so go out there and do it right
and I remember April love her to death
and she's always been very supportive
but she's trying to have a very
practical conversation with me and say
hey at what point do you go back to
school is it a year from now when you
can't get a development job is it two
years from now what happens and my goal
was a year
god bless I did in nine months and I was
happy and proud it's been a great
rollercoaster ride I've loved it every
minute and it's scary right it's scary
investing the time and energy I was
coding for hours after a full-time job
and then eight to 12 to 14 hours
everyday on the weekend
I was putting in probably 40 to 60 hours
easy a week coding outside of work
sleeping not going to the gym or
anything just trying to code and knowing
guaranteed me a job no one guarantees I
say hey don't there is a light at the
end of that tunnel you need to guarantee
yourself I and what she what she asked
me that that and out of the she was
caring for me she want to make sure that
hey do you have a plan and I did but it
wasn't a negative asked it was hey let's
bring reality into this person is very
hyped up and nothing is what are you
talking about I'm get in there right I
have I'm guaranteeing myself cuz I'm
puttin the work in to get to where I
want to go and here we are and you can
be where you want to go to you just got
to not be afraid to put the work in and
study and code every day and power
through your age is nothing but a number
right and that's really it and you have
to be hey if you're if you're an older a
gentleman or lady there's a lot of
benefits that come along with that as
well I know a lot of people are very
worried they're like oh well I'm older
and you know I'm gonna be working with
I'm working with guys younger than me
have more experience I mean Crandon not
as big of a gap as if I was 40 but five
years experiences they have three four
five years experience on me or five
years difference that's three four years
five years experience I mean you say
well alright then I'm 45 and they're 25
that's 20 years experience yeah okay and
you're getting started but time you're
60 of 15 years experience in the
industry you just have to get going man
it's not a big deal and you just have to
continue to work on yourself work on
your skill set and go in there a lot of
times there's benefits one of the
benefits to hire somebody who's just say
45 versus a 23 or 24 year old or 22 year
old straight out of college they know
you want it right you're making a big
career change they're just getting their
career started
you have relevant work experience you
probably have skills that make you very
interesting I know that my one of my old
co-workers he was 36 kind of kind of
getting his life together he had spent
his
first twelve years at a heist at a high
school straight in the military no
experience of Cody went to school spent
another four years and at the age of 35
became a developer and and continued
going forward there is no there's no age
at which you can stop doing this this 80
year old 81 year old grandmother
presumably started using computers at 60
and built her own app at 81 and after
six months you can do it too and it's
just a matter of believing and be
willing to work and at 20 at 45 for
instance I'm just saying that as a
general middle-aged anyhow so if you're
older or younger
don't sweat it it's just a random number
that consider middle age so at 45
you have probably for somebody family a
kids a mortgage you are a very stable
individual and they don't have to worry
about things that maybe they might have
to worry about maybe a youngster if you
will who maybe on the weekdays goes out
on drinks now that have anything against
that but as an employer you want
somebody stable mature so who values the
job who's going to show up on time and
maybe you have experience in the
industry but not necessarily in software
but the the realm that during that makes
you very attractive can you have life
experience you have you have job
experience you have other skills that
may be relevant to the role that make
you outshine some of the younger
individuals but you never think about
that right you just think about
everything that can go wrong that's
that's it why don't you guys start
thinking about what can go right stop
worrying about the anticipation of oh
well no one's guaranteeing me that if I
put in the time and the energy and I've
already wasted so much time in this
other industry and oh my god stop all
that stop all that like I understand man
it's scary it's scary putting yourself
out into the world it's scary
investing the time and energy when you
feel you're already behind I understand
that I really really do and all you can
do is say all you can do is look at the
situation objectively and say what's the
alternative is
turned to stay in a situation I clearly
something about it I don't like clearly
there's something about it that makes me
unhappy
where do I pull the trigger do I pull
the trigger study everyday get to the
point where I feel I'm ready for a
development job and I dive into it and I
I go and I go I go until I'm there see
alternatives to stay and be unhappy stay
and continue doing something you don't
want to do it's probably the worst
decision you can make so I hope that if
you are one of those people who are
worried and you're one of the people who
ask me how long have you been coding for
what age all that sort of stuff you
think you think I you think I like it
when I see 12 year olds that are coding
circles around me no man I don't good
for them but I don't like it either it's
just one of those things guys where we
all are at different stages of our life
and you just have to understand that
whatever choices you made maybe there
were bad choices maybe they're good
choices but a good choice is to invest
in yourself and plan for the future and
a bad choice
I said not invest in yourself even
though you're scared and and to stay in
something that you're unhappy with hope
you guys stop worrying about are you old
enough to code out you know at what age
can you still be a developer
unless you're 82 our old older the
coding community gives you a pass until
you go and bring out your app and then
you raise that up all right so
thank you guys so much for watching I
wish you all the best I know it's scary
I know man invest some time energy money
into something it's scary it's not as
scary as not doing it though so I wish
you all the best don't forget to join
