sponsored by this company brain for his
uh specifically for study juice and I
was really interested in it so I reached
out so I said hey I'd love doing a
sponsored video and they sent me some
free samples here to see this nice
letter for those of you who are frequent
Watchers you probably know that I drink
I'm always drinking a energy drink or
some sort of caffeinated beverage
usually a monster rehab or something and
those you don't hear is like a six month
example of my girlfriend collecting my
monster tabs I am an avid energy drink
users not only because I'm tired but I
actually find that it helps me focus
better and I was looking for something
that would have a lower caffeine
alternative but still give me the
ability to study longer and focus and
study juice really sit out and look at
this box they sent me if this is not the
coolest thing you've ever seen I don't
know what it is but so studies useless
what stood out to me and they sent me
some free samples and one of the things
I want to talk about is what's in it so
they it's only about two percent
caffeine and then the the main
ingredients the two big ones are the Tia
cream which is a very high-end high-end
ingredient that's very expensive for
what I'm from what I've read and it's
supposed to be really good for you and
then there's also the L the ain't oh my
god these words men the elves to a me LT
ma which is 400 milligrams our natural
ingredient and that supposed to help as
well so they equated you know brain
fortune equates it with the feeling of a
pre-workout or a cup of coffee basically
and there's two different ways that you
can take it you can actually the way I
take it is I take about six of these
which is a high dosage serving in the
morning and then if I if I'm going to
have a cup of coffee or energy drink
quite well I am having that I only take
three which is a smaller room I have
I high tolerance to stimulants and
things that will get me focused so I'm
I'm okay having an energy drink and this
but you may not be now the way the
another way that you can take this very
interesting I haven't quite adventured
this far yet is you can actually empty
out six capsules into orange juice or
good tasting liquid is is what's the
suggestion is the reason for this is I
originally put three of these into a
water bottle and it is the most bitter
thing you've ever tasted in your life
unfortunately I was unable to finish the
water ball so if you're gonna do that
you really do need a liquid that's very
strong tasting so that's that's a quick
synopsis of study juice to make sure to
get yours I I definitely enjoy I'm gonna
order some I in about a week once I run
out and or two weeks and what you're
gonna sing next it's basically me waking
up at 6 a.m. to start my day on the
first day or I think it might've been
the day after I taken study juice the
first day before I took just a three and
I started I woke up and took the sixers
it that's kind of how realistic it would
be you'd wake up you'd start your day
and you need to get to work you need to
type out some code you need to prepare
for our test whatever it may be and so I
wanted to kind of give my thoughts good
morning ladies and gentlemen it is about
6:52 a.m. i just got up we're about to
put study juice a brain force of product
to the test yesterday we did the three
and there's pretty good as pre smooth as
a person who likes caffeine
I don't like smooth I like to feel boom
maybe like so I told myself when I woke
up nothing in the stomach gonna take a
little bit of unsweetened tea right now
into the 99-cent holiday mug that the
girlfriend wanted to buy from the
clearance section of Ross I believe it
was pour ourselves a little bit of that
we're also going to take remember the
high dosage is six pills so we're going
to try that
you get 90 pills in a container so if
you're a high dose guy one of these
bottles is gonna be good for 15 servings
basically five and six so there's small
pills if you're not if you know some
people some people have trouble
swallowing GI normos pills they're not
ginormous they're pretty much standard
vitamin capsule size it's gonna be hard
to kind of communicate but you can see
right there it's not the biggest pill so
a small pill by any means but in terms
of the what type of fill it is it's
relatively reasonable so we're gonna go
ahead and uh chow these six down and
then in about an hour I'll uh you know
once I feel like kickin or not
sure guys it's uh it's about an hour and
a half after I took the high dosage
study juice a brain force of product and
one thing to note about is I feel pretty
good I feel awake I haven't had any
caffeine other than the you know the the
unsweetened black tea which is like
water to me I haven't even finished that
cup but yeah I feel smooth I feel alert
I've been working for about an hour and
a half on some video editing for a work
I'm a side project I was assigned and
I'm good to go I I met but I have my
desk in a standing position that's how
you really know man but Desi's up I'm
standing I feel good I feel mentally
ready I feel physically ready I'm awake
and I really like it so far and I'm uh
I'm glad they sent me two bottles
because I'm going to use both two
bottles and I'm gonna see what this
lemon balm extract is about I haven't
really dived into that yet but I would
definitely recommend this as someone who
like has tried various products of these
some of them are super overwhelming I've
tried other competing products I just
pure caffeine pills and even someone
with high caffeine tolerance like myself
you can going to get a little dizzy in
the head this is smooth this is uh this
is alert this is very like okay
I feel like I feel like I'm awake I feel
like I can focus and I feel like I am
ready to go versus that sort of jittery
I feel like I'm a little drugged up and
a little bit hyper that some of the
competing products maybe but I
definitely recommend study juice and I
hope you guys enjoyed this review I
tried to do it as natural as possible in
terms of how you would actually use the
product for me I would use it when I
wake up to get my work day started to
kind of turn on the brain if you will so
that I can go at 125 percent and just
kind of excel for the day but thanks for
