in free code camp we're building a
markdown previewer if you're not
familiar with markdown what it basically
is is is a way to type shorthand HTML so
all this up you see this is the settings
is Arcade section this link looks like
it's all just markdown and having a lot
of my a lot of my projects on here like
this add one you'll see that I have a
video embedded here that will take you
there these why these inputs let's mark
down if you're not feel owes markdown
now we're going to build a preview or
essentially you can type in something
like this and you could type in if you
wanted h1 now you have an h1 with just
that hashtag h2 h3 h4 I'll exaggerate so
that's what we're going to build its
we're going to fulfill the user stories
of using github flavored markdown we're
going to be able to preview it as we do
it as you just saw and then also we're
going to use this library called marked
which essentially will help us convert
our our input into HTML or convert our
markdown into HTML that's what we're
going to do let's go ahead and get
started now I'm not going to be using
code pin to do this I'm going to
actually be using a text editor just do
it on my local machine and we're going
to start fresh so go ahead and setup
your folder if you haven't already
create a new folder in this case I'm
going to call it FCC - mark down and
select that now I'll be using the create
react app in this application what we're
going to what we're going to do here is
going to launch our actually I shouldn't
have created that folder so I'm going to
create a react app in that folder right
now so go ahead and launch git bash and
use the crate react up if you don't have
it installed I suggest you install it
this is basically Facebook's
man to create a react app from from
scratch create wracked up in this case
we'll just call it FCC - marked down
pure previewer something like that so
forget that whole thing about creating a
file but this is going to install just
essentially a little local server so it
auto updates in the browser it's also
going to import a bunch of files that
we're going to use so a couple things
that we're going to be using in terms of
dependency we're going to install
markdown we're also going to install a
react bootstrap for the form input and I
believe that is it so that's the two
things that we'll be installing right
away once this gets going and let me go
ahead and bring up the documentation so
once this finishes now this one the
hardest part about this one was actually
going through the documentation than
anything else I found that the project
itself was about as simple as you could
you could make it but if you weren't if
you're not accustomed to go with your
documentation this might actually be
pretty hard for you and I have the skill
within itself so I know that I was
looking for something and unfortunately
I was looking in the wrong space and I
had to reach out to a friend of mine who
I know I completed sa hey where did you
find that find this documentation he's
like oh that's actually not in the Marc
documentation that is in the react
documentation so go ahead and open up
your installer here in our case we're
going to do FCC markdown previewer and
we're going to install a few things so
CD into sec - mark down previewer and
what we want to do now is we want to go
ahead and install marked and then we're
going to install react bootstrap and
then we're going to still everything
else and then we're a launch our server
and see where we're at so this is just
some some basic stuff if you don't want
to listen to me talk about the project
for the next two three minutes you might
as well
head and if you haven't if you're
looking for something a little bit more
challenging
we as of right now yesterday's video
which I think I'll probably put this out
sometime next week I put out the react
camper leaderboard from the data
visualization section of free code camp
in that case we do some Ajax calls so if
you're looking for to go in that you
could introduce Axios react bootstrap as
well and something else
alright so mark took longer than
expected to install next thing we want
to install is react bootstrap react -
bootstrap - asleep and this will be our
final installation react bootstrap is
done installing if last but not least
we'll do an install to install the
packages that are leftover from the
crate rack bootstrap application jumping
kind of back and forth just because I
don't want to sit here and give you guys
a bunch of empty talk while we wait for
the installations alright cool so if
everything installed correctly go ahead
and input yarn and start this is going
to launch our react application while
that is going we're going to go into our
source and jump into our apt Jas file
now go ahead and delete everything
that's in here except this div class
name map and then while you're at it go
and collect the bootstrap because we are
using bootstrap we need to import the
CSS CSS is not included in the react
with strap application so go ahead and
get that some CDN or something like that
and we're going to jump into our index
on HTML which is in our public folder
here and we're just going to go ahead
and throw this stylesheet in the in the
header like so and while we're here we
might as well change this title here to
markdown
project so now that we've imported the
CSS let's go ahead and import our
dependencies that we're going to be
using for this project it's only a few
will take one moment
so we've already discussed that we are
going to be using some bootstrap and
there's three things that we're going to
import for this from the react through
strap library the form group which is
your active bootstrap live slash form
group the control label on the form
control these are basically if you're
familiar bootstrap at all you would have
your form group class essentially
grouping together stuff your control
label is the label for our text area
because remember we have a text area
where we're inputting all of our content
and then we're going to have a form
control which is actually the text area
that's how that's what why we're
importing this and last but not least we
need to create a marked variable I did
let probably would have been better Duke
aunts but I just don't think we're going
to go ahead and call this marked we're
going to set this equal to require month
this is going to essentially bring in
the marked library that we we use all
right so where to get started the
easiest thing in first let's go ahead
and find our page make sure everything
is set up properly so if you have a if
you're following along and you've
deleted your content this is what it
should look like if you can't delete it
there should be some stuff here that
said you know welcome to react or some
nonsense like that now everything's
going good so how can we get started
let's think about what we're trying to
do what we're trying to do is have some
types of text come in and then in an
input and then output it into HTML so
the easiest thing to do is to start
designing that input and we're going to
be using react bootstrap for that so in
a div we're going to remember these
components that we imported from react
bootstrap the first one that we're going
to create is called form
group and in this case we're going to
give it a control ID this is just going
to be the ID for that group and this is
just coffee straight by the way from the
the reactive shop documentation so if
you want to know more about it you can
go ahead and go there so that's our
forum group essentially kind of just a
div to put it in there then we have our
label right so that's our control
labeling you'll notice that these names
are lining up right because that's the
whole point of it and so this is going
to be our label and then in here what do
we want the label to be I just put
markdown input I think it's pretty
self-explanatory now the last part we
want our form control and this is
slightly different this is going to be
basically our text area and this has a
couple parameters and component class
this is how we tell it what what input
we want it to be by assigning component
class and as we mentioned it's going to
be a text area so that's where we're
going to pass it in and then we can at
this point just pass in normal things
like placeholder we're gonna set this
equal to I don't know can put markdown
its enter markdown over that
and we save it and if everything's set
up properly
you should see a little bit of output
right now just a text area so you see
right here we have our label we have
this nice little highlighted selector
that goes along with it
it goes to the edge I don't really like
that so in here let's going to use the
bootstrap class container just to get it
down and make it a little bit less you
know all the way to the edge that will
bring everything in just a little bit so
you see that that's a little bit nicer I
don't worry too much about styling when
I do these projects I hope you guys hope
you guys style it better than I do I
really enjoy the what's going on here I
do I really enjoyed the JavaScript
aspect more than anything else now the
next thing that we want to do is well
this is the dit this is the dip where
we're putting content in we're going to
want to dip where we put content out and
in the example they had side by side I
just did it top to bottom you know
that's a quick project you do whatever
you want with it in here I just had a
little h1 I put a markdown output so we
did that and then within that I had a
div where I wanted to output the content
nested within there so everything should
look something like this at this point
and we're all on the right track now
let's start talking about the logic well
we want to pass some value from what
changes in the text box to a state
remember our state is going to be
basically how we we have variables that
we dynamically set within here so let's
go ahead and create our state our state
property within our class up so state
and I just called it markdown
and I initialized it here to just an
empty string now where are we going to
actually pass that valuing well you
might have guessed by me using the word
value so in value we are going to set
this equal to one down like so so now
whatever values in there is the value
that starts there but because we're
changing the value and it's an input we
have to go ahead and put that in there
but this would be this dot state
markdown but we're going to use some
Deconstructor in here and we're going to
create a variable called let and then in
here we're going to pass in markdown
justin siegel this dot state well that's
going to do is it's going to say hey let
this value hold whatever this state dot
markdown is and if we had multiple ones
we could separate it with a comma say we
had like a markdown
to something like that it would work as
well although now we are getting a pair
why are we getting in there state is
equal to this which is marked down
markdown is not defined line 24
so we have some sort of syntax mistake
let's see if we can figure it out oh and
there it is
markdown so who wouldn't be a Mon in my
videos if I didn't fat thing or
something so now we're all good
everyone should still have the same as
it changed too much but now that we've
done that we should say how can we
change our codes so that when we when we
console dot say if we were to write here
console dot log out the value of
markdown it would return something
different every time we hit a different
keystroke because that's what we need to
happen for our output we don't want to
have to click a button and then it
renders it although that is one way of
doing it that's not this project in this
case we want it to dynamically update on
that to do that we can use the on change
function that's a JavaScript here and
what this basically does is it calls a
function that runs every time our value
changes now every time we hit a
keystroke it's going to change well how
do we end up doing that well because
we're working with state we need to
update the state we need to set the
state well you do that by just writing a
simple function here I just call the
update markdown and it's going to take
in one value now we're just going to
name it markdown so that we don't have
to write more than we want and we kind
of know what it is so in this case this
dot set state and then passed in the
object and we're going to set say
markdown like so copy name does
something different and is like value as
your parameter you would do it like that
instead of markdown save us some some
time some nice es6 stuff right so we
have markdown here and now we're going
to set the state of markdown although on
change we haven't put anything in there
or about two right now so the way that
we do this is on change passes in an
event callback so we want to go ahead
and hand
that and we say look when this runs go
ahead and call this other function in
this case it's our update markdown and
what we want to pass in there is the
event target value and that is the
content the the text that in our text
area and that's what we're going to pass
down and that's what we're going to set
state to so in here we're going to say
this dot update markdown and our
parameter in here our markdown is going
to be this dot excuse me event target
value it's going to save that make sure
everything's good
I believe at this point we should be
able to see everything being outputted
so as it reloads here so I'm going to
put a D you'll see there's a D a y-axis
a DUI LAN and you can see our state is
updating as we intended right so so far
so good
now the the last little part that we
have to do here now the hardest part as
I mentioned earlier was for me finding
what I needed to convert this to because
I was looking in the marked
documentation for some function that
would output what we're looking for now
if we go and we actually say something
like this I'll give you an example of
issue is if we go and the way that you
convert text into markdown or markdown
into text is you go ahead and into HTML
rather so we call the marked and then
you just pass in the value in our case
it's going to be marked down and so
let's go ahead and save that and bring
this down I'll show you oh I always do
two of these for my angular days for
maybe an angular developer so you
wouldn't believe how many times I've
done that issue and looked at it if you
like what the hell's going on and so if
we do something like that you can see
you can see that turns it into an h1 I
don't know I guess the idea of Dillon
but here you can see that it's actually
printing out
h1 tag but the string we need we needed
to compile into HTML and for me the
hardest part was finding out how to
actually do that and it's not in the
markdown documentation but in the react
documentation as I mentioned and luckily
it's really easy to get started they
have this gaint
dangerously set inner HTML function
which doesn't mean like a whole lot to
me I'll be honest with you I don't
really know who came up with that or why
they came up with it but hey do you and
then we have this what we're doing is
we're passing in an object into it and
that object has a parameter underscore
underscore HTML and then that marked is
what we want to pass it because that's
converting our that's converting our
markdown into HTML but it's going to
take that HTML string and it's going to
actually print it out so all we're going
to do is pass in our markdown value like
so and now when this reloads we can go
ahead and pass in something like Dylan
is super amazing a Maxim Maxim is just
as good I'm definitely probably more
super maxing than I am amazing so that
is the markdown preview again not the
cleanest thing in the world but in terms
of the logic in terms of implementing a
very short a very quick project to knock
out the free code camp build your own
markdown previewer um pretty pretty
straightforward I encourage you to get
comfortable with this stuff because
those readme files when you're uploading
on github I really hope you guys are
including readme files to show that
you're just not that that you're just
kind of spamming your stuff up there and
that you want people to use it and you
want people to see it as well to promote
yourself and whatever else that may be
maybe you want to just put your LinkedIn
on there for potential employers and
things like that so take advantage of
that I appreciate you guys watching the
video don't forget to Like subscribe
share and join the Facebook groups for
me on patreon all that good stuff there
links are in the description I'll see
you next time bye
hey guys thanks for watching the video
vo special thanks to our sponsors dev
Mountain if you look for a coding boot
camp where tuition and housing is
included definitely check them out
appreciate it and I'll see you guys in
the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
