in free code camp doing those
intermediate algorithm scripting bonfire
DIF to erase diff two arrays so what are
we trying to do here we reset this okay
cool
so essentially we are taking in two
arrays numbers and strings and
everything else and we want to return a
new array with stuff that is unique to
both of them so for instance if the word
the is in the first array but not in the
second array we're gonna add the two the
new to the new array and vice-versa with
a raid 2 so how do we do that
so the give you a nice start this is
exactly what I would do except I would
call this a older array I don't know why
but that's just kind of what I've been
doing so and also I've been getting a
lot of requests to zoom in more when I
type so we're gonna be trying out a
hundred and fifty percent zoom so this
should make the videos a little bit
better and a little bit easier to see so
let's go ahead and get started so we
create a temporary array because we're
going to be pushing to that array and
we're gonna need some for loops and they
give you some methods here the easiest
thing for that I thought was I remember
using index of and it would run through
an entire array and then if it if it got
a result of negative one when you
compared it with another array or an
element such as like a string it would
when it returned negative one it would
tell you that it's not contained within
it so to me that was the first sign to
go and so that's what I'm going to do so
I'm gonna start with a for loop and
we're gonna create a variable here just
you know so we normally would and we'll
say for for a 0 Y I is less than the
first array r1 dot length and keep going
I plus plus
I'm thrown off by the zoom a little bit
that's kind of interesting so next thing
we want to do is we want to add we want
to check that we want to check our
second array so we wanna say while our
second array dot index of doesn't
contain any one of our values here or if
it's equal to negative one we want to go
ahead and push it so if it's not
contained within those values just in
the array not one index of the array the
whole array that's why we're using index
of we are going to push it to our right
here so I've r1 and then I let's go
ahead and run that make sure we're good
to go right here so what happened when
we ran that new our is not defined oh so
cool so we passed a few things here but
the issue that we had is we're only
checking one array if it's not contained
there if each array has a unique word in
it we need to check them both so what do
we what are we going to do the easiest
thing to do is just write another for
loop you see right here we're checking
the second array and now we just need to
check the first array so all we're gonna
do here is basically copy our code over
in this case we're just gonna have a J
variable so we'll say for j VAR j is
equal to zero
well j is less than the array 2 dot
lengths because we're checking that one
now j plus plus and then we're gonna do
an if statement it's gonna be exactly a
reverse we're just checking array 1 dot
index of saying look man if if it
doesn't contain our second array item
within your whole array array whole
array of array 1 we're gonna need you to
tell us that by sending an equal
negative one and then we're gonna say
okay cool it's not in that one we wanted
to then hold our a dot push the first
array onto it
air excuse me a second array onto it and
there we go so that was the difference
of two erase so why don't we as always
let's put in some code here so this for
loop uh some comments right like this
for loop is here to iterate iterate
through array one if ii or a array two
doesn't contain items in array one add
it to new array and we'll just put right
here vice versa
switch array one with all right all
right
- so always put the comments in there
it's gonna really help you out down the
line so i hope you found this helpful I
hope this kind of explains what's going
on so again we're just iterating through
both arrays in separate for loops and
any place that they the one array
doesn't contain the the other array with
our index of but it returns a negative
one and we know that we can then add it
to the new array so I hope you found
this helpful don't forget to thumbs up
like the video subscribe share it if you
have a friend that's stuck on it and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
