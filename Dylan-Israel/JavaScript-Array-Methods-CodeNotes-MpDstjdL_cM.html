going to be talking about everything you
need to know when talking about
JavaScript array methods so let's get
started do you have an array and you
want to be able to output the contents
of that array so we have hello world
world hello whatever it may be you can
use the two string method this will then
output that with commas in between
values now it does have to be a string
in there so you could use numbers it'll
still out put it in the same format kind
of like the two string method is a joint
message this will allow us to connect
the values that are in that array index
values and then using a separator of our
choosing so in our example we're going
to put a space star then a space this
will take all the index values and
output it using that format oftentimes
with arrays you're going to want to add
values to the end to do that you're
going to use the push function that way
when you push the number 5 for instance
on it it will now be the last index now
if you wanted to remove that value you
use pop this will pop off that last
value from your array so that five that
we just added will then be removed that
index will not exist and therefore will
have remove that value similar to help
push your pop works at the end of the
array now if you want to work with the
beginning of the ray you'll use shift
and unshipped when you use shift what's
going to happen it's going to remove
that first index value and then shift
everything over to the left one so what
was in the one index will not be the
zero index was in the two index is now
be the one index now so you want to add
something to the beginning of the rate
you would then use unshipped you'd pass
in a single parameter that you're trying
to add let's say the number five for
instance and then it would add that to
the zero index and what was in zero
would now be one was in one would now be
two and so on and so forth don't forget
that you can change a single index value
just by selecting the index of the array
setting equal signs and then studying
that value to overwrite whatever its
current value was you also have the
length property of the array what this
is going to allow you to do is find out
the length of
now keep in mind this is always going to
be one more than the last index because
we're starting at one and going to the
entire length of the array so if the
last index values for the length would
be five because you would have 0 1 2 3 4
5 5 values and a length of five we're
gonna help pop and push works on the end
and shift and unship works on the
beginning you have splice to really work
for anywhere in the string mainly
probably the middle part since you're
going to use the other methods for that
so splice ticks and two parameters it is
then going to say the first parameter
where do you want to start slicing and
the second parameter do you want to
actually remove the elements that come
next or do you want to leave them alone
so if I was to put in the index one to
start and then to as the next two values
remove it would then just remove those
values now say we wanted to add
something in those two places let's say
we start at the one again we want to
remove two spots you would then put a
comma and this put in as many values as
you want to splice into it so if we
wanted it to splice the numbers five and
six into it would then remove those two
values and splice those numbers in now
keep in mind you don't actually have to
splice in as many items as you remove
and vice versa you can actually just
splice out values as well and do that
not add anything sometimes you may want
to concatenate you would use the concat
method to do that you can use it on one
array so take a rate one could counter a
22 it now ray one will be store both
arrays into one larger array now you can
do this your multiple arrays all you
need to do is separate with a common
like you would any parameter and cat all
your arrays together if that's what
you're looking to do hey guys thanks for
