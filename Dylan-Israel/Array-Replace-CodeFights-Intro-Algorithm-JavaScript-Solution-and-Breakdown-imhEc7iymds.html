fights doing a raver place in the intro
section and in typical code fights
fashion II we had a couple hard ones
with that box blare two problems ago now
we get some gimmies to get us more
confident a little bit of a rest so give
it an array of integers to place all
currents of the Elm to replace with the
substitution element what that means is
we're given an array and if there's ever
a one we want to pass in at three
essentially in this example we want we
have a number that we're checking if it
exists replace it this can be done with
a pretty much just running a for each
loop on our right so we'll take our
input array and run up for each loop
that will iterate through all the arrays
and we're going to pass in the element
that we're checking the into our
function we're passing the element that
we're checking and the index number here
that index number is optional but we
need it for if we're going to use it for
each loop
and where if they look if the element is
equal to the element to replace meaning
is it in the first test a one go ahead
and take our input array and remember if
we are now taking that index value and
go ahead and set it equal to the
substitution element so check if it's
the element if it is that index that
we're currently iterating on go ahead
and replace that element with that new
with that substitution element and at
the end here all we have to do is return
the input array save it run our test and
we are officially done a kind of a
simple problem kind of a gimme problem
if you will but I don't know if there's
made me just say sorry about our
horrible instructions on a lot of these
and but the next few are going to be
kind of gimmies although is a nicer
pressure to kind of not have to count my
head against cool so as always guys
thank you so much for watching it's
going to be a short video on this one
but I appreciate you checking out the
channel I hope that you subscribe and

discord channel and support me on
patreon there's links for all of that in
the description I'll see you guys next
time hey guys thanks for watching the
video special thanks to our sponsors dev
Mountain if you look for a coding boot
camp for tuition and housing is included
definitely check them out
appreciate it I'll see you guys in the
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
