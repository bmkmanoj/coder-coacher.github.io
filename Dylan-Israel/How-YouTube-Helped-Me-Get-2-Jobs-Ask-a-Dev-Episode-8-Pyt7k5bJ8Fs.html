talk about how and why my channel got me
my last two jobs so for those you don't
know I basically started my channel
about a year and nine months or so ago
uploading my very first Ruby tutorial on
Codecademy and from the get-go the
channel was kind of a two or three prong
kill bird with two cents or to say where
I wanted to have a channel for obvious
like financial reasons i love the
residual income Matt engineer truths one
of my best friends and he's doing very
well at that time and much better now
but I saw his success I wanted to
emulate that too I wanted to use it as a
as a way of getting better and three I
wanted to use it as a video portfolio
and that was really my goal when I
started the channel and I have to say I
think it was very successful in all
three maybe not so much the money side
but it ended up giving me a lot of
financial value in terms of jobs and so
how did I get my first job from YouTube
and to put this in perspective when I
got hired at my very first job I was a
full-time computer science student
working part-time as a delivery driver
at Domino's also was doing some
freelance work where it's picking up
clients that way i was also unemployed
for a while my girlfriend was paying all
the bills you know god bless her soul
and you know I had a bunch of odd jobs
doing physical manual labor I'm just
being doing everything I could bring
money in so my financial situation was
drastically different and where I was in
my life a year and about i guess about
five months ago was when I took that
second job or two jobs ago rather my
previous job there we got my previous
job and at that time the reason I was
able to get that job which I went from a
delivery driver to the role as a
technology trainer at a software company
where they wrote student information
system software was because of my
youtube channel it's not the only reason
but it was a major reason as to why I
got hired ouch also so the role that I
was applying for
was one in which they were looking for
someone who knew software and also could
create technical training materials of
videos and so I had a coding channel and
put this in perspective my subscriber
count was five or six hundred at this
point as the date I got hired and I
showed my interest in coding through
through my channel I also showed my
video and editing skills which are great
resources that i can put on there so
let's have people are like how do i
create how do i create experience
without actually having experience well
when you're talking at least on video
editing software and the ability to
create videos and the ability to show
that you can code when it's when you
have video proof that you could do all
three of those things it's very helpful
in creating my resume so i went from
being a delivery driver with no benefits
part time work barely making any money
at all to a role that at the time was
very financially much better I it was
like 22 an hour with what I've been paid
full benefits so I covered my medical
and dental outside 401 K all these sort
of things that were you know big adult
boy jobs if you will now how did that
was my first job 500 subscribers i think
i had like 180 videos up 200 videos up
and just kicking out these Codecademy
tutorials as fast as i can in free code
camp as well now fast forward to my big
my real job my courage on my big boy job
because i wanted to be a developer right
that was that was kind of the main end
goal one of the three i wanted to become
a developer and I was going to use
YouTube as my video portfolio that
helped me do that and that's what it did
and it's not hypothetical or anything
like that that's exactly what it did the
hiring the individuals who I work with
the coworker mind I work with he the way
that he decided that I was a good fit
and I talked about this a little bit in
how to add resume experience on linkedin
without any experience basically was
with my videos he watched my videos he
said hey I think I can work with this
guy he seems quick he seems confident at
the very least and he after watching
some mrs. video
I can actually tell they knows what he's
talking about and this was how my
channel helped me get not one job and
two jobs and my second job pay I don't
want to say how much they paid but it
pays significantly more than my last job
and the resume experience is invaluable
in itself but this is how I was able to
get get up two jobs and it was all
because of YouTube grandin I still had
to have the skills I was able to work on
those skills through YouTube and various
other fields like video editing a photo
editing I got a adobe captivate adobe
photoshop adobe premiere pro i ended up
gaining more skills and grenade didn't
get me my developer job but it did get
my foot in the door to work with
developers in a software company where i
could get somewhat relevant experience
and hopefully work my way up now that's
not what i did i ended up deciding to
leave and accept a role elsewhere but
that was kind of the idea when I
accepted that role and I did make a big
decision to stop going to school and
decide if I want to resume that at a
later date but YouTube in itself was the
platform that helps me get my career
started and got me my last two jobs
which I I'm very happy about that and so
the kind of point of this that's how you
drop out of school and just chase your
dreams or anything like that so don't do
that the point is to realize that there
are other avenues to get rekted to get
experience if you will that make you
stand out that isn't traditional in
terms of just I have a degree hire me it
is hey I started a company this is what
I did our i started this is my website
this is what it covers or i started a
podcast or i started a YouTube channel
kind of as simple programmer said in our
interview a while back going through the
back door getting creative with your
resume experience not lying but getting
creative all the skills that I had I got
from my youtube channel i bettered
myself in a direction i continue to do
so and kind of some of these things may
not occur to people and that's like
that's really why i like mentorship i
think is a really important thing and a
lot of people don't have that and that's
kind of what i want these sort of videos
to be is a little bit of men
taurine and not theoretical stuff not
like oh it'd be great if you did this
but of my actual life experience of me
saying this is what I did this is what
worked do with it what you will and so
that's my that's my little speech about
how YouTube ended up helping me get two
jobs not one but two and got my career
started for me as a developer and how
I'm very thankful about that and it's
