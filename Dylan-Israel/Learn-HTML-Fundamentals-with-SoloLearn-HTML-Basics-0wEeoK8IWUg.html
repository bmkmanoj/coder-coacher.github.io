in solo learning doing HTML basics
we're in HTML doing a channel basics so
let's jump in real quick Google this
section is a lot longer than the last
one we just did so that's good so
there's a paragraph tag on the paragraph
tag is use with a P and it has an
opening tag and a closing tag so as we
just said you have an opening tag and a
closing tag and let's go ahead and
demonstrate that that's where you put
text in you'll be treated as if it's a
paragraph so it won't you'll see that if
we have three paragraphs it will be on
separate lines because that's how what a
paragraph would normally be broken up
the BR / will add a single line it
basically starts a new line if you need
that without the text blocks so these
are BR / suic paragraph paragraph this
is a line break so it drops down now
with paragraph it adds a little bit of
extra spacing as what it was saying in
there so fill in the blanks we want a
closing paragraph tag and then this is
our BR / there we go text formatting so
you can format elements using B for bold
big I didn't know about big I know about
small so I guess I should have known
about big so you have all these little
text I'll show you how this works right
which is pretty cool so yeah insert
let's see if it actually will open this
up with all the examples so long since
I've tried this so we can see it's going
to run this and we can see the output so
big text you see bold big text italic
text small text strong texts subscripted
text superscripted text is very social
script detects inserted text and then
deleted Texas you want to put this one
is probably one that you'll use quite
often especially when you do like to do
list and you're learning something new
things like that let's go ahead and jump
back in so what's your tags make the
text bold you have BM that's strong
you can format elements as we just
showed okay so you can farm out a lot of
different things it's going to fill in
the correct tags so if we are trying to
make this bold or strong like so and
then portent X subscript it I believe
that was sub and sub or a flawless
champion sprinkle headings lines and
comments so comments are pretty crucial
to your code so headings are basically
various sized text you it goes from h1
being the largest to h6 being the
smallest you can see right here the
output pretty straightforward
it's a heading it's supposed to you know
be big be bolder showcase what's going
on so h1 to h6 I have a headings
horizontal lines these are basically
lines that go across your screen as you
can see right here so you have auras on
to line and this will be used to the
showcase a couple different things that
wasn't supposed and let's go ahead and
continue on right how do you need to
indicate a horizontal line is that HR
for horizontal line now your comments in
HTML are as a caret exclamation point -
- and then - - Gary to end it with your
comment going in between there you may
use comments to explain stuff in your
code or anything like that or anywhere
they're necessary use them as needed
it's better have too many comments that
not enough in my opinion so let's do the
dash dash dash dash Kari
elements so HTML elements such our P
tags BR slashes all these are elements
so some don't have intact so if it
starts with a slash if the first tag
starts to flash like the BR tag there is
no closing tag
NHL elements because this is tags open
tag
well it cannot have a closing tag so it
could be tags I believe it's only tags
these hmm in ancient let's go back right
so actually start tag and an end tag
with the content in between ok so
apparently even though some things don't
have tags they're still considering the
content and to have an opening closing
tag okay I was thinking that maybe
logically that wouldn't be correct since
there are elements that don't have that
but maybe they're written in the same
way that it just ignores it or says that
it's undefined or something I'm not
quite sure you know it's not over here
over there just understand how to use
tags filaments are quite small sample
contents within a break tag and you
don't have an opening closing ax every
single element okay so in our example
here remember the title tag will let us
set the the name of the page oh excuse
me this is our head tag sorry guys and
we have our title track and we're Picasa
our title content so we have our closing
title tag are nice we're now down to
attributes which often times I will call
parameters so if I say that I've
apologised they're actually attributes
so in this case you'll see we have a
line equal to Center which you can go
ahead and pass on things typically
you'll want to do this with just CSS in
a class or something but what they do is
they modify the tag attributes are
specific to attack and they modify as so
in this case the horizontal rule
remember the line
we can go ahead and set that to be 50
pixels long so with the width attribute
you can use pixels or percent to define
how far is the width attribute is so you
also have a alai match route which you
can pass in something like this to
Center it so what attribute is to line
the contents of an element to the right
center left that would be a line and
then finally attributes a contradictory
at times so what happens well you sent
our paragraph byte because this is
inline styling it's always going to
override the parent which in this case
would be paragraph and so we want to go
ahead and align the paragraphs like so
just grab my glasses dirty and continue
on some images see right here images
have a source tag this basically
location the image display and then it
also have the closing tag similar to a
br slash right so that would be IMG so
there's only one tag with images the alt
so in case the image cannot be displayed
the alt attribute specifies an alternate
text that describes the image in words
so if this doesn't display that's good I
doesn't actually going to showcase it
here I guess we could so we'll just add
like 1 5 6 and then we'll say no whoops
see so you'll see right here this is
what displays with the alt tag when this
image is not found so people can see
what it's supposed to be maybe or maybe
you just want to keep it as a hair
message Sam that's what the alt tag does
what attribute should be used to add an
image URL so that would be the source
this is the where the file is located
the source of the file you can also
resize an image with those attributes so
you have a height you have a width that
sort of
can use pixels or you can use
percentages this is a very good point so
if you know you're not going to need a
4000 by 4,000 pixels
you should probably lower it to the 100
and save as 150 550 or somewhere a
little bit closer to increase the speed
of your site so what your app at roots
can you use to resize images inside HTML
code you have with any of hight image 40
Council put border on images so image
and that our source is SRC that's where
things are located the a tag is the H
ref tag is basically allows you to
create links it doesn't basically allow
you to do that I don't know I said that
that's exactly what it does so a lot of
user create links the anchor tag also
always has a closing and opening tag
unlike images as most tags do because it
needs to know for for where it needs to
go so you see right here the a href this
is basically where you want them to
relocate to when they click this so HRF
is the location of where we're trying to
go the target attribute so the target
attribute is a little bit of what
happens when you do this now by default
if you don't set target it will just
take the page you're currently on and go
to now if you want that that link when
you click it when you click learn
playing here to open a new window you
need to reset that value to target
underscore blank I believe in HTML 5 you
can just put blank and it should work
the same as well so it's going to
continue on so pretty cool so list lists
are also really important you use these
quite a bit there's ordered lists which
means that these lists objects when you
open this up will come out with numbers
it's going to run this real quick so
you'll see 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 so this is an ordered
list
and then there is unordered list which
I'm sure they'll come up with in a
second so under the tag corresponding
list item so though you define what type
of list but oh well tag if it's ordered
list and then that how many list items
using the Li tag when you have unordered
lists which are basically the same thing
except there's not numbers included in
them so you see dots instead now you can
style these various different ways but
that's basically the difference between
unordered lists and ordered lists and
you'll see right here you have a ul so
this is an unordered list that starts
right here and has list items within
each one here each list item has an
opening and closing tag as well then
there's tables a lot of stuff goes on
with tables tables are really only if
you're displaying very static data right
so like if you're going to play
statistics you're going to display
something where it's like there's row a
row and then columns of data in there
that's really the only time you're going
to use a table so you're going to start
off with a table tag and then you're
going to find define your table row your
TR and then your define table data
within there which are three columns
right so in this table it's one it's a
single table with one row and three
columns as we see right here so it's
used to create columns in a row that
would be our TD table data and then you
can also define a boarder on here so
let's go ahead and open this up now
sometimes you may want your table to
take up more than two slots like
typically it will take up only one
column and want a row in the table but
you'll see right here this one right
here takes up two slots we have three
columns you see red green and blue our
table row which is basically right here
and then we have tables this column
table column table column and then we're
having an empty data and then we have
another empty data here except it's
taking up two rows we're doing that with
the call span equal to two
what after is used for self x12 or more
and you can set this to however many as
you want in our case it was to culture
man demonstrates culture on street and
action we really showcased that so you
see right here now we're just passing in
data and it's going in like so before
it's just empty so we want to have our
table row you have to have a table row
to have table columns or table data
which are your columns and then you've
forced me to define that you're working
with in a table you can also set
background color aligned attributes as
well in here so you see right here this
is a setting of the color for just the
table data instead of one thing here so
that background is red used to change
the color so though it's BG color and
then in line in block elements now this
is something that I am guilty of not
being the best with is keeping track of
in line and block element so we might
slow down for a second here so we're
setting the background color to green
and the font color to white and having
some padding having this basically just
how much space the element has around it
so you'll see right here has a padding
top padding in-between padding on the
left having on the bottom and then this
is just based off this space so you'll
see right here we're setting in the
color this is CSS at this point we're
setting the color of a single word
important in red so the div element
defines a block level section and
document the span element of up defines
the inline section of talking so what
this means is a div is considered to
take up an entire space like there's
actually space allocated to the div
while the inline section is just more
focused on the element interact with the
element doesn't take up space it just
does stuff based off what you say that's
probably very poor description of it but
that's what
sense to me ah the block level elements
are divs
given h1 there we go H ones have space
around it as well well meanwhile the
reason that bold and was it bold and em
don't because they don't take up
anything they just all through things so
in line elements cannot contain any
block level elements did another
so these are some very specific things
here can you insert a block element
inside an inline element let me go back
real quick what is scoops back to far
so you can insert inline elements inside
block elements you cannot what's up no
just your quarry
why you can insert inline elements
inside block elements for example you
can multiple span elements inside a good
villain inline elements cannot contain
any block elements okay can you insert a
block element inside Emily no no and
then forms so you did a lot of forms
data analytics and gathering data is
very big so be be be comfortable with
forms not too hard it's just about
capturing data and then sending it to
the database that's the hard part and
formatting it the way that you want it
so HTML forms are used to collect
information from the user so you have a
form tag the action attribute will point
to a web page that will load after the
user submits a form so usually when the
form is submitted you want it to go
somewhere else you do that back so that
would be the action attribute cool now
oh this gets a little this is a little
interesting so the method here people
who are just learning a channel may not
understand what like a restful api is
and get imposed to this may be a little
work a little complicated but when you
use get the form data will be visible
from the pate in the page address use
post the form it's updating data include
sensitive information basically and the
only thing to really keep out of this is
that post is more secure and thing good
that's really what you need to know now
I can also name a form you know which
you may refer to later on so that's
what's the name attribute here the input
element has as many variations depending
on type a it can be a text it can be a
password radio what's basically a just a
text box that you would enter stuff into
oftentimes you'll sell this so these are
both inputs one is for username one is
for password in this example
so based off what you said it in this
case password it's going to a stir it
like a stir it like that so into a type
for password type would be equal to
password and it would inherit some
properties based off where you set that
attribute to now value is a interesting
thing that you'll use quite a bit when
dealing with inputs so sometimes
especially an angular if you make if you
do that you'll use value quite a bit ng
value actually so sometimes you may just
want a boolean value which is a true or
false variable such as in the this may
be outdated with the social justice
warriors out there but may say your
gender is male or female so but you know
ten years ago that was a boolean as I
would you're either male or you're
either female and so this is a one or
two value true or false basically and
you may store it in the database like
that while you still may want to display
male or female to the user that's
basically what's going on there so we
have our form our methods post our
action is just to redirect exactly to
where we're at so don't do anything and
then we're going to say let the input
type is submit and and it's going to
close the form as well cool
so the submit button submit the form to
the action attribute so basically that
URL will then send the data there that's
more or less what you know after the
form is submitted the data should be
processed on a server using a
programming language such as PHP which
is something that you will do quite
often you could maybe do note as well
I've done this with PHP in the past for
work and whatnot so which value for the
type attribute turns the input tag into
a submit button just submit
HTML colors lots of different colors in
HTML you can have hexadecimal values 16
values 0 the rest can you on 3 go
through F as we just said so give your
RGB scale that overlaps right here you
can do it as let's just can get to the
questions what color your model does
HTML es this is RGB color values you can
also set color values using the hashtag
Supan or you can state the color so was
the color black leave of 0 0 0 by hex
characters as they say so hashtag that
so in our example here you set it which
I guess is a dark blue and then a
hashtag F all the way across is white so
body we're going to set color and excuse
me BG color and then we're going to go
ahead and set this to hashtag white and
finally we have frames so I don't know
the last time I use the frame the frame
tag specifies one specific window within
a frame set each frame in a frame set
can have different attributes such as
border scrolling the ability to resize
frame set element specifies the number
of columns or rows in a frame set as
well as what percentage or number of
pixels of space each of them occupies
the frame set is not supporting a
channel on so this is this is outdated
guy so you probably shouldn't be using
this moving forward we'll continue doing
it
rows and columns will indicate the size
and then use nor size actresses whether
user can resize the element or not it's
also a source
again the frame tag is not supported in
html5 what actually from Trent the North
sighs I believe it was let me go back it
was n lr e sighs I know I get know
resized oh that makes sense
no resided as in north east side and
let's go on to our question here when
formatting text can you get the same
result when using different tags yeah
when formatting text can get the same
result and formatting when formatting
text can you get the same works awfully
so yes so weird question what does the H
attribute contains the URL to be
transferred to good which check contains
fill tags resize the table tag TD which
second change cell types
so yes gr there you go Taylor Rowe what
is HTML stands for hypertext markup
language and choose the current HTML tag
for the largest heading so h1 its
largest all the way down to h6 the
smallest which is these tags are table
tags table row table table row table
table row table data you know and then
we have film the blank fill we want our
form the methods posts the image tag
here no side closes we have a line break
then we input another type is equal to
text what the name is equal to name cool
and finally align the text of the
paragraph to the right so we can do this
by using the divs and we're going to
line it right cool
so that was our first section our second
section HTML basics moving forward we
will do challenges which should be fun
hopefully but that is for that was
there's a lot going on in there I hope
