that we're gonna do is we're gonna
actually import an audio file show you
how to do that and how to get it to play
so if you haven't done this before it's
similar to importing a font so we're
gonna import it using an audio tag we're
gonna actually assign an ID here so that
we can target it later you then put the
source of the file like you would
anything else and then you have what
type it is in this case is audio and pay
so in our jQuery here that we have setup
remember our document already is just
basically saying hey Ren jQuery in here
onload so we're gonna go ahead and just
set a variable here and we'll call it
buzzer equal to I always put the quotes
first so we're gonna sittin equal to the
ID buzzer and except because there's so
many things in the audio file it's an
array we actually only want the zero
index now what is this gonna do now so
now when we call our variable and we
call the play function on it when our
page loads it should say our times up
times up there it goes
cool so that's how you're gonna get it
play now the reason I'm showing you this
is just because as of right now I'm
probably not gonna go through a game and
again everything counting down so the
first thing that I want to do is I want
to remove this reset button this is only
supposed to be shown when our break time
is over at least that's how I wrote it
so definitely a matter of opinion so the
way that we can do that is we're going
to target the reset ID and then
put dot hide here
so onload it's gonna actually hide that
reset button so it's gonna save it and
we should see it hiding so cool there
it's gone now we have a much more easier
is everything's looking a little bit
more clean than it was before now I'm
looking at this and I'm thinking okay
where's the next good place to start
well why don't we do the addition and
the subtraction button so we started
pretty straightforward so let's go ahead
and do that the way that you're gonna do
that is with a simple click function
we'll do the minus five o'clock right
here first so give a little space here
I'm going to say look when you are going
to be messing with the ID minus five
o'clock we want you to one second guys I
thought that the autorun was driving me
nuts and I was making my screen flash so
what we were trying to do here is we
want to take our minus five o'clock and
we want to say look when you click this
I want you to run a function that does
some stuff now what's that stuff well we
need to get this value and then minus
Phi from it so the first thing we're
actually going to need to do here is
create a variable to get that value
fright when we enter in so we'll go
ahead and just create a variable in this
case I call it count we're gonna set it
equal to so now this is gonna be a
string and the correct way to do this is
really to turn it into an integer so
we're gonna parse it and then in here
we're going to go ahead and target break
now
and then we're just going to call dot
html' and we forgot some brackets here
and we it's good to check to make sure
you did everything right before moving
on so we'll go ahead and console dot log
out our count let's go ahead and pull up
the console real quick save our code
let's run it we should get five there
goes and then there's our five minutes
an integer if it was a string of being
quotes cool so let's go ahead and - is
five o'clock function right now so the
first thing that we can do is pretty
pretty straightforward we want to say
look count is equal to count minus five
now the better way of writing that is
just putting - equals five so I have my
things subtract each time so look at in
a console that log out our our count
here now what's actually gonna happen is
we're unique we're gonna need to change
that HTML value so that's pretty
straightforward so what we'll do here is
we'll go ahead and do it like so we'll
just target it R value which we called
at that point an ID of num and we're
gonna say look change the HTML to our
count value so we were basically mining
five now we're doing it so let's go
ahead we run it and then we want to - so
there's 0 you see the value change
there's negative 5 negative 10 negative
15 now this doesn't do us a lot of good
because we don't want to have a we don't
want to work negatively so we're gonna
set a little bit of logic here that's
only gonna basically let it run if
count is greater than five that's all
we're gonna do basically saying look you
have to work at least five minutes or no
this is going to make any sense because
you can't work a negative amount hours
so it's going to save that and we will
actually reset this value real quick to
25 and move on so let's see here so
let's go ahead and run this so we're at
25 so there's something broke count is
greater than five
interesting so save and did we change
the wrong one
no we've set this to break no so what we
needed to set this to with no there we
go
now let's go ahead and - so run our code
in just a second here so we go - there
we go and it'll go all the way down to
five but it won't go back so in the next
video what we'll do is we'll do next so
you won't set up the Edition and we'll
set up the subtraction and addition for
break time so thanks for watching guys
as always and don't forget to like it ah
you know what all that
we're only four minutes in let's go
ahead and do the addition this'll be
real quick what's so great about this is
a lot of the functionality is the same
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
copy and paste this is save some time so
go ahead and take this instead of minus
five o'clock we're going to change this
to add five o'clock and same thing minus
the if statement because we don't care
how long you work till if you got that
type of grind you know god bless
we'll go ahead and add a plus on here go
ahead and save it let's go ahead and
clear this we're also gonna run this
shouldn't load in just a second
you can also comment out this for a
future so doesn't mess with our numbers
so we're able to - so there's 20 goes up
25 30 35 so there we go back and forth
and we're gonna do the same thing here
except now we're just gonna do it for
the break time so let's clean this up a
little bit tighten it up a little bit
just gonna copy and paste both these now
the - and the add and instead of at 5
o'clock it was - I break and had 5 break
so we're gonna change this first 1 - 5
o'clock is going to be -5 break and then
same concept except we need to create a
new variable because that time may be
different so we're gonna do the same
thing here except we're gonna have a var
break time and we're gonna do the same
thing parse the int we're gonna have a
target deep break num the number that is
on our page get the value from the h2
now to do alright that looks good now
we're gonna go back down here and we're
say if break time it's greater than 5
break time
ma is equal to break time minus 5 and
then we're gonna change the value of
break num to reflect break time and when
you take out these consoles at this
point because we know our code works
we're just changing values so let's
clean up our code
so there's our minus five break now
let's do the same thing for add five
break and we say break time it's equal
to break time plus five and we want to
target our break numb and we want to
change output to break time value to it
and we'll take this out
save our code let's run it should go in
a second here alright so we haven't
changed this to 25 so this still works
cool all the way down this won't - five
oh it looks like our oops so something's
wrong with our add five o'clock add five
break let's go here we have a add five
great
click function break time + equals 5
break now oh here it is right here so
our HTML is incorrect so let's go one
more time and run it usually a little
syntax errors luckily so now we can have
it just funny so I said you're gonna be
able to add and change this value up
next we'll do is some Java code showing
how to do a count down real quick so
we'll see that in the next video
