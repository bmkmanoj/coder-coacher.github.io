back in free code camp oh my goodness we
are now we're cook atomy it's been a
while it's been a while since I've
another cook category video we were back
in code Academy and we are doing make a
website they revamp this I got an email
today we're even have to check it out so
we're just gonna go ahead and get
started we're on site structure site
structure so Ollie bike sharing shares
the wheels the world yeah yeah
so if you're unfamiliar with HTML
typically there's a head file where you
kind of put all your general stuff
that's not gonna be viewed on the page
such as the stylesheet the list all
referring to the stylesheet they've met
a char set I tell these truths I don't
even know what that is I'll top my head
and like the title of it so in here it's
asking us to change the text that
appears between the h1 tag so h1 is a
heading so let's just go ahead and so
handy this just big font essentially
comes in various sizes so you're
building a website so we'll just
we'll do it coding tutorials 360 alright
so use the largest heading to indicate
the name of your website in the
index.html don't copy and paste
all right so I guess they want us to use
let's see if we can use what we want to
type we may have to use what they give
us cool so there's our coding tutorials
360 and now we'll use a smaller heading
in h3 and we'll say something like
entry-level program he goes we had to
run that cool so you can see obviously
the massive difference between an h1 and
h3 there so the next thing we're going
to do is a PTAC for a paragraph and here
we're gonna say something like add me on
Twitter Instagram Facebook and become a
patron at patreon a little bit of
shameless self-promotion you'll see this
will typically the the PTAC will
typically drop down a line as well
alright so pretty straightforward so far
so it shows us how to add a link so it's
an anchor tag and then the href is the
where we put the URL and then that
everything in between now we can do this
for an image or we can do it for text
like we're about to do right now or
button so let's get started let's create
a car elements and visitors loose web
pages all right
a href equals
www.payoor.com slash coding tutorials
360 so we start with an a tag and like
with most tags we have to close it
Oh
let's create an anchor element to send
reserves
does they want alright so they wanted us
to put that line the text specifically
all right so here's a use and anchor
element to link the word list to the URL
cities dot HTML
alright so we're gonna look for the word
list right here same thing we're gonna
credit a tag and put it to cities dot
HTML and then we're gonna close it after
list apologize fight like off a little
bit guys I'm battling the flu at 102
degree fever yesterday I feel much
better today time to get back to the
grind you know I mean all right so hey
let's see here
so what's a quick note that this is
talking about a relative URL so if
you're on the main page there easily
have to put city HTML is because it's
already within the same folder structure
so that's why we don't have to put Olly
back column slash city sign at HTML so
aah oof dice well this from CIT IES dot
HTML did you set the href attribute to
cities
yeah let me just go ahead and copy and
put this in here I don't know it might
be some sort of syntax thing cuz it
looks correct to me oh you know what I
don't think it wants I don't think it
likes this any tag here I would bet
No
yeah I'm having trouble man what was it
going on here was wrong with my coat
hmm so apparently it didn't like how we
did our h2 our anchor tag in the
previous example and that was where our
air was I don't know at what point you
told us get rid of that
but hey you live in your learn just it's
more important to know the concept so
what are we looking at here so attribute
name right here is the href then the hat
should be a value and in the link text
this is probably something we should
have a minute before you got started but
I don't make those decisions especially
if you're a beginner it's gonna be a
little intimidating so index I hom line
below the paragraph element add an image
element okay so the way so we're gonna
add an image down below so the way that
we add images it's pretty simple you say
image and then the source and then you
put the URL typically and you'll notice
that you'll put a slash at the end the
reason for that is because there's no
closing attribute on images so you just
put the slash their closing tag excuse
me
let's go ahead and run this there's our
bikes alright one change of photos that
the image element displays simply set
the value SRC there different photos URL
so again we're just changing what photo
essentially here in practice if you're
looking to do this on any sort of
project typically just buy yourself a
website off GoDaddy
it'll cost you like 3 dollars a month
and you save as your storage let's just
so you know something I've done in the
past
alright awesome the photos excellent
page for much cooler so the next thing
we're gonna do is it looks like implant
and video so index.html please - image
element so that we can use the space
okay
simply delete
the 10 name it Shaq here run it now
we're gonna put in a a with a night so
if you look up here I'll give you a kind
of an idea what's going on it should be
pretty intuitive eighty HTML is pretty
cool like that so you know video with
height you can kind of guess pretty
easily even if you never saw a line of
HTML what that wouldn't be referring to
so width in the heights of the video
controls maybe you wouldn't know off
straight off the bat so oops and this
has a closing tag and this is going to
be somewhat similar in this case we're
just gonna say source SRC equals then
the URL we'll just go ahead and cop yeah
let's see did they give us a Europe okay
they did so we just go ahead and throw
that in there and then we have to set
the type to video slash mp4
I think I should do it so you'll see
here our controls here is with the light
that we set for it so everything's
slowly coming together here so next
thing we're gonna be messing with is
ordered lists and unordered lists the
only difference between an order list
and an unordered list is that a ordered
list is a list of numbers unordered list
is just dots or some sort of styling
typically dots unless you change it in
the CSS so let's see here
our navbar will fill with bugs company
heading so to create something lilies
between body in each one all right so
we're gonna basically show how to create
a simple navbar right now looks like so
first we will create an h2 element to
service the heading for the nav bar all
right so h2 and we're just gonna call
this Olley Olley Olley Olley
bad joke all right so the next thing
we're gonna do is we're going to create
a UL unordered list to create out oh
well we would just create a we had to
create an ordered list for you just use
oh well and if you like me you just go
ahead and copy that throw it out three
four times and then we are going to be
typing in sign up
search bikes reserve a bike
about us I'm gonna run that you'll see
our for a lil you else
nice little explanation here
parent-child pairing element
children again I kind of find it a weird
that they do it and to me it seems like
it's in reverse order but I guess they
want you to read through all this I
typically kind of glanced through it
alright first we'll close all elements
between body and the development with
the class div class container so these
are kind of how you group things
together they're like boxes essentially
and you boxing's in a certain area so in
this case we want to put akin to our
container here
and we want to take in everything that
body contains
well that was probably so I go that
looks very contained all right uh next
what we want to do is create a div class
for our navigation buttons right here so
we'll go ahead and do that as well oh
all right the reason you kind of do this
is for CSS purposes it's also for
organization purposes but uh I mean
that's not the only reasons I'm sure but
that's the only reasons that I would
really do this all right so in this case
we gave it nav and now you can see that
it's inherited some sort of styling from
over here so nav gives it a little poops
what is going on here so nav gives it a
little bit of background color yellow
and width
okay so far so good
and then finally close the company h1
and h3 paragraph and video third day of
comb main all right so last but not
least we have our final div here and
we're gonna call it main
mmm-hmm go ahead and close that div and
we're going to run that and now it's
much more organized so everything that's
going on here this is one div this is
another div and this is another div
right here or maybe this is so you can
see you like one day of two div three
diff thats it this kind of tells it so
they go over a few of the more technical
stuff like doctype HTML i've just kind
of says hey this is a HTML document oh
let's find out what minister I said tell
us the rebbe web browser which character
you use character set all right it's not
that exciting and that that's pretty
much it guys so I'll see you in the next
Co Academy video and I'll probably have
Koch Adam II Pro by the end to do the
pro stuff as well I'm just waiting back
to hear from Koch Adam II if it's
against their Terms of Service for me to
record their pro content if it's not
