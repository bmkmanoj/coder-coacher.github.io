island of knowledge of the intro section
doing array maximal adjacent difference
so what we're trying to do here is find
out the absolute value of a difference
between some numbers so there's there's
a two difference here there's a three
difference here so let's we return three
all right
seems easy enough right well let's go
ahead and get started I screwed this
variable called back stiff max diff gets
initialized to the first value because
that's what I kind of decided to go with
just to set the tone I guess you don't
have to initialize it this is something
I've started doing quite a bit is if I
know I'm going to be checking for R
value I'll just initialize it to the
very first one and go from there so
we're giving an apt remember we're doing
the absolute difference so now use the
method absolute and then we start a for
loop now on 1 instead of 0 because we
initialize it as I said 1101 and we say
while I is less than our input array
length go ahead and get a rate for each
one now here we I create a variable you
don't have to create a variable again it
sometimes I just do this to really
camera at home so what I'm saying is if
current diff which is current difference
is equal to the map not absolute of the
item the previous item to our current
item
so hey go ahead and get the absolute
value of our previous index - our
current indexed and if it happens that
the current dip is greater than max dip
go ahead and set that and we can
actually we can do it like this
forget the s statement we'll just do a
ternary so max dip is equal to the
statement current disc greater than max
dip if that's true we can go ahead and
set the value to current if-else set it
to max if this is a ternary looks a
little cleaner in my opinion so we're
going to be the difference with current
decimal or say hey if it's larger than
this go ahead and set the value to that
if it's not just set it back to itself
at the end here we're just going to go
ahead and return our car max dip assume
we know syntax mistakes I think that is
it submit it kind of a strange one for
being so deep so far into it but confide
sort of difficulty is all over the place
maybe if you didn't know about the math
library might been a little bit harder I
guess you might learn that but as always
guys thanks for watching the video don't
forget to comment like subscribe and
share and if you would like to support
me on patreon that's great and we have
our Facebook group and our discord
channel all that good stuff all those
links are in the description I hope that
you are studying algorithms as I'm using
I'm using this as a way of prepping
because even even though you can study
things like binary trees and and big
o-notation you should if you really want
to get one of those super like Facebook
Google jobs because that's what they're
going to test you on stuff like this
it's good prep for a practical coding
interview which will give you a couple
algorithms similar to maybe harder than
this and my experience a lot harder than
this and go and solve it and if you've
trained yourself to be able to solve
these quickly and you're prepared you'll
you know you could get a job out of it
down the road you know go from there
but as always guys thank you for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video hey guys thanks for watching the
video especially thanks to our sponsors
dev Mountain if you're looking for a
coding boot camp where tuition and
housing is included definitely check
them out
appreciate it I'll see you guys in the
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
