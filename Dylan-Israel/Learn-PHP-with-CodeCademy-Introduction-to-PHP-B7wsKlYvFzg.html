PHP you can see I already took one
section here and did this a while back
so we're just gonna work our way through
this so welcome to PHP introduction to
PHP and code can be so like they usually
do there can showing us how to do some
things here I'm not expected to know
exactly so we'll just take a look at it
so similar it looks like it's similar to
HTML and this link is kind of for
styling purposes and title and why don't
we just click to submit and this changes
so we'll what's going on here but let's
go ahead and jump right into it alright
and I'm gonna have to reset the code
it's like I said I've done this before
so we've written a little PHP to the
editor to the right but it's not
complete on line eight type my first
line of PHP in the bracket so if I had
to guess I'm guessing that echo is Z
so that's right paragraph all right ice
let's reset the code one more time
we're gonna copy and paste this in here
there we go nope I sure might've just
misspelled something all right
so echo prints out a statement in the
paragraph PHP code always goes in
between the bracket question mark PHP
and the end question 1 okay
and we used echo output I'm learning PhD
so use that go to output your name so in
this case is simply echo Dylan something
cold don't you work just fine there's my
name all right
I have noticed that our main file is now
dot in index dot PHP
instead of indexed at HTML
and then is asking us to once again use
that ago don't you love your PHP and
semicolons are you there
oops let's refresh the page
cool area all right reset the cone as
always this we're doing something right
go ahead and add echo of your choice on
line eight some line eight we're gonna
say echo hello since we have an issue
let's try and just rate issue with code
Academy try it only time see if it goes
ahead there we go
my quite sure what's going on in there
end but we'll keep it going
alright so in this case in addition to
opening strings PHP can also do math so
in between the PHP anchors we are going
to use echo to calculate 17.3 semicolon
BAM
so it's 2091 ought to get word for it
alright variables so in order for PHP
declared variable we have to do that
cash money sign for it so in this case
cash money my name is what they want us
to clary equal and then it because of
how we're gonna claim what we're
declaring here to the string we have a
use it like that
save us well turn out our semicolon
let's go ahead and refresh the page
I like turn adblock off mr. main that
maybe that has something amusing found
that happen with others I swear oh god
someone : good alright so there we go
hopefully that was the issue we've
forgotten our semicolon so doesn't works
we have to add one for slide 9 here
alright so we need to add a comment this
double slash is save and submit
cool now create a variable declare
variable my name and give it your name
as a stream so remember
cash money is how we declare variables
here and then we end our PHP code with
semicolon
and it says my name Dylan all right now
after we our first clue
variable to clear second my age we're
going to set that equal to 20 so it's
not going to be in practice really 27
cuz it's an integer or parenthesis
rather save them soon it could help me a
couple I say let's refresh the page
oh I see what happened okay so um the
issue we're having right now is they
don't this system the reason is getting
print out is because we never actually
declared our PHP so your own request
your mark PHP and here we are there we
go so now it's not printing out and it's
accepting our PHP variables so in here
it wants us to print out it's still in a
paragraph so we can do echo my name
semicolon echo
oops we need to actually do this in the
PHP code pick out my name you want to
try and have some standard spacing
conventions usually there will be Auto
formatter function in your development
environment but uh so Dylan in 27 and
you notice it does not print on same
line or you can have space at night so
that was our first introduction to PHP
not too bad and next what we're going to
be doing our conditionals and control
flow there should be someone similar to
most programming languages so it should
go pretty quick
see you guys that's video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
