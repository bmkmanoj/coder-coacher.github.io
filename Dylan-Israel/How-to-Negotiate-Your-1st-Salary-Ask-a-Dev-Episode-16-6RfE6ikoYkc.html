asked me how to negotiate a salary when
you've never had one before right so a
lot of us are trying to better our life
with code we're going from jobs that may
have paid minimum wage or minimum wage
and tips or maybe 10 or 15 dollars an
hour and you know the recruiters can ask
you you know what do you expect to be
paid or the whoever you're interviewing
with and you want to make sure you get
paid the most amount of money and even
if you're not super confident you should
at least get a better salary right a
good salary and I I was one of those
people that always was bad with
negotiation with salaries but I always
relied on one thing to kind of get a
fair rate and it's just one thing I want
to share with you because I know it's
really awkward for a lot of people right
you don't want to scare them away
because you're like damn I finally got
it I finally got a job right you've been
working so hard you're to be a developer
you've been even in the grind you're
like god I'm so happy someone's going to
make me an offer I can start working as
a developer and not just practicing and
studying someone's actually going to pay
me to learn it's pretty exciting you
don't want to mess that up so when I
negotiated my current salary in my
previous salary it's well I the way that
I negotiated it was pretty simple they
asked me what I expected to be paid and
I told them I wanted whatever the
average salary for a web developer was
in the region and if you're curious on
you know what you can do to find that
out because the and the reason I say
that more than what we'll show you what
that is and sites that you can look at
but the reason that I say that is
because you can't really say that that
you deserve to be on the above than the
average right because if you're a junior
developer or you don't you've never
worked as a developer to be hard for you
to make that argument now you can
probably go just below the average but
at least you'll have an idea of where
you're going to float around but I also
think it's a pretty reasonable
expectation and you're not asking for
anything out of the realm of
was this guy want to get paid the
average right the average of what the
role should pay you're not making a
number up Edison here you can you're
going to be going to just google it
right now right so I'll do my example
this is how I know she ate it uh my
contract where I just said I wanted the
average of a web developer in Tampa
Florida and so you'll see right here we
have four salaries of positions that
fall into that and this is on indeed we
have kind of an idea so just so you know
my salary is between one of these four
numbers and I got the average which is a
nice raise from my previous job but when
I said that that was it everyone was
cool they made me an offer within the
range that I said they made me offer I
looked it up and here it was I said cool
thank you but this to me I think is when
you don't have anything and you're
feeling kind of self-conscious about
counter countering and you're not sure
what you should say um you can go to
sites like Glassdoor that's that's
probably my my favorite sites to check
salaries to see what's going on it all
depends right but last doors a great one
indeed also has self by use class tour
mainly to review companies we will see
right here the national average for a
web developer 66,000 according a glass
door now on the men's side that's 41,000
right you don't want to go them in
that's too low you want to go the
average because if you're confident and
you should be somewhat confident but you
that's a pretty solid argument right the
average is $25,000 more than the minimum
and you should always be striving for
the average or the max but when you
start you want to get your salary as
high as possible so when you're when
you're negotiating and you don't have a
salary to compare it to you know maybe
you were working at Domino's like I was
or what are you doing something like
that where like of course you're going
to make a massive jump in salary so it's
not an equivalent job asking for the
average salary as a junior developer or
developer it's your best strategy in my
opinion but definitely negotiate however
you feel comfortable but this is just
one way I think that you can make a
really reasonable request or argument
rather when talking with recruiters
because
when that when they bring it to their
person they're saying what does he want
he wants the average that sounds alright
like it but if you go above it or you go
below it because their job is get you to
take as little as possible really or get
a qualified candidate that will for a
good price and when you say the average
I think I think you're kind of meeting
everyone in the middle that's my two
