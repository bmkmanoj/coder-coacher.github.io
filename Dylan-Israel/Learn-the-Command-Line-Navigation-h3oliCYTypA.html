today learning the command line it's one
of the new new skills they've added if
you want call it that
lot of cool things in the command line I
use it I well I'd rather I used to have
my internship to pinging sites to see if
they're up and running properly and get
a response so hopefully we'll be able to
learn some cool stuff it's you can see
only two thousand people have already
enrolled in it and will just be doing
these it looks like there's four
sections so probably about 15 minutes of
section and let's get started in
navigating the file system navigation
alright so let's see here to access the
command line we use a terminal emulator
as you can see here often just called
terminal in the terminal after the type
LS and press Enter so let's see LS so
you should see the next three items
below the command
all right so Ellis do they tell us what
Ellis is really tell us in the next next
video so what's going on here okay so in
the terminal you'll see the cash this is
a shell prompt appears when the terminal
is ready to accept the command okay so
that just means it's working property
when you type LS the command will look
to a folder and then list the files and
folders inside of it cool so this is
like our list directory all right so
file they give us a little bit of a
technical what's going on here let's see
how to navigate the filesystem from the
command line in the terminate in the
terminal after the shell prompt so PWD
let's see what PWD does it's going to
give us it looks like our path so PWD is
our path by the looks of it so we want
to oh it's going to rather it's going to
print the working directory so that's
our directory that we're in so PWD cool
list all files in the working directory
so LS should list the file names and
then CD 2015 alright so CD is to change
the directory so we want to you can see
the hardware dot txt is actual file
well the 2014 to 2015 are folders so now
if we were to call LS on our list
directory 2015 because we're now on this
one it's going to print out these
folders and meanwhile if we need to type
in PWD you can see that art our space
has gone up to the 2015 so we want to
change the directory into the 2015 again
we then want to go to see here print
what's in this specific directory
rather change to that directory and then
we want to type CD dot dot and I believe
this takes us back a directory it's I
think daughter dot dot dot so let's see
here no uh PWD yes so this brought us
back to our last directory
I believe that's what it's gonna tell us
right now so see a change the directory
to the 2015 / v directory so and this we
want to change and this only works based
on where we are in our current directory
I believe so that way we couldn't go to
Jan / memory from a directory that
before then it wasn't it so everything
has to be the same up to that point so
we want to change the directory to Jan
slash memory
and right here you can see that we put
in something wrong so we'd probably put
a slash on it we don't need to sit down
change Directors still files 2015 /
better cheating
so CD 2015 I still Feb you hour / Feb
2015 there we go it is a directory
alright and then m'kay direct media
again what is this gonna do so I'm not
sure what m'kay directors I don't think
I've used that before so this stands for
make directory so now it looks like it
created a folder so if named Mediate
Creek here we use m'kay direct create a
new directory called media inside the
February okay cool
so now we want to CD to the 2014 /
December and then type touch key or txt
up Lucas opens the touch creates a new
file inside the direct working directory
okay so touch creates the file while the
previous command the MK direct creates
the folder I believe that's not that's
how I'm going to look at it yeah so the
touch mind creates a new file inside it
which it takes in a file name so we
named it keyboard txt and so so far
we've this is just a kind of telling us
what's going on here so we've basically
just been navigating through our
directory so far so PWD outputs the name
of the current directory you're working
in and let's list all files a directory
in that current directory directory CD
switches you into the directory that you
want an MK direct creates a directory
and touch creates a new file inside the
current directory nice
so I believe that it is the ending of
that it's a it looks like they do this a
little bit different but uh we're gonna
be learning some more stuff and this I
may just make this one video actually
I'm gonna break it up as we've been
doing so that's our first part to the
command prompt as you can see here we
did we did the first navigation portion
and next part is the mini bit
manipulation so we're gonna go ahead and
copy move and delete files and
directories from the command line next
