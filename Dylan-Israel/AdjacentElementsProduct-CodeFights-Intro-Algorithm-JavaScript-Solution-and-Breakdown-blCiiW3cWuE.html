adjacent elements products product and
the objective here is we get an array
and we want to know what the largest
number is that we can return if we
multiply adjacent elements meaning
elements that are next to each other
it's fairly straightforward what you
need to do to start off is well one way
to start off I would say is to create
your first product now originally I set
this to zero I just created
you know something called product and I
said equal to zero the reason that's
incorrect is because you may have a
negative product which will be greater
than zero so the easiest thing to do or
the thing that makes the most sense I
should say is to just initialize it to
your first value so we'll have an input
array one now if you understand why
we're doing this and what it means to be
adjacent and you understand what you
need to do in the for loop we're about
to create so we're going to create a
standard for loop of RI is equal to zero
and within the for loop or say well I is
less than our array that we're comparing
go ahead and increment by one we're
incrementing by one because we want to
check every single value now in here
what we need to do is just have a simple
if statement and within our if statement
we're going to check whatever iteration
I is on and then the item in front of it
and say hey if we multiply this if it's
greater than our product go ahead and
override the value of product to that
that's what we're doing so we can say if
our input array better yet I didn't do
this but this is a good example of a
ternary so we could say product is equal
to we could do our input statement as
instead of an if statement well
we can do is set product either equal to
itself or after evaluating our statement
here which is input a right I times
input array I plus 1 greater than or
equal to product so if it if that is
true we want to go ahead right here and
set this we'll set that equal to that or
just go ahead and set it back to itself
this is a ternary operator if you're not
familiar with it this is basically what
happens when it's true this is what
happens when it's Hulse and then at the
end here we want to return product we
run our test submit it we're good to go
now one other thing if for some reason
you find that confusing let's just show
a if statement of what I did last time
which is I'll go ahead and copy and
paste it in here which is the same logic
except we're saying hey if this is a
true statement go ahead and reset the
value again we're evaluating the
statement here in our ternary this is
our full statements is me and then we're
saying this is what happens when it's
true this is what happened when it's
false let's go ahead and get rid of that
is adjacent elements product you could
probably also convert this for loop two
for each loop if you really wanted to do
that no real need to though but as
always guys thank you so much for
