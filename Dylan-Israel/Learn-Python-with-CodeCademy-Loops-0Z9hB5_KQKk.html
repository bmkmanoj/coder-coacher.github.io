loops so we're gonna be messing around
with while loops and for loops should be
somewhat familiar if you've ever touched
any sort of coding before while loops
before loops are pretty much standard so
we have a little bit of I think they're
kind of giving a compare and contrast
here we know how to do if statements at
this point then we're saying if the
count is less than five print this and
you'll notice that while count is less
than five continue to run this so this
will one run once this will run five
times until it hits five and we increase
it by count by one every time so it
doesn't do an infinite loop oh it wants
us to less than or equal to they wanted
us to change that so it's going to
change that to less than or equal to
nine
well I countless listened mine oh is
zero at night so because we want it less
than there's ten so yeah there we go
so 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 so if we took
this out it would actually crash our
page because it'd be an infinite loop
see else it checks the condition all
right so we're basically studying a
boolean variable true and we're saying
while this is true print I am a loop
then we have it change the false so this
should print only one time I am a loop
so just using boolean x' to do the same
thing we don't actually have to say
while loop condition is equal to true
we're just inheriting the value while
this remains unchanged all right
so create a while loop that prints out
all the numbers from 1 to 10 squared
so while count is less than 10 our wall
num is less than 10 because they gave us
2 no less than 11 rather because we want
to include 10 one second guys I put a
fan out here and I can hear blowing into
the mic so let me change that all right
all right so while num is less than 11
we want to fill the blank space in
certainly putting that number so we want
to square this
alright so print num times no or to the
second power it actually saw they want
to do it and then num equals num plus 1
that's it so you see one four nine etc
simple air so film the loop condition so
the user will be prompted for a choice
over and over while choice does not
equal Y and choice is unequal and so
we'll say well choice it's not equal to
Y or a choice it's not equal to n good
so we'll just put G sorry I didn't catch
that enter again and we'll put in yeah I
put Y alrighty so while this is not
equal to it
well it's just like why isn't this
working I should do we need to break it
do we run an infinite loop I don't think
so so rotten input enjoying the course
yes sir no wow this is not equal to that
so it's got to go the QA forum and see
what's going on because I'm why can't I
use or is that what we're doing here so
that might be it
oh there we go alright so this needs to
be hand because in theory I'll have to
refresh this page in theory it's always
gonna be one or the other not be one of
the other so while it's not a why it
could be in an alliance an N is happy
why so same thing we just did there
except will say well choice is not equal
to Y and choice it's not equal to
Soji should run one time why there you
go
so we're good to go on that so the loop
in the editor has two problems this
missing : a syntax error in count is
never incremented logical error the
latter will slot in if and loop be sure
to fix both before running so while
count is less than 10 colon print count
count and increment count equals count
plus 1 good to go see what break does
feel free so break is gonna break the
loop so once we get it greater than or
equal to 10
break it this is another way to do it
just depends on what you want to do so
see you while in else in action so we're
gonna do it looks like we have a wall
count that's less than 3 generate a
random number if the numbers equal to 5
prints are you loose else increment the
count plus 1 so basically it runs three
times and see if we went three three one
we won because we've made it to three
without it hating 5 that's all that's
going on there so let's see here use a
while loop to let the user keep guessing
so long as guesses underscore left is
greater than zero so wall guesses
they're left it's greater than zero
ask user for the guests
alright um so say equals user or excuse
me
int because we want an integer or raw
underscore input that will do your guess
so we're gonna some input and we'll say
if we'll do a random random underscore
number it's equal to guess you're
exactly equal to guess
print
you win and then break
oops else we're going to decrement so
guesses find your score left equals
guesses underscore left minus one
using nails
use a nails case after your while loop
to print you lose so don't do else print
you lose period all right let's see if
we did everything right here so my guess
is three to one I lose and we have just
got our thousand exercise badge so as
crazy as it may seem we have done a
thousand exercises on cook Henry
apparently which seems like a lot well
then we've been at it so that's pretty
good right back to the four loops so
make the loop print the numbers from 0
to 19 it says 0 to 9 so that should be
it all right create a for loop that
prompts the user for a hobby three times
before I in range
4
we'll create a variable here we'll say
choice or new hobby that's a bad bad
name
we have hobbies we have a it's a good
variable name always fun time
this is an awfully fun time equals C
equals I forgot how to call it raw input
I'm just input and then hobbiest dot
append
hobbies happen oh they wanted to be
called hobby
alright so hobby oh we don't actually
ask for anything so we'll just say games
movies
Cody you get to so we actually got
probably easier yeah we got for I think
they wanted three but hey it worked
so alright at a second for loop so that
each character in the word is printed
one time so we'll say for I in the word
print I that should be it
so spam exclamation part eggs
exclamation point add your for loop
let's filter out the letter A for my
string do the following four inch our
character in the phrase and so we'll say
for a char in phrase if char is equal
equal to a or char c equal equal to a
little a prince x
shrinks with the trailing comma why do
we I'm not sure why we need to include
the trailing comma but we do see if it
says why in the hint here
oh yeah you know um otherwise else it
might just be so that combines these two
print statements even though they're not
on the same thing else print sure comma
all right let's see what's going on here
see if we did this correctly
don't delete this print statement okay
ex bird and the ant a bird in the hand
so just put a space in there maybe I'm
not really quite sure if the commas for
the trailing comma but maybe we'll find
out next next one so write a second for
loop that goes through the numbers
listen for each prints each element
squared each on this online so we'll say
for enum and numbers we want to print
num x times two
there you go on line five print the key
followed by space followed by the value
associated with that key only five print
the key followed by space followed by
this alright so put the key so print key
followed by a space plus a space
followed by the value associated with
that key
I believe that's what they're asking and
don't forget your plus try that one more
time there you go
a is Apple C is cherry B is berry we
don't the users see things listed from
index is zero since this looks unnatural
instead the item should appear starting
index one modify the printing I'm gonna
feel like this behavior see the hint for
help
alright so so for index print index plus
one I think that's what's asking so
instead it's still supplementing the
index before increasing it by one
because people won't understand why it
starts at zero even I don't understand
some of the times like all indexes start
at zero but hey they do so there you go
alright complete each pair of elements
and print the larger of the two so let's
do an if statement we're gonna say if a
is greater than B
print a else friend be there you go so
we're just saying if this value is
greater than its counterpart print that
if this is greater than the kind of
heart print that we're not printing all
of them we're just printing we're
comparing the you know if the zero index
is greater than B zero index so on and
so forth Oh click Save Co for else works
all right so let's see if we can
understand this print you have and then
for F in fruits banana and if it's a
tomato the tomato is not a fruit it
actually is print it breaks the the for
loop and that's that so it doesn't print
anything else out from there all right
modify its kind of editor sis just a for
loose else statement is executed just
take out the break and he goes all the
way through and build a for else name in
the editor here all right so let's but
it's alright so let's just do languages
our codes and we'll set this equal to
Python PHP and JavaScript all languages
we have done on code Academy among
others
so we'll say for I and and I could be
anything I just always use I because
that's what we used when I was first
taught Java so for I in codes print I or
print my
okay so one uh actually no just do it
simple code god I hope I spelled
language right
I'm so bad was filling and I will at
will quit I and then
and we'll do frying codes don't do a
while loop here actually well actually
this makes it was a real compilation it
will do a count equals zero and then
we'll do a while count is less than
three print this and then we'll
increment count equals count plus one
I'll break it and then we'll say if
count there's equal equal to three print
I
oops I know more but I'm too tired to
list them I Oh see if that worked
don't forget to : so if we did this
right it should print out Python code
language I need three times and they
should also print out this and there you
go make sure you're for with an else
else print
something something something there you
go
so we finish our loops we earned our
batch and in the next video we are going
to be working a little more with loose
and it's called practice makes perfect
so we'll probably just be going over
everything we did and as always
constructive criticism is appreciated
and if you ever have any WordPress
questions I'm trying to do some of my
own videos not just code Academy because
eventually we'll run out of coke Adam E
and sneak-peek they have a a preview of
their my sequel program that's coming
out soon so if you want to just kind of
get your hands on that making yourself
familiar with databases is a great way
to get your foot in the door I'm
learning that the hard way I have very
little experience and that's what I'm
doing in my free time as well so you
know I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
