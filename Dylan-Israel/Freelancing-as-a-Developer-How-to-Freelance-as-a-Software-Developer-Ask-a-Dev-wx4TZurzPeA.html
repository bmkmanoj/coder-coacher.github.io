freelancing how to get freelancing jobs
how to essentially land the contracts
and why you might want to do it and some
things to consider I mean at the other
day there are a ton of developers
looking to her work remote looking to
work for themselves as freelancers and
what I want you to do at the end day is
be able to be a freelancer and shout
show me the money which is a something
about 50% of you don't know what I'm
referencing but that's okay so we're
gonna be talking about freelancing and
some tips to get you up and going and to
make sure that you continue to land
those contracts man I think today's
sponsor study web development comm for
supporting the channel if you're
interested in freelancing they have an
awesome course at study web development

interested in that go to steady web
development comm so freelancing is
interesting because it is one of those
things that is often some thought sawed
off sought sought after and it is one of
the things that I think we're gonna
start this video by talking about why
you may want to freelance oftentimes the
idea and it's often comes from people
who aren't developers yet they love the
idea of freelancing and just working for
themselves which is possible but it's
also very stressful and this and it's a
lot of hard work and it's one of those
things where I would I definitely can
give some advice before you start to
freelance that I've learned throughout
the years of doing my own freelancing
and that is that you're going to you're
gonna put yourself in some uncomfortable
situations at times as you navigate
through which is one of the reasons that
you should educate yourself about the
freelancing process and how it all works
and and understand why you want a
freelance so you want to work for
yourself okay now do you want to work
for yourself or do you want to work
remote because those are two separate
things
we're gonna talk a little bit about that
at a later date and relate later date
being like in seven minutes I so love
just I want I want you to kind of
understand that when you're considering
freelancing really consider what it is
that you want cuz when you're freelance
there's no guaranteed paycheck if you
don't get clients and you don't get
contracts
you don't eat you know I mean like the
fridge is empty it stays empty the rent
isn't paid you may be living in the car
so freelancing is a great thing to have
but it's hard work and you are in
control of gathering your clients and
you know sometimes that's why you may
need a little help so what's the first
thing that you can do - excuse me - make
sure that you are gathering clients well
the most obvious thing is having an
impressive portfolio a lot of times
people ask me I want a freelance what
can I do I say well you know I'm not
being successful as freelancing how can
you actually send me your portfolio and
unfortunately it's just not at the
quality of what someone's going to pay
you for to be a freelancer it your skill
set needs to showcase that you have you
have projects that are relevant to what
it is that you're the people you're
trying to accomplish or acquire as
clients one so if you're going after
people in the food industry for instance
you need to have a beautiful food web
site or a site that is a beautiful
shopping sort of website a ecommerce
store if that's what you're going after
and if you just have I don't know a
JavaScript calculator and not something
that is more focused on web design width
functionality you're gonna really suffer
in that aspect so you need to make sure
that you have an impressive portfolio to
showcase your skills in the process
maybe some mock templates maybe some
even if you haven't actually sold your
templates you need to build these
templates to showcase of what you can do
and what you you know what you can do
for them and so an impressive portfolio
it's the obvious thing that you have to
have along the way now the next thing
number two is a slick sheet slash
introduction if you're not feeling the
slick sheet it's essentially a one-page
sort of you know one-page paper if you
will now this should be like a PDF that
you're going to send and
is gonna have all your skills it's gonna
have maybe one or two projects on it
it's gonna have essentially an
introduction as to you and what you're
you know quote unquote company can
accomplish and it's really important
because it's one of the things that a
lot of people don't a comp this is how I
got freelance work I created a slick
sheet I essentially had my my name my
number my email my contact information
and then I had screenshots along with
what sort of services I provided that in
that time is HTML CSS JavaScript
WordPress a little bit of jQuery and I
had I had websites that I built to
showcase what it is that I was going
after and links to projects and my
website of course where they could find
more so you need to have a slick sheet
so that you can not only if you're ever
meeting clients in person give them
something to take with them almost think
of it as an expanded business card with
a little bit of your portfolio attached
to it and that's really what the
solution is I encourage you to have that
my third tip is be willing to mean in
person oftentimes when you're when
you're starting out with freelancing
you're gonna essentially be scraping the
bottom of the barrel and that's okay and
a lot of the lot of people who don't
have a lot of money but they need to
hire a web designer for maybe fifteen
twenty thirty dollars an hour whatever
your freelance rate is you're gonna
they're gonna be very nervous about
actually paying for something they don't
understand and I have found that every
client that I ever had freelance there's
only about five or six I haven't had a
ton of freelance clients is that the
thing that really got me to seal the
deal with them was just taking an hour
out of my day one time to be willing to
meet in person and that allowed me to
introduce myself
it allowed me to showcase what it is
that I'm going to try and do for them
and how I'm going to help them
accomplish their goals and it also
allowed me to get better requirements
sometimes it's very hard to get
requirements over the phone or over the
email even through video chats a lot of
times they just want to see you in
person and it's not it's not always
possible for everybody for everything
but I think it's um I think it's really
helpful when you're dealing with people
who are on the fence essentially go in
there you shake their
and you talk about what it is you're
gonna do how you can help some things
you can't do sometimes right sometimes
it's like look you want me to build
Salesforce on fifteen hundred dollars
and whatever it is I can't pill Z so
source on that right it's just not
plausible and it allows you to
essentially make sure you're all on the
same page right I would highly encourage
you to be open your mind which is
counterintuitive
because a lot of people they want
freelance because anyone work from home
they don't have to deal with people too
often but uh you're kind of putting
yourself in this situation where it's a
little bit harder that way so I'd
encourage you to actually be willing to
meet in person at least every now and
again the fourth thing is social media
so this is one of those things where I
found so many different professions web
web dev web design freelancing and all
that is no different we're just having a
social media presence where you can
showcase your work and other people
follow you you'll write so with my
youtube channel I get on the regular
people emailing me for job offers people
emailing me for contract work and
interested in working with me on various
projects social media is a great
resource in that aspect because you have
now put yourself out there
your skills are out there what what you
can accomplish is out there and people
who maybe otherwise wouldn't know who to
reach out to your now sort of authority
you're sort of a figure so I'd encourage
you social media and I've seen this
happen for a lot of people there so one
of you guys added me on on Facebook and
you know subscriber it's usually social
media accidentally on his Facebook page
all he does he does like construction he
builds fences and walls and stuff like
that for homes I see him post video are
videos and photos all the time on
Facebook just sharing pictures of the
fences ages and every time in the
comments
you see people oh that's really that's
really great so the networking aspect of
social media is amazing because I you
see people see your work and I'm
suddenly like oh let me reach out to
this guy and you can do the same thing
with with your websites and web drive so
be willing to network via social media
the the the I guess that was four or
five what I don't know we got two more
that's all what matters all right so
the only thing is there are websites
devoted to freelancing upwork.com is
probably the most popular one I've hired
some freelancers in the past off of work
to help me out on certain things for my
YouTube channel and it's been very
helpful now the thing about up work is
you get rated by your previous clients
so you may have to spend some time
charging a very low rate and competing
and in in the international space you
may be competing against people who have
a much lower cost of living until you
get your your your reviews up until you
get a couple projects on your belt well
people can see like hey this guy had
five clients and all five you know would
love to work with and we and this guy
actually did and it's going well you may
have a little bit of a hard time getting
those more higher-end clients but once
you have that once you've sort of gone
through that that grind that that
process you might have a much easier
time landing some larger contracts so
one thing that you guys may not know
about me but the way that I got my
internship and a lot of freelance
clients is I would post my slick sheet
on Craigslist in the looking for work
section and that was one way that I was
able to get freelance clients a lot of
people who you know on the again the
bottom of the barrel sort of thing where
they just have like a a like a furniture
store or something like that was one of
the ones I worked with and they just
needed someone to help maintain their
website okay that was twenty dollars an
hour for me that was my first freelance
job I've seen twenty dollars an hour all
I needed to do was maintain their
website update some things change some
banners around some basic HTML CSS stuff
and WordPress and that was my first
freelance client and I got several
others just posting my slick sheet on on
sites like Craigslist and if I was going
to look for freelance now I probably
kept trying to work my way up and up
work and last but not least I think this
is six so top six things but uh
networking with companies and recruiters
recruiters are something that people
don't take advantage inside why would
you network with a recruiter well this
isn't really freelancing so much as
there are a lot of corporations that
need sir
developers and what that basically means
is that a company says okay we're taking
on a large project we don't have enough
in-house developers it takes a while to
get a good dev it's not and hire someone
so it may take you a company all year to
hire 15 developers and you know that's
like a little more than one a month and
so but you're like look we need 15
developers now so we're gonna we're
gonna contract out to a agency that what
they do is they essentially give you a
developer the next day here it is is
this guy the skill set that you want
yeah cool and now he's working for you
so you might want to consider that it's
not necessarily freelancing so much as
you are contracted out and your contract
employee and you have a much more
flexible thing so I work with a ton of
of contract employees at my current role
and they're traveling across the globe
they're in different countries a lot of
times every every month and so if that's
the type of lifestyle you're looking for
you can also consider that which isn't
again exactly freelancing and when I say
networking with companies one of the
ways said I've got freelance work is
I've reached out to companies that I've
worked with in the past as an employee
as a previous freelancer and I've said
as an intern and I've said hey I just
wanna let you know here's my portfolio
here is this I am open to taking on some
clients some freelance work so you have
anything that you can't complete or
isn't in your wheelhouse but is in mine
I just wanna let you know that I'm
available to check to work it out to to
to help out and you know make some money
or if you have any work that you just
want me to do for you you know and and I
found that very successful because
oftentimes companies aren't going to
reach out to you even if you work before
unless they they know that you're open
to that sort of thing so I always make
sure to let companies know that I am now
be careful with how you say it because
if you quit and then you tell them look
you can hire me contract boy for triple
the rates you might come off as a bit of
a dick but just be be respectful and in
all things in life including business
now you can look out for numero no but
just be respectful so um those are my
tips for freelancing some things to keep
in mind now what are your guys is
so uh again my my freelancing experience
is limited and if you're looking for
more of course check out our sponsor s
