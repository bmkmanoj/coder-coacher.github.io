talk about and I think it's kind of
important at the same time because a lot
of people don't realize how much their
home life affects their work life and
their work life affects their home life
and what we're going to do is we're
gonna dive into that a little bit deeper
specifically using statistical analysis
that data science did that's kind of a
cool side project using them R and D 3
to create graphs with over 500 different
occupations to show case a an effect
between how much money you make what
your job is and the divorce rate for
that so we're gonna dive into that and
look at that I'll include a link to that
below it's pretty interesting so as I
mentioned we're gonna be talking about
divorce verse your occupation right what
and we're gonna look a little bit into
where software developer meets and I'll
explain my sort of slaw process so the
amount of data were looking at is over
500 different jobs collected over five
years and released in 2015 by the
American Community Survey survey and
it's going to showcase what the median
divorce rate is which apparently is
about 36 37 % here and all these are
jobs and you'll notice right here so
physical scientists all other and I
believe if here we are software
developers so software developers in
general are was that the fourth least
likely to get divorced or the fifth
least likely to get divorced and a
couple things about that and as to why
and we'll jump down in our data here
this is I really like this isn't built
out in d3 not a library that I'm fan of
but definitely interesting if you want
to make custom custom graphs and the
data is analyzed with the R programming
language as well you'd see the divorce
rate by occupation so these are all the
jobs that kind of fall into that field
and I show the median divorce rate of
all them added together now it's also
worth worth noting that depending on the
median salary
the higher your
salary the the less like you likely you
are to get divorced so why is that a lot
of that I think is because one of the
number one reasons people to get
divorced is because of financial reasons
right if you're dating somebody or I
guess at this point married to somebody
who's making bad decisions financially
it affects you both and at some point
there's a cracking point right if you're
having trouble paying rent and you're
having trouble you know buying clothes
for the family and food for the family
it's definitely going to add a add to
your stress level and that's going to
have you act out it's gonna have you go
against you know maybe the people around
you just do the nature of stress right
and so those with higher salaries do
typically pretty well so I think it's
where is it right here one of these are
software developers here so here we are
software developers so you'll see that
the average software developer is making
about ninety thousand it's pretty
accurate for the United States so and
there are one of the one of the lowest
divorce rates and you'll notice a lot of
these Co are all high-paying jobs right
engineering managers dentists anesthesia
s-- physicians and insurgents and
lawyers and judges so there is there is
a I don't say correlation but there is
something to be said about making more
money lowering your stress and having a
healthier productive relationship
because of it it's pretty interesting
when you when you think about it so why
is that let's let's let's dive into that
a little bit and why I think that is I I
have I've been dating April for about
six to seven years a lot of a lot of for
the 12% women watching this channel they
are all saying girlfriend leave his
bitch ass for not putting a ring on it
already right so that's what they're
saying so what what is my thought
process is it because I'm too immature
to get married and I'm just putting off
the inevitable and I know for me I am a
big believer and I think this kind of
this is kind of shown in the data here
that
want to be financially stable too to be
able to provide for my family and not be
able to know I don't want the stress of
of I want to be able to enjoy the time
with my family and not have to stress
about money and I think that's a big
thing
especially you know the last couple
years of my life being very poor up
until recently and understanding the
stress that it can cause not theoretical
the stress that it has on me and
understanding how I'm at times
don't don't handle it the best as is the
nature of stress and so I could I can
respect that you have a lot of these
very intellectual people in the job
categories right talking about software
developers lawyers dentists doctors all
people who use their brain and did a lot
of study and I would say can think very
logically and are getting paid very well
so if you could think about it for a
second I really do think that that the
salary of just being comfortable in
terms of being able to provide will
actually lowers your stress and that's
why you see lower stress levels I don't
think the money necessarily has anything
to do with its I'm like oh well I'm
making $100,000 of course I'm gonna stay
married I think it's more so that you
make enough money to to survive like
actually survive right you can pay for a
car for both of you and you can you know
maybe you have a house payment you have
enough to to give a little in either
direction right you can maybe your
salary could even drop it it's not going
super stress you out as long as you
manage your money right you're able to
save money you're able to invest money
at that salary cap typically or a salary
level and that that sort of stress of
what if I lose my job what if it's not
going to affect your family because you
already have that the biggest stressor
out of your life in my opinion which is
why I think the the median divorce rate
for software developers is going down
very high because you have skills that
are hugely in demand and you're getting
compensated very well so you know if you
do lose your job that it's not the most
stressful thing and it's a very unique
feeling so when you're thinking about
what job occupations to take I wouldn't
necessarily say
choose something like this choose choose
based off of this data but I would say
you know it's interesting to think about
it and you would see and vice versa
what not to choose right so you'll see
here that there's a lot of lower pain as
well as more social items that will lead
you to divorce and we could we could
dairy craft about why that might be
right I would say that the social items
in terms of the bartender why that's the
tied for the highest right there it's
because you're involved in an
environment in which you're essentially
dealing with the cardinal sins right the
drinking and the the sort of sex
industry at Dan because it's a bartender
your your your co-mingling your you're
in a much more social environment which
introduces you to a lot of people of the
the opposite or the same this 2017 right
but you're introduced to a lot of people
and what what ends up happening is
perhaps given the scenario of people's
inhibitions being lowered that maybe
there's more infidelity by bartenders in
and that could be a result there or you
know what is let's see what is some of
the other ones telemarketers that's
someone who's unhappy and that again
goes to the goes to lower stress levels
right or higher stress levels and being
unhappy is just as stressful and if
you're unhappy at your job you're gonna
be unhappy in your life which lifecell
people who like are really trying to
force themselves to be developers is to
find something that they like don't
force yourself it's okay to work hard
and try to get better but it's also
important to understand that if you
force yourself to try and do something
that you don't like for a long period of
time you're gonna be unhappy massage
therapist some of these I'm not too too
too surprised of gaming managers that's
that's that's referring that's not like
to a gaming channel that's referring to
like casinos so another sort of sin with
a lot of very personal thing going on
but a lot of this you can see are low
pain or very social jobs in fact that
you're always interacting with people
which I think might lead to a little bit
more infidelity than maybe a software
developer where your work
with 90% men men men working with 90
first nine other men but it's very
interesting to think about how sometimes
occupations can affect not only and
salaries can affect your the happiness
of your marriage potentially that's not
to say that you can't be a bartender or
a gaming manager and have a perfectly
healthy healthy relationship but it is
to say that there are some stats that we
can look at that are clearly based and
some sort of we can save the trends
without being too you know biased or
anything like that so if you're a
bartender I'm sorry nothing personal
right we're just going off the data here
but um pretty cool in my eyes that we
can look at this and see who's getting
divorced and maybe we can set break it
down by salary and job category and see
what the likelihood that is and it could
even be by education right everything
that we're talking about is also you all
the other the fields that we're talking
about except maybe software development
but even software development is
something that you have to be pretty
highly educated in to to get a you know
grant although what I mean by
traditional education we're talking
about doctors you have to go years to
school lawyers these are all things with
really low divorce rates and so there
could be a correlation with education as
well right software developers kind of
our bachelor degrees are higher
typically for the average average
software developer most of the time but
I'll put a link to this down below I'm
curious what your guys's thoughts are
cuz to me I say that on the lower end
it's it's caused by more social
interaction and sort of the the cardinal
sins for some of these you know drinking
drinking gambling those are kind of the
ones that stand out to me but I also
think there is something to be said
about people who interact with a lot of
people for their job are more likely to
be
have heart infidelity as well as stress
and lower paying jobs affecting the
relationship and the opposite me said
but that's just kind of my takeaway from
the data here I'd love to know what your
guys's takeaways are again I'll include
a link thank you so much for watching
