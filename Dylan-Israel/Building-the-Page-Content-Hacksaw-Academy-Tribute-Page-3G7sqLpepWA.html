hacksaw Academy we're going to be
continued between the landing page
project and if you want to try out
hacksaw Academy go ahead and click the
annotation colored your description to
get your free 14-day trial let's go
ahead and jump right in special thanks
to them for sponsoring this video as
well so in this pit in this section
we'll be building the page content using
HTML CSS cool let's jump right in so
last time we built this header now we're
going to go ahead and build the content
so building the page content so it looks
like we're gonna be doing some CSS try
adding the following body to the body
selector so you'll see right here we
have our body now what we want to go
ahead and do is add a background image
so we're gonna use the property
background image and we're going to pull
it from this URL here it's a relative
URL so static / image you know what just
because I know myself and I know that I
am going to miss type it let's go ahead
and just save ourselves a little bit of
a headache there and then background ash
sighs cover so what covered does so
background dash size has a couple
different things that you can assign to
it in this case we are using cover which
basically means make this background as
big so that it covers the whole width of
it without distorting it so it's go
ahead and do that and then finally oh so
there's our little chub chub cat I'm
going to zoom in a little bit let me go
ahead and close this JavaScript aspect
out because doesn't like we're touching
it and then we're going to do background
dash position oops I'm typing on the
JavaScript so background Josh position
assume is zero and one hundred percent
oops then we moved that a little bit so
background image let's just provide a
URL if you don't provide the property it
will be the original image size will be
used so if you don't set background ash
sighs maybe the same uh covering contain
contrast okay so I wants us to say you
know let's see what contained us so
you'll see right there that it breaks it
up into various pockets do it has that's
a very like early 90s feel to it
probably not something that you're gonna
want to do all right background eshe
attachment this is something I recently
just learned how great it is um but
let's go ahead and put this in here so
background dash attachment touring if it
is fixed now what did this just do so
basically the cats going to stay in the
same position now cuz of it I love that
they used to kind of really do okay so
let's go ahead and jump into the HTML we
we are going to HTML panel so it looks
like they want it out of our header here
so in the interest of saving time let's
just go ahead and copy this so what
would the div remember is a container
we're giving a class called content here
and then we're also just crazy spera
graphs
so bam there's our this is all contained
in the same div but then we have some
paragraphs very cool so update the
header selector so now we're going to go
ahead and target this so we want header
inner comma dot content so that's going
to basically incorporate that as well so
you'll see now that we have this so
basically what it's saying is to include
this as well for the styling that's
going on here so we don't have to copy
it over we can also go ahead and target
the class content to have its own unique
CSS as well so margin-top we're going to
have 40 pixels on that so you'll see it
adds a little bit of spacing and then
we're going to add a color here which is
going to be hashtag 636 e6a so we change
this to like a gray very nice we want to
create two columns to contain both
before and after the cat images you'll
need to set the content area with taking
up half of the way the beach at the
following paragraphs in HTML panel so
we're going to create a class called
image here it's going to go right below
this one but still within the body and
we're going to have you'll see
before-and-after here now in our CSS
we're going to go ahead and create a dot
images class dot images and what we're
going to basically do is add some
padding around this 20 PX oh excuse me
adding and then it's going to be 20
pixels and 0 and then for the dot column
or for our column class we are going to
give it a with a fifty percent so we're
basically going to say look we want two
columns
% well we now have two columns but
because gives their block elements they
appear below each other should change
them at the following Colin selecting
the CSS family so basically we want
because these are laying on top of each
other we just want to go ahead and put
float left on here so that they float
next to each other so now you'll see
that each one of these is taking out
fifty percent all right so well now
we're going to just go ahead and add
this image source here to the first
column so let's go ahead and bring out
our CSS so we're just going to add an
image I think that's the grumpy cat if I
remember correctly now we're going to
add it add another image to the second
column after and you'll see right now
they're side by side taking up the full
page or fifty percent of fifty percent
now what we want to do is we want to go
into the CSS right below column because
you want to kind of keep everything as
organized as you can say look if you're
within the column and your of the type
image this is the CSS we want you now we
only have ten pixels for the margin s
talk only have a width of one hundred
percent so it's looking super clean I
gave a little bit of padding or margin
rather it looks like that was the end of
the lesson kind of the things that's
takeaway is background ash sighs oh this
I set a background cover so background
noise about three or four different
properties I would definitely go on like
w3schools check that out and become more
familiar with that and then background
ash attachments same thing but um if you
