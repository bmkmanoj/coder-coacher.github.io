streaming director Sean is a developer
who vlogs about his life and about being
a developer and things like that and
yeah his life stream was about why he
doesn't do coding tutorials and that's a
it was an interesting interesting reason
why and all that but it got me thinking
as to why do I still do tutorials and I
wanted to kind of elaborate on that
because if you don't know my behind the
code interviews where I interview
developers or tech professionals and my
ask a dev sections where i answer
questions or topics and things like that
exactly like this actually get on
average typically more views and require
a lot less prep time and put in
perspective this was a topic that i
simply got from watching a video i was
like oh i think i could talk about this
and I you know kind of let it linger in
the back of my mind while I think about
it and in terms of actual time I spent
on it it's really going to be this ten
minutes or so I spent talking about the
video editing and putting it up versus
the the project I work on all this
weekend Saturday and Sunday and total
probably about 12 to 15 hours and a lot
more brainpower right a lot more of
actual time and usually these get more
views at least up first anyhow so they
have been some some tutorials do better
than others but on average they ask a
des and then degrees typically do better
so why do I continue to do tutorials
well for one that is my core audience
right so there's there something about
being a loyal to people who subscribe
and are interested in free code camp
content and wanting to put things out
that subscribers would want to see the
second reason is because I'm still
learning I'm always learning and I want
to the way I better myself is by
learning these things and then as a
bonus
when I feel like I have a decent
understanding of how it works and I can
help people out I throw it up on my
youtube hopefully I make a little bit of
AD revenue and it's kind of like killing
two or three birds with one stone and I
build my portfolio in the process now in
terms of YouTube specifically I may
actually be better just doing these
asking deaths but there's no reason why
I can't do both especially if I'm
spending time learning and trying to
master these skills right so i may do
this video right now talking about why
still to tutorials but what skills did
it give me at the end of the day maybe
it got me to have a little bit of a
deeper understanding about myself and
got to connect with people about the
channel but what did it help me with my
resume or my portfolio very little
however the skills i worked on this
weekend was a node Express mongodb and
Mongoose all backend technologies to
make myself a better developer it also
gave me one portfolio project to
showcase new skills in a lot of
knowledge in the process and something I
can show to potential future employers
or current employers right to
potentially make the argument of hey
this is why I should get X amount of
dollars at my one-year email because I
have these skills because I am a much
better developer than I was a year ago
all these sorts of things but that is
why I still do these tutorials at the
end of the day I really enjoy doing them
i keeps me fresh I learn a lot I learned
some es6 just doing this stuff I'm
trying to get better with es6 know it
expressed want Mongoose all these sorts
of things and I appreciate helping
people out when they're just getting
started to a lot of mid-level or
entry-level guys like myself heard you
know they already got their developer
job they're trying to get better we can
figure it out at the end of the day we
can figure out a lot of things and we
don't need a video tutorial to do it my
channels mainly mainly towards those
people who are just getting started or
our entry-level developers and still
need help and the reason for that is
because you
they are kind of the most needy if you
will those are the people who need the
most help and it's an easy way for me to
do something fun some of its review and
sometimes it might review you like oh
you know I forgot about that and and
you're like oh cool like I get it now
and you know it helps me just constantly
maintain sort of that programmers
thought process and in the process
sometimes I pick up some cool new tricks
but that's why I still make tutorials
and why do them even though maybe
perhaps in the short term at least
they're not the best thing for the
channel but they are the best thing for
me as a developer and that's why I
started this channel in the first place
is to become a better developer and help
me get developer job now that I'm
working as a developer I want to
continue to get there once you're a
junior developer you should strive to be
a mid-level to senior developer and if
your front-end developer you should
strive to be a back-end developer and if
you never touch QA never touch quality
assurance testing you should strive to
know testing and all these sorts of
things and me doing coding tutorials and
walkthroughs and things like that and
showing projects that i do and walking
through the the steps of building it
it's not so that someone can go and copy
my code and have their own project and
trying to sneak their way in because
you're only gonna screw yourself it's 21
so I reiterate through it and you'll see
in my projects oftentimes I find ways
that I could have improved my code or
that I could have added a feature that
didn't occur to me or validation or
whatever it may be and to because you
will learn so much by watching somebody
else when I want to learn something new
I ask somebody who already understands
it to walk me through it and give me the
basics I don't want to have to go and
search through the amount of time it
would take me if to ask a friend to give
me a one hour tutorial on node is
equaled about 5 to 10 hours on my own in
reality and they've already figured out
the basics and that's really all you can
get from a tutorial at the end of day is
the the basics the building blocks and
you're going to run into all the all the
 that's all the bugs in the
works along the way but that's why I
still do code notorious if you have any
questions leave them in the comments
below and maybe I'll answer them in the
next ask a dev section I appreciate you
