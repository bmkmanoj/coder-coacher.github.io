about should you be a developer in 2018
and that video was mainly about job
growth salaries and how the amount of
jobs which are things that I think are
really importantly and choose a job I
think some of you were expecting the
video to be about would you be a good
fit to be a developer would you enjoy
being a developer and that's what this
video is really gonna be about sort of
breaking it down and saying okay these
are some characteristics or these are
some of the things that you can expect
if you like these things you might like
being a developer everything once you've
made the awesome decision that being a
developer is for you and you're looking
for a place to get started
might I recommend our long-term sponsor
dev Mountain you can check them out at
dev Mountain comm where they have their
three-month programs where housing is
included with your tuition so you can
get up and go this moment and get
started in web development user
experience design iOS development
Salesforce development software QA
online in person sometimes after hours
check them out they have everything you
need if you've you called me a click
Vader in my last video and I'm not too
happy about that cuz I pride myself on
not being a click bear your boys a lot
of things coding god developer boyfriend
son excellent lover may be subpar lover
but not a click Vader and that's why I
also want to make this video because it
seems like some some of you wanted
something something a little different
than what was given so let's talk a
little bit about the obvious thing that
I think is if you want to find out if
you'll enjoy being a developer if you'd
be good at being a developer start
developing you don't need a job today to
figure out if you like writing code
because although that's not going to be
the only thing you're gonna be doing as
a developer it is going to be the
largest part of your job for the most
part you are going to be writing code if
you're interested in web development
start building some web applications
you're interested in mobile development
start learning to build some mobile
applications and go from there because I
think that really is a tried-and-true
approach a while back when
and when I was doing some research about
should you go to boot camp or not I was
watching some videos about from some
people on YouTube who posted why they
dropped out of their boot camps and one
of the one that one the gentleman that
dropped out about very nice guy but he
made this very funny statement where
when he went to the coding boot camp he
didn't realize that his job was going to
be him sitting at a computer for most of
the day writing code so if that doesn't
sound appealing to you if you don't like
the idea of sitting at a computer and
and that's a large portion of your job
the fields not for you right it makes
sense I don't blame the guy for dropping
out if I have that epiphany mid boot
camp I would dropped out too I think I
would have had it a little earlier on
hopefully but so the first though my
first piece of advice is find out just
find out it's not going to be identical
to the workplace but today software and
and web development and all that one of
the great things about it is you can
teach yourself and if you enjoy the
process
just sit down so summer break if you're
in college and you have a semester offer
you have no summer or you have nights
and weekends sit down for four hours and
code five days a week
it's almost like a full-time part-time
job you're a part-time developer except
for yourself let's see see how it goes
the other thing is do you like working
on a team this is something that you
don't you can't it's harder to get this
in sort of outside the workplace but
most of the time especially as you
progress in your career maybe went
depending on your area and depending on
every every job is different is what I'm
trying to say and so it may not be a
hundred percent we're going to talk in
generalities a little bit but do you
like working on team because most of
your career you will be one of ten
developers one of five developers and
you all are expected to deliver
different things your job is to work
with your team get help from the team
help those on your team do you like that
do you can you collaborate well because
you can't it's gonna be hard it's gonna
be hard experience for you doesn't mean
that you can't be a solo dev doing
freelance stuff doesn't
that you can't be yeah it's just your
your pass is gonna be a little bit more
difficult now that should be something
you probably already know already like
can I work with others well can I play
nice basically is the gist of it
do you like solving strategies do you
like logic do you like you know when you
when you put a when you play a game do
you is it are the games that you choose
strategy based and if they are might be
for you it's a programming is a lot of
mental a lot of problem-solving you know
we do a lot of these algorithms as
whiteboard interviews when you look at
that and don't get me wrong you're all
gonna get frustrated I get frustrated to
this day solving algorithms but for the
most part is enjoyable right it's
something that you'd like to do is just
do you like the challenge one of the
things that struck me on a on one a
traverse the media's videos I forget the
exact exact video or maybe was engineer
truths video but it's one of their
videos they I just remembered Theresa
media and I commented on it and a guy
said it was engineered shoes videos
where he was interviewing me and he said
hey cells that you have you have to
learn all the time sounds like hell if
that's something that you're like look
man I I just want to go into the
workplace
two months later be complete have my
skills not have to learn anything ever
again this is for sure not for you it's
gonna be it's gonna be a hard path and a
hard career and it's one of those things
where in software especially in web
development it is ever-changing right
new technologies are coming out better
technologies oftentimes that's just a
new right there's a lot of new stuff
that comes out that's crap there's also
great stuff that comes out that you know
maybe has new programming principles and
you know is we're gonna replace MVC or
you know it's going to be a superset of
JavaScript with types like typescript
and there's all this new stuff coming
out build tools every anything that you
can imagine and a ton of stuff coming
ahead that you have to be okay learning
these tools and what to write not even
be okay you have to want to be sort of
eager to learn because you're always
going to be doing everyday
you go in there's a day where you're
probably not going to know anything I'll
give you a great example I need to
integrate a certain technology from
Microsoft into a project never touch it
I have no idea
documentation is pretty awful Microsoft
and I got a lie and they don't go and
say hey have you ever worked with this
technology before you know this this API
no they don't care that you're a
developer you're gonna learn how to work
with that right you're gonna go and
you're going to to test it out you're
gonna play with it you're gonna go read
through the docs you're gonna you're
gonna watch some videos you're gonna do
everything you can to get what
functionality they want from this API
and you have to be ok with that you have
to be ok that there's gonna be barriers
of where you don't know you know you you
need to you need to know that you can
figure it out but you don't know yet
right everything is possible but until
it works it don't work right so you
gotta yeah you have to you have to go
and make that work and to do that you
have to be ok learning on a consistent
basis and I think I think above
everything else do you want it alright
so a lot of people you know they they
want this video and they want mostess
videos to tell for me at the end of this
video to say that you like you Alex you
Rebecca you Dylan whatever it is
whatever your name is to say look I will
guarantee you that you will thrive you
will be successful and this is the
career for you you're born to do this
javascript is in your blood PHP is in
your decrement you guys all enjoy say ah
and it is it is for you and you I can't
I can't give that to you but what I can
say is that everybody is unique every
organization is unique and even if you
don't completely fit into these sort of
categories that doesn't mean that you
can't be a developer this has just been
my experience but I would encourage you
to say do you want it is this something
are you trying to find a job that just
has those you know the three things that
we talked about high salaries
growth and a lot of jobs because I mean
I didn't say last video but I've said it
tons of times before there are a lot of
things in life that that you should not
do and one of them is work a job just
for money and work a job that you hate
right so one of the things that I love
about this field other than being paid
well so I enjoy it and so I would
encourage you to find a job that you
enjoy and that's really what you have to
figure it out when you're when you're
trying to find out if you're right to be
a developer do you enjoy it right is
this something that when I say oh hey
you know you have to learn every day is
like alright sounds kind of like fun I
learn something new I'm gonna learn new
technology it's gonna you know make me
more valuable to the marketplace and
maybe I can use it in my personal life
I'll said project is it does that sound
good or do you see oh my god take me
behind the barn and shoot me so that's
really what you have to take away from
this video is do you enjoy it
is this is this for you and you can find
out but start coding today coding
regularly today and and continuing your
you're your own personal education doing
udemy courses YouTube all that and find
that out logic obviously you have to be
able to think logical right a lot of our
stuff is very sort of sequence based
formulaic based when you're doing this
after this before I do this before I do
this do you enjoy thinking like that can
you think like that
a lot of people can be developers but
not everybody right a lot of people
struggle with it a lot of people don't
have the temperament right you are gonna
get frustrated because that's the nature
of problems right problems are things
that you don't have answers to and
that's frustrating in life and them and
and it it is in the workplace as well so
can you handle that is that something
you're okay with so those are all some
things for you to consider about whether
or not you should be a developer and my
main points are do you enjoy learning
and do you enjoy
developing because that's really what
you need dude the worst thing that's
something like 70% of people hate their
jobs and I don't want you to be one of
those 70% we've all been one of those
70% one time in our life
and I encourage you not to do that so if
you're just thinking you're gonna jump
into dev too because there's money or
whatever and and you just want security
but you hate it
try and find something else but if you
like it and you enjoy it just grind it
out you'll get there and sounds like
this is for you and the good news is for
a zero cent free tech so you can go and
get started today so all the technology
is pretty much open source and web dev
at least and you can find out today so
that's today's video guys I appreciate
you watching don't forget to comment

patreon and all that good stuff
