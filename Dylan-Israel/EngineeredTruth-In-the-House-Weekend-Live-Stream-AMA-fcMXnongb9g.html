it's a professional setup yeah no you're
right
I mean if you have four monitors and you
don't use all four you're just an
asshole it was like what's the point of
having four monitors you can even throw
David Youngman loyal subscriber baby
David King so gee Dave King is here all
the time we actually did a mentorian
session a while back let's seize it was
his goal what he's trying to do well
David has not put you on blast David or
anything like I started this video by
specifically talking about David so this
is like ex-military looking for a career
change and how are you talking about the
code mentor site
David is a perfect example of why it's
Alaia meat serve this his mentor that he
got assigned yeah told him to study
things that were not even being
maintained and the example so learn this
tool meanwhile Adobe abandoned the tool
six years ago Dreamweaver not
Dreamweaver I forget exactly what it is
I got nothing but love for your David no
shade let's do let's do some
interventions let's do this an
intervention so how are you gonna know
how though was the intervention for
David that you did so David I put a lot
right past was like all right well these
are the skills and technologies that are
headed in the right direction well he
was going down a direction of my mentor
who had you know older guy had a bunch
of experience but just wasn't what does
a junior dev need to get into the market
not what did a developer need to get in
the market 15 years ago so it's quite
different that's true so what does a
developer need to know now javaScript
number one especially on deal so if you
want to do data science as much as
homeboy yesterday said not the link
python we got I got I got some
interesting videos coming up
a guy named Joel he has a book called
modern CTO you can find about modern CTO
calm and we shot a video called how to
become a CTO how to become a machine
learning engineer and then how to sell
your first app for a million dollars at
18 so those videos will pretty mean
coming out in the next couple months
very interesting character so super
excited had those videos up but
depending on what you want to do is a
front-end development cuz that's sort of
my specialty you need two things you
need like three or four main things one
you need to obviously become controlled
HTML CSS yeah you need JavaScript you
need a JavaScript framework that's I
have a reactor angular alright react
emails you'd say relaxes you you've had
more problems but your lack of react
knowledge yes there's there's more rules
in react right now for larger companies
specifically like if your goal is
Facebook the Google's Amazon's react so
we were just we were hanging out and
Google gave him a call Google recruiter
right yes guess what the Google
recruiter called him and asked do you
know react it's like what
because if to give you guys context
react was created by Facebook and Google
created angular so Google is calling him
and ask him do you know react it's like
wait well why would you why would you
ask him if he knows react why don't you
says use your angular for technology I
thought you guys that's what you guys
made it for so christ-centered EV I'm
guessing he's a loyal hello guy he says
uh that big dick Moggridge big
moderation did you give him the modern
cuz he said christ-centered so he's wild
you like that you like a religious man
oh yeah
alright so he says Cody God centered he
said how is the trip in the Philippines
it's good I enjoy our might every trip
to the Philippines
I'm gonna go back May or on May 7th okay
yeah like hang out so they had set up to
sit who made a fire every time I like it
I'm not sure yeah yeah like alright
you're like the mist that makes it feel
like you're one of those gypsies like
telecard readers I'm kind of a gypsy I
do move around every couple of months
I'd never renew at least it's just one
year later we gotta move the next
apartment yeah so he cute so
christ-centered ed was part of the
bootcamp and value it so that's the
first bootcamp in value so they teamed
up with a couple Australian co-founders
and then they get this pretty it's
pretty genius because like in the
Philippines they're cut their wages are
much lower right so these Australian
companies would be more than willing not
to have these developers intern for them
for like small things and then at the
same time this coding boot cabin Baguio
which I forgot what the name was they
get experience while the Australian
companies get cheap labor
so it's a win-win on both sides I think
a lot of since there had a good
experience yeah it's uh oh yeah I still
really want to go to a boot camp for the
experience I don't know that it'll ever
actually make sense financially do it
but one day I might do not like an
online 101 be straight up in it just
like I never did the dorm thing either I
was just always running around or
whatever so I mean it'd be probably as
close as I can get going back to boot
camp by 40 with like 12 years experience
yeah oh so so christ-centered dev did
you did you have a good experience of 5x
academy and did most of the students get
jobs as web developers to be honest I
only gave me a good idea for my youtube
channel to build a assess so I might be
hiring Filipino devs pretty soon but I
probably look for experienced devs
because the project is definitely not
for new gret it's uh it actually that's
the thing is like I always want to build
some sort of software but I just don't
know what I'm passionate enough quite
yet about to dive in because it's not
like any other project real spend your
three weekends it's like well I must
spend six seven months building said
platform what's coder Academy you know
is that some new your friends uh what's
the problem that
coder Academy provided was total crap
only three out of 21 students got jobs
from it never heard of it so it'd be
interesting there's a lot of it so
that's the thing is a lot of times when
you're choosing a bootcamp what you
really need
to do is first off do your research make
sure that the subject matter being
taught is relevant to the job market
it's really easy to just search junior
roles and see if it lines up with the
syllabus yeah and from there go to
reviews and and dear and just it's
better to pay one or two thousand
dollars extra for a curriculum that has
better reviews than to risk two thousand
and then just get long ditched by the
job well well I think that's why our job
is so boring cuz like your boats I mean
we work with that mountain in the past I
went to dead mountain directly and I'll
say that shit works and everything like
you just had a he's got a message on
LinkedIn from one of your subscribers
yeah who wants you dead mountain he got
a job right yeah did debt like Meza a
month after he started a month a three
step after you end after he ended right
so that's the that's why you know what
we do what we find is important that we
recommend you guys the boot camps to
actually work we're not gonna recommend
you that we you need
can we talk about iron yard guitar
I have no problem out of it out of
business now so doesn't really matter
but like I mean you went to iron yard
and you're like nah man Matt this this
is not think that the the graduation you
called me right after yeah what do you
say so I went I went to the graduation
of iron yard where they have like their
20 or 25 students and the only of the 25
the old up to that I would give a
internship to based off the projects
presented yeah where to that already had
bachelor's degrees in computer science
and they were just looking to up their
skill set and it was so unbelievably
concerning it was all so I went and they
were three weeks in and the guy couldn't
do a for loop but they were starting
react on Monday and that was Friday
night now it's just no way yeah
absolutely no exactly there's absolutely
no way they're just taking the dudes
money at that point yeah they are no
here's the thing is like with you know
it's funny interesting is we didn't have
a lot of insight to coding boot camps we
really we didn't know they're good were
there bad so I went to a dead mount and
I was like dude this this is pretty good
like all the students are here pretty
good and I showed Gail in my project is
like these are really good projects I
showed him some of my classmates
projects I think and they're like pretty
decent don't get me wrong not ask the
students
we had a couple students that had to uh
they had a term for it it's basically
any step back oh you get you uh you get
uh remediated yeah you're reviewing the
seventh-grade basic yeah yeah yeah we
had that a technical term for it
basically means like you had to retake
another term yeah but they did that for
free they didn't charge you extra for it
you could actually step back as many
times as you'd like because they know
that your goal is to get there out of
there as soon as as soon as possible but
so since Dan Mountain was the only a
coding boot camp that offered that like
the remedial basically means you fall
back a grade I knew they're legit cuz
that means they don't want you to finish
until you know what you're doing
interesting because there's so there's
so anything when it comes to education
just so scam based that is hard to find
the good ones because it's like oh well
here are some people who are looking for
a better brighter future and I'm going
to paint them the best picture but to be
honest you're better off going with a
coding bootcamp and ever with like DeVry
or University of Phoenix any of that
kind of crap it's just funny because one
of the one of the dev Mountain grads
yeah got hired by a universities who is
starting their own boot camp yeah after
he graduated a boot camp that was his
first job out there and it's like teach
other boot camp to teach out of boot
cases it's like good for him but if I'm
going to a boot camp I want someone
who's worked in the industry I want
someone who has years of experience and
that's why I like it's really important
to understand who your instructors are
now like I think Dan mountain says like
our average it's like instructor length
of seven years someone wanna ask where
the humidifier was it's out of out of
screen don't worry bro don't worry bro
we got you to meet apply who might who
minifiers here man my hey I've been
having a bloody nose so use this Florida
this Florida dry heat to makes it gonna
make sure I got it's always here a nice
humidity there is this in the corner
we're saying but but yeah it's just
insane to say okay well this guy who
just graduated boot camp three months
yeah he's gonna start teaching these
other people are gonna graduate a book
games your father work that's
that's pulling on coats Minh yeah so
that's the but that's also one of the
reasons I try and tell people to stay
away from university or anbu pants
because even say they're such a crap and
they charge more because they yeah that
it's funny because because it's UCI or
because UCLA they add like five or ten
thousand dollars because you get that
you get a UCLA certificate so what
you're paying for is that UCLA
certificate that's ten grand
because it's certified right certified
meanwhile the educational sucks
and you paid twice as much then what you
should have for the same education
there's there's a girl who has a
master's and then she way they got and
it's like it's some bullshit liberal
arts stuff I've tutored her before and
she's going through the shoes graduated
through the Florida State coding boot
camp and I saw the syllabus I was like
Sunday's syllabus is six months of
content and it covers like two or three
different stacks and it's it does entire
last month is devoted to WordPress and
that was the final straw for masoala
halle well WordPress is actually into
men's gildo WordPress yes just like
their plenty of cashiers at fast food
places that need like I the WordPress is
going for the low-hanging fruit and the
issue that I have with it it's not that
there are jobs it's just that they're
not good jobs and so why are you doing a
wordpress and you will get a job maybe
sooner that depends on what you're
looking for if you're looking for at to
max out at sixty thousand all right if
you're looking to build your own your
own website though and you're looking to
monetize your own website even Empire
flippers a multi-million dollar company
their websites on WordPress yes and but
how many developer so they probably have
one that one developer yes yeah
and that's how WordPress will always go
you have one developer yes time but so
there's a reason why they were use
WordPress though right because like
someone could be a wordpress developer
but then someone can still go in and and
and modify things add things at post add
pages and then not F things up and it's
it's a content management system it's a
content management as a content
management system so it works so even
multi-million dollar companies you still
use a wordpress so there's the Oh like
if there's a lot there's a lot a lot a
lot of multi-million dollar
because because here's the thing is like
you don't want to always have to go to a
dev like say you have a website like
even like Empire flippers where they
have a marketplace they want to be able
to go in there and edit themselves they
don't want to have to have that process
of like oh I want to add one little job
posting I have to go through my blog and
I'm not saying that it's not convenient
or it doesn't have its place cuz it
clearly has its place everyone needs you
know there so there's the reason that
there's freelance clients doing the
small business websites but I'm saying
that for every large company that uses
WordPress there's ninety five percent
that are small tiny companies where
they're gonna get shit on as a wordpress
developer that's kind of my argument
quick shout out to Ricky Garcia who
donated $10 Thank You Man
if you guys haven't subscribed to him I
think I really definitely for $10 rate a
man that you do subscribe to him no I
appreciate every game so so uh about the
coding bootcamp in Baguio Christ hunter
dev said he actually didn't like his
experience there so he said I ended up
having to learn on my own resources at
the coding bootcamp that's a very bad
thing you should not be learning about
your own the whole point of paying to go
to coding bootcamp is to ask them have
them guide you so if you're learning on
your own you'd always learn on your own
on your own okay so he said at he at
week three he noticed the program at the
problem and week eight he dropped out
because he wasn't gonna continue paying
a ton of money each month when he was
learning from his own resources so it
turns out they you know it sounds like
we need to start a coding camp in the
Philippines it sounds like what we need
to do I'll just make a syllabus of your
deme courses hey do this yeah the annual
new chart will charge what fraction of
the price according to accounts not
would you would you be willing to start
quitting boot camp in the Philippines
down the road after you get that so so
we have it we have a chip on our
shoulder we need to get we need to get
Dylan a job at Amazon Facebook or Google
because every every single
YouTube video title you know you have
Google engineers like me Google it's
just soft it we like Skillshare course
by Google engineer right that then when
he quits he'll be like X Google
engineers
starts starts decoding boot camp in the
Philippines we won't run out of business
BC she like that okay so I saw that
someone who enjoys learning and teaching
which is a the key part I would love to
start so sort of boot camp or be a part
of one I've actually we could kill in
the Philippines but though we could
charge us a lot lower than in the US
I've applied to several boot camps in
the past basic that tonight because of
lack of experience but maybe in the
future yeah
what was our saying from yesterday so
this is one of our tips that's gonna be
one of our and the video called how to
become a CTO it says no means no but you
can always keep asking yeah that's life
quote guess I gotta get that just put
that on your wall no means no but you
could always keep asking so dela has
been rejected by all these companies and
multiple times but all the time all the
time it's shit yes no good but this
thing is like just cuz you fail and
someone asked me recently like I've ever
been interviewed with Amazon or Facebook
I have and I failed my technical
interviews but does me I'm not gonna and
I like that you openly say you're like
you told you called man you manned up to
you're like a fucking bomb but but
here's the thing is you gotta have that
failure because like next time you you
have an Amazon interview you're gonna be
more relaxed you do it you might you
might do a little bit better yeah some
time is past I'll go through the motions
again you know you get better and
improving you only got it okay so it's a
good context he didn't get denied from a
boot camp you got denied from working at
Amazon yes
we switch topics really quick good but
you only have to do leave to get hired
once you know I'm saying they can reject
me all day I just gotta get that job one
time so flat iron fire Anna's og one
flat iron is a good one
so that's let's that's the thing is like
you got to make sure your name is unique
it sounds too fucking close to I own a
large flat iron
Flatiron and a hack reactor are the same
about the same age they came out about
the same one time I don't know too much
about flatiron letter I will say that
everyone who I've talked you from hack
reactor just seems to be a genius I feel
stupid around them so yeah they're doing
a good job even that you know I failed
their test to get it yeah I wasn't gonna
pay anyways but I don't want to go for
free all right but the other test their
tests work all involved recursion I
think what is that the right term yeah
yeah so their tests record evolved
recursion which is you know you know
JavaScript you mean no recursion yeah
yeah also I think and also involved this
and if you understand this and recursion
you probably understand JavaScript well
pack reactor is a boot camp where you're
pretty much already have to know how it
actually already get a job as a dev yeah
you've got to know the nitty-gritty so
uh so Cynthia says she's starting a boot
camp in NYC she got a scholarship to
Flatiron
how did you get the scholarship Cynthia
by the way congrats so Cynthia are gonna
switch from digital marketing to
learning how to code or you just want to
learn both skillsets cuz you're just a
boss like that
in the meantime Baguio City was the best
place ever lived seventy degrees
fahrenheit year-round awesome people
music free so Baguio is the only city in
the Philippines that you can get 300
Mbps because there's no no one else uses
the internet tower that's not it's not a
joke so there's there's like screenshots
of their bootcamp founder we like with
posting screenshots of speed test app
and I would say like 300 Mbps I don't
even see like shit in America but it's
because no one uses the Internet up
there except for the boot camp and their
co-working space look there's always
gonna be people are gonna quit Google or
Facebook or Amazon or every company shit
man yeah when he there's still people
today commenting on his video why could
quit engineer you tell him how he's
gonna be fuckin a crackhead on so
there's like it's like three years old
dude like Rob we already made it
conversation I know it's funny cuz I'll
be like you know if you are coming so
about three years ago to give you guys
context I made a video like why quit
engineering and then people are like in
the beginning people are like oh you're
not gonna make it but widget model makes
sense at the time
doubters right or people said you're
gonna be a fuckin idiot and then now if
you are still writing I'm an idiot and
that would be like I'll be like on the
island on an island in the Philippines
with like a mojito like reading the shit
I'm like you you know like didn't know
where I am right now like just take my
fucking Instagram I'm like you took my
Instagram story like I'm in the beach in
the Philippines and and and I residual
income from from YouTube I probably are
more burn more money than most people
out there day job it's like dude come on
I mean at some point you just gotta he's
gotta exist except that I've made it
know will everybody make it no but okay
I made it how much my audience us-based
about 55% did the only 55% Iran is the
US base yeah Europe and international
India
it's like 55 so it's just I think that
makes like drop off just like 7%
I got 85% Americans so it's kind of
fucked up so christ-centered EV said
they didn't get the high-speed Internet
to students they just give the students
one two three megabytes that's a pretty
fucked up another high paying customers
to Timothy it's pretty fucked up cuz for
me if you're high paying customers which
is the coding bootcamp students you got
to give them the high-speed Internet
I or at least better than 1 to 3 Mbps
even I'm doing tending you know saying
like get the 20
oh no you gotta give one fucking poverty
shit here like trying to watch a video
just buffer in the whole fucking time
trying to watch your video is this
buffering little thing yeah I have a
legit question that may be perceived as
this offensive I've watched both of your
videos but why should I take advice room
advice from you guys you can't get a job
at one of the big companies like a job I
want a big company soon but that wasn't
always my goal
most people don't get a job at Google
for their first job or their you know
Facebook or am so you kind of kind of
work your way into that role which is
probably how I would say most people go
about it but so so actually we're
working at what you what you should at
what you should ask according to Joel is
why are you chasing the company instead
of chasing to learn from the experts in
your industry if your goal is to be the
become the best developer possible
you're doing it the wrong way you should
be chasing who's the guy that made react
redux he's like a famous book there's
like really famous developers you guys
don't even know who don't even who no
one goes to you because no one thinks
that shit
like the guy who created react Redux and
you can go after him and mentor unto him
which would be a lot better for your
career than trying to go straight for
Google because you're just for Google at
every job for Google you're even flying
against a thousand people but the guy
who created rap redux probably gets like
one email a day because nobody thinks up
to hit him up to mentor under him yeah
also I think there's this sort of like
you've made it if you've made it to the
big four meanwhile there's 99 percent
developers will never work at a Google a
Facebook or Amazon the work at a million
other companies and so a lot of times
you just have to kind of get into the
mentality that if you want that job just
work towards a you'll get it but a lot
of times most people don't even want
that they just want to make a good
salary in live in a good area now
everyone wants to live in SF and pay
five thousand dollars in rent and live
enough more hundred square foot
apartment well I think we defined
success differently like you despite you
wanting to work at Amazon Google
Facebook you know that you're never
gonna stay there you're not a lifer you
you may be at five years cap you're done
for sure so we define success as
creating your own product and then
creating your own thing and then making
money so that you can also enjoy the
beach in the Philippines enjoying a
mojito to us that's success because
here's the would you rather earn a
thousand dollars a day working at Google
working eight hours per day or maybe
even nine or ten hours per day or would
you rather creat your own thing
thousand dollars a day and you just sat
on a beach because your SAS product or
new $1000 that day or your YouTube
channel earn you a thousand dollars that
days so we would wrap much rather do
that that's our definition of success oh
by the way so in the Philippines like
their salaries are like between like
$300 and one that's to like up to two
thousand a month usually that's a pretty
good that's like they arranged at the
coding bootcamp they're paying $1,000 a
month
we could teach yourself we could see
some pretty good code for $1,000 a month
I'll tell you that
I'll do the marketing you do the
teaching April do the admin yeah give
her a job yeah I know that's a full-time
job and we'll get them faster speeds
than one carry Mbps guarantee you five
five yeah you're gonna at least 20 men
you can watch some videos why does he
keep mentioning she lives in the
Philippines half the year that's pretty
much why yeah
so then Cynthia says what do you guys
say are the most popular language
parents to know in 2018 oh yeah if
you're talking about Friday this
reactant probably followed by angular
well back into the lane note no there's
no you so notice a quickness is like the
quick let's get comfortable with with
JavaScript but there's a lot of
companies that don't use no the truth of
matter is as much a site to say it's PHP
or c-sharp for the backend it's it's
it's the backends is a little bit more
feisty c-sharp and net it's great
because a lot of corporate companies use
it and that allows you to get fat
salaries because that's pretty much all
corporate companies have to offer you
and then nobody's great because it's
quick development you can get up if
you're not familiar back-end go straight
into a Java Script back in PHP there's
just a ton of jobs in PHP but then it's
also PHP richard richards to say what
language should you should I do it with
would do what with oh I want to program
make a program that files out a PDF form
from information on another program I
wouldn't I would just find a library
that the outputs PDFs from your other
program isn't there a lot there's a this
there's a library for it don't don't try
to recreate it from scratch yeah if
possible I mean
you're always welcome to write your own
program if you're really trying to
market it but if it's just adding a
feature to your website someone else is
already mean that for sure yeah I mean
it's gonna be very rare for you to make
something that doesn't exist doesn't
mean you can't put your own spin on it
add your own features sure you know it's
it's just like anything else is it
probably exists but can you make it
better and can you make it better so
much so that even though that they have
the brand recognition they're gonna come
to your product and you're gonna be the
new brand so someone had asked I'm a
starting web dev should I charge my
friends and family because I'm broke how
much should I charge you should always
charge and how much you should charge is
take what you feel like is your growing
hourly rate at your time maybe that's
ten dollars an hour and just like quote
them for ahead of time
oh yeah my thing I'm charging is charge
what it's worth what it's worth for your
time right yeah charge what it's worth
your time
don't worry about your first sale like
your first sale is mentally the hardest
part so you really just want to get your
first sale out as immediately as
possible
and then you can worry about charging
what you feel like you deserve but you
want to get the first sale out right
away yeah like when I started I start at
12 I moved to 15 yeah we all survived
and now if someone wants to hire me
freelance it's 90 dollars an hour yeah
and so you should charge what it's worth
for your time and energy for you for
engineer trees my first sponsor like
mention I've ever charged was like 20
bucks and now I charge a thousand so
it's something that you build up over
time because you realize you kind of get
feel like what the markets worth for
your Bremen from my into my case my
video mentions so the next question is
how do you motivate yourself working so
many hours on coding and not standard
nine-to-five don't you you get this
question every day don't you I do this
all the time so don't you feel like you
miss out on life or have regrets later
in life without losing on your life
experiences yeah I mean I do work a lot
I work a standard nine-to-five so it
sounds like you think I don't have a job
I think yeah I am working Monday through
Friday at 9:00 to 5:00 and then
the morning I study after work I study
on the weekends I study I build things
it's just to get to that destination to
work to where you want to go to be where
you want to be and part of the part of
the thing and Matt can testify since
I've been in Florida is far the reason I
love being in Florida is I'm secluded
from all distractions I don't know
anybody I don't know what to do so I'm
able to stay here and be focused almost
to secluded really so that's the whole
topic in itself yeah it's also just
about how bad you want it right so like
it's real easy to go and just pop in
League of Legends or just drink your
yourself to stupidity and not have to
stress about being better and doing
better
but it just all depends on what it is
that you want to accomplish and if you
actually want to work towards this hard
work right it's not easy waking up at
5:00 working 2 and a half hours and then
going to work do you see how tired
Dillon looks right now yeah he looks
looks even more tired in person yeah how
long have we known each other since
we're at 13 however old you are in the
sixth grade
eleven eleven like 19 or 20 year 19 20
years but this is also this is also
important cuz what we helped each other
a lot right I hope you get a boost in
subscribers like for example the full
stack interview I did free it with with
you as a hundred thousand views and
that's why it's so important to to not
be I so even though it is important to
work a lot it's also important to find a
colleague or a friend who really
understands your mindset like we men
tell our made a joke the other day it's
like Matt I can't even find another
person with the mindset like we share
mindset and like we're the only two
people that I think we know at least it
from our upbringing yes with the same
mindset as us yeah there's very few like
old friends that are like okay well I'm
gonna go home I'm gonna grind down I'm
have a side project you know people like
that other other than matter other
youtubers or other other content
creators that are in the the space and
you know the the developers that you
actually know by name that are out there
the people who are building courses
writing books like those are the people
that I want to be like and I try to
surround myself with and you know I have
you know we're not like best buddies but
we are acquaintances we
me to get over email talk on the phone
every now and again so how do you ask I
can't pay for premium tutorials and
always learn from free websites like
free code camp and searching and
watching youtube videos do you think it
makes me slower or weaker than others
who can pay well take it from the guy
who just wouldn't even buy like a $15.00
horse for years uh I would recommend
buying a premium tutorial and I mean
every everyone has their own finance
issues but you can get udemy tours for
$10 they're much more organized as why I
think they're worth it yes for example
one of the affiliates I recommend is
Skillshare you get access to 19,000
courses for $15 per month it's like dude
you can sack the Netflix subscription
for a while to get the skill shirt
subscription a you access to 15,000
19,000 organized courses
the problem with learning from YouTube
videos is that don't make like one
tutorial on will say Scala or some shit
like that and then it'll be like one
hour thing and there's no homework
assignments and there's no follow-up
this is not it's not all put in one
place so you're losing money by losing
time by trying to gap all these
different things from all these sources
instead of having all the information
comes to consolidate in one place yeah
it's also that that's support on like
udemy right so like I know for my
courses when I get questions I answer
them every single time because you
actually paid money to take my course
first the people are just getting free
content probably run an ad blocking
these folks do but so but I but when I
was learning I was just doing free code
camp building my own projects I think
the real key if you really for whatever
reason you're just in a hut in like
Southeast Asia and you really can't
afford to buy a course you should start
building your own stuff that's really it
you just have to build build build build
build
so Richard says hey I'm from school for
that helpful I found I'm fine school
sure really helpful to be honest a
difference of opinion what courses have
you tried to take on Skillshare Richard
yeah I feel like I feel like when you
have a platform like Skillshare you have
to find those creators that are good
because anyone can post right anyone can
upload and go from there well there's
19,000 so you got it you do have to do a
little bit searching
how can you not be able to afford recode
care it's funny so Sam asked how do I
get more clients for my web developer
agency see you hire a high-ticket closer
and you pay them only Commission you
have to have someone so here's the
things uh so many people ask me how do I
become a freelance web developer have a
question for you are you confident
enough to get someone on the phone and
close them for $10,000 to make their
website you probably aren't right you
probably don't know how to do that you
probably know how to find people you
probably don't know you probably don't
want to do it and then and then most of
all you don't know the techniques and
the skills to close someone for to pay
you tens of thousands of dollars to do
their website so what you do is you find
a high ticket closer and you only pay
them a commission and their job is to go
find people for you but you got to give
them a considerable Commissioner
otherwise they're not gonna do it how
much money do you feel of course you
create on udemy I have two small courses
on udemy one javascript one on angular
36 one on angular 2 plus and I've made
about $500 for each one of them and
they're still bringing in money ha so
huh I know depends on the context but
it's pretty common question was the
average starting salary for a junior
front-end developer depends on where it
drastically depends on where if I was
just to give you a ballpark random
number based on all 50 states I would
say somewhere between 55 and 60,000 my
first role in in Tampa Florida area
I got 62,000 and that got bumped up to
67,000 after three months I wouldn't I
wouldn't care about where you start so
that's how many of you are focused on
where you start it only cares about
where you start it's about where you are
five years after you start just more
important like for example I've been
promoting a digital marketing course and
people are like oh they only got a
$40,000 job after three months we gotten
people 40,000 friends that was Cindy in
one example Cindy I took our course in
digital marketing she had a job in
digital marketing and like a month for
40,000 or 45,000 people like up $45,000
salary starting what do you suppose
do with that hey she got in like a month
after taking the course it's not about
where you start it's about where you are
five years or it's about the trajectory
it's about the potential and it's also
about the respect and one's skills that
you learn something like digital
marketing or what development it has
such good potential to not only get a
high salary later on but also do your
own thing yeah it's it's just like
someone's like oh that's so low $60,000
starting salary I think that's a fine
starting salary because in two years
you're gonna be at eighty thousand two
years after that you're gonna be at a
hundred thousand two years after that
you're yet 120 thousand and the reason
we're focused on coding and all spoken
digital marketing is because they offer
a lot of opportunity to start your own
thing and also a lot of opportunity to
work remotely and that's why we keep
promoting it that's why I don't really
want to make videos about mechanical
engineering civil engineering and remote
engineering anymore because I know
first of all those careers get capped
they have low opportunity to start your
own thing and they have zero opportunity
for remote work so that's why I don't I
don't really want to promote those
careers so doesn't offer you the
lifestyle and the potential that coding
or digital marketing would offer and I
was also if you do the most important
thing you need to consider when you're
starting your first developer job is
just getting the job getting the
experience and let's say you started
30,000 have it forbid let's say you do
your goal six months grind it out study
everything you can't become such a
better developer get the experience and
immediately start applying to a job base
60 so Sam some if you're looking for a
high ticket closer I recommend you going
to Dan Locke and asking him for a high
ticket closer he teaches a course on
high ticket closing and then his
graduates he's looking for people to
hire his graduates to be high ticket
closers only paid on Commission and
those students are willing to art they
want to do that job so a lot of you guys
may not understand that but there are
people who want to do high ticket
closing that's their passion and it's
also very efficient for them to make
money and they can do it remotely and
all they need is a phone so go to Dan
Locke email his staff and ask for a hot
ticket closer they're having a cohort
graduate and next week and they're gonna
have about 20 plus students or maybe
even like a Aundre I'm not sure how many
people are in the program it's a digital
it's a remote program but he has like a
load of students willing that
want to do a high-ticket closing because
imagine this you jump on the phone call
30 minutes to get off the phone call you
take you close the ten thousand dollar
client you get two thousand dollars you
know so some people really enjoy that
last though it's becoming a QA analyst
test or a good choice it depends on what
it is that you're trying to do there's
always going to be a role for quality
assurance and software development it's
slightly different than being a
developer there's white box testing
there's black box testing it really
depends on what you're trying to do but
yeah you can make decent money as a QA I
typically believe it's a little less
development but not everybody wants to
put in time outside work does it stay up
to date and you don't necessarily have
to do that with quality assurance you
just have to it's not as in demand but
it's definitely a skill that's needed
yeah so scindia says true I'm hoping
that my digital marketing background
will give me a leg up and salary but
there are so many SAS products that are
related to digital marketing so if you
have a digital marketing background and
then you apply to a SAS company for
digital marketing you're almost
guaranteed to interview yeah this is one
of those things where people are like
well what do I put on my resume should I
include my experience if I don't have
any in any in front-end it's like well
if you actually take your experience and
it's applicable right you're applying to
a construction company that needs a
software developer and used to be in
construction yes and it absolutely think
plus it's nothing but a plus huge plus
actually it's one that it's what makes
you unique it's like oh my gosh like
someone who with the technical skills
web developer skills and also knows our
industry yes that's hard to find that's
that's your the needle in a haystack at
that point and that's that's why the the
digital marketing is very good as well
because every company has a marketing
department and it's going to appreciate
that you can do that this here o was the
digital marketing course if you go to my
youtube channel engineer truth there's a
huge testimonial playlist that's on the
channel page it says digital marketing
testimonials just watch one of those
videos and you'll see what we're talking
about what sites was I looking at why
applying for my first job I was applying
I did a little bit of Craigslist but
the most most of it was linked in and
zip recruiter so ACTRA asked what did
you guys read down Locke's book fu money
and so what do you think of it so Dan
Locke has a book that you can download
for free if you watch the webinar just
sign up for his webinar and uh it's very
interesting because if I had read this
book a year ago I would it be annoyed by
it because it talks about like mindset
it's a lot of mindset stuff but at the
same time um he said things that are
counter to counter intuitive and what I
realized life is like full circle right
like I used to think mine stuff mindset
stuff I'm there psychology was the most
important thing and I reached a point
where I was like you only need to know
technical skills right and then I I
listened to your stories about how your
web developers yeah they have technical
skills but they don't have the mindset
to grow right they're just going to
their job for the last five years
they're not improving so then it kind of
comes back in assert full circle where
it's like no your mindset is a lot of
things so what Dan Locke's book is that
it really sets you that the mindset of
how you should think of money and well I
agree with almost everything you said
it's in that book uh for example he says
like if you want to be a millionaire you
should spend like you oh you are a
millionaire and like if you don't really
understand that they'll disagree with
that people say like you guys spent
under your means which is what I believe
before but ever since I've been spending
more money I've had a lot more drive to
earn more money whereas when I was so
frugal with my money
for example 2016-2017 I was very frugal
with my money and I was earning a lot
more money than now spending but in
doing that I had no motivation to work
harder because imagine I'm saving more
than 50% of what I make what's my
motivation to work harder if I'm saving
over 50% of what I make right it's like
what's the point at that what's the
point
but once I started spending more then
now I'm like oh shoot I got I gotta
actually I gotta actually work so that I
live in the Audi oh yeah yeah so in
spending more it makes me work more and
and so I know you know recently I just
flew business class first time in my
life right and like I'd refuse class I
started working a lot more and then I
recently I just bought an Audi which he
asked to find on my Instagram I bought
an Audi and ever since about he I've
been working extra more so in spending
more and treating yourself like a
millionaire you actually and you want to
identify as the persona as someone
that's a
right and a millionaire isn't gonna
still drive a 2000 Camry when he doesn't
need to you right so in and behaving out
like a millionaire you actually start
acting like a millionaire because you
identify as someone like that how many
hours you put in Cody while you're
working for full time I mean I've worked
about two hours in the morning about two
hours after working about eight hours on
a Saturday and a Sunday so the question
is how do I put how do I spin my
experience as a general manager at a
restaurant into something applicable
when applying is webdev so I would say
apply it to the to the company right so
let's say for some reason you're going
into a FinTech company right where as
the manager you're probably gonna have
to do some some tax paperwork you're
probably gonna have to do some payroll I
would try and spin my bullet points for
that role to include the the software
that you would use for that as well as
just you know try it's all about
relating it to their business that's how
I would do it you know I wouldn't be
like ordered people around did you are
yes answer the question about how many
numbers of hours of practice or more uh
I actually did a whole video about this
about how many hours you should code a
day it came out like maybe two weeks ago
you can go watch it on the channel but
the gist of it is about three to four
every day every single day until you
have a fucking job I'm gonna say one
more time cuz everyone asks this how
many hours a day how can I get a job
code every day till you have a job no
excuses how many days every day every
day every day oh my god they tell you I
have a fucking job and then you'll get a
job okay that's just how it works it's a
it's a you need to build up the habits
and you need to if this stuff builds on
top of each other so by the way when I
when I mentioned earlier to spend more
I'm spending more within reason right I
do have like I do spend still less than
what I make but now it's much the ratio
is much closer right like maybe now
I'll spend about 80% of what I make and
I don't plan to do this like permanently
but for now I want to I want to spend
80% whatever and make so that I'm
incentivized to grow my income then then
the ratio will go down right all right
so what kind of technical interview did
you have a so do you know have you
talked about how 95 percent of people
who apply for devil of Abela paroles
don't know how to make basic code shit
yes you better talk about it I I don't
know if I've talked specifically about
this but I find it hard to believe but I
own the story this is actually pretty
funny story okay so my work has like a
five step process and one of the steps
is a very introduction white board
interview where you come on they ask you
to solve a problem which essentially
just is a four loop with a if statement
so what it's the most fish I think I'll
interview the first thing you learn in
coding yeah okay kick I'm gonna give you
a number in a function any number I want
you to return all numbers that are
evenly divisible by five that's the
that's the the whiteboard question it's
not a trick question it's not a hard
question unfortunately according to my
my tech leads and the people on the
channel
95 out of the hundred people cannot
solve that problem on a whiteboard and
part of it is probably just being
applying to jobs for the ready and not
being prepared part of it is just not
practicing for technical interviews part
of is just straight up lying on their
resume so I couldn't believe this to
know so Dylan did I both couldn't
believe this when I heard so the
recorder is telling you that that was
true and then you're like nah there's no
way no way and then you kept asking
people right yeah yeah I asked like for
other people who do the interviews
because I just thought it was bullshit
oh so 95 percent of them cannot cannot
do that now I I had something very
similar there's another part of the
technical interview process but it goes
back so if you guys haven't heard of
fizzbuzz if it's a very similar to a
physical question
and I think it was like Steve Jobs who
said that if you asked the average
developer to do the fizzbuzz problem
which essentially is if it's divisible
by five if it's divisible by three it
was divisible by both print out
something that's pretty fucking easy
yeah it's and with the it summary roll
out the answer yeah modulus so that if
you something I think Steve hey I might
be misquoting who is from but there's
some some some CEO yeah some CEO
entrepreneur of note said that 95
percent of deaths can't solve that
that's crazy
all the knobs that they're just applying
for Deb Holmes know that he was talking
specifically about senior devs well it
yeah so crazy so it's uh it's just one
of those things where you have to be
prepared first simple stuff like that I
also have yeah and that was a fair thing
and I think part of part of that there
at least there approaches it's super
overwhelming doing these technical
interviews you have four people there
asking you to solve an algorithm on a
white board on the spot on the spot
right so y'all ready nervous cuz are
there so uh that's super awkward and
then they followed that up cuz that's a
very easy problem with a technical
project like a three to four hour
project that you go and turn in there's
a lot of work but I understand why the
project follows that so um give us
another interview question it depends
every company is different so Cynthia
asks what would you say your are the
biggest mistakes junior devs make wall
on the job not asking for help I think a
lot of times this goes for a lot of
contract employees so like half hour
half contractors are just bad developers
and they refuse to ask for help even
though you'll extend a hand and so
they're so worried about asking for help
they actually get fired because they're
doing such a bad job like it's kind of
counterintuitive right yeah and ask for
help so that you don't spend fifteen
hours writing one line of code instead
someone says oh well do it this is what
you do and you grow from that that
learning of working with developers who
get it and that's my number one thing is
asked
when it comes down to it sounds cliche
but it's not what you know but it's like
your soft skills right like it's a soft
skill to ask what you know right and
then it's a soft skill to be like hey
can you help me with this in a way that
quite finding the timing to help think
about who to ask think about the way to
word it right like and then also being
humbling yourself to to ask for help
right like that's why your success
depends more on your mindset and it is
on your technical skills because like
you could always be it's easier for
someone to become technical it is harder
for someone to change their mindset
because your mindset you feel like
that's this the way you think yeah it's
it's so it's very counterintuitive
because I try to focus so hard on on the
soft skills like you still have to have
the technical since I know the type of
soft skills make care of you through
when your technical skills are dogshit
well your ear your mentality is what is
what Rose you though right like because
for example you you work all the time
but then like your coworkers who are
also web developers they don't care they
don't care to work at Google they don't
think they're at mindset of like having
a YouTube channel doesn't make sense to
them working on Google applying for jobs
in time does it go doesn't make sense to
them right so like they're really
comfortable with where they are and then
that's just a choice things are like
yeah that's a cool thing to do I wish I
did that well well you can't like you
just have to put in the time right you
just gotta you just gotta start knocking
it out so sona's so Stephanie asked me
hey Matt do you feel lonely sometimes
because most of your friends are working
at a job I hired two full-time employees
just so I don't have to be alone so so
so 2017 just I was doing the cliche
4-hour workweek stuff it's typical
temporary stuff and then I was like it's
kind of cool by like Monday through
Friday I really have to look for shit to
do during the days cuz everyone's else's
at work and it gets kind of boring so
that's why I hired two employees to hang
out with me
and they're doing work too but so that's
that's the thing is like the solopreneur
thing as much as people want to
advertise and I think as much as like
that's a good place to get started well
once you're a solopreneur for a couple
years it gets too lonely and then that's
when it's time to hire people so that
yeah so she can grow something together
but also so that you also it's more
interactive you have some social
interaction do you think it's
also change your mindset if so you just
have to consciously work at it every day
and then eventually it becomes part of
your life a lot of times people are
really just gonna they're gonna have
that one day where yeah man I'm gonna go
to the gym I'm gonna get fit or whatever
it is in your life but you actively have
to do it for 30 90 days to tell us part
of your life now this much much easier
well anyone in this watching this live
stream is probably has a better mindset
than that your average show because
you're taking the time to improve
yourself and I send on a live stream and
you stay here and you're watching us and
you you you you it's probably because
you share our mindset right if you
didn't share a mindset for example I
quit engineering like and I think the
cliche Mackay like physical engineering
like mechanical aerospace is dumb so if
you're someone that doesn't share that
mindset with me you're probably don't
tune in to my stuff for the online
presence what is the percent value of
the phone so that you can't preside
you can't put percent values on personal
branding you can just say it helps or it
doesn't help because who really knows
how much it works your github code
probably helps a ton a Stack Overflow
profile is gonna help LinkedIn reference
they're going to help blog is going to
help online portfolio unlike portfolio
and your github code are the two best
ones of the options there yeah well
github code is is a popular right yeah
it's essentially a portfolio actually
it's just a little different in front
end because front-end most developers
unless you're working with mobile apps
but if you're backing developer you
don't necessarily have like a micro
service set up or people can see your
code working and going but it's
definitely more important for the
front-end to have a visual portfolio
that a lot of other languages don't
necessarily so you want to have both
right you want to have the github friend
Stack Overflow profile so you're found
in the text world but at some point you
also need to get found by recruiters and
recruiters aren't looking on github or
developers right they're looking on they
did so you got to do everything and you
have have to have a balance of
everything cuz different platforms are
for different you're gonna get
discovered in different ways yeah it's
also it just this is one of the things
that I hate when people ask questions
about should I do this should I do that
it's like well it only helps you like
these things there's not like oh I have
a Stack Overflow profile or ever get a
profile what is the harm that
come from it nothing literally nothing
you just it will only help you so you're
just gonna keep trucking forward and
doing all these things having a good
LinkedIn all that it's it's all the same
stuff where you it just only helps you
so then with in terms of mindset by the
way it's uh it's really important that
you consume books that have that focus
on mindset and I wouldn't mean ignore
even now with my proper mindset I read a
few money which is basically a book on
mindset about money and it's still it's
still very helpful to me now so I think
you should always kind of come back to
mindset every once at all you should be
reading my books all day like there's
only so many Tony Robbins books that you
should be reading but every once in a
while revisit the topic so that you stay
on point with it and it's not so much
for the practical stuff but it's more so
that the motivational stuff and success
is half motivation like if Dylan wasn't
motivated to do all the shit he's doing
he wouldn't do any of it right here you
just probably be uh still making I'm
replaying a shit-ton yeah he's feeling a
shitload of legal age and still working
at Domino's with the Ford Explorer that
made the clickety clackety clackety
client gonna blow up oh I feel bad for
the guy that drives that car so back in
entry so this one's for you back-end
engineer entry-level jobs what advice
can you give to someone with no degree
or experience who has interests in front
end to get a job but no interest in
front end uh you used to building micro
services you need to build a portfolio
of micro services and you need to put on
your github do all this all the other
things that we suggest your your
portfolio page will need a front end for
them to test and use your micro services
to see them and deliver the JSON data
formatted back and forth code on the
github LinkedIn resume all that sort of
stuff well here's the problem with only
knowing back-end is that you can't
really use it unless you do a call from
the front end right uh well you can use
there's tools like postman that you can
use yeah but you still have to have some
get yeah - some read
experience a built-in to to test to see
what fucking works yeah yeah you just
have to know what tools to use so it's
headed so the front ends client is
customers but back ends client is the
front end and so it's a little bit of a
different mindset of that but you say
you will probably need just to have a
simple front end a form where someone
can put in the parameters chassis yeah
yeah you have to know some friends
because the other hesitation yeah yeah
you don't have to worry about the design
though like design or something else I
just for designers but you do have to
worry about like what the front end is
asking for well yeah it may be tough to
show off a back and front and that's why
you need to make that UI be like here
are my they're my four rest cause you
know mind my post I put my delete my
update and display what change how it
changed you could do audit log with it
and just you know authentication and go
from there someone just said they just
got a draw a job at Papa John's so how
many views I work at Domino's like five
I work it out around till Pete's over a
year we all started off in pizza yeah
hey hey if you want to be successful you
gotta start up in pizza that's that's
the secret expert secret I also worked
at Papa John's for three months as a
second job and I just stopped showing up
is awful job and Rizzo's pizza in high
school I've done the Pizza trifecta so I
think we're done with questions right
yeah okay so he has any of the last
super last questions or if not we're
just gonna go to get some food yeah Oh
what do you put on LinkedIn if you just
started coding but for you cook em yeah
put your personal projects I put all my
resume experience even all I literally
down to my very first high school job
just so that people can see I'm always
just grinding what's your opinion on on
these starter jobs like shit people do
this you people do it like working a
subway working at well your Linkedin not
on the LinkedIn but like you know and
their early career because we did it yes
I feel like if I don't have a choice
today but I would still recommend it to
someone even after they're in a
situation where they don't have to do it
because it builds character
I would disagree completely I'm against
any job that doesn't help you in the
future and those jobs don't you may say
helps build character anything else I
think if you sit in a room and you code
ten hours a day building side projects
but then but then both character that
here's the thing is coding is only
helpful if you find problems in the real
world to solve if you're only coding and
you know they're still gonna be sort of
the real world we're gonna stall way
it's not gonna change that so but I say
so but you said you recommend coding all
day
however if you're coding all day you're
not it's one of those situations where
you don't know you know you're not gonna
be able to have real-life experiences to
bring into your code to solve real-world
problems yeah I accept people live in
the real world and they're gonna be
going to Maps how so because all right
let's say we're talking about sixteen
year old kids okay at least 16 years of
experience even if it's just yeah but
none of it's working though so so first
of all you gotta find a Palmer ruling
people are willing to pay money for you
understand how money works well I'm not
saying you're talking about starting a
massive your own project I'm simply
talking about side projects and starting
something and then the bigger idea as
you learn from those side projects as
you network as you meet people and you
go and and develop as an individual you
then will find that a bigger project
under oath but what I'm trying to say is
it's it's when you pull things outside
like for example YouTube in itself would
be boring if you don't pull things like
life experiences in outside of YouTube
into YouTube for example you're pulling
coding into YouTube so that's why I
makes it interesting I pull in my
engineering experence into YouTube
that's always interesting if I don't
have that background of like hating
engineering I would have nothing to say
on to YouTube same thing with coding if
you don't have like a variety of life
experiences you're not gonna be a good
coder because you don't understand like
the problems outside of just coding
right you might be a technical expert in
coding but you don't understand the
real-life applications of problems you
could be solving with code and yeah we
hated our job so fucking much that we
were dedicated to never going back to
that lifestyle and unless you have that
experience you're not gonna you're not
gonna be as motivated because you're
gonna think oh it's not so bad like
sound so bad and then once you do work
pizza for a year or two years you're
like fuck that I'm never going back yeah
yes
there's definitely like I I'm a great
example of just someone who is just like
I can't do this anymore and you could go
and be humbled by it and and be
motivated by it but I'm saying in a
perfect world where you I think
educating yourself and you're saying
look I I got I got these guys on
youtubes are sending me on the right
path
I have the right mentality that if you
can avoid those bullshit jobs and still
have the right mentality you should you
should do it and just gain things that
are going to have value in the future oh
I think I think working on somewhere
over McDonald's all that stuff how does
have extreme amount of value because you
know but I think more people get lost in
it then it provides value like I think
you're taking a bigger risk going and
getting some bullshit paycheck wasting
your time there then people get building
character and coming out of it that's my
thing I think anybody here working a
bullshit job is probably not in that
situation
but we're just talking about in general
right but yeah it's not are you that
you're not going to build character at
one of these jobs of course you are
you're gonna work in a really shitty
industry I mean work giving up at 5:00
a.m. to go work my first job was that
ever since I was fifteen and a half I
got up at 5:00 a.m. to work job getting
carts thrown on that stupid-ass orange
vest being very humbled all the time and
sometimes that sort of hitting rock
bottom whatever it is for you will be
what carries you through I think that's
where it defines you to write like David
like you mentioned before like some
people get those jobs and we know people
from my high school that may still very
well be working at Target and it's just
like they reach that job and they stay
there for five years right and it
defines you right like so they did it
for five years we have people you know
we have classmates who are still reaches
and waiters at thirty years old you know
because and which they started out like
twenty years old so they got they got
comfortable in it which I agree with
but then for people like us we did and
we're like dude how can anybody want to
barely afford rent for the rest of their
lives that doesn't make sense and unless
we had that experience I don't think we
would be as motivated to do what we're
doing now yes that I mean that is true I
just saying that if you can if you
already have that mentality and you can
see and like and you can get that like a
lot of people's parents are fucking suck
they're working the McDonald's jobs it's
very easy to see mom and dad
much as you love them barely paying rent
bar and $100 from their son or whatever
yeah say look I don't want that shit you
don't necessarily have to go and put
your yourself in their shoes so Dan
Locke actually can't had a good quote
it's an F you money it says all success
comes from frustration right so if
you're not getting frustrated for
example learn how to code
can't imagine everyone here guarantee
and this hat has feel assured with code
at least once even in the beginning
right so all success comes from
frustration so if you live this life
where you're not getting frustrated and
it's better to get good feel frustrated
at multiple angles like if you're only
pressured at code
you only learn lessons about code right
but you feel frustrated in other aspects
of life like dating right if you look
flustered about dating then you're gonna
start working out or gonna start
dressing better because the frustration
of getting rejected if you get
frustrated at work with subway that's a
different angle of getting frustrated
you want to get frustrated at different
angles so that you yourse more
well-rounded instead of just being a
code god only a coding person because if
you only know coding and that's the only
thing that you got you're not gonna be
well balanced and you're actually gonna
get capped out it's the CEOs the people
who start companies are usually well
balanced people to have some good soft
skills they had different they have
different angles of life but it's
usually not the person who's only became
a coding god only did coding that
becomes that's not successful just
because you're not working a shitty
part-time job doesn't mean I can get
frustrated there's frustration every
aspect of life the dating school coding
thing I think they're working the shitty
job is an important really key really
key part of the frustration yeah I mean
the truth of the matter is everyone here
is gonna work a shitty job so we're just
and it's pretty unlikely if someone's
not gonna work a minimum-wage job
yeah I'm just saying in a perfect world
if you have the right mentality and
you're able to stay at home read free
and just grind it out that's what bi
what I would do if I was 16 but in the
real world you're most everyone here his
parents aren't wealthy most people most
everyone here aren't independently
wealthy by the time they're and there's
a reasonable adult right there's a
reason why people keep running the chat
like I worked at Subway I worked at a
pizza over to Papa John's I mean we all
had to do at one point and this point
what I think is saying it's good that
we're opening up to them
expensive drink is like they're probably
thinking like I'm an I'm so behind I'm
so behind Dylan where Dylan worked that
piece of Domino's for five years I
worked yeah yeah
so there's comfort in knowing that we
were just there ten years ago or more
thirteen years ago for me it was like
five years ago it was it was five years
it wasn't that long ago on that note we
will leave you check out mass channel at
engineered truth all that good stuff
yeah yeah yeah so oh you guys had a full
time out of fun time hanging out with us
we're gonna go get breakfast yeah oh my
god</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
