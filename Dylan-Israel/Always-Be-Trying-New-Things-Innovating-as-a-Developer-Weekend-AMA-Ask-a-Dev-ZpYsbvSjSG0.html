welcome to the weekend AMA I'm your host
as always still in this room we are for
those of you are new to the channel what
I like to do every weekend is I take
about an hour and answer some questions
answer so I'm just should provide
guidance right it's always hopeful have
a developer as you're trying to become a
developer answer some of your questions
that's really what this is about
and I usually start off with a topic as
people come in and and today's topic is
kind of a cool one usually they're based
on the questions and whatever people ask
me or or anything like that so today is
today's topic is always about innovating
and trying new things as a developer and
the reason I want to talk about this is
it's something I'm trying to do with in
my life right so right now if you guys
haven't noticed I've been putting out
like oh you know 30 minute to an hour
tutorial for the last four weeks or so
and I have a couple more planned
covering various software topics and
sort of introduction guys and that's one
way that I'm continuing my learning and
you know changing up the channel and I'm
reading books for the first time and and
continuing to grow and with personal
projects I am learning I'm gonna I think
I'm gonna start diving outside of
angular since I work within the
workplace and maybe start picking up
view or even react lean towards few but
always sort of innovating try new things
and progressing and it's it's very easy
to go to what you know right it's very
easy for me to go and continue building
angular projects you know I get paid to
do that I I can do it don't have to
think about it and
that's fine so it's that's that's a very
easy thing to do but the harder thing to
do is to try new things to learn new
things and to progress in different
directions even if you're not going to
use it in the workplace it's going to be
a skill that you're going to pick up and
so that that's really what I wanted to
point out is that don't be afraid to you
know spend a weekend two weekends a
month picking up a technology that you
may never use because you actually never
know when it may come in handy you know
so be willing to take those try new
things go in different directions and
see what's out there well still you know
you always have to have the practical
aspect of all right is you know is
Pascal gonna give me a job maybe not but
I think you guys can weigh the pros and
cons so let's see some questions so try
new things at my new job on program net
after putting out for 12 years nice yeah
we do not net at my workplace I need to
pick it up to be honest I need to dive
into a great challenge but keep us a
good vice thank you very much huh it's
coding good for people who are visually
creative yes especially in the front end
so a lot of front-end developers they
don't they don't know and I apologize if
I sound like I'm a little congested I am
I had trouble sleeping last night but
they most friend and devs aren't UI UI
UX people so you can go into UI UX which
is essentially your designing how things
are gonna look and function and then you
can also have that skill carried over
into front-end which is a great great
area for you to go into
yeah it's actually one of the things
that I've been thinking about reaching
out to on these online boot camps that
specializes in ui/ux
and see if they would let me in 10 for
free and I'd do some videos because I it
is an area that I do suffer it and I
would like to learn you don't want to
fill all the gaps guy doing backend
stuff at work no I was asked to but it
just never seems like there's any time
to dive into it none of my current job
but yeah we're a angular and dotnet shop
so yeah
innovation of what contacts innovation
in your learning path innovation in in
trying new things stepping outside the
box that could be that could be hey I've
never gone to a hackathon before I
already have a job
I know should I still go yes you should
go going to meetups it could be reading
a book for the very first time it could
be writing your very first blog posts
doing you know contributing open-source
for the first time volunteering for
these you know code.org there's a bunch
of different ways that you can go and
get started
stick to one framework or try every new
framework so it depends on where you're
at in your career um
I personally it really there's three
frameworks so there's angular there's
reacting there's review and it depends
on what the jobs in our are in your area
I would probably pick if if react just
popping off and react seems to be diving
interactive angular's popping off in
your area you know go angler if you go
view but i would say i would say in the
short term it's probably better to focus
on one and then as you progressing our
career
expand out that would be my advice
good morning Justin yeah uh you know so
my thing is you do one professionally
and then you do one personally and
sometimes they they connect sometimes
they overlap you know thinking about
going to a three-month boot camp that's
exciting you can do it online area so
you in a person boot camp TL TL DR is a
is a too long didn't read so it's kind
of it it comes from like patch notes and
it comes from like it's just like an
Internet term for like this was too long
and I have time to read it so the idea
of being that um is essentially a crash
course so you're just learning what it
is so that's that's the way mg toh it's
a $10 donation thank you man I
appreciate that
doesn't even say anything with it just
says here's my money take it no I
appreciate it man thank you very much
for the support obvious the TLT arts too
long didn't her it's like you might see
sometimes some people just on reddit or
people in the comment section right
 essays and someone will just be
like TL DR we're talking about you know
cat poop how can you be so passionate
yeah so I got a nice cantaloupe carrot
juice freshly squeezed freshly juiced
juice right here every morning we drink
fresh juice that's one of our health
choices we're making some are good some
are less than good what we drank them
all
God the Kelvin was always so bad always
good to give to those who do so ever
thank you man I appreciate that so for
those you don't know I'm saving to buy a
house so when you when you donate ten
dollars you're buying a brick of that
house I appreciate it it goes I have my
youtube money from YouTube the Adsense
go directly into an account that into a
separate account into my separate a
separate checking account where I'm
going to use that to buy a house so I
appreciate that very much so yeah
exactly twelve months for my graduation
what do you suggest
so that that I'm not giving you advice
twelve months out that is way too far
out I would say that look at the market
and also if what you learned was
relevant to your area trying get a job
in that what your degree is then easier
time adjusting I real
enjoy coding and I want to continue
learning but being in high school while
playing sorts makes it extremely hard
yeah man I mean we all have to make
sacrifices to accomplish our goals
you know I know like when I was learning
the code I was working full time you
know and I've had a part-time job doing
lift I still manage to put three or four
hours a day in and I had to say no to
going out and no to spending money cuz I
don't have any also so you know
sometimes you have to decide what's
important and if planes for us is more
important that's okay um it's it it's
this thing it's the there's no judgment
about what's important to you if it's
important to you to play baseball play
football fine
completely understand that that's where
your priorities are but I mean you have
to understand that is it is a choice and
you just say look this priority one is
is you know maybe school priority two is
sports priority threose coding so who do
you have those priorities that's how
that you just have to go in order you
know and it's it's just a reality of
things do you think about trying new
things personal I think there's no
problem absolutely when trying something
new when it comes to professional I
think you have to have a very strong not
only I think you have to be very well
versed in whatever it is you're
suggesting I think it should be I think
you have to be I can't put this not only
do you have to be well first and
educated and I think there has to be a
very good use case so like if you go
into your work tomorrow and say look
well we're switching over I think we
should switch over from a relational
database to a document based database
why because there's going to be a
learning curve for everybody but if you
have a good reason why and you're
educated in it
then maybe you can you know that's not a
bad thing if you so that's my thing is
if you have a reason why and you're
educated in the technology and you just
don't say hey I heard in a blog post or
did you actually go on and read in-depth
did you actually build something with it
and so if you're educated in it and
you've worked in it feel fine suggesting
it but just know that you know you're
probably good they're probably gonna be
looking to you for guidance since it was
your idea you know just don't throw
something out there and not and expect
it to be fully adopted and no one's
going to question you on it so you just
have to be prepared that's all swimming
has been also for my wife and I I know
you started exercise in school I found
family time yeah you know what it's been
getting hotter again
in Florida so I might start so I was
swimming last summer almost every day
for like three four months and I felt
really good and I'm trying to lose some
weight
get some muscle back so I might start it
up again it wouldn't be a bad idea
I'm thinking of my work just from using
FG FTP basically inversion be using it I
mean I think like I think it was 88% of
workplaces use git or something like
that yeah a lot of places use it it's
like there's things get and then there's
nothing else
basically there's get and the next all
is everybody else who's an older
developer that never wanted to move to
get that's really how it is
two to four hours daily around I ain't
doing that I'm talking about going in
there swimming maybe four or five laps
and leaving the smoke it's it's the
essential oil diffuser I have some
peppermint oil in there right now
what's a guys I gotta blow my nose
that's better Oh project ideas for
angular I find that you should dive into
at least one or two API projects when
you're working on the front-end but
other than that this is something that
you enjoy choose a topic that you enjoy
that's useful um what's up how's life
treating nice pretty good man um I have
I have no complaints I I've been house
shopping with a co-worker of mine so I
don't know if I'm ready to buy a house
yet I probably need to save a little bit
more money I've been one of my
co-workers as a house shopping so for
last two weeks I've been going on lunch
breaks here there and we've been looking
at some houses and we looked at some
really nice brand new houses that uh
that uh we could he could get her I
could get and really made me think about
just buying something brand new fairly
affordable but they were beautiful so
the the cracked-out Shack house is it
life is good though and I for those of
you don't know I also gave up caffeine
for the most part in energy drinks it's
been a little over two weeks it's a very
strange thing it's been so long since I
haven't so I drink a little bit of green
tea at work like two or three cups a day
at green tea but there's very little
compared to coffee energy drinks black
tea there's very little tea in our very
little caffeine and green tea and so
first week was rough the you know the
first week was really rough so and I
felt slower it felt like is I wasn't
moving as fast and I felt a lot less
jittery
but now I feel alright I feel like I'm
back in normal our house is in the Tampa
st. Pierre you priced a good value there
up in value from what they were before
like but like we were this was in the in
the Palmetto Bradenton area which is
basically 20 minutes from st. Pete maybe
30 minutes from st. P because you have
to go across the big bridge and the
houses we were looking at we're like
three-bedroom two-bath and these are
brand-new by the way fully renovated you
know they're fully you know brand-new
granite countertops backyards and and
they were about $250,000 and they're
brand new is come with a den in a flex
room and you know so and they were about
2,100 square feet some of them some of
them were like 1,800 square feet and
then if you went up to like 300,000
you're giving like a two-story house
with like a loft up above and it's like
a four-bedroom three-bath and so uh in
terms of my view they were excellent
prices but I'm from California where
shit's up and so like you go to
California height I get emails from an
old job I worked in the South Bay in the
in Southern California and there'll be
houses built a hundred years ago and
they spent 20 grand to read I'm not
known by the way I'm not exaggerating
when I say a hundred years ago literally
I saw a house maybe six months back that
was built in a 1920 and they had
renovated it it was 700 square feet and
they were asking 850 thousand dollars
and they'll probably sell it they will
probably sell it
alright let's just we're just gonna go
ahead and immediately I don't we high
this guy will just put that guy blocked
that's inappropriate
so how my compliments are died I tried
to let April do the shopping and cook at
home and not worry about it and so
basically just for breakfast I've juice
and I'm trying to eat healthier on my
lunch breaks but it hasn't run going too
well III my diet needs to get better can
you give us link the links were even buy
some things for me set up I'll do a
setup video one day or set up a lot so I
one thing I need to do is like make a
affiliate page on my website and stuff
like that but yeah I'll do something
like that in the near future have I
tried out graph QL I have not I'm a big
fan of it in theory I just haven't used
it what if someone asks how you're doing
me completely broke down crying I'm
telling your woes to the camera laying
them and I really feel there's a time
where I mean there was a time where as a
young man I would hold back crying quite
well as a dolt I probably would just cry
I probably excused myself cry I can't
imagine I would ever be in such a
fragile state that uh that that aren't
on eliminating the word try I see I need
to yes I have for not doing my my
exercises I've said a very bare-bones
minimum exercise routine and I am
increasing it every 21 days or so and
it's been helping so far slow and steady
and I need to do the same for my diet so
you're right so it is absolutely true
Michael Dunn thank you for holding me
accountable have I considered buying
investment properties first yeah I mean
that's one of the things is the house is
that we're looking at their brand new
construction for him not necessarily
what I was looking for I'm more so
looking for like duplexes old duplexes
old maybe apartments the problem is is a
lot of these I've looked at houses in
the same range to two hundred to two
hundred fifty thousand and it's it's
it's one of those things where there's a
lot of people who are just sort of out
of there like there's a lot of houses
that aren't going to sell on the market
it's it's so strange looking at a house
that's 250 that's a mile this way 250 a
mile that way same neighborhood
but two different people that are
completely out of their mind like they
don't really want to sell their house is
how I have kind of and it's the same
thing with a lot of these duplex and
houses with backhouses so yes that is a
direction that I will be going I'm also
not actively looking I'm kind of just
going to see what he's looking at this
will kind of base it off and see what
I'm going but uh yeah so if I broke down
crying in a video I don't know I I can't
imagine so here's the thing there's
nothing in my life that could really
happen that other than other than like a
loss of a loved one that would probably
put me in that state if I lost my job
I'd be fine if my job started treating
me like I'm just leaving get a new
job if April left me that would be
surprising very very surprising out of
the blue that might do it though I might
do it I think I think the I think at
first so what you would get is anger
before you get the sadness that's what I
think would be oh I would tell you
though I mean I've had videos on here
I've had live streams on here where I've
been open like hey man I'm not
something's not right in my life I'm not
feeling right
unload the pressed been very open about
it and you know this is what in the
reason I share those things is not you
know partly to get off my chest feel
better another another part of it is to
say hey how how can we you know if how
can we have we being people who are in
the same situation you know not feel
this way anymore because it sucks so you
know that I was sharing that so I could
share my attempted solution so what I'm
going to do different and what I'm going
to do better should I worry about fave
icons for making website yeah I mean
it's not that big of a task for you you
go and you go and you get a fav icon
there's little converters online they'll
do it for you
thing that worries me I'm always so like
I went to gamestop yesterday I never got
a game stuff we were in the area and I
like this Nintendo 64 shirt I saw it and
there's a guy there working behind the
counter he's just talking up with nice
guy he's just talking up with one of the
guests and and he had mentioned his
daughter and I was just thinking like
god man we're gonna gain like right now
the economy is great by most people
standards and it's just like working a
game soft with children that's got to be
rough you know like that's got to be a
bit of a grind and oh my god I don't I
don't know I like like it's just what if
someone steals your fav icon you don't
worry about it oh yeah it was just
something like like I don't know man
where you're like how did you and I it's
not that uncommon either where how do
you when you're making a minimum-wage
job go and have children how do you do
that it's no no given and you just
don't pull out I I guess that's how you
do it but I guess I guess how do you how
do you put yourself in that that
situation where now it's gonna be that
much harder for you to get your life
together because now you have another
life and Falls and it's it's so strange
to me but also people people have
different values and Mayola so I don't
know I don't know maybe I'm being too
judgmental um just just so first name
start a firm work first startup work as
a freelancer I would say you could work
as a freelancer and find a job starting
and then you can do all of those find a
job so I I personally so if working for
a start-up and starting a firm are two
things that are gonna be a little here
any little bit of experience for most of
the time she's not making good money
don't have kids say I don't I don't say
that necessarily but I just I don't know
like what's the rush man like I think I
could have kids right now and be fine
but if you had asked me five years ago
when I was a college student sleeping on
couches and going hungry I probably
wasn't the best candidate to have kids
for some people having kids what makes
them get things together I could
understand that I would hope so but I
would say that's that's the Michael I
would say that's probably the exception
to the norm I've seen way more people
not have their together have kids
then do but like I don't think that's
any probably percent wise I don't think
it's any different than people who don't
have children don't have their
together as well children are worth it
yeah I don't know man objectively they
are not objectively as someone who
doesn't have children but fully
understands the responsibility of having
children in terms of time commitment
lifestyle changes financial commitment I
just can't see it but then again I don't
have children so this is this is from a
objective standpoint of someone who's
never had children and never liked
children I don't like being around
children I
I don't like little kids and I never
have objectively girlfriends and wives
aren't worth it I think I see the wife a
special I guess I could see the the
marriage aspect where now you're you're
putting yourself in a financial
situation which is why you have to get a
prenup but I could I could disagree no
because a girlfriend unlike your unlike
a girlfriend or wife when it comes to
children you can ditch your children at
least I mean legally you can't you ditch
your girlfriend her life if you know on
boyfriend her husband as well this is
not one side to thing you could you know
it is one of those things where things
aren't working you can cut ties you know
it is a partnership there it one year
when you have a girlfriend I mean have a
wife or a boyfriend a husband it is a
partnership both people are bringing
something to the table
children don't bring to the table
for like 30 years
please well yeah we're again we're
getting off topic I don't want to make
people feel bad about their children
that's not what this is about this is
just my own objective opinion on
children I'm a newcomer
programming often feel overwhelmed does
this feeling ever go away yes
slowly believe it or not do you most
coders feel like they're struggling you
have constantly learning new things it's
a it's this process Devron Devron tum
Paco that's quite the name yeah it's
completely normal and there's also you
know think when you first get your first
Jeff job called impostor syndrome where
you kind of feel like you snuck in the
back door no one everyone's gonna
discover that you're not a real
developer and things like that and that
happens but yeah don't don't be worried
if you're like you're getting frustrated
you're getting overwhelmed it's the
standard it's the norm you're not an
outlier and even even working as a
developer last two years I still feel
frustrating at times and overwhelmed um
but yeah angular 6 was released that is
true that is true indeed so my
understanding no big changes the only
big update was that Archie is moved to 6
which may have some groundbreaking
changes I haven't had a chance to deep
dive into it quite yet but for what I've
been reading it is a that a smooth
transition they do their best not to
have breaking changes uh how do I find a
mentor well this isn't like you know
before the times when you have
apprenticeships and things like that you
just have to sorta find peace part of
part of a part of this right here you
could consider this a little bit I could
be your mentor for an hour a week yeah
every weekend I'm here and this part of
the reason I do that I don't have a
mentor I don't have someone answering my
questions but we live we live in a great
day an age in which there's 30 channels
just like mine
you know people who are doing live
streams and they're answering questions
and they're they're providing videos
that have topics that are going to be
relevant to to you and you can start
going to meetups and meeting people and
learning from people and and going from
there
so you put yourself out there you start
going and start attending you start
watching videos and you know you sort of
get guided the thing about there there
are no more mentors in the traditional
sense just as an exist so you have to
sort of gather the knowledge from
multiple data points and then
extrapolate what you're trying to learn
that's really good
what are your thoughts on building
custom WordPress themes and learning to
code meanwhile freelancing that's
WordPress to supplement your time and
effort to be self-taught I honestly just
tell people stay away from WordPress in
general some people disagree with this I
think you're just pigeon holing yourself
a little bit your time spent doing other
things
since a freelance is the best option
well I said that you can do it while
doing other things after use a bathroom
real quick guys
you
what I'm thing about self-learning I
think it's the excellent skill have it's
what's made me so successful if you
don't understand a concept if you don't
understand my concept and can make it
work it's okay and move on and come back
to it later yeah I would I would
encourage you to take breaks when you
get stuck on things and move in
different directions but if you really
are struggling with the concept there's
lots of videos there's lots of resources
don't just keep hammering away I try to
understand it in different way if you're
reading documentation that's not working
those videos if videos aren't working
you know ask a friend ask ask a say you
know code tech and caffeine group I have
you know any any coding group so it all
it all really just depends
hey I started my first dev a couple
weeks ago I'm finding it hard to keep
coding and learning after work on
weekdays every day I feel super lazy any
tips beyond just stop being lazy
I mean really mad I mean it really comes
down to what's important to you the
thing is is and this is this is common
man and I really I really tell people to
try and make sure you're not one of
these people because it happens all the
time where you go you get your first job
and you lose the grind man you're you
accomplished the first milestone and
that's why it's important to have
different goals right different
milestones so for me I have a couple
different ones and and I understand what
it takes to get there and honestly if
you're you've probably just reached a
point where your content and it's ill
bite you in the ass one day and then
maybe you won't be lazy that
but I mean really it's just find a way
to keep it fun I guess would be the only
real tip I could give you that's what
has made me successful and continuing to
grind and grow and do everything and so
just I do what I walked so that I can
continue learning while enjoying it
right they could be from every morning I
watch about a 30-minute conference talk
to doing the YouTube channel to you know
building courses for scrim ba' building
my own udemy courses doing some videos
for for the free code camp YouTube
channel I try to keep it fun if I don't
like the content I'm making on my
youtube channel i go and i i i
you
okay I don't know what happened if we
had some technical difficult
difficulties I should be back my back I
don't know what happened that it crashed
there for a second but but yeah you have
to find a way to keep it fun but on at
the end of the day there aren't not any
real tips and tricks
you just have to it comes down to
priorities it really does is what's your
priority is your priority to watch
Netflix and play League of Legends after
work and that's fine I have no issue
with that but when you're like hey how
come I hear these devs are making you
know 50k more than me and I'm stuck at a
job and I trying to get a new job to get
that higher salary to get a job bump but
I haven't been staying up-to-date on
technology I'm not as good as a
developer because I'm just putting in
the same amount hours as the other 90% I
want to be on the top 10% so it's to me
it's it's a combination of re-evaluating
priorities as well as keep finding a way
to keep it fun that's really all I can
say buddy
if you're not in school not working no
responsibilities can you get a job in a
month to go hard enough uh for some
clickbait videos on YouTube they would
tell you yes I'm gonna say probably no
everyone goes at their different pace is
it possible I suppose is it likely no
and you in all honesty you shouldn't
even be thinking about it that way you
need to just be thinking like I'm gonna
give it all my effort and it will happen
eventually and continue on so where's
Dylan hanging these days huh I know that
um plea eights I don't have any
inspiration for dole on videos right now
Dolan will come back and in the future
just not right now I don't know what to
do with don't long
alright guys any of any more questions
it's 30 still yawn
I mean I'm 30 I mean young compared to
who yes a 12 year old they're gonna say
your oldest I I mean I like Windows
I've been using Windows
how to get the on click to display the
array we're gonna need to do some Dom
manipulation so you can do document in
your in your paragraph for your div
wherever you want to display you're
gonna give it an ID so you'd say
something like document dot get element
by ID and then you would set the inner
text unless you're gonna inject HTML in
which point you do hinter HTML but you
set enter text equal to that array value
on click and i on click func that on
click would target a function that would
do that for you I'd be how you did that
yeah so decoding connection so I don't
know coding connections personally but I
I've seen these videos he's probably in
his 40s that's probably the longest
well yeah but again a ten-year-old I'm
I'm ancient Hastert oh so now
that you're no longer WG you what are
your long-term goals so I have some
short-term ones it's get healthier get
better I'm just I'm working towards that
I'm doing that the long-term ones are to
grow the channel I would like to get to
a hundred thousand subscribers the goal
was by the end of this year it doesn't

going to conferences and get some
certifications and things like that on
the side as well as jump into a
different direction towards the end of

exciting so

update like oh hey you know this is what
I this is watching the channel this is
how much I made and this is you know how
many videos I put out blah blah blah
