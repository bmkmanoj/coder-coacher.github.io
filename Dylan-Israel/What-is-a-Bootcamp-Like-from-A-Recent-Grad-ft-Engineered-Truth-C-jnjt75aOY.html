Matt for being on the coding channel of
the year or up for a Streamy we're gonna
win it
we're the only coding channel competing
but no I why don't you introduce
yourself in your channel for everybody
sup guys my name is Matt I run a channel
called engineer truth where I make
realistic career videos I recently
graduated from dev Mountain which is a
coding boot camp and that location I
attended to was in Provo Utah so I just
came back and Dylan's gonna ask him
questions about my experience there yeah
we're guys for basic questions and go
off tangent like I always do a little
bit in the in between the the first
question I kinda want to know is what
was the real one thing that stood out
about dev mountain or area coding boot
camps in general like what did you
absolutely just love about the whole
process one thing I like about the whole
process is the immersiveness it's
actually called immersive boot camp and
the fact that you're live there that
provide housing so you're living with
students and then you're pretty much
just coding about twelve hours everyday
it's like really big part of the
experience it feels like a legitimate
boot camp and also surprised with how
good our lead instructor was he had
about eight years of experience as a
developer and I felt like he was also
good at explaining things he had a very
like loud voice and also very clear so I
would say those are two things that
really stood out when you say immersive
can you kind of just give a rough
estimate of how much time you spent in
class combined with how much time out of
class per week that you you spent
working on your coding bootcamp yeah so
the official time of the boot camp is
eight hours per weekday so you spend
four hours in lecture than four hours I
would say like guided practice with
mentors there if to help you if you need
help and you're assigned particular
projects and then after that those four
hours then you do it's up to you but in
Mike
I did an additional in four hours after
that where I just either worked on stuff
that was gonna be the next day or I just
like fine-tuned the project that was
assigned for that day or I just did my
own projects for the during that time so
that's how I usually divided up
Saturdays and Sundays are optional but
since I was in Provo Utah and AD
literally nothing else to do I usually
also coded or worked on my YouTube
channel on the weekends nice so like
anything that is a three-month immersive
experience I'm sure there was one or two
maybe less than positive points or stuff
that needed improvement fall what would
you say was kind of would be for the
average person maybe a negative aspect
of the bootcamp or something that you
didn't necessarily agree with how was
taught or the how it was kind of
introduced or anything along that lines
yeah for sure we had a guest lecture for
angular and because our main lecture
went on vacation and so our guest
lecture for angular was awful he would
take like about 35 minutes to get ready
and this is like 35 minutes of our class
time not like 35 minutes before our
class starts like he would take 35
minutes to just get the projects open
and it gets started so as a student you
have three hours of lecture three or
four hours of lecture and for the first
like 35 minutes or even up to an hour
the guy was just like getting things off
github like loading the project like
getting the work environment ready and
he did that five days in a row which it
impressed me that he was able to screw
up through third day I was like oh yeah
you got okay like yeah first thing is
like cool you know like maybe he wasn't
expecting this second day you're like
okay well maybe the you know kind of
stretching it but third or fourth and
fifth day I was a I was a legitimately
mad and I think a lot of students were
mad also we had a guy do our job prep
and he had a spray-and-pray model where
he told us to add random developers on
LinkedIn and send them messages super
spray-and-pray model of like hey I'm the
new developer in town I was wondering if
you guys got any jobs or like if you
know how did you get your foot in the
door as a developer and just like
messaging random developers on LinkedIn
I've talked to your number of developers
on my YouTube channel including Quincey
Larson and I think many of them would
disagree with that method of spraying
messages to random developers on
LinkedIn and hoping that something
happens from that yeah good luck with
that man I'm sure one or two people of
guy
I imagine it's like just mass emailing
girls on Facebook saying hey baby you
want the did it's probably how
successful as bad the same rate is about
the same rate it's probably it's a it's
definitely a similar strategy and we can
both see in white in both situations
that doesn't work okay so this may be
kind of related to the second question
but if you were to change something and
it was up to you to kind of improve upon
the boot camp or boot camps in general
what would be the one thing you would
change not necessarily about your boot
camp but it could be that but in general
as well
I mean besides us switching out those
two people like the angular lecture and
also they could job prep guys like that
would be like the biggest fixes
definitely switching those guys out
particularly the job prep guy started
his job prep saying oh yeah I've never
worked as a developer but I'm gonna help
you guys because we develop your job
lolol obviously not good a first
impression um I would say also like in a
ways to improve is that
they had like our products that were
assigned to us that were kind of to help
us reinforce the point like they would
teach angular and then after the angular
lecture they would have an angular
project sometimes the projects were
pretty out of sync of what was taught in
class or haven't been updated in a long
time those could have definitely been
improved but besides that like I mean I
was really happy with the structure
because it was three months and we did
three projects I thought that was like
perfect amount of perfect amount of
projects to do and I think it was a
really good balance between like lecture
and product time yeah and I saw some of
your projects I I mean I was pretty
thoroughly impressed they seemed very
well done and professional so I could
definitely a month per project scene is
about right to test out new skills yet
I thought it was good cuz I could be
doing more projects you're just like
spending a lot of time to work on
projects you're not learning in love
like lecture so I thought it was a
really good balance nice a final
question
would you recommend dev mountain or
coding boot camps to the average person
and who wouldn't you recommend it to so
I think if you're a person that has been
coding for a couple months on your own
now and you're like oh I could see
myself doing this as a job that's the
kind of person that should go to a
coding boot camp if you're like ah I
don't know like I just thought like on a
whim I saw this like banner on like
Facebook it says like I could go I could
become earning 100k in like three months
from now that's like not the person to
sign up because you don't have any you
don't even know if you like it and like
you have to be able to teach yourself at
least for a couple months on your own to
really evaluate if this is something
that you like or that's something that
you would want to do or even you have
any talent in because if you go and Rob
no background at all you're honestly
gonna walk out like with a little bit
more skill but you're gonna get way more
out of it if you practice like a lot a
lot beforehand like I don't know you
look you and I practice quite a bit
before we did these kind of things so
yeah yeah man practice is good going
unprepared into something that you're
gonna spend 60 hours a week doing it's
not good advice well I would say like
you know it's a me coming in way I pad
practice about it three months before I
went to Deb Mountain okay so I practiced
three months the whole the whole boot
camps about three months long like
there's no time for you to get to catch
up to me because like how how are you
gonna ever catch up if I'm there for 12
hours a day and you're also there for 12
hours a day what time do you have to
catch up to me you're never gonna catch
up to my level but most importantly like
if you learn the basics beforehand then
you could focus on learning the more
advanced concepts but if you're there
and you're barely learning like oh
what's a function what do you mean by
return like what happens if you don't
return what do you mean like this
function has its own scope like things
that you can learn on your own
beforehand that do take a while to learn
if you know those things already coming
in then you just focus on what you don't
know nice I think it's kind of important
to mention that you did three months of
prep from
basically free resources of code data me
and free code camp so anyone can do it
if they're determined oh yeah but
there's definitely like a like a jump
between like free code camp and code
Academy and then getting a developer job
and I think that's where coding boot
camps exist is like yeah okay you did
code school and code Academy or and like
free code camp but you still don't know
how you just don't really know how to
make anything to be honest and then a
lot of these free resources don't
definitely don't comfort cover enough
back end like sequel Mongo or node right
so then you still have those um and like
that's I think that's where the boot
camp came in is that it taught me like a
lot of back-end stuff that's pretty hard
to learn on your own at this current
point nice well I appreciate you sharing
some knowledge and our voice I Lopez
would say yeah you like to go ahead and
promote your book or anything miss uh
yeah I mean my book new grad job packs
is on Amazon right now has five star
rated I'll be sure to check it out new
grad job axe or if not you guys coulda
just check out my youtube channel
engineer truth to learn more about
realistic crews yeah just got that
silver play button and I on the way man
that means he's legit like this way yeah
I'm hoping they send me like a wood tier
one at 10,000 they just invent that it's
like it's like just like it looks like
made out of shitty ass would like it's
not even wood it's like plastic covered
rotted and shit they said it's you all
damages should they don't even send a
package all your name it's like coding
tutorials 180 thanks for watching the
video special thanks to our sponsor dev
Mountain definitely check them out at
dev mountain comm if you're looking for
a boot camp that's in front-end
development iOS or UX go ahead and give
them a shot tuition includes housing so
you can get up and go and fully immerse
yourself in the program as always thanks
for watching I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
