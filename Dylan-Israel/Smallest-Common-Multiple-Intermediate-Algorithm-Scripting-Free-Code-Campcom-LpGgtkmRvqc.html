and free code camp intermediate
algorithm scripting we're working on
smallest common multiple so this one at
first glance is very intense but you
really have to think it through
I did some I've been doing some pair
programming on these intermediate once I
highly suggest it if you see over here I
have a whiteboard I do all the lessons
before you've write a line of code I go
over there and I I do I've write it out
so that I can visualize it I definitely
recommend doing that if you have access
to that if not pick one up at Costco or
Target for about 15 bucks I got that one
for 15 bucks at Costco and and as I was
doing this I basically was able to solve
it without writing a single line of code
and when I was done my my buddy typed it
up and we got it so it's definitely a
harder one though we're getting towards
the end of these intermediate algorithm
scripting so let me explain what's going
on here so what we're trying to do is
find the lowest common multiple between
for our range of numbers you have a low
number you have a high number so if you
get the number one in five we need to
find the lowest common multiple for one
two three four and five which turns out
to be 60 so the first thing I wanted to
do was I wanted to sort the array the
reason for that is if five came if the
array came with a 5 before 1 I the way I
wanted to add to the array is I needed
to iterate through it the length of it
so I'm going to sort the array so that
one comes before five every time then
I'm gonna create an empty array as I
like to do I've had a couple of people
on comments ask me why I create a
placeholder right and the reason is to
so that the original input is never
distorted if I need to use it for any
other reason then I'm going to run a for
loop that's going to get all the values
between 1 and 5 because we may not all
we starting at one maybe we're going
from five to ten and so I'm gonna start
there so um let's go ahead and do that
part and then I'll explain my while loop
and how I did that so because that's
kind of the first part of it so I'm just
create a simple variable here let me
lower this a little bit a simple
variable called range and we're going to
say range is equal to our inputted array
dot sort and because we want to check
our code let's just go ahead and return
range and we're gonna change this to 5
and a 1 so we know that it's working
so you can see it sorts it in the
correct order so that's our first part
the next part is we need to take an
array create an empty array and from
there here in like some music going off
from there we're going to sit here oh my
god
no I sorry
I think it's some neighbors sorry about
that let's get back to the video guys so
what we're gonna be doing next is we're
going to actually be doing hopefully
that cut that out maybe I'll just leave
it in for funds we're gonna create an a
a for loop so this isn't going to be our
typical for loop because remember we may
not be starting at one so what we're
actually gonna do is save our I is equal
to our first element in the array so
that's where we're gonna start and then
we're gonna say while I is y is less
than or equal to the the length of the
array or excuse me
yeah the length of the array are done
with the our length minus one alright
dot plus plus that's right so the length
of the array minus one so and the reason
we're it's not the length of the array
we're taking the array and we're getting
the last value in the array so it might
be a little anti intuitive as you could
see I was just trying to spit it out
properly kind of messed it up so next
what we're going to do is we're just
going to push the value of I that's it
and that will allow us to iterate
through so again let's go ahead and test
our code here we'll just go ahead and
run through this and you can see we get
one two three four five okay cool so
what the next step is we then need to
see if we're just going to use modulo
basically and we're going to use a while
loop we're going to use a true or false
statement and we're going to create a
variable to store the lowest common
multiplier so let's go ahead and create
a our simple true or false variable so
we're gonna set this equal to true
because once it's false we found the LCM
and then we're gonna create a VAR LCM
and we're gonna set it initially to zero
and then we're going to create a while
loop and what's going in this wall
we're gonna say while true keep running
this and then we're gonna have a we're
going to iterate each each time we go
into wha loop we want to increase the
LCM by one the reason for that is we
need to take the LCM and then divide it
by each or modulo it by each each each
item in the array in a and if if it
equals if it does if it does not equal
zero we need to break that means there's
a remainder or it's not basically it's
not the lowest common multiples what it
means else if it is we can set X equal
to false and we're good to go
so let's just go ahead and create our
simple for loop here again like our like
our first for loop we're actually going
to be setting it equal to the starting
value and not one or zero because we may
not be starting at one or zero so and
we'll say wow i's lesson again it's the
same as the other for loop so if you're
able to figure it if you understood the
other part and this should be someone
easy so length minus 1 I plus plus
okay so we're iterating through our
array now if our LCM modulo our current
value excuse me J so if our LCM modulo J
is not equal equal to zero we want to
break excuse me we break else if our
else if our J is exactly equal to the
array so this Elsa statement let me
explain this before we go into it so our
else--if means if we actually get to
this else if statement it didn't have to
break our for loop
meaning that what's essentially what we
want is for this not to equal zero
because that means that it's a common
multiple so we just continue on so if
it's not in our or if it is rather we
break we break it it's not the common
multiple but if it is we just kind of
ignore it until we get to that final
value that final where J is let me fix
that too well or J actually has reached
the last value in our in our array
meaning that it's passed all the tests
and then we can set it to false and
return our LCM so that's what's going on
here so we're saying look if J is ever
equal to the same value as the last
value
X is equal to false break the for-loop
and then return the LCM if it and so
when we break this it breaks the for
loop it iterates through here it adds
one to the LCM so it's not actually
running through the whole thing so it's
just going to keep it breaking the for
loop until we actually meet this victory
condition if you want to call it that so
we'll sue this and all we have to do
here is change this to return the LCM
and I think assuming I didn't make a
syntax error it looks like I did so
let's go ahead and look over code line
10 so VAR x is equal to true LCM sorry
I'm checking my code here
search
no I kindly disabled a little protection
I did that the other day and it took me
20 minutes to get this thing back up and
running I really don't like this new
update
sorry Quincy so J is less than R erase
length minus 1 I plus plus 4x equals
true all right sorry about that guys
pause the video 5 minus 6 so right here
you'll see that I put R instead of array
so that was where our air was so let's
go ahead and run that real quick and see
that it all works very very nice so
let's as always let's put our comments
in here because you know this is only
about twenty two lines of code once I
cleaned it up a little bit on the break
here but it's definitely one of those
things where if I go back and look at it
I would like to have the comments there
it's good practice to get into so sorts
array so the VAR does it so the range
here so it's alright
actually you know what I don't even
actually use this do I now I look at it
I should though it that's interesting so
it's the right I'm looking at I'm like I
never used a range anywhere so I say
right anyhow we'll just continue on
great empty array
all right and then here we'll do it
we'll do one for here as well starts for
loop at lowest value and continues till
we iterate to the highest value well you
at this point you should know what a
rate up pushes as to end of the array
here we create a variable for our while
loop while loop victory variable that's
what I call it I don't know what's a
good good name LCM lowest common
multiple will type it out Louis calm and
multiple placeholder while loop
increment each iteration of while loop
before LCM yeah alright again here well
we don't need you this again the same
exact thing alright so here this is a
where some good logic is so if our
lowest common multiple does not return
zero it means there's not there's a
better common multiple essentially ends
for loop if LCM is not correct for all
values of the array and then here when
you reach the end of the array it has
passed the LCM test
break the wall ooh so hope you guys
found this helpful
a lot of code it's a lot of maths it's
not necessarily a lot of code that's
probably the best way to put it out
as always guys don't forget to Like
subscribe share it if you got a friend
that's doing this and oh I also have a
patreon account so if you want to help
out there that's great but as always
I'll see you guys in the next video
