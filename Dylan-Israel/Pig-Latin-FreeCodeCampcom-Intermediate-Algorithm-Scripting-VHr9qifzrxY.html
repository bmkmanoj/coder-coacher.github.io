like probably a week and a half two
weeks since I've even touched free code
campus a long time for me I work on this
stuff almost every day but we are doing
Pig Latin bonfire and this was a this is
one of those standard ones where if
you've programmed in any other languages
for class or for in general you usually
end up getting the pig latin ones so
there's a I did this in Java and Python
I believe time before so there's a
couple different ways you can solve this
let me show you what I did mine so we're
basically going to replace any words to
start with a a Val we're gonna add lay
onto it and that's it and that's
probably the easiest thing to do if it
doesn't we're going to go until we hit a
Val and then we're gonna add a a why
it's that way so the first thing you're
gonna do is you're gonna break up your
word into an array of characters so for
me I create I called it letters and I
just said take our original string STR
rather original STR and in this case we
want to dot split it on every space so
break it up into letters and if we were
returned we were to return letters right
now you'd be able to see that it broke
up our string cool that back so the next
thing we're gonna use is regex to
compare if there's any AEIOU and i if
you're like me I don't know regular
expressions like this very well so
typically it just takes a google search
and for me to find out if there's a the
regex for the AEIOU is simply put it in
like this and i wish i could go into
more detail why that is but this works
for me and I just
quick search and them you probably
should know how to do it but this takes
you're taking these values so that we
can do an if statement that's going to
check if the first letter matches any of
those so does it match an AEIOU so we're
gonna say our Val Rage X dot test and
we're gonna test to see if our letters
are ranked at the starting point matches
if it does we're going to return our new
word letters or excuse me our newer
write letters and we're going to join it
with the string way that's it and so
that should actually tell regex it's not
defined
Oh make sure you spell everything
correctly cool so you can see we're
we're gonna in some write right here
so these starts with an A so if we were
to test it on let's just do eight
because it's a little easier you see
right there eight ways so cool so we
have those out but now we have to
address the ones that don't start with a
with a about so the way I did this was I
and this was not the first way I did
this I originally tried iterating
through with a for loop and I ended up
getting an infinite air because I kept
on put popping and pushing on to an
array so there's a like so there's tons
worse than this ways to do this so we're
gonna do the same thing we did right now
but since we don't want the test we want
it when it fails we wanted to do
something when it fails we're gonna have
to put that exclamation point and then
we're gonna test
letters zero so letters again is our
array of letters and then what do we
want to do we want to we want to push on
it so remember when you push it's going
to add it to the end of the array and
what is it that we want to push on it we
want to push it by one but we're gonna
splice it from that spot because
remember we're going to splice at the
zero point and then we're gonna push it
on the end and the reason for that is we
can't just we need to remove the letter
and put on the end not just add on to
the end so letters dot splice a lot of
these functions at this point we should
have probably you know something when
something like this comes you're kind of
like oh cool like this I think I might
be able to do it with this and you might
be remembering some stuff but else so
what we want so if this test that fails
is true it hits an AI or you what do we
want do we just want break the wildly
and then finally in my case the way I
did it we are take our original strength
that we started with and we just want to
change it and you could do it this is
probably it's probably a quicker way to
do this rather than going through and I
mean a why under there because we move
the string this is only for this this
part because we return it here so that's
why we're returning a why here we could
also doing in the else loop and AD and
just say yeah you know and add it here
but there we go is that simple so let's
uh let's go through our code real quick
and put the comments in because you know
I did this this took me probably about
close to 40 minutes working on it so you
know describing it in five minutes may
not be as helpful so let's put some
comments so this is just gonna break
original
string into an array of characters regex
for Strings contain AEIOU chess the
first character of the array on matching
as way to the end of to end of the
string and let's see for cases not
matching vows if regex doesn't contain a
vow first first
push first letter will put this here as
well even others it looks like no code
why are we doing else on a break it's
it's at least helpful to be able to look
back and understand it so brakes on
finding of how because that's the only
reason to do they're here
that's a why and join to the end the end
and joins string mr. Hart mr. string
back together cool so that was bonfire

section as always thanks for watching
guys and keep on keepin on
don't forget to keep on spending time
coding sometimes these easy to get
yourself down as always comments
questions concerns are appreciated see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
