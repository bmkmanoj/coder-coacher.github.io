credit table was a little bit buggy so
we're just gonna kind of knock out the
lessons and it won't really matter
because we'll be they'll be ordered in
the playlist so if you want to watch a
credit table we'll do that
so we're in queries queries queries are
how you kind of get data from the
database that you're looking for rather
specific yes we have select name comma I
am DB front aspirating from movies press
around so there goes our movie ratings
oops next let's continue with the Select
statement in the code editor type select
distinct genre from movies movie
this gives us all the genres that are
unique the distinct probably makes a
does unique select distinct yep cool a
lot of this stuff makes they're kind of
fine follow good convention so you can
kind of take an idea where this is going
so select all from movies where the I am
DB rating is greater than eight BAM so
those are all the movies that are
greater than eight in that database like
is a special operator that can be used
in a where clause and the code editor
all right so we're gonna select from
movies where the name is like SC or en
semicolon to end our query so we have
seven and seven
let's use the like query for a few other
patterns in the text editor so this case
we're gonna select all from movies where
the where the name parameter is like a
and a Prince's Perth percentage sign I
don't know what the ampersand no I don't
know what the name will tell my head
like this so what that spacing say is
where it starts with an A and goes down
it looks like and then we're gonna do
another query we're gonna select all
from movies where let's see if we don't
need to capitalize this where a name
like man so at some point it starts hits
man and then the man hands and it goes
on that's what I think that does remove
the first query so you can see right
here these will have man in it so before
we do that though we need to remove the
first quarry
cool so that one query wanders all
everything's gotten man in it so between
is another special operator that can be
used in a where clause and the texts
that are tight all right so select all
from movies where name between a and J
so see what that does so Gordon returned
any results
such tall movies I don't forget
semicolon there you go so it looks like
it goes all the way to a to J H I thanks
no J it looks like alright remove the
previous query let's just select movies
where the year between 1990 and 2000 you
see we don't have to put those in quotes
because this is an integer very nice so
instead of removing every mote returning
every moved between 1990 and 2000 let's
just search for movies that are comedies
okay so this is kind of like if and else
statements and how we use operators to
get what we want so we want to select
from movies so like let's say it's our
movie array for typing out code where
our where statement is kind of our if so
if the year parameter is between 1990
and between 2000 and
the genre is equal to comedy return it
so it's just like code it's a little bit
different and there we go not bad at all
so similar to Antenor we use we're close
so we want to owe and then that just
like encoding or so select from movies
where genre is equal to comedy or the
year is less than 1980 semicolon in that
BAM there we go so we get all the films
that are comedies and or were made
before 1980 so oh now now we're getting
into how we want to see our data it's to
select all from movies database or table
rather and then order it by I am BD
underscore reading and descending so
from worse
would we just select all from movies
order by select I don't know why this
would be an issue now from movies well
that's my first instinct is to I'm there
I'll here's D be ready yeah there we go
so you see the IMDB radians 9.0 8.9 etc
not too bad
so let's write a query the only return
is three lowest four right over so in
order to what how we would do that we
would select from the movies where old
limit three order by IMDB and whispering
and we want ascending so start at the
bottom and limit three so we don't
apparently limit means we will only get
three and then Alvin and the Chipmunks
anaconda is a 4.6 that they're talking
about it's a 10 point movie man JLo was
in it oh yes let's let's how you
apparently limit your results so limited
clauses specifies the maximum number of
rows cool and it looks like we finished
our next lesson queries so what can you
take away from this and I encourage
everyone to do this I will be doing the
same make yourself a cheat sheet not
flashcards flashcards are kind of weird
but for me I it's not that I don't
understand concepts a lot of times I
just forget the words and that are
needed so I will be providing these on
my website at a later date and I can you
can use mine or use your own but things
such a select where like between and or
order by limit those are all things that
need to be on there maybe with an
example or two and they'll help you out
in future sequel uses so you know
comments questions concerns WordPress
quick ideas I really appreciate the
comments and don't forget to like the
videos that's always really good too
that really helps I hear from forums and
stuff to like the videos other people
see it if you liked it and if you don't
like it I understand but I'm always
trying to improve I will see you guys
next video and thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
