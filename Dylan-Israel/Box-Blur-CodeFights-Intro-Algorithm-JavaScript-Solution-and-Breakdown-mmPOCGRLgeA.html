in box blair on code fights of the intro
section island up knowledge so this is
this is one of those ones where they
kind of you in the description
because give you one example for this
doesn't really do it justice
so let's explain what the problem is
before we get started i struggled on
this one for quite a while and i had to
get a little bit of help to solve it i
bought a hint the hint didn't do
anything for me just wasting my gold i
would ask for a refund if they let me
now
what's happening here is you have a 3x3
square or you're evaluating every 3x3
square in the in the array now and then
just returning the average so and
rounding down right so all those numbers
add up you divide by 9 you get 15 over 9
plus you return an array of 1 a nested
array of 1 now work is so confusing is
when it isn't anus when it's like a 3 by
4 right in this example and so with what
you're actually getting here is 3 and
then you're moving over and then you're
getting so you're getting each one of
those values in the same row so in this
case we're doing the first 3 36 there
are 18 24 7 54 9 81 63 72 and you get
you'll get an average of 40 and then
you're moving over again 0 18 954 9 0 63
70 45 so you're going to the first step
is we're going to go left to right and
getting three cubes then if there's a
row below it it's like a fourth row we
got a drop down and do that as well so
it's a lot of looping and a lot of a lot
of confusion and a very bad description
and they should be ashamed of themselves
and this is their description so let's
go ahead and get started
here we're just going to create a this
is going to be the array that is going
to store our response and we'll just
call this image array or SS is equal to
an empty array so at the end of each
iteration we're going to push our value
to that all right now because there are
nested lines we need to as you can see
here before we start iterating we have
to create a new line what I call the
line array we're going to push an empty
array to we're going to create that
empty array to push values into it and
then when we hit the end of that row
we're going to push the line into
imagery now the first thing we have to
do is we have to iterate through the
array now here we'll call this VAR y is
equal to 0 to kind of give you an idea
of x and y so it gets really cut
convoluted really quick so I start
writing this x and y for our coordinates
right so while Y is less than the image
length minus 2 all right
so Y minus 2 because we're iterating
three spots at a time so then man you
guys get the idea 1 plus plus so let's
go ahead and increase now this is where
within here we create that line item by
the way I should be using let you want
to be using let and as of pretty much
now M comps when you need it there's no
constant here but start using legs set
of ours
now the next thing we have to do is kind
of the same thing except with one just
same thing except with our x-coordinate
and our x-coordinate is going to be
iterating through all values of y -2
because we're now ready to them to 3x3
grid we have our or let X equal 0 then
while X is less than our image Y dot
length minus 2 X plus plus all right so
there we go with that first one
all right here now what we want to do is
we want to create a variable player keep
on to the wire you want to create a some
variable because remember we have to get
the average down the road and push that
we want to cure it a count variable the
cats just going to be used to divide by
the amount of numbers that we have which
now I'm thinking about it we probably
could have just used 9 what we'll test
that out in a second
once we get it working so now we have 2
now that we have our array essentially
we need to actually iterate through the
9 values so it's going to be 4 then
let's breathe a is equal to Y so this is
how we're going to initialize where in
those 3 by 3 cubes we are and while a is
less than Y plus 3 so you want to get
the check for three values a plus plus
and then here we have four we're
essentially going to do the same thing
where let B be equal to X and while B is
less than X plus 3 B plus plus
and here we are now that we finally are
here we need to take our some plus equal
our original image and in there it's
going to be the a value and the B value
and then we're just going to add to
count and drop down drop down and out
remember our line now that here after
after each one of those four loops we're
just going to go ahead and push map
top-floor remember we drop it off that
value which is the sum divided by the
count and then right above it right here
still in the Y for loop we are finally
going to actually push the line to our
image array so take a maggiore dot put
your line and then finally at the end
return image array now let's say that
hopefully I have no syntax or six it
looks like everything is working now
let's test something real quick because
I think I can improve my code I cool so
it looks like we can do that like I
imagined we'll take out our let simplify
the code as much as we can you know we
have four nested for loop so this is
going to get a little bit convoluted no
matter what you try and do but again the
first step right here for these two
these two lines for these two for loops
we are trying to capture the three by
three grid next we're creating a
variable to store the data and then a
line variable for that for it for that
that 3x3 in here we're actually
iterating through the 3x3 we're pushing
the sum and then we're capturing the
next 30 by 30 and then finally we're
pushing once we break out once we get to
the end of the write the horizontal line
we're pushing that entire line over then
we're dropping down a line and we're
repeating the process
finally return you a lot of this one
having me stuck for a while I think a
lot of help but this was eventually how
I was able to solve it I hope you guys
found it helpful as always thank you so
