jQuery effects jquery effects so we'll
probably just be doing a little bit more
like with what we were doing with the
event handling and stuff like that so
write the necessary jquery code to hide
your div as soon as HTML document is
loaded so we have to first get our
document ready and in here oops already
and then we want to function to do some
stuff and so what we want to do is
immediately hide any divs so we have to
say find this element div and do this
something or another to it do hide it
and I believe you have to give us hide
slow so you can see right there seems to
be working do you call high and I know
jquery object Oh semicolon alright maybe
doesn't want to slow maybe just once hi
there you go let's begin by getting beat
up by targeting our image inside here so
our image is just IMG so OMG let's
animate our image go down by 100 pixels
so minus 100 TX and let's make it happen
in one second or 1000 milliseconds
on the speed see one so we're doing
millisecond so that's 1000 so now when
we save and submit you should drop this
down your top counter should be
increasing not decreasing so I mistake
over one second should have decrease
there it looks like you're going
elevator day and move down 100 pixels in
one second did you add 100px to the top
yes check the hand if you need help I
don't think we need help it just didn't
work it's so animate the top
actually this needs to be changed as
well I believe that goes there and then
you can see right there drop-down now so
they add the code in the editor a little
bit wrong so that we could fix it we're
back with our Krypton example so this is
in our script jsk your document ready
alright so document already and hoops
then we want to function do some stuff
and pass it on a dot click event handler
is on your div so we want to say for the
div or divs dot click what do we want to
do we want another function and in here
we want it to do some stuff as well and
for that we want our div to give it the
input the effect effect and then there
is something called explode is that a
stylesheet know it it might just be
something built in to jQuery so now only
click on it boom it's a pretty cool boom
I so that exploded so change your
explode to a bounce and make it so that
Krypton bounces three times in five
milliseconds so there's something else
called bounce comma and then we need to
give it some parameters and we want it
to bounce three times and it also needs
to happen in 500 milliseconds or
semicolon submit so now 23 so you see it
bounces three times and continues to
bounce nice so go ahead and change your
bounce to slide
so it looks like we're going to be
messing with this a little bit so we're
going to change it to slide and remove
the two other inputs so when we click it
it's going to slide back in to frame
it's kinda cool check out the code then
click save and submit so we have a pound
menu accordion collapsible true active
false oh nice so this is you know some
basic JavaScript stuff here going on
call the draggable function on the pound
car so as always get our document ready
already function and then we want to say
for our pound car don't forget the
parentheses we want to dot draggable
let's see if this just works right away
so are ya so I was thinking that maybe
we might have to create something that
says on click but click being held down
so nice we can move this around a little
bit that's pretty cool call the
resizable function on your div so let's
get everything ready
and so we want to select the div arm any
diff and we want to call dot resize
resizable
let's see when we select it resize me
so now we can resize it left or right
can we do up and down not so much ah
cool all right in script Jas get your
document dot ready alright so we have
sufficiently mastered the document dot
ready I would say this is one thing we
can take away its document dot
ready all right loser document already
called the selectable function on the
oal all right so now we want to target
our ordered list and we want to say dot
selectable let's see what happens so now
now we can slick and we hold down ctrl
down control you can do it as what
select all of them nice
so in script Jas tab replace your dot
selectable with dot sortable all right
this will probably let us do exactly
what you think and now we can order them
one by one nice if got you started in
index HTML tab button menus no good with
only one section at two more like the
first alright then go inside menu div
but after this section Devon alright so
and we'll call this section 2 i'm the
second second second section and we'll
call this section 3 i'm the third
section so just a little bit HTML there
you know this part by heart get your
docket see they they know they this must
be the thing that people are just like
look man you have to have document dot
ready or all your jquery will not
work so just it's a three hour course
allegedly let's just pound this into
their brain if they if they know one
thing it should bite be by heart the
document dot ready all right so go ahead
and call dot accordion on your menu so
we're looking for our menu and we want
to call dot accordion with no parameters
and see our menu acc lr tion not am and
now you can see our little section has
turned into an accordion doesn't look
like it will let us not have one open
though click save some incomplete you
finish your first Jake warrior prince
imager your journeys only begin share
any clothes websites you make with us
via Twitter and we'll retweet your
favorite so maybe I will do that so
let's just go ahead and save and submit
and we have a finish officially finished
our jquery
course but do not fret young ones there
is the make an interactive website I
haven't tested this so we're going to be
using javascript and jquery in here
eventually to kind of get started this
is probably going to be a little more
difficult because they don't hold your
hand as much but that was our jquery
section nice little introduction i
really liked it it made maybe web
development a little more enticing than
it already was but as always questions
