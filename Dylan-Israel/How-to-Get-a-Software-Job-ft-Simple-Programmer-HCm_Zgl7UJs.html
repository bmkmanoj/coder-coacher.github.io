going to be interviewing john sonmez
from simpleprogrammer.com how to get it
for free also his channel what he's
trying to do with it is gold now we're
also going to be going into how to get
your first web developer gig or software
gig after getting sort of education and
without it and all the ways that he kind
of suggests going instead of going
through the front door going through the
back door kind of like what I do with my
channel a little bit so I definitely
enjoy this video and don't forget to
like it share it so we can do more in
the future
thanks for watching and enjoy code
everything alright
so would you would you mind I think if I
were to kind of give an introduction to
you and your channel and everything I
might just go ahead and butcher it so
would you mind kind of introducing
yourself and your channel and everything
sure yeah so so I'm John Sean mess I run
a channel called simple programmer and
and I've been trying to figure out like
people always ask me what do I do and I
was that as that sumo con this weekend I
finally came up with their lives begin
and I say that I help software
developers to be cool to learn how to be
cool and it's so really what my focus is
on personal development like self
development for software developers and
so kind of if you think about it like
most developers focus on the technical
aspect of their lives right and they're
really good at that but all of the other
areas tend to get missed a lot right and
so I kind of focused now I used to do a
lot of technical stuff I was a software
developer for 15 years but now I focus
on all those other areas of your life
from everything from fitness to
relationships to finance to just
motivation and mindset and achieving
your goals so kind of you know I'd the
way that I kind of joke is I say that
I'm kind of like a 1/3 Tony Robbins 1/3
Tim Ferriss and 1/3 Bill Gates like
that's my makeup my mic's my makeup I do
personal development I do do self
experimentation and and of course I'm a
programmer so nice that's really kind of
important
as someone who is just recently looking
through job apps till I found one I
couldn't believe how much was required
in terms of communication that was
something they put a lot more attention
to detail it's like like you have to be
able to function with people if you
don't have those skills you can't really
join the part of the team and they're
there at least two people I were looking
I was applying to or more interested in
like having someone that can work with
and then teaching the skills to then
having the skills and be hard to work
with so yeah yeah actually one of my
subscribers told me that you you before
you had a YouTube channel you were kind
of a blogger is that true yeah I still
blog actually I still I still do one
blog post a week I'm actually writing a
book right now so what I'm doing is I'm
giving the book away free on the blog
and so basically a chapter comes out
every single week and then you know I'm
writing ahead of time and I'll finish
the book before all the chapters get
released so people can go to the blog
and they can sign up and get you know
get a chapter every week delivered to
them and then when I release the full
book then I'll have probably the option
to purchase it to say okay you know I
want to just get the whole thing now and
have some other options there's probably
some video stuff like that and that
that's available on on your website yeah
yeah simpleprogrammer.com if you go
there you can there's I think there's a
pop-up there actually you know it's
simpleprogrammer.com forward slash
career guide is the easiest way you can
just sign up with your email and you get
you'll automatically start getting from
chapter 1 and start getting all the
chapters nice and this is your second
book because I think I've seen that you
you've already written a book yeah yeah
this is my second one so I wrote a book
called soft skills the software
developers life manual and that ended up
doing really well I was surprised I
could end up being a best-seller it's
still selling really really well
especially the audible version
surprisingly that was something that
that I didn't expect but that's actually
house outselling the print and that book
is basically about about the kind of
other things that I cover from career
development to Fitness finance all of
that learning quickly marketing yourself
building a brand all the kind of core
you know the way I describe the book is
like
if I could go back in time you know 20
years and hand myself one book what
would I put in it and that's what I
created when I when I wrote that book
and then and then the new book that I'm
working on is is tentatively titled the
the completes often developers career
guide and so the idea there is like okay
now let's just focus on the career
aspect and let's just say okay if you
like what is all the stuff you need to
know as a software developer all the
non-technical to soft skills like from
how to get started how to learn how to
program all the way up to you know
getting your first job how to do
interviews how to negotiate your salary
how to compare contract versus salary
you know rates because they you can't
just take them out it's not a simple
multiplication and then how to like you
know get the skills you need how to work
in your in cope with co-workers in your
environment and then finally how do I
like accelerate your career to the next
level give talks presentations start
blogging all that stuff so it's kind of
like the whole I'm trying to cover the
whole game but if like everything you
might need to know and so that's what
that's what I've been working on and
that's where all those blog posts are
coming out nice I actually wish I read
that before you except in this job I
think I could have probably got more
money and then in the long term if I did
is it's amazing I like you know just a
simple like I feel like a lot of times
when you take a lot of these sort of
books that are advice or self-help or
anything kind of better yourself even if
you only get like two three pieces of
something that affect your life they
affect it so drastically that it really
is like covers it's just totally worth
it in my opinion so that's been my
experience when I've read like um rich
dad poor dad was a great example that
kind of helped me get control of my
finances to a degree and kind of get
serious about life and I look forward to
any any idea when it's gonna be be out
in print version I'm thinking probably
q1 of 2017 cuz I'm about like it's a big
book right it might be a two-volume set
I think I'm about a hundred and ten
thousand words into it huh and it's
gonna be somewhere around 150 to 200
thousand words so I'm I'm finishing it
up and then I'll be going through the
editing process and I want to put either
a nice package and
have a kind of nice cover and just kind
of make it it like a set that'll
something that you could put on your
desk and kind of be proud of it so
that's that's kind of what I'm going for
for this one so nice
are you self-publishing are you go
working with a publisher for this I'm
just curious
yeah so I'm going to self publish this
one there's you know there's definitely
some pros and cons my first book soft
skills was not self-published this
publisher Manning and meanings grater
you don't have any complaints about
Manning but I believe now with my
audience you know I've got maybe like
thirty eight thousand subscribers on my
my email list and that's you know so I
can sell it quite a few books I've
enough reach I think to be able to self
publish and then with the success of the
first book that always helps because now
I've got my fingers in the Amazon so if
I published a second book even self
publish like it's gonna come up when you
see the first book and so I feel like I
could I could do well there and then you
know there's I always leaves the option
the way I thought about it too is I
thought okay I self-published this thing
and then if a publisher comes up to me
and they say hey we'd like to we'd like
to publish it that doesn't you can
self-published first and then you can
pick up a publisher if you want and get
even wider distribution so I might as
well like sell to my audience first and
get you know not give away ninety
percent of the profits yeah correct and
then later if I need more distribution
and I and I can't then then and then
also you can go to a publisher you can
say hey look I've already sold 10,000
copies of this book so you're gonna have
to give me a better deal whereas you
know with my first book I was at a great
disadvantage because they're like well
we don't know if the books yourself like
you know I didn't have any negotiating
power so I feel like self-publishing
first is and I could be wrong you know
I'm tested I always find things out and
yeah I just take my best shot and then
if I fail I fail and I learned so I'm
glad you're doing that because I have
one or two friends who have kind of got
picked up with book deals with
publishers and it has just been not a
pleasant experience at all so I think I
think they could have just been the
publisher they're working with but in
terms of numbers
as long as you can kind of put the
upfront cost to buying you know
inventory and things like that and you
have a market yeah
self-publishing is probably where you go
IIIi don't know though I'm just talking
about my ass at the end of the day just
from what I've heard well you got
options now I mean today we live in a
time that is just awesome for
entrepreneurs right because you've got
so you've got companies like create
space right where you can publish books
on them it you can put your self Bush
book on Amazon and through create a
space it'll print on demand and ship to
your customer so you don't even have to
hold inventory you don't have to run do
print runs so there's there's a lot of
really cool stuff that you can do I
think that that we that you couldn't do
even five years ago yeah jump over to a
little more software related you say
you've been a developer for 15 years and
so I'm not sure when you started at what
age you started learning in code but any
sort of like anything you've noticed
from when you originally started
learning how to code compared to like
let's say someone wanted to start today
like how is that changed like what is
the dynamic do you think of like 15 20
years ago when you started to now like
what would what would be some of the
resources available then yeah maybe
aren't and vice versa you know that's a
great question no one ever asks that
question but that is a really important
question and in it because it is it's
changed so much right so when I first
started when I was teaching myself
there was really no internet I mean I I
started when I was like well I guess it
depends like I got my first professional
job at like 19 but I started learning
kind of 1314 you know kind of teaching
myself and there was some books on C but
there was that you can google you
couldn't find tutorials you can find
video courses any of that stuff right
you kind of had to figure it out like I
spent a lot of time downloading source
code and modifying it and that's how I
learned see is that muds actually the
multi-user dungeon I download the source
code and trying to make my own and
modifying it and so I mean there are
some books and some material but it was
hard to find so finding actual material
was was much more difficult and and then
the other thing that I think that that
really really back then was it was all
of
out like mastering the language so I
remember learning C++ and becoming an
expert in C++ and it was the the
expertise was you knew all the nuances
of the language and the standard
libraries that went went with it so now
if you contrast that today to to today
right there's so much more information
and there's so much more you need to
know if you want to be a web developer
today you got to know JavaScript you
gotta know HTML CSS you're gonna know
some kind of JavaScript frame you a
framework whether it be angular or you
know whatever you you want there Ember
you know all kind or maybe and then on
the server side you got to know maybe
you're using notoriously not like
there's just so much to know and so and
plus all the things you integrate with
write it so you're gonna be using
libraries and frameworks and all this so
so the shift has become really before
you know 15 years ago or so you could be
a really good developer if you're an
expert in the language today the skill
set is not expertise in the particular
language although you should solve a
specialty but it's the ability to
quickly learn and to get the the the
grasp of the the larger picture to be
able to put things together right and to
be able to quickly pick up a framework
and see how things integrate together
it's to have more of a broad type of
ability to to do things rather than that
focused language focused and then the
other major change here is that it's
it's easier now right in well it's it's
harder because there's more to know but
it's easy to learn stuff because you can
find tutorials I mean you know like
you're yourself on YouTube right
obviously and and there's a lot of
youtubers that are putting out free
stuff there's paid content like
Pluralsight and Linda and treehouse and
you know and there's boot camps and
there's tons of books and tutorials and
blog posts so you can find all this
information we're so so I think that's
that's kind of the the difference now
it's like a really good developer today
is someone who can learn quickly and can
find information quickly and and put it
together right they still have to have
depth like some kind of specialty I
think is important but it's it's a
totally different world whereas before
it was like okay you're really good
developer if you are an expert in one
particular programming language and you
know all the nuances of it and it was
harder to do that but there was less to
know overall so it's definitely a
definitely different different
environment yeah I tend to agree
especially about the alert and being
able to learn quickly and learn new
things especially like I've always
thought that and then I started getting
some like applications in which they
would have coding challenges and the
coding challenges would not even be in
the languages that you'd be working with
they're like we want you to do this in
Python oh camel and rust I was like okay
but isn't this a JavaScript related role
and they like yes we just wanna see if
you can do it in these languages that
you've never touched before okay yeah
and so that's that I think that's really
what they're looking for more than
anything else it's like how well can you
adapt and then assuming that it takes
you three months to learn our stack cool
well you know here you go
there's three months to play around but
you got to make sure you know how to
learn before you can kind of jump in
exactly
yeah what's the most important skill you
know for Stauffer developer ID I do a
talk on this and and you know it's it's
not the most exciting skill but honestly
the most important skill is the ability
to teach yourself this is to learn
that's it and this part of the most
important school you'll have in your
life because if you could teach yourself
if you can self educate what can't you
do like the whole world opens up to you
if you can do that one thing and it is
surprisingly difficult most people have
difficulty teaching themselves they have
to go somewhere and someone has to teach
them you know they they they don't take
responsibility for their one education
is what I'd say so
I always seem to get asked this question
and I'll ask as well what's your opinion
about coding boot camps first
traditional like CS degree so yeah this
is a good one
you know and I actually like the some of
the first few chapters in my book I I
covered the three eyes like I have a
chapter they kid to boot camp one to
college and then one she's just total
self self taught education and I you
know as I was writing those chapters
actually and I was researching I became
more and more convinced that boot camp
makes the most sense in in in many cases
right
and the reason why is because it's like
you know boot camps necessarily well a
lot of people get get upset a lot of lot
of old timers like the old guard
programmers they say well oh boot camp I
you can't learn how to code in three
months these guys they're doing a
disservice they're just like you know
learning the basics and then they're
going out into the world and they're
writing the scrap code I couldn't
disagree it's like you know today we
work at very high levels of abstraction
and you can learn the basics if you're
dedicated if you're willing to work hard
if you have a good you know good system
for learning you can learn how to write
an application you know I just did this
video that was very very passionate
about like I could learn anything in
three months because some people were
doubting this and I think that's you
know that's the thing is like if you're
willing to put in the work a bootcamp
gives you the ability to to really
maximize your results in a short period
of time and it's focused on what you
know the traditional education has this
big problem today which is that it still
lives in a world where we are we're
perilous being a generalist is is
valuable and that's not the world we
live in today today we are specialists
today being a specialist is really
important being well-rounded does in
education sense doesn't make any sense
and so I think that's kind of the
weakness of college now some colleges
and the creep decree a degree programs
are are fixing that but a bootcamp is
focus on specifically what you what you
are trying to learn what you want to do
and so I like that approach and I think
that you know there is some merit to
saying that okay if you get an education
in how to program and you go through
like a 12-week or three-month boot camp
that that's not enough and I agree but
it's enough to get you started and get
you in the real world working and to
actually be productive and to add value
to a customer and then you your
education doesn't stop now you're
learning on the job but then you got to
go back and I think learning some of the
things that you would learn in
traditional CS becomes valuable but you
can do that you don't need to pay you
know a whole bunch of money go into debt
and spend four years of your life in
order do that if you're driven and
you're getting paid you get a job you
know quickly from boot camp you can go
back and then you can go and learn that
stuff on your own and that and that will
you know you still gotta keep learning
as a developer but it but I feel like a
boot camp is just in it just
economically makes sense timewise it
makes sense and because it's focused on
specifically what you're on application
as opposed to theoretical and academic
pursuits it to me you know as long as
you find the right one and you're
willing to work hard it seems like the
best path I just can't see why you know
someone would really like to see another
path is so much better yeah I think I
think it's more so just outdated thing I
tend to agree with the boot camp but uh
I it's one of those things I think you
get as much out of it as you put into it
there's definitely probably quite a few
people who go to boot camps and just
never do anything with software because
they just think they're gonna go for
three months get like a $80,000 starting
salary and like not have to work after
that but that goes back to the whole
like always being willing to learn and
always you know kind of being
self-taught like I think I think you do
the boot camp you start working and
continue to prove your skills so yeah
well you know the thing I tell people at
boot camp is I say okay don't even go to
boot camp if you're not if you're not
absolutely determined to be within the
top ten percentile of the of the
graduates in your boot camp because if
you're in the top ten percent you're
gonna get a job like you're gonna get a
good job because you know because people
say well not everyone who goes to boot
camp
gets a job yeah I totally agree but if
you're in the top ten percent I
guarantee you that any boot camp that
survives there at least getting
placements for the top ten percent of
people right it's probably should be top
fifty but but let's you know if you
don't have the drive and motivation in
and work ethic that you're gonna try to
be one of the top ten percent I'm not
saying the top person may be you know
that might be hard but the top ten
percent if you don't have that then
don't do it then you know you're what
you're wasting your money your time it's
not it's like you said it's not like you
just show up but the same people apply
the same thing to call it right a lot of
people say okay well I jump through all
the hoops
I got my CS degree at my 4-year degree
so where's my job dude and you're like
whoa hold on a second I think you missed
just because you did this just because
you've got a degree you're not entitled
to get a job it doesn't it doesn't work
that way it's like what value can you
contribute to society or to a business
that's how the world works that's how
economics works and so whether you learn
MIT the skills yourself whether you went
to a boot camp whether you got a degree
it was up to you to learn first of all
and then second to actually have that
learning result in some kind of value
that you can now provide and so if you
jump through all the hoops and you went
to a boot camp or you went to a
four-year degree and you didn't learn
and you can't provide value well I'm
sorry like you know you're not entitled
to just get it just because you did it
and that's I think that's it's a really
difficult mentality to shake out of
people's heads but it's very prevalent
today and that's scary I think you know
if you could give like one or three
whatever amount of advice that you would
like in terms of people who have gone
through the hoops the boot camps the
degrees they what would be the things
that you kind of recommend for them to
do or kind of create in order to
actually get their foot in the door and
get hired that seems to be something
that people are having trouble with
their game a little discouraged they're
applying all the time they think they're
ready to you know get that first
developer job but for whatever reason
it's not clicking yes this is this is a
big problem and it's interesting I just
recorded a video on this because people
complain well companies complain they
say we can't find any developers and
then all these developers young
developers aren't supposed to all
developers sue they say wait a minute
hold on are you guys crazy there's so
many of us like I I want a job like I
can write the code and so what's what's
the disconnect here right and so so the
problem is is really related to the the
fact that you know companies want to
hire the top developers the experienced
developers and so when you how do you
get your foot in the door right just
just like you said so I think there's a
few different things that the first
piece of advice I would say is do not go
in the front door
okay go around the back door figure out
do not and what I mean by the front door
is do not go through the standard go to
monster calm or hard a calm or you know
whatever the job search site is and just
drop a resume in there and expect to get
a job and you send out five thousand
resumes that's that's not a good plan so
you want to figure out you want to
figure out some other way to get in so
I'll give you an example just to make
this a little bit concrete so I was at a
music group and I was giving a talk and
this guy comes up to me he says hey I
want to get a job as a remote developer
and he said you know since you're here
can I pick your brain can I get some
help on this and and so I said well tell
me more and you said well you know I'm
really experienced in asp.net I know all
this stuff I've been programming for 10
years but I've never been able to get a
remote development job I've applied for
a lot of home but there's a lot of
competition like you said and so how can
how can I do this well what what could I
do he said I'm really good at talking to
people and you know communications so I
said okay well what if you did this I
don't think there's a podcast called the
remote developer podcast I think a lot
of people are interested in remote
develop I don't think there's a podcast
dedicated what if you created a podcast
you know it's called developer podcast
or something like that and you
interviewed a bunch of remote developers
you know about their lives about the
struggles how they got their jobs all
that and you actually called some
companies that had remote teams and you
companies hey do you have any developers
that would be good for my podcast I am
the host of a podcast dedicated to
remote developers and I know you have a
remote distributed team and I've heard
good think about your company right and
then and then what's gonna happen there
is a couple of things one you're gonna
become an authority but by virtue of
being the host of the remote developer
podcast - you're gonna make connections
with all these companies in in an
indirect way instead of banging on the
door and saying hey could you give me a
job you're going to be coming in from a
position of almost authority right here
or at least at the pure level like where
I'm looking for for developers from your
company to to interview and so now
you're going to create all these
connections and so guess what happens
when they
have a remote job opening they're gonna
be like well should we hire the guy
that's interviewed like 50 remote
developers and and is an expert honor it
I think he'll probably be a good hire I
you see what I'm saying like you'll have
all these connections I think there you
go and that's an example I mean that's
just one example but that's how you
don't go in the front door that's how
you go around the back around the side
door is you figure out these ways and
sometimes it's just like noticing that
this company that has all these
developers that you want to work for
they all they all go to coffee at 10:00
a.m. at some spot we'll go hang out
there it with your laptop right and go
straight up conversations and you know I
mean it takes some work and stuff but
think outside the box think of ways so
you're gonna build relationships that
you're gonna get opportunities that are
gonna that that the HR person you know I
I heard this great story this was at a
conference and this this guy was was
telling me that he had he had tried to
get this this guy a job and he had there
was a developer friend of his and he had
put in his resume and or the guys submit
for the job and he never heard back in
his perfect match and he went to her and
said well what-what happened and the HR
person said well you see on his resume
you did the programming language that
this job is for he listed it as as as
the 8th skill so we threw the resume out
son let it suck you it's like what wait
a minute how do you know that he doesn't
know all hated those programming
languages equally like this is
ridiculous like call them up right and
so the point there it's like HR person
you know no offense HR people but
they're stupid they don't know
technology right they're gonna like
filter based on keywords they're like
you need to have 10 years of experience
in a programming language that came out
yesterday like it's you know that this
is so you cannot go through you got to
avoid these gatekeepers and so you got
to think of ways to do this how can you
and that's why I always emphasize for
developers to market themselves to build
a personal brand get a blog out there
right you know I mean first thing that
someone does when they when you apply
for a job I guarantee you what did it
would what they do is they google your
name and if your blog comes up and you
claim to be an iOS developer but your
it's like you know two years old you
haven't posted anything on it uh you
know but if you've been posting every
week and you have all these great
articles on iOS development they sit
there and you get an interview before
the interview because they'll sit there
for an hour and read your stuff and
they've already decided to hire you
before you even come in for the
interview they're just gonna check to
make sure you're not a psycho maniac at
the interview and that one is easy to
pass for most people right so you got to
figure out you know if you want to get
your foot in the door you know figure
out how to go around you know and it
could be like I said some of the
techniques but if some practical things
are that everyone can do is to create a
blog keep that updated you know build
your personal brand and your and your
your marketing freak for yourself and
and do things like get it get a
portfolio like you know put for Android
apps in the App Store if you want to be
an Android developer so then you can say
look I can actually write code and I
publish it you know try to figure out
you know think think in terms of the
employer what would they want what would
be something that would just knock their
socks off that they'd be like okay I got
a hire this person right and then I'll
give a one last piece I'm going on a
loop of a diatribe but be persistent as
hell like you cannot be too persistent
right just keep on knocking there's I
read you know if you reach sales books
one of the things that they say is like
you know the difference between the
sales person who makes $300,000 a year
and the person who makes $60,000 a year
is the $60,000 a year person they only
call they only call eight times but the
300,000 a year person they called 13 to
14 on average so you just keep on
knocking you just keep on being annoying
you know dude in a plight way but keep
on knocking say hey what about now do
you have done for me now you know what
can I do what you know and you you keep
on going until you get it because it
works the squeaky wheel gets the gets
the grease so I definitely like the
marketing aspect I don't think it's
something people do that I'm sure you
know I watched some of your videos I can
get quite a few ideas of how to proceed
with that yeah yeah I mean yeah you're a
perfect example right I mean like you
just like if you think about it if if
I'm thinking about hiring you for a job
right and I go and I google your name
and oh my god that's interesting you
have YouTube channel I'm sorry watching
your videos and I'm like oh that's
interesting so this guy's actually
teaching so then another thing clips in
my head I'm like ha if I heard this guy
he's gonna help make my whole team
better because you can't stop him from
teaching he's gonna teach right and
that's then I'm like okay now this you
know it's like you've just moved up a
few levels and and plus I mean you know
having your name out there like is just
it's a powerful concept you you have
this you can create these many celebrity
effects and it doesn't take a lot right
in order to do that as you've probably
noticed right it's it's been it's been
an interesting thing because I never
really thought YouTube would ever help
me get a developer job but it it has
yeah it's like oh that's great thanks
