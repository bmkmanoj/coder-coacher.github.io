with you which is edging X dot TV now
you may be familiar with their courses
where you can they sell various courses
but what's the difference between the
dot-com and dot TV version is the dot
TVs you pay a flat monthly fee and you
get access to a ton of different courses
and you know let's go web you see here's
a couple other more standout ones you
have learning Euler to react Jas
software you know going over get bigger
and essentials mobile and they have to
have a ton more in good search form but
it's pretty affordable too so you have a
free month so you can give it a shot
it's $90 for a year so at the end of day
for a mere 90 bucks you have a year's
worth of a limited course access and you
can see that if you go ten dollars a
month which is basically one course you
get access to all their courses they
also have a course certification show
that you you took it which is always
cool to put that on your LinkedIn I
always think it's a clogged in that on
my own and you have access to a ton of
cool stuff and like what one that I
actually I'm going to do because from
the sponsorship they're actually given
me access to it I am going to be doing
the angle angle accusin is something I
want to learn and I'm pretty excited I
might even do some videos about this
moving forward we're now for a small
monthly fee i've access to this course
which i was looking at buying is like 30
or 40 bucks on their website just by the
course where you can give it it's just
part of the $10 month bundle and you'll
see it's 14 hours of videos with 81
lectures and you'll build 12 angular 2
web apps now I've always said that
projects get you jobs especially as a
junior level developer so I'm really
excited to see that the Aylor 2 video
that I'll be working with will cover all
these 12 apps I think it's really great
because I know a lot of us are trying to
change our life by getting better in
software and maybe we're changing
careers and the last thing we want to do
is spend
money and at ten dollars a month you get
a bunch of high quality premium
tutorials and I was just playing through
their website and some of the it's funny
some I've been to people ask me all the
time like who who are some of the
youtubers that you watch I name like
Derrick bonus and new Boston but one of
the guys I've been watching for a while
now is Shrek traversée media and he
actually I don't know if the discourse
but one of the courses I was looking at
I recognized his voice instantly because
I watch a bunch of its tutorial and he
makes quality tutorials which really
excited me about this sponsorship
because I I if you end by the way if you
haven't joined his YouTube channel you
should as well but I think this is a
great package for less than $10 a month
if you sign up you could access to a
whole bunch of courses and they're going
to be adding more in the future
definitely check it out and at the very
least get your free month you know if
there's a skill you want to pick up in a
month go ahead and give it a shot but I
appreciate you guys watching this video
look forward to some angular2 tutorials
in the near future as I go and try to
better myself and future-proof myself
and make more money down the road but
that's always guys thank you for
watching don't forget to join our
Facebook group if you want support me
you can accomplishment Orioles 360 thank
you to our sponsors and thank you for
such a cool product also $10 a month for
all these courses is pretty dope and I
can't wait to see what happens with it
moving forward hey guys even though all
these courses are such a great value as
they are you can save even more money
using the coupon code coding 360 that's
coding 360 so save yourself a few bucks
and get yourself some nice courses on a
monthly basis hope you enjoy it and
learn a lot in the process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
