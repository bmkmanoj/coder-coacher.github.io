statistics exam statistics your students
took their first test let's see how
everyone did it says so we have a great
list full of grades we're gonna print
grades and then so on so forth so this
basically looks like what we're gonna
make here so define a function on line 3
called print grade so def print there's
4 grades with one argument a list called
grades so this is gonna take in grades
all right inside the function integrate
three grades print each item on its own
line
all right so print alright so for I in
grades print by and then we need to call
it so print under spread grades grades
and that should be good so there are all
our grades review all right it jumped
around a little bit let's compute some
stats all right
I can get down with that on line three
define a function called grade some so
def grades
I'm just course some takes in a list of
scores so it takes in scores computes
some of the scores returns the computer
cell so for I and scores
let's do total total equals zero so it's
initially so that zero total equals
total plus I
return total that should be good
call newly out and then call it so
grades underscore some and we need to
put grades in here
oh don't forget to print it and there we
go so the total sum of the greates is a
little over a thousand so now define a
function below the grade sum function
that does the following all right
has one argue so grades average so death
grades
I'm just gravure äj-- has one argument
grades and let's see here calls great
sum with grades
all right so for compute the average of
greats like dividing the Sun by float
Lin grades all right
so we'll say average equals grades I'm
just where some grades divided by float
Lin grades
turn average I'll call it don't you're
good so see we call this function
how's one I'm gonna great it's called
grades some with grades oh and this
needs to not be modulo let me through
that and then finally return and then we
need to call it so let's put in print
grades underscore Everage and in it will
just put grades I should do it just fine
so the average is 80 0.42 print time to
conquer the variance it says all right
so what's next on line 18 write a new
function called F grade underscore
variance XS one arguments scores first
create a variable called average set
that equal to grades isil we're setting
this equal to our average of scores next
for another variable called variance and
equals zero we will use this as a
rolling its own and then for each
scoring scores it's a for each score
they want to use this for scoring scores
Computers squared different average my
score all right so this is variance
equals variance plus average minus score
to the second power divided variance by
total number of scores all right so then
return the result
all right so variance equals variance
divided by length of scores and then we
want to return the variance finally
after your function code print grades
variance all right so print grade out
grades underscore the variance grades
hey let's see what's going on here
so our grade variance is 334 all right
so now define a function grades
all right so def grades on this for a
standard underscored deviation variance
return those all the variance return
variance to the square root
after the function create a new variable
called variance so let's say variance
set it equal the result of calling
grades underscore variance craze finally
print grades Oh deviation are they Oh
standard deviation okay we're doing a
little bit of calculus if I remember
correctly so that's basically showing on
average I believe on average the
difference is 18 percent so now last but
not least a little bit of review we want
to I think we did all this print out the
following you all right so print all the
grades so we'll just work our way down
let's take out all these print
statements start at the top so print
time just for grades grades all right so
we just have to call that one some of
the grades so in this case we need to
actually declare print grades underscore
some grades and next one is the average
raise so we actually have to declare
print as well so grades underscore
average grades and let's see the
variance so we also need to print grades
underscore variance and in there we will
put grades and finally we need to print
standard deviation graze undersized to
do deviation and in here we need foot
bearings I believe that's correct
BAM so there are all our numbers blew
through the exam statistics a lot easier
than the last video and up next I think
we're getting into advanced topics with
Python if I remember correctly so we're
blowing through here so it looks like
we're gonna be get things allegedly
you're supposed to be getting a little
bit harder and I'll see you guys in the
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
