listen functions list and functions so
let's get started here all right so
let's hear please I have the code that
print out the second so we want to print
and oh my god
this the second index Vout we won't
print 3 so 0 1 2 there you go
so for instance a pretty simple all
right on line 3 multiply the second
element of the end list by 5 so we're
going to print and n1 times 5
I'll show that
that so we're getting the right result
but it doesn't look like that's what
they want us to have okay so they may be
well I nighttime unless like there's
some five values in the form all right
so I think they want us to do it like
this and of one equals and of one that
was five so what they want okay so they
just wanted us to change the value of
the middle value and not overwrite the
whole end append the number for the end
of the list
all right so and append let's see if
this is right I think I'm declaring this
wrong but you're not sure all right so a
pen just means added to the end of the
list and there we go
removes first item from the list and
using either dot pop dot remove or
delete if I remember quickly pop removes
if you just called dot pop it'll remove
a suit delete and then remove
all right so if we call that pop we're
calling on the index value and this is
what I normally would use end up pop and
we want to remove the first item which
would be zero so there's our three and
the five good so change the function so
the given argument is multiplied by
three and return so we are just going to
change the symbol there well that should
do it
and then return is 15 cool define a
function called add function so def add
underscore function has two parameters
and x and a y and it adds them together
so return x plus y and so we should 5
and 13 get 18 returned there we go ready
function called so def string underscore
function that takes in a single argument
s returns that argument concatenated
with the word world done add space
before word world so return s plus world
don't forget the quotes
so hello world one word click save and
submit to see that using an ELISA sorry
miss function so this is gonna just
should print out three five seven there
it is
alright so change line to so that list
function returns only the items stored
in the index one of X rather than the
entire X list so let's see so we want
index 1 which is 0 and I should be
that's all we got to do
well return 6 instead of one Oh index 1
there you go that's the first slot but
actually index one alright so change the
list function so that you can add 3 to
the item of the index 1 to the list I
think that should do it
stir result back to index 1 ok so we'll
say index 1 equals the next one plus 3
return X 1 return X
there you go so index one was three we
added three to our index almost five we
added three to it so those are eight to
find a function called list extender so
our death list under song extender takes
it one parameter first and inside
function append the number nine to the
list
so first out append
nine
actually it's just something mom do it
so we append the list first returned
first yeah that's right
and valid syntax
list underscore extender first
to find a functionalistic sender tooth
has one parameter first
oh it's list though that was first so
that's an L all right there we go so
that's the LST not a one st like first
alright define a function called print
list so def print underscore underscore
a list takes one argument X inside that
function print out each element one by
one using existing code as a scaffold
then call the function with argument to
print it inside that function print out
each element one by one using the
existing code as a scaffold this kind of
looks like it's already there I think
that's what they're saying I think they
just want us to do it like that and then
we want to call print underscore a list
on N and it should print three five
seven on separate lines do you create a
fish of print on your list
so there's three five seven the body of
your function should not contain any
references so first so that's X and then
X so just go ahead and fix that and now
we're good so you see the three and five
and seven it's not premia knit as an
ArrayList like it did before
it's just printing the value all right
so create a function called double
underscore list takes a single argument
X which will be a list and multiplies
each element by to use the existing code
as scaffold alright so again they want
us to take this freak addendum properly
change the X's to ends and I believe
that all we need to do did you remember
to return the result all right and then
the return
turn X
there we go so just wants us double this
and we did 6 10 14 good to go so on line
6 replace the blank with a range that
returns the list containing 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 so
long 6 print the function with our range
all right so if you look in the example
right here range is a built-in function
that has its own parameter so we're
gonna do the range of 0 up to 3 forget
your comma and there you go so we have 0
0 to 4 oh it's multiplying it by 2 right
here okay so that's right so we wanted 0
1 2 so divide those by 2 you still get 0
1 &amp;amp; 2
okay so create a function that returns
the sum of lists and so we're creating a
function that returns the sum of a list
of numbers so find a function called
total so I'm deaf total takes in one
parameter numbers that's gonna be a list
inside there create a variable called
result set that equal to zero usually
one or two methods above iterate through
the numbers list so we'll do for I in
numbers that just seems a little bit
easier you could also iterate through
that but if we're iterating through the
whole thing we might as well just do the
more simplified version so for I in
numbers added to there's also result
equals result plus plus I excuse me for
less in numbers I there we go
finally return result
nine-nine
listen X out of range
line six so somewhere we're saying
resolve is equal to zero so result is
equal result plus numbers I return
result yeah hmm so we set results so
it's it has its in the scope of this
function we're saying result is equal to
whatever our current result is plus
numbers I Jimmy that should make sense
but let's go ahead and pull up on the
Q&amp;amp;A forum real quick what are we on
we're on 15 15 of 18 let's see what this
guy had an issue with Zoey because I
thought it was all plus I know
take care about spaces so this guy did
the same when I did then he returned it
and then let's try doing it this way I'm
not it should him in theory it should
work the same but we're not kidding cuz
they're saying we're having a length
issue so I believe it should work the
way we did it such as this but just
because they want it this way go ahead
and do it that way just might work out a
little bit better for you all right so
define a function called joint strings
def join underscore strings accepts an
argument words it'll be a list inside
the function create a variable called
result we're gonna set it to an empty
string iterate through words list and
append each word to result return result
okay so we'll say for I in words print I
and also you want to result dot append I
return results actually I don't think we
need to print I there's a lot append
words I I think that's right no all
right uh I see object has no attribute
append
results equals result plus words I so um
can't treat this as a list the cut looks
a bit off check the console so line 10
line 6 right so let's look at so join
strings and should return hello there so
results Ziegler's all plus words I that
should be correct
let's try it like this there we go
that's better
so I was trying to call the indices when
we're actually dealing with strings my
fault nothing really say about that but
uh all right like Ford defined function
called jointless add F join underscore
list it's gonna take into parameter X
and y both will be list inside the
function return the result of
concatenate all right so we're working
with numbers so all we got to do is 2x
plus 1 just do they want us to
concatenate all of it looks like it so
one plus four one two three four five
six so we're just adding the list
together that's all we're doing all
right so we are finally on the last one
so let's create a function called def
flatten so take one argument called list
make a new empty list called results are
gonna set results is equal to zero
iterate through lists call the looping
variable numbers for numbers unless
oops this is a empty lift so like that
and then we'll say the results dot
append numbers finally return results
now let's see remaining hairs here
flatten one two three four return one
two three four and seven one two three
four
we'll just think come one four five six
so what did we do wrong here so he
returned one two three four instead of
one two or three four you said get what
it should turn into so let's go ahead
and go out the form real quick
I'm kinda on the same page as this guy
so there's all seacoast Oh
yeah I'm sorry I don't know I I tried
that
alright so here we are
so
did I miss a whole loop
huh all right let's see here so
apparently we needed to iterate through
two lists as you can see here so this is
our double array rather then we have our
function we have an empty function then
we have four numbers in list we want two
results
okay so alright so I I see what's going
on here
we need to iterate because we're trying
to combine them and they we have two
arrays we need to have two for loops so
iterate through this array so the first
loop is to get the array the number of a
race once we're in the first array the 1
2 3 iterate through that and then once
we're done with that go to the outer for
loop again alright so we'll do 4i and
numbers and then I think that's it oops
let's see let's take a look again
results that append is what we needed
and we have to append the inside
unexpected indented block and now we're
good so that's what what's going on
they're a little bit confusing not
because it's necessarily hard just
because Oh actually does say right here
iterate through numbers so that's my
fault for not reading up properly
sometimes I try to rush through these
things and I suffer for it let's take a
look at what we're doing next and it
says welcome to battleship so it looks
like we're gonna be making a classic
quote-unquote 5x5 grid game should be
pretty fun usually these are only about
five or six sometimes eight but this
one's nineteen so I'm excited for it I
like I like Python and I indent gets a
little crazy but I can't wait to start
the PI game and if you have any
questions comments concerns anything
wordpress related i'm always looking to
make wordpress videos now go ahead and
leave me a comment below and i will see
you guys in the next python video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
