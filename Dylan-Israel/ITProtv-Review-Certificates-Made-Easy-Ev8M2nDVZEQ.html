about IT Pro TV who is sponsoring this
video they originally offered me money I
said I don't want your money
I want a subscription because I need to
get educated and I hope you get educated
and will include a code for you to get
educated for 30% off down below so
definitely listen up
so what IP Protima is is a resource to
get you prepared to get technical
certifications and knowledge as Tai
Lopez would say but it's a really great
service they offer tests practice tests
for these for those some of these who
don't know how to maybe increase your
skill set or become more higher bullying
and in-demand certifications are a great
way of going about that there's a lot of
certifications out there in things like
AWS or Cisco or Linux and I'm working
through them now thank you - I see Pro
TV for doing that even though they may
have turned me down for a job interview
or - that I apply for not not better at
least thank you for sponsoring the video
so we'll leave it at that but let's look
at a couple of their courses you'll see
right here I'm actually learning a a
project management agile is something
that is even though I don't plan on
being a project manager anytime in the
near future
agile is definitely something that's
great for the resume a lot of software
development jobs have it now I'll be
learning more of their deaf courses
which they're launching and the top by
all you know senior developers and
professionals all of these very detailed
high-end quality content a lot of these
courses are like 8 to 40 hours depending
on the content you see Amazon AWS
certified Solutions Architect associate
is a 16 hour course you make six figures
as a certified AWS into a working
individual and then they have the system
office administrator Cisco ton of stuff
here
now I know very little to nothing about
hardware and sir
furs and things like that but what I do
know is that when I've been looking at
job applications lately they want me to
have Linux they want me to have AWS
these are things that are in the
preferred categories if you can start
knocking out those preferred categories
you can get a job much easier which is
why this bad boy right here is in my
near future as well as a little bit of
the agile and as well as the Linux
courses that they offer but they don't
only offer that they also offer and this
is a part of their free service so you
can go and sign up today say Amen life
is hard that 30% ain't going to cut it I
uh I just want free stuff okay I can
appreciate free I do YouTube it's all
three so they have a 24/7 of live
channels going on multiple things
depending on what you want right but
you'll see right now they have something
about how to become a Linux system admin
dev Pro which is a more development all
these sorts of channels breaking it down
piece by piece by piece
Linux Kali Linux down here I might have
to check that out but that's free you
can go check that out right now
IT Pro TVs slash live they also have
virtual practice labs for the premium
content which is really cool a lot of
times it's kind of hard to imagine how
do I actually get started with this with
this what do I build what do I do
and here you have a great opportunity to
do things like Microsoft SQL Server
Microsoft Office Cisco actual virtual
projects that they will help you get
started dive into as well as practice
tests to get all that that's the goal
that's the goal of the bulk of their
their projects UI excuse me their
categories here they're designated to go
towards a specific certificate to make
you more hireable to give you the skills
that get you more resume your resume to
look as good as possible so that you can
go in and work those jobs and on top of
it they have their def Pro TV this is
just the beta I'm very impressed with a
beta that they're going to go and check
this out and to be honest April is
probably going to go in a project
management route and all these
certificates and project management
meant this is what she's going to be
doing the next couple months she's going
to be trying to getting these so that
she can help get her role in a
answer it roll at a tech company well
maybe to make that transition that much
easier project managers make as much as
developers so there's a lot of great
stuff in here
it's almost technical skills Microsoft
everything in here can help you the
depth Pro TV because that's what we're
interested in on top of all the great
stuff that we just said from IT Pro TV
is the docker that's another get
JavaScript node and tend it I'm actually
really excited about this node course I
know very little node I love it what I
know with it is all expressed related
this is a 10 hour course on on node I'm
excited about that react you if you're
if you're just getting started
introduction to web development the es6
and 8 our course on es6 i'm really liked
it because i can't code in es6 that work
i'm pretty excited about this one as
well
express these are all great things to
have if you're going down the mean stack
and i'm sure i've no doubt it's going to
continue to expand i highly encourage
you to check it out again that's IT pro
TV definitely go get a free account at
the very least have some free courses
you can't see them on here because i
have a premium account now but i want to
thank them for for for accepting my hey
i'd rather just have some free content
so that i can learn because i promise
you right now if i didn't like what I
saw I was just taking the money so just
to keep it real I was just taking the
money but I like what I see here and at
the very least if you're struggling
you're not quite right you're not quite
ready to jump over and buy an account
you can use the free stuff and maybe one
day when you say you know what I'm ready
to take my career to the next level
that's when you go and and say ok let's
jump in and I still got that 30 percent
discount code for you but they could IT
pro TV for sponsoring this I'm really
excited
you'll be seeing me actually talking
about the certifications over the next
year or so then I plan that I'm actually
getting through here and I imagine that
my income and my higher ability will
jump up as well so thank you so much for
watching the video guys I'll see you
next time and thank you once again
psyche protein because it's hard it's
hard being a software
