brag I just want to kind of I try to
give you guys some culture so you get a
little see a little bit of craziness we
we did I want to say it was about 22
hours of driving to get from where we're
at in Tampa to New Orleans was just out
of the path of the storm and I've logged
a good portion of it there and a little
bit of the way back I hope you guys get
to see a little bit of how crazy the
road was and how insane it made me go
yeah just being in the car that long
today's shout-out goes to our boys at

as always guys you can choose if your
money goes all to charity or if it goes
all to me whatever you want to do hey
guys before we get sorry I just wanted
to show you some of the crazy prep we
had to do we had to get water which was
a multi-day mission I finally got lucky
guinea man you can see my coffee on the
picture there and the can and a doughnut
I picked up at the Publix grocery store
we got there at 7 a.m. right when they
opened kind of my usual schedule with my
coworker
then they happen to have several things
of water and they sold out about 20
minutes we picked up some and then also
just a little bit of the flat tire issue
not the not the way that you want to
start your trip when you're evacuating
out of a city you would never know by
the weather it's nice and sunny that
this entire city has cleared out all the
water gas because they're worried about
a hurricane you'd have no idea at all
hi my name is Delia sir today is
September 7th it's a Thursday we are in
Zone B of st. Petersburg Florida we're
recording this video just to showcase
our furniture and all our items for
insurance purposes hopefully it won't be
necessary
hurricane and no hurricane I'm coming
back for you I couldn't leave you behind
let's go baby
where I go the PC goes alright guys we
are fle not desperately or anything we
are leaving
Florida right now the Tampa area the
hurricane
curved or towards the west part of
Florida when most of the models
shouldn't go in the east summer we're
thinking about stayin and lady but we
had all our stuff prepped we spent about
two three hundred bucks on food and
water and so four hundred dollars of car
repairs so that we could get up and go
you know cat food cat litter so we have
three cats in the back there
we're about an hour into our trip Milo
just threw up Monty know about 20
minutes ago
so we had to pull over and clean all
that mess up and we are on our way
just probably we're going to New Orleans
right now
all right we're gonna do our leans which
is about ten hours from where we're at
the storms not supposed to hit there
we're gonna go stay at a motel 6 for a
little bit maybe eat some alligator
sausage highly recommend we went to New
Orleans once before actually I have my
Dalia shirt on right now and just gonna
try and wait it out for a couple days
before we go back to home
alright guys we are about three and a
half four hours into our trip we are
down to about a third to 40% of our gas
tank
April's called all the gas stations in
the county that we're in see if they
have gas they are all out of gas we
currently can go about 120 miles on what
we have in my tank right now at a
hundred miles there is a gas station
that we called that has gas as an honor
way there's also two hours away so
there's a good chance that yea they
meant they may be all sold out of gas
and we may be parking out of gas station
until more arrives the car in front of
us has about nine gallons
I thought about feeling it is scary
we're not guys feeling okay that gun is
completely prepared I thought I should
have bought a gas canister and done all
that but I don't know I I made a mistake
but we're learning we're on our way to
New Orleans I'm not sure if we're gonna
make it there tonight I'm this this
traffic and this drive is killing me man
it's every reason that I left LA the
traffic and the heat and so we're not
running the AC to save
to save gas because of how dire this
whole situation is but at the very least
removing north and hopefully the the
hurricane when it when it does arrive in
two days or so it'll be the farther
north you are the less less intense it
gets basically so we're going to
continue on and hopefully have some gas
in about two hours
I'm not sure if you guys can see that
but I'm about the 40th car in line to go
and get gas at the first gas station and
about well only about 50 miles that has
gas but we've probably seen about 25 gas
stations hopefully they still have some
by the time we get up there we're gonna
be totally you can see right
there we're down to about 20% of my tank
which is about 40 miles to put this all
in perspective also it's about 4:45
right now we left at 9 a.m. we've
travelled about a hundred and thirty
miles in that time and for the last 100
miles because we were worried about
running out of gas we haven't had for a
lot about 100 of the last 130 hundred 40
we had we've we have a ran out of we
so I gotta let this guy through here
it's crazy man
well we've been going without AC the
poor cats have actually died no but
they're not enjoying this too much
alright guys we just arrived to
Tallahassee
it is a 7:30 p.m. yeah we're hoping to
get a room but Motel six or something
like that we stopped at two called a
couple they're all booked I imagine it's
gonna be like that for a lot of the
other ones as well as as you manager a
lot of people are leaving a lot of
people are evacuating and driving the
friends and family whoever else and so
those rooms are booked so at this time
we are continuing our journey for about
ten and a half hours and so far right
now I think we're going to New Orleans
that's where our final destination is is
New Orleans
hoping to hoping to find some gas and
find a place to stay on the way there
little I don't want to drive another
five and a half hours they get there up
like one or two three tired exhausted
ready for the day to be oh alright guys
as you can see it is dark out hmm it is
8:30 and we're stuck in traffic on our
way to do or at least we're probably
gonna just keep saying on our way to New
Orleans but you know you're not taking
me to normally I'm just about to say we
are probably going to stop at the edge
of Florida and not go all the way to New
Orleans
someone's all salty that we're not going
I am real salty you know we have been
driving for I told drive it's not about
that I don't want to be in this car
anymore anyhow
oh so we're going somewhere probably
towards the edge of the west western
border of Florida and the Panhandle part
I think I don't know was all this floor
so submitted me much like hurricanes a
real me Los Angeles so we are on
our way
topped off our gas tank should be good
now for about three hundred plus miles
should be more than enough it's kind of
crazy that I would say probably one in
20 gas stations are our full we've tried
booking in a couple or motels along the
way
we've gone probably about 40 50 miles
from Tallahassee and we're hoping maybe
if we got in the outskirts a little bit
that we'd find some luck but I guess
when a good portion of the state is
evacuating it's just even that's
unreasonable so here we are on our way
in traffic going on soon to be 12 hours
of adventure and the poor cats are in
the crate
according to April I'm the weak link and
we should go all the way to New Orleans
but we have to actually get some sleep
eventually I'm pretty tired BAM that's
the update Captain's Log we've now been
on the road for close to 13 hours still
unable to find a motel or hotel my
mother is actually trying to find us one
at a one of the last cities that happen
in Florida that is outside of the
hurricane zone so we if we could stay
there that'd be great it's about 110
miles away from here
I will be surprised not only if there
are rooms available but if my mother can
actually do a google search it's not
very tech-savvy it will be I'll be a
thoroughly impressed I appreciate the
effort my gut is telling me that we are
sleeping in the car tonight cars backed
up with supplies and cats so we can't
stretch out can't do anything more
importantly they've really will be able
to stretch out they'll probably just
sleep on top of us we have two pillows
and blanket in here
yeah it's it's been a long day and a
long journey and may be able to get
lucky and my mom will find us a place in
Motel 6 or something but uh we haven't
been lucky so far
this is really reminded me of the drive
I did from California to Florida I did
that in three days and they did like a
12-hour day of 14-hour day and a 16-hour
day if I remember correctly and it's
been off now
I had HC of the whole way so that was
much better but the idea of doing doing
that what we did today
two more days in a row is really weird
like and having done it so that's very
painful to think about hey glad
hopefully we are we are very grateful we
don't have to do it but we definitely
have to drive back if we make it all the
way in New Orleans
I'm assume that we have no traffic
there's a big assumption this is going
to be a ten and a half hour drive which
is very tiring I'm not even sure because
we've been on the road how the hurricane
Irma's paths has changed and what that
means for when we're going back is that
as of right now I don't know when we're
actually going to be able to drive back
so that we both can go back to work
so looking forward to that when we
eventually have any place to sleep at
update time we have now been on the road
for approximately 16 hours my mother
actually booked us a the last room for a
motel 6 in New Orleans for two hours of
40 minutes away filled up with gas the
cats are looking to feed it and tired
and just want it to be over much like
myself but we have a room it's two hours
of 40 minutes away we just entered
Alabama on our way in New Orleans for
myself April and our three cats in a
full bed in a motel 6 oh it's going to
be quite a party for the next few days
alright guys I was too tired to film
this as akiles links our ice bucket
right now when we got in here you can
see we're kind of settle down a little
bit a little little full-size bed April
and I have our our bed a little bit
dinner we picked up TV AC nothing too
special and three amigos
little makeshift litter box and then
you'll see this is Jim over here I have
a video with more details but basically
this just started dripping into here for
no reason at all but we don't want to
report it because the entire hotel or
motel is completely full you see all the
water in there at this point it's
completely full we want to have anywhere
to go so we're just going to kind of
have a bucket oh hey buddy
alright guys it is Monday morning I've
been around about ten minutes we're
leaving nor leaves headed back towards
Tampa I think we might get a little bit
of land on the way back it's very lay
off calls for another month I just
clicked it a little bit and mostly we
drive through
if not we'll probably post up for the
flowers when we got food poisoning last
night I really just what I feel you look
off another trip
so it's abominated some other things
happen so that was really exciting for
an event trip but now we're on our way
Oh hopefully Joe home that is if you
flooded from the new as it sounds like
damp up all that that badly so I'm
pretty hopeful but we were in a man 3
Maxim
the sandbags at the patio door hopefully
nothing too bad happen hey guys so it's
about 11 o'clock at night it took us
about 12 full hours to get back home
from New Orleans and I wanted to show
you a little bit of this tree that fell
over from the wind right outside in my
apartment it's about 20 30 feet away
that's pretty crazy
and you can see how even with it not
being a direct hit or anything I think I
think it was a level two when it
mirrored by it broke this whole tree off
pretty much blocking the entire driveway
and some parking spots but I am we're
home now that's just good got to throw
away a bunch of food just power went out
but not to shopping no water damage or
anything like that and just ready to get
back to the grind these hacks
do-it-yourself projects revolving around
Arduino and Raspberry Pi there's some
great how-to guides I highly encourage
you to check them out and thanks for
