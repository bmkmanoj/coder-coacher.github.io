subscription box don't glow your dank
little my quite sure I said but it's
basically a box every month you get a
random stuff there's three different one
standard danke lo Prime and pro so it's
I got the the Prime I just figured 13 99
plus tax probably can't beat that come
it came out to about $19 after-tax tax
was like five fifty or six dollars or
something like that so let me show you I
just opened it up and I'll show you what
I got for almost 20 bucks so little box
you'll never guess what's inside is
their slogan and they were right so they
send you like all subscription boxes a
little guide about what's in it and how
to use it and all that stuff but one of
the cool things is they also send you
money in every box I only got a dollar
but you can get anywhere from a dollar
to a thousand dollars so this goes I'll
look through it if you're in confused by
your item someone not so the first thing
I noticed is just like one of the bigger
items is a touch me it's like a
toothpaste dispenser where you just kind
of I guess put it inside here and then
it comes out when you push on something
once you put your toothpaste in then
they sent me some toothpaste salt also
ultra bright I'm not very big on
whatever toothpaste brands whatever
works but hopefully it's a good one then
they sent this it's called the wallet
ninja and it's a bottle opener that's
cool a ruler it's got a screwdriver it's
got a couple different like wrench ends
so I mean it's kind of one of those
all-purpose things a can opener but I
think it said 18 or 20 different uses
out of it so this is one of those things
I guess it's kind of handy maybe throw
it in your wallet if you're I don't know
if I'd ever actually use it the next
thing is a they went with a theme I
don't know if all the boxes are the same
or what but mine was a very toothbrush
eccentric theme so this is like a you
put up on your wall
and it holds your toothbrushes and they
just kind of hang there so that's kind
of cool I guess it's just me so I don't
have five toothbrushes it's just the one
but uh I'm sure I could give it to my
girlfriend or something the last thing I
got was a little like squeeze thing so
if you have your toothbrush out or your
toothpaste around like you just put it
through and squeeze it and that way you
get all of it out of there so just go
over okay toothpaste dispenser and a
little squeeze thing lip-lip squeezing
toothpaste holder the ninja card wallet
thing and ultra-bright two-face
so for about 20 bucks this one guy I
have to say I'm not really that happy I
was like I guess a dollar 19 after I get
a dollar back it's a crisp dollar though
it's like it's not a homeless-looking
dollar it's a nice one but still dulling
nonetheless I'm gonna give it AI with
all my subscription boxers I gave it
three months as kind of the standard
let's see how it does but I have to say
this first box I'm not that impressed I
get that it's supposed to be random and
you know helpful stuff by I really feel
like you should get some value out of
things and I feel like through this for
this thing this is all junk and you can
yeah this toothpaste thing will be cool
and put up on the wall but I feel like
they gave me $20 worth of stuff when I
kind of expect a little bit of a deal I
expect to get something so I suspect
more value than what I pay for with when
you're not giving some when you're
getting random stuff so hopefully
they'll get better but this box I wasn't
that impressed on but I'm I have two
more months and hopefully we'll see
something new and better and a little
less all focused on teeth you know teeth
are cool a nice butt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
