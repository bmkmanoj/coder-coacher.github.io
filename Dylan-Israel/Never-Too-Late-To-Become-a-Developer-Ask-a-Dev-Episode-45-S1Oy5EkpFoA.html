of a fun video where the first part of
the video we're going to be talking
about getting started in life and what I
mean by that is I didn't really get
serious about life until I was probably
about 25 I'm 29 now my career is on the
right path
I'm making all right money and things
are looking positive for the future and
I reflect back and I think to myself man
I wish that what I was doing when I was
18 that I was on the right path right
and that's part of why I like doing
these videos as well is to talk about
what I've learned along you know the
journey of life right it's always easy
easy to say I wish I knew this and I
wish I did that you know I wish I
started investing when I was 18 I have
so much saved I wish I saved money and
it spend it at the strip club or
whatever you get with your money right
and it's easy to say that and you really
just have to take it with a grain of
salt because what the person you are
today is only because you were that
person before then so it's like yeah I
may feel that up until 25 I wasn't
necessarily making the best choices or I
wasn't you know I was more interested in
maybe dating then I was in you know
having a career or taking school
seriously or being productive investing
money whatever it may be those things
that are important to me now weren't
always important to me I wasn't always a
developer and I wasn't always coding
every weekend and working on my
technical skills and things like that
and you know I wish all manawa subs
YouTube so that's the very the intro to
a very fun segment that I called and
some of you I guess I have to even
preface this is how old I am
at 29 years old I'm given to that age
where if you're like one of the younger
viewers and you're like 13 14 15 you may
not even know what myspace is and that's
okay but before for the further for the
young ones in here
welcome and secondly what my faith is is
it is essentially a bootleg Facebook
where for us older gentlemen there will
be a man named Tom that we are very
familiar with Tom created Tom created
Facebook has sold it for 750 million
dollars or something like that and then
Facebook came along and I think I think
some global media agents they bought it
like fox or CNN or some right
and Facebook came around and basically
put my face out of business so I am
going to share with you the pictures
that are still on my facebook to this
day I've yet I've never actually gone
and deleted the facebook other than the
myspace account and I I just I came
across it searching for something in my
email and I happen to have a link to my
myspace so I logged in and we are going
to together see these pictures and see
what they're all about
I'm going to narrate to the best of my
ability
the history that goes along with each
one of these wonderful pictures alright
so let's go can we go full screen real
quick let's go full screen all right
we'll start in the beginning so this is
us shooting dice for like three dollars
in front of a in the back of a 7-eleven
on the way back from a dirt biking
contest it's fun stuff Matt just for fun
another picture from when your boy used
to actually do physical activity dirt
biking I believe I'm about 18 or 19 in
these photos we're at a little bit of a
house party here I'm in a chicken suit
uh I believe I was sick from that same
occasion same occasion this is my
brother and I'm on the Left my brothers
on the right than my dad's to the left
of my brother and then my grandfather
who has since passed
these photos are probably about 10 years
old so I'm I'm somewhere around there
more of the chicken suit this is
graduation day I think that might have
been the first time I ever wore tie I
really do let's zoom in a little bit
so that guy that was so long ago
let's see so sort of a party picture I'm
in the top right corner looking handsome
as can be
uh looks like I'm at a hookah bar here
and that didn't even look like me I
don't know um I like I'm diggin the
sideburns though I got maybe I gotta
bring those back um there's some sort of
picture I'm not sure who took this that
is the real mystery is who took this
photo
cuz that's me and that's my dad waking
up in the morning looking like death all
very classy photo of me playing poker so
sort of new deck this is Alicia Keys at
the writer so that my father is a writer
writes television Scripture he was she's
retired since then but they were on
strike for a while and I believe this is
that oh they said this was this was a
fun one um my good friend Ryan's mother
worked at a real estate company that had
season passes to two Laker games and so
they had four for every single game and
if the tickets went unclaimed no one
claimed these tickets we would four
hours before them get them for free and
go to the Lakers game so they'd be $140
tickets apiece and this was I believe
like the third row ah there so we're we
were pretty pretty good I am I'm did I'm
digging that haircut I think I look
better with a little bit more hair not
as much as my brother but same riders
field effect this is this is a throwback
right here
your boy looking like like a star like
was starvin Marvin Caucasian version
over here and the backwards hat I think
that might have been the last time I
ever wore a hat it looks like I am at a
casino here so I must be 21 this is oh
this is going back now so that you see
my lo here on some sort of chair I had
that's young Milo that's the young one
that is he's not the old caddy is this
is at a casino
Milo again I believe I I believe I was
interviewing at some
to Indian casino back when I was
apparently on my way that cousins way
alright so that's a funny story
I am I lost my sight I brought 50 bucks
a gamble on the way and I lost it and
then I had to asked my mom for gas money
it didn't go over as well as you might
think as to why they have gas money
um I am if anybody ever watched the show
this is I am God with Rob the DC got any
on I'm a character called Bobby light
here with the RICO dress up as the old
basketball player it looks like is this
from some sort of porn convention that a
adult convention that I went to with my
friend was like 20 more photos I think
there's one or two more pictures of that
that we're going to skip over this is
for a black and white Christmas party
that's a good party I like that party
ron jeremy from the the adult convention
as well as and this is my first
motorcycle there was a radio host called
tom Lycus who was very misogynistic that
i listened to at the time and got a lot
of my a lot of my lifestyle choices at
that time for my suppose and he had this
thing called flash friday
anyhow so this is my first motorcycle
this was the j kiyose piece of
whoever gets that anyone ever had it was
a 250cc
i got a save this thing i i'm never
going to come back on myspace so I got
saved some of these photos to just
remember the like is 101 bike I paid 800
bucks through this thing
oh man it was a blast that's my first
motorcycle more photos some sort of
Christmas tree sit here I think I think
we might have seen it yeah that's a
little trip down memory lane
um what so what I show that well one cuz
it's fun i I enjoyed it too I I want you
guys to understand that you saw that
that's probably about four years of my
life right there I would say for
probably about 18 to 22 or a little bit
after that that no matter where you are
in life
ize is it's never too late to start and
you may not be where you want to be but
you have to be glad where you are right
like I wanted to be farther along in my
career in my life at this age and that I
am now and I really it took these last
two years three years of me kind of
buckling down to get there and it yeah I
could I could worry I could think like
be down about you know I could
accomplish the things I wanted by now if
I started earlier or if I knew what I
knew now if I started a YouTube channel
in 2010 like you know all these
sort of things but you can't think like
that but I hope you enjoyed it I had fun
showing it to you it looked down memory
lane I can't even believe it's still up
to be honest with you um
who the uses MySpace
that's just that's just one of those
things where look man I know someone's
trying to do something with it but you
just got to shut it down bro you got to
throw in the towel myspace is done man
that that's the truth of the matter so
just shut it down and save all of us and
I hope you guys if you if you're if
you're old enough like myself to have on
my face I hope you go and check it out
to see your growth over the years
because I know I'm not the only one with
some up pictures and that's right
