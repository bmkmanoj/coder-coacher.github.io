vacation in the function section we'll
be resetting the code as we go here
already done it excuse me
so define a function called answer that
takes no arguments no def answer it
takes no arguments and it returns a
value of 42 I think that's it all right
all right so define a function called
hotel cost all right so it looks like
we're gonna be doing a little bit of
math here
with one argument nights so it's gonna
take how many nights or really Santa's
hotel the hotel costs under $40 for
night so the function of a hotel cost
should return 140 times nights so that
seems pretty straightforward now blow
your existing code to find function
plane plane ride cost so we need to find
how much our plane ride
I'm sure cost is gonna be now this is I
mean this is pretty may seem pretty
basic but I mean there's entire sites
devoted this it's like Expedia and kayak
which I recently used so takes this
string city so it's gonna take our city
and then it's going as input the
function should return a different price
all right so if city is equal equal to
Charlotte and you could probably
probably be best year to use a switch
statement but uh return 183 if City
Tampa
return g20 yes City go to Pittsburgh
oops
we wanted to return to they should be
Elsa elif's also because we only gonna
need one go to Los Angeles where I
reside for 75 because it's expensive as
 out here and do they have an else
statement doesn't look like they're
asking for an else statement okay all
right so let's see below your existing
code we're gonna find another function
are you gonna need a rental car some
people do with days as a parameter
I personally am going to Portland so I
would he used to add not getting a hotel
cause I'm staying at my brother's I
don't need a car because I'm hopefully
gonna be using his or his girlfriend's
so for me I would only need the plane
ride cost cool all right so uh rental
car cost is the argument called disc
appellate the cost of renting car
everyday it costs 40 so let's let's read
this over every day it costs 40 if you
rent the car for seven or more days to
get fifty off your total I'll turn into
the if you have the car for three or
more days you get twenty after total you
cannot get both of the above so let's do
it
shortest the longest so if days is less
than or equal to two was it fifty forty
dollars a day Total Return days times
forty
well if days is
greater than or equal to three or days
is less than or equal to six
we have a new range and we want to
return days this times 40
- 20 LF days is greater than 6 return
days times 40-50 all right you cannot
get both of the above discounts so I
believe that's it just like in the
example of your seven-day shake the
interesting me on the three day checking
out so soon
so see what's going on here oops don't
do it like this
let's return to 16 so the correct amount
234 seven days so let's see how they did
it here greater than equal to seven
still yeah that shouldn't matter
so if you're in the car for seven more
days you get this should work so we were
in it for seven days times for death -
80 - 50 there maybe my brain isn't
working but let's look here days of 7
times 40 to 80 - 50 equals 230 so it's
returning to 60
Oh
all right so it's returning to 60
so let's go ahead and look at the form
because in my head the logic works which
one was this this was four or seven
states greater than you go so rental
house
because
all right so let's check our indentation
if-else
so far everything seems to be working
just fine
so it may just be that they want us to
return write the if statement in the
proper way I don't think that's the
issue though
so jess is scarier than april 7
we took our clothes days
all right well let's go ahead and put in
what they want us to do here because it
looks like it looks like they want us to
start with if days is greater than or
equal to this sort of cost okay so let's
take out let's do it the other way I
don't like doing this because I think
our code works just fine but for
whatever reason we're getting an
incorrect value here so let's just go
ahead and cut this out we'll start with
if days is greater than equal to seven
return okay so we'll do it the way that
we saw in a couple examples cost equals
days times forty return and if it's
greater than that
cost is equal to cost minus fifty
returned cost I'll say LF days is less
than seven and this is greater than oh
did I do an or statement if I did or
State and that's why it doesn't work
because it might be it might be doing
the other value which would make sense
jaysus so it's less than seven and days
is greater than or equal to three
cost is equal to cost minus twenty right
return cost
else carrying cost alright there we go
basically I think that was our air I
think we used to or instead of an end I
don't remember but uh that was probably
it
alright so below the existing code
define a function called trip cost it
takes two parameters sitting in days so
def Jeff trip cost it's gonna take in
city there's no cop arenas and days like
the example above have your function
return the Sun with calling rental cars
days alright so we're just literally
going to be returning return I like
doing things in brackets you don't have
to so we need a I guess nights is gonna
be same hotel underscore cost nights or
days excuse me days plus
was the Nixon rental car cost plus
rental car cost
I'll all see these days here and then
plus we do hotel rental car and then we
have plane underscore ID underscore cost
and that's gonna take in the city just
come only valid to call the hotel nice
with variable days I justify Oh chip cos
sure
city coming days : a plenary cost is not
defined there we go so we're just
basically running all these functions
and we created a third function to
calculate them all together yeah that's
that's pretty much it right there all
right modify the trip cost function
definition add a third argument called
spending money so we're adding something
spending underscoring money and then
modify what the trip cost function does
add the variables spending money
all right so plus spending and there's
more money and on the last one after
your previous code print out the trip
costs to Los Angeles for five days and
the extra $600 of spending money
don't forget all right so we are going
to call trip cost and in it we need a
city we're going to Los Angeles and from
there we need days that's gonna be five
and our spending money's gonna be six
hundred so we want to print this out
and into indented there we go so our
total cost is gonna be 1955 for this
trip so a little bit of a you know
simple calculator for travelling and
stuff like that and very basic but I
mean as I mentioned before there's tons
of sites I gets millions and hundreds of
thousand views that does exactly this so
kind of cool stuff let's see what we're
gonna be doing next video we are going
to be messing around with lists and
array lists and stuff like that so see
you in the next video of our Python and
I appreciate any constructive criticism
or comments I really do appreciate
comments to motivates me to get in here
and keep on working on myself and making
video so
