popular demand we are starting the
advanced front-end projects from free
code camp first of all we're gonna get
started on here is to build a Pomodoro
clock we're gonna build exactly what
this looks like
we've hadn't started just so you can
gonna see it's a very basic thing maybe
down the road we'll add some like
animation but basically it just counts
down that's it and then when it goes
through the break it'll give us the
ability reset will fulfill all our user
stories so let's go ahead and get
started on this first thing to do go
ahead and open up code pin if you're not
ready not already there name your
project I'm gonna name this YouTube
Pomodoro o'clock I use jQuery so I'm
going to import jQuery I also use
bootstrap so I'm gonna how to import
that as well cool so how I normally like
to start this off is I like to import I
like to basically set the page up so
that's what we're gonna do here so first
thing that I set up was a div class I
did here this is just gonna be the
larger div well give it a class later
once we have some some context so what
we're gonna put in here and from within
here we're gonna add a h1 and we're just
gonna say build Pomodoro block / h1 so
and then we're gonna give it an h3 here
goes into a little little detail free
code camp
advanced and projects h3 pretty cool so
uh next thing I did was I set up a timer
time div now the time div is basically
just gonna store the buttons and the the
input for the session time so we'll go
ahead and said that give up the div
class this should probably be an ID
but for time being we'll just keep it
the same as my code it's always
interesting how much of your code you
see you can improve upon as you're
making a video so don't think that
you're like oh man only I write bad code
but uh just know that's part of the
process man you can always do things a
little bit better every time which is
why I kind of leave these open-ended so
the next thing I did was I credit h1 and
we're gonna give a lot of things IDs
because we're gonna hide a lot of these
and show a lot of these things so we'll
go ahead and start here and we're gonna
say ID title one and we'll just go ahead
and close this and this is just gonna be
our session time cool so this is
basically just gonna let everyone know
what it is that the buttons and our
adding and subtracting 2 so we have
accession time next we're just going
crazy
empty anchor tag here and this is going
to be the subtract button for the minus
5 minutes on the session time so we're
just gonna give this a bootstrap class
equal to VTN BTN - primary obviously if
you don't like the way this looks change
it I kind of use bootstrap so if you
don't know a lot about styling bootstrap
is a great resource and it gets you
familiar with something that a lot of
people are used so we actually needed
that to be a subtraction so excuse me
here so there's our - we gave an ID
because later on we're going to target
this ID and the next thing that we can
do here is we can go ahead and put the
number 5 now the way I ended up writing
my JavaScript was that we eventually
just change the value of this h2 that
we're going to at this point called give
an idea of num
probably want to come up with a better
ID and by default for testing purposes
we're just going to set this to five so
that we can test but you're going to
need to change this to twenty five down
the road
so go ahead close that so there's our h2
and now we have a we'll do the addition
here so we'll say let's see this was the
same thing as our subtraction we're
going to set up an empty hrf tag here
and we're gonna give it a class equal to
VTN BTN primary
don't we're getting that ID here of
minus five o'clock oops we need to swap
these trolex ctrl-v
well X
ctrl-v
all right and then we're gonna put a
plus sign on that so we're basically
going to the same thing that we just did
right now was what we have here so we
have our plus minus we're also going to
add a reset tatak now you didn't see
this in the intro of this video because
it's hidden right in right away but we
haven't gotten to that point yet
so say the same thing BTN BTN - primary
now this will be used later on to reset
the values so that if we wanted to run
our car mode or o´clock again you can
you can also have this going a loop I
decided not to go down that route I just
decided that I wanted to keep working I
would and I would just click reset
alright so here is our time div now that
we have that set up what we're gonna set
up next is a break dip class so actually
I set this one to an ID
and while we're at it we might as well
switch this class here to an ID we only
use it one time that would be better
practice let's go ahead and close our
div and at this time just save a little
bit of time we're gonna go ahead and
copy over since most of this is the same
skip the reset we're gonna copy the h1
the anchor tag h2 the other anchor tag
and then we're gonna change the values
so a session instead of session time
we're gonna have break time and set a
minus 5 o'clock we're gonna change that
to minus 5 break again you may want to
name these things a little bit better
than I did I kind of just named them
what first comes to mind we're gonna add
5 break as well and then this was break
no cool once we have that outside of the
div I created a start button this will
basically just start your anchor tag
start your your logic
so Larry start your Pomodoro clock
rather and what same thing I just used
BTN BTN - primary
and then I gave an ID equal to start
it's a lower case
with the text sorry alright let's say
that so we have everything set up in our
HTML right now doesn't look too pretty
in the next video what we'll do is look
at the CSS running and so that you can
see this so you can kind of see it
looking pretty before we get started
with the logic so we'll do that in next
video as always thanks for watching and
don't forget to Like and subscribe I'll
see you guys in the next video for
