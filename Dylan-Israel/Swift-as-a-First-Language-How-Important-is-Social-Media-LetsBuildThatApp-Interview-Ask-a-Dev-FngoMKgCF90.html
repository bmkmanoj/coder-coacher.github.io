with Brian from let's build that up
we're gonna be discussing what makes a
good first programming language
specifically is is Swift or a good
programming language to start off with
sort of the importance of social media
and we talked about various social
medias that we use and how they help us
as developers and and our YouTube
channels we also talked about trying to
try try to reach out to female
developers and capture that audience a
little bit of how can we connect because
I've said about 90% of my audience at
least is male and 10% female but there
are more female developers so we have
kind of a philosophical topic about
about how we've tried certain things and
some have succeeded Sommerfeld and then
in part 3 we will be discussing our
philosophical thoughts on traditional
education boot camps self-taught what
works for us and you know kind of dive
into that and for me personally I really
enjoyed that so I hope you guys check
that part out as well enjoy um in terms
of IO Susan in Swift I believe is the
the programming language um yeah so you
can see you'd see I'm very in in the iOS
communi have to ask that question right
now hundred percent sure right how is
Swift words out there it's it's it's
kind of crazy right so it's uh you know
it's like we need you to know these ten
languages all right I'll see what I can
do and I got two so how is Swift as a
I'm an aspiring developer in this in
that situation I want to pick up my
first programming language is Swift a
aid language that is a a good
entry-level language or should is there
something that you would recommend other
than that and maybe come back to it as
your secondary to start
right so this is a pretty common
question where it's really difficult to
decide so I think the the common the
deciding factor on whether or not a
language is good for your first language
it's just like three things the first
thing is accessibility like do you even
have a MacBook to use lift at all
because that's the easiest platform we
use it on and map books are expensive
you know people don't have that quirks
right if you have a MacBook then the
second thing is do you like iOS right if
you don't like iOS and don't use Swift
you're not gonna like it and then
thirdly do you find yourself enjoying
Xcode the ID the editor the IDE if those
three things are like yes yes and yes
then yeah you'll you'll find Swift to be
enjoyable otherwise you're gonna hate it
you're probably gonna find something
like even just JavaScript a lot easier
to learn because just you type out
something JavaScript and the even the
google the chrome console thing and you
can just execute it right away a lot
faster yeah I find that with learning
something new especially if you it is
your first language sometimes setup is a
very big barrier of entry and it doesn't
necessarily have to be but if you don't
have anybody kind of helped me out there
I could I could see how something where
like I could just open up the browser
and put console.log and I feel like a
coding god writing my first line of code
oh it's it's all about like what can you
get running like as quickly as possible
to verify that you know what the hell
are you doing if you can do that really
quickly then that's the language that
you just start with whatever that is
nice now where can obviously you have a
YouTube channel will link to that do you
have any other social media platforms so
people can follow and make sure they
stay up to date on what you're up to
yeah yeah so I have a Twitter handle
which is at built that app and then I
have this Facebook page that you can
join if if you're into my channel
I've always debated whether or not to
start like a Instagram things I've no
idea what am I gonna post myself that's
you know it's funny that you say that
cuz that's something that I've thought
about as well cuz people have asked me
hey do you have an Instagram and I kind
of a personal one but I I don't upload
on it really all that often and I can
tell you right now I will never get a
snapchat I don't understand it but uh
it's a it's all those things are like I
feel like I showed like it's makes a
smart business decision but it doesn't
make a smart like is it gonna be a pain
in my ass decision and like this that's
something that I'm debating at the same
time so yeah yeah I totally get that too
like I so I'm assuming that we both have
a ranking of all the social platforms
that are most productive and provide us
with the most value like in terms of
investment so for me it's probably like
the Facebook group and then Twitter and
then I have the LinkedIn trailing of the
very last then and sometimes I don't
even put them LinkedIn even though it's
like it's not that bad no how do you how
do you because I thought about posting
on LinkedIn maybe some videos of me
talking about things that I think are
appropriate to talk on LinkedIn but I'm
kind of hesitant I never have what do
you find that you get that people you
know it helps and people are watching or
commenting on them how what is sort of
the engagement in your experience yeah
so each one of those LinkedIn posts that
I put up they get about like 1500 views
just on LinkedIn it's hard to determine
how many of those views convert into
YouTube views but those are the insights
that LinkedIn the platform gives you so
it's better than nothing and for the
most part because they're not working
for anyone like I don't have an employer
I don't have to worry about I was my
employee gonna
gonna come come to me and ask me why I'm
putting this up I can see how if you're
working for someone that it becomes a
kind of a gray area there yeah there's
there's a lot of it'sit's interesting
thing where people I I just did a video
about this and P is actually my most
disliked video of all time maybe people
don't necessarily agree but I basically
the the point of the I was talking about
the Google engineer that got fired in
the point I was trying to get across was
that what you put out into the world can
have real-world consequences regardless
if you agree with it or not that every
company is going to say that you know
your social media is a representation of
the company's gonna be writing your
contract or get fired because of it
and so I I've said that in numerous
occasions that I never put a video out
that I wouldn't feel comfortable sitting
next to the CEO of the company and
watching and sometimes I think I've
recorded several videos and ivory watch
every video I put out before I actually
put it out and then I've there's been
about five where I was like you know
what I don't think I can put this out
into the world this because it's a it's
a it's a sort of uh you gotta balance
the the pros and the cons of it but it's
an interesting position to be in
yeah I think I've watched her video the
most risque what I would say would be
the could babe one could but yes that
was something i I I was debated about
but I felt like it had to be done in the
name of like good could in the in the
name of of I've in the name of just
something that shouldn't even exist look
like this is just something I there's
there's a platform for that somewhere
it's just not on YouTube I baby so no
trying to say yeah I'm yeah I think I
agreed with it
I agreed with it all of your points
except for the fact that these things
they have to exist they have to exist
just to prove that it's something that
should happen or should not happen just
just to validate itself these things
should show up every now and then
yeah I can agree with that where you
know you kind of have this sort of
standout sort of outlier where you
they're like that's what not to do you
know like a good thing I I can
understand that in they're always going
to exist you know there's a lot of
things in that that we wish didn't but
they will and this is I guess a very
limited case of not trying to come off
too salty as a coding channel let's do
much better than my own so it's I think
we've both just kind of like on a on a
separate tangent on that that video like
we've always come upon these really
quick of baby videos and I myself I've I
mean we probably fall in the same boat
in terms of like female audience
engagement and I'm always trying to find
out how I can reach out to more females
in my target audience and if I had like
a female on my channel doing coding I
feel like I could somehow latch on to
that female audience but then at the
same time I don't want to use her just
for like her her looks and try to get
the audience that way but there's really
no other way other than doing that I
haven't figured it out either I've
actually reached out to girls who code
and a couple like language because I you
know I don't know your analytics are but
88% of my audience is male and 12% is
female and I'm sure there's more female
developers out there so how can i how
can I reach out to them one thing I
tried to do was I reached out to a
couple of coding organizations that were
targeted at females so I okay let me let
me interview some of these people let me
try to set something up and not one got
back to me so I don't know they're like
that's the enemy I don't know it's where
the enemy I feel like it's because it
just comes off creepy no matter how you
do it I haven't figured out how to slide
into that zone or it's like oh hey I
have a video channel do you want to come
up something and we can videotape it
together it's just weird yeah I I mean I
think the I bet if I went back and
looked at my analyse so after like 30
days I was try and teach my girlfriend
how to code and I bet if I looked at the
analytics at that because I've had
several female subscribers tell me that
is how they found my channel and
coincident it could just be a
coincidence but I bet if I went back and
looked at that that maybe that was
something where they could relate a
little bit more to what she was
struggling with than that having a maybe
a female perspective in in this software
conversation help so it is I just I
haven't figured out the goal because
there it really is it the other day
there's there has to be an audience and
it's just smart business kind of reach
up and you know we want I want everybody
learn to code not just a bunch of dudes
right yeah yeah and I just recently got
back from this jangaiah trip where I
talked Shanghai kids out of code and
there's bunch of high school students
but I think about 60 to 65 percent of
the students out of 30 students were
female students and this is the trend
that will keep seeing we'll see more and
more females join and and we have to
figure out how to how to how to get
better at engaging that audience yeah I
was just gonna get super buff and just
hope my my charm and good looks attracts
and I uh the last thing I need is my
girlfriend yelling at the Commodore so
they just writing nasty comments on
multiple accounts yeah it's yeah I don't
know what the secret is but I just feel
like as dudes as guys that code we
understand like exactly why we code and
we have like this vision as to if I put
this out there we're just going to
engage the male audience but it's like
we I mean I personally maybe you might
not agree with this but like make up
channels make up tutorials like I have
you know my own opinion on why if those
are like useful videos at all
and I you know I personally think there
are way
time but obviously to women and they're
not right so there's something there
that we have to target yeah III don't
understand them either but I can tell
you I know my girlfriend watches a shit
ton of them so they're doing something
right and they're making money man those
makeup channels like there's it's yeah
it's it's crazy to think how much money
they actually may make selling makeup
yeah yeah you know what's the strange
phenomenon that I see these days that
make up stories like little girls will
just go to L'Oreal or Sephora and
they'll pull out their phones and watch
the literally watched the videos wow
they're picking out what lipstick or
mascara to buy right now it's it's so I
guess thanks for watching the video if
you happen to be looking for a boot camp
I couldn't recommend dev Mountain any
higher they also include housing with
their tuition so you can get up and go
and get started right away thanks again
for watching and I'll see you guys in
the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
