in manage packages with NPM we are doing
let's see here I believe it's just tag
removal yes so we're in this tag removal
almost done with this section going
piece by piece so my hands are a little
wet just the dishes real quick so now
we've had a dish tiger - let's clean
things up you can't remove is the latest
that's because every package has the
latest tag by default but you can't
change the latest so let's delete all
the tags that we can appoint laces the
other so I believe if I remember
correctly if we do NPM diss - diss - tag
and PM we only have one dish that we
have like this so what we want to do is
actually move that disk tag the latest
one to OS was NPM just - tag LS look so
you'll see right now we have latest and
we have tests so the first thing we need
to do is remove tests the way that we do
that it was a dist bash tag or NPM disk
tag so now I know we're messing around
with this ax we didn't need to say where
we were moving that that's at CT 360 /c
- 360 yours maybe at whatever your user
name is slash your work space now from
here we're gonna do something a little
bit different we're not gonna include
the version number to remove it excuse
me I forgot to do it's just sack RM
remove at the location 60 and then the
tag which in this case is test and
you'll see right here this - showcasing
that it just got removed now if you're
you're not a believer we can do and you
can go ahead and just a double check and
read it which by the way I double check
 all the time I know with 99.9%
accuracy that it worked
and just because I you don't want to be
I don't know just because I'm paranoid I
guess so you see that we have the latest
attack so we only have one district now
how do we actually move that it's
similar to just adding there can only be
one one dis tag right so instead what we
want to do is NPM dis tag add and then
we're gonna name the package at CT 360
/cg 360 now at instead of going to our
current version we're gonna go back to
the old version and we're gonna put the
tag of latest and you'll see now when we
go dis and PM dis tagged LS we can see
that it worked just fine so NPM this -
tag LS you'll see one point 0.0 and so
it's now in the old version so now we go
to how - to - verify or how - - - NPM
verify we gets that we're done so what
do we need to take away from this well
we need to take away the fact that we
can add disc tags which we learned last
time but we can add if we have a disc
tag such as latest we can add to move it
we just need to add it elsewhere we also
know how to remove and then we also know
how to list all of our disc techs so
I'll keep that in mind when you're
working with these disc tags as always
