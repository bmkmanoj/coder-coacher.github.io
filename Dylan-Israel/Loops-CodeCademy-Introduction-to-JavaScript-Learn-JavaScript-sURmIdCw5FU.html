back in code Academy and we're in
introduction to JavaScript arrays and
loops loops now what are loops for those
of you that don't know it's basically
talking about for loops and while loops
and things that will iterate through
time and time again until a condition is
met and then it will stop looping
through that so it's gonna jump right in
it'll make more sense if you're new to
programming to see it in action
so you'll see right here we have a for
loop the typical for loop takes in a
iterator that's going to go up to a
certain number and then a statement to
compare it to so while I is greater than
or equal to zero we want to decrement
downwards just go ahead and write a
creative writing array called vacations
license that lists three places we'd
like to visit write in a rate set it
equal to a variable named vacation so
this is already oh all right so let's go
ahead and run this I'd love it love to
visit one two and three so instead they
just want us to change our thing here
but you'll see that it er ated out three
times so one two and three as we have in
here next separate line to do this
decision property access next console
dot log each item a vacation let's go
ahead and change this to maybe Callie
for Nia let's change these estates will
do New York although I have no
interesting guy in New York sorry guys
and I'll probably go eventually
and then Florida where my new job is
that next console like each items on a
separate line okay so
I think this is basically just to show
us how we would have to do this three
separate times when we could just do it
with a single for them log and then
we'll do vacation spots index zero
vacation spots index 1 and finally
vacation spots index 2 gonna run that so
you'll see that we're console.log in
this out unfortunately it looks like
it's a it's a get across what the for
loop is really there so you'll see right
here this sets the start that condition
so this is our iterator we're setting it
at 0 typically stop the condition we're
saying look while our iterator is less
than the length continue doing this
until this statement is no longer true
and then iterate up each each time I
plus plus you can this could be anything
but typically if you're going one after
the other up its I plus plus or
iterating whatever your iterator is plus
plus now let's go ahead and dive in a
little bit more let's replace your
current code with a loop write a for
loop that through okay so it looks like
we're gonna get rid of these consoles
and we're gonna create a for loop we'll
go ahead and save our we'll use a
different one for J is equal to 0 while
J is less than the vacation array
vacation spots array dot length remember
that minus 1 J plus plus and then we
want to console log out that value so
you just want to go ahead and it looks
like in our second step they want us to
add some stuff I plan to visit
and then put vacation spots and then the
current item that we're iterating on
just going around that
just gonna get rid of
why is this returning to fun so it's
good to get rid of this for loop let's
for write a for loop that loops through
your vacation spots array maybe they
wanted us to use an eye I'm not quite
sure
oh I see what happened here uh put an
eye in here so just go ahead and run
that J so that I isn't defined in our
local scope which is why it didn't work
which is why now that's working let's
see maybe they want us to do it exactly
like so that's fine I'll go ahead and
put that in there and then we'll get rid
of this because we no longer need it
I'm not quite sure why this is saying
this isn't working
let's go change this to the eye and see
if that's one of the issues that we're
having here
huh well
let's try this first maybe they just
want us to put out the value like so we
skipped a step if so my my apologies and
it looks like that's actually what they
want us to do so now they want us to add
some more content a little bit of a
instruction issue here I personally
think you should be able to go step by
step or all at once when you run your
code but hey is what it is so we need to
make three changes to our for loop edit
the start condition this is our VAR I
equals their 0 and then we want to equal
the length of the array so we want to
instead change this to the vacation
spots dot length and instead we want
actually go backwards run go Florida in
New York California how do we do that
we're gonna decrement downwards so this
is gonna change and we're just gonna
change this to a zero weight let's see
what they and start going to say that's
a stop condition equal to vacation spot
length finally change I plus plus 2i
minus minus ok so they just wants to
they don't care about us good they just
want us to go backwards work our way
down oh whoops I see that in the
instructions I thought we had to change
this so instead we're just gonna change
I is greater than or equal to the 0
because we're starting at 3 we're gonna
go 3 2 1
BAM then we get undefined here why does
this happen it's because we did a
greater than or equal to and it's gonna
continue printing this out undefined so
instead of the length we're gonna go
ahead and do minus 1 because remember we
started the 0 index but length is always
greater than the last index spot which
I'm glad they actually bring this up
because it's a common gotcha for new
programmers who are having issues we're
going to write this program for scratch
start writing in the variable called my
places all right
so we'll do var my places and we'll set
this equal to we'll do 3 an array of
three places we'll do three places in
Florida we will do st. Petersburg we
will do Tampa Tampa and then we will do
what's another city in Florida there is
Jacksonville I apologize
it's anyone if I spelt these wrong I may
have done that now we're gonna make
another variable
I study equal to an array with three
places a friend might want to go so
let's call our friend places first input
will be the friend zone kind of a joke
the friend zone
second place is out of the friend zone
and third one is third base make sure at
least one your place the same as my
place is right all right so we'll put
Tampa because one of these has to be the
same it's gonna run that real quick
cool now that what now we're gonna go
ahead and write a for loop that iterates
through each of my places and logs out
each place so we'll just start at zero
no need to go backwards or make it more
complicated this is kind of the standard
way
so we'll do while it's less than my
places dot length I plus plus and then
we'll console dot log out my place is
high let's go ahead and run then we
should get st. Peterburg
Tampa and Jacksonville like so now we
want to go inside the existing four loop
so now we're gonna do a loop within a
loop we'll use J this time so all right
so we'll do a for loop here bar J is
equal to 0 while J is less than friend
places array dot length J plus plus and
just actually chose to do anything in
there in this first bit of code
Oh friend places there we go
apparently they wants to console dot log
I assume they did I was trying to follow
the instructions since the key so friend
places and in this instance we're gonna
iterate using the J operator so what's
gonna happen now is for every iteration
of I we're gonna run through the entire
four loop of our nested loop so we're
actually gonna get the output three
times for J so you'll see st. Peters
friend zone out of friendzone Tampa
Tampa the friend zone out of the friend
zone Tampa like so so instead of console
dot logging this out we're then gonna
we're gonna use some of our operators or
not our operators excuse me
we're gonna use some of our control
flows that we learned that it's going to
allow us using the comparison operator
to print out some stuff so the purpose
is we're going to see whether your
friend haven't Commons utilize what's an
if-else statement so in here we're gonna
say look if the my place is I is ever if
the item if the index in the my places
array is ever exactly equal to the index
we're checking in the friend places
array we want to do some stuff so that's
that's our logic there front else do
some other stuff so inside the second
formula Brennan field soon
it is like the console places so here we
want to console dot log and we can do
let's see in common
it doesn't really matter which one we do
as they are both the same in this logic
here if I don't think we need this else
it's going around that so it looks like
we have in common here Tampa as you can
see with our logic cool we're still
logging out everything in the original
array now we did a lot of great for
loops now there is also the wall loop
let's go ahead and start fresh so we're
gonna create a variable called cards and
we're gonna study equal to the array
with diamond spade heart and Club the
four suits of a deck of cards
now we're gonna create a current card
variable
and we're gonna set it equal to the
string heart or the suit heart this is
taking so long to run
so I'd only get too far ahead why this
is running Oh
let's see did we get a syntax error so
lark arts diamond spade heart club
alright sure this one more time there we
go and then we'll go ahead and put this
back so this is gonna be the variable I
believe we're checking for in our while
loop in a second so now we're gonna do a
while loop while loops you have to set
specific conditions to break the loop so
you're basically saying wow this is not
the case and again it goes into detail
while the condition keep running the
loop so it's not like an array way you
know oh well I'm gonna keep checking
target to the end of the rail run the
for loop till the end of the array well
loop you could indefinitely go on if you
don't set a break condition properly so
do you think well the current card is
not if the current card he's not astray
then come for the log the value of
current card so wall current card is not
equal equal to Spade run our while loop
there you go here and then we want to do
an if statement is if current card it's
not equal to a spade we want to do some
stuff what is it that we want to do we
want to console.log current card
remember our current card is gonna
probably reset here then create a random
number between 0 &amp;amp; 3 so if you don't
remember how this works we can go ahead
and at the bottom of here we'll do it
VAR current excuse me we'll say var
random number is equal to the math dot
random and then we're getting times it
by 3 because we want something between 0
&amp;amp; 3 and now what we want to do is we
then want to reassign the current card
value with that random number so we're
gonna say current card is equal to the
cards array on that random number no
let's go ahead and cool so everything
looks pretty cool oh excuse me we need
to do math off floor forgot about that
so remember this is going to well we
actually have to do it because it goes
between 0 &amp;amp; 1 we then need to times it
by 4 if we want to get between 1 &amp;amp; 3 so
we're gonna map that floor this excuse
my my simplicity errors here and then
we're gonna go ahead and run it for the
time being so we get heart and then we
get diamond and then it looks like we
got spades so the loop breaks and then
we're just gonna console that lock
outside of here
Spade found so basically you need to set
a something that's gonna break this
while loop condition or I'll run
indefinitely you'll probably crash your
browser or something and then you'll
have some issues so what did we learn
this lesson with the introduction of
JavaScript we learned for loops we
learned that you can start at zero and
work your way up we also learned that
you could start at add a higher number
and work your way down to we learned how
those work we learned that you can do
for loops within for loops that are
going to iterate through one and then
all of them and then keep on going and
then we learned about while loops and
setting conditions to break the wall
loop what's in the wall loop so all
these are definitely the building blocks
of JavaScript in any programming
language get very comfortable with it
and my suggestion to you is if you're
struggling with this do it this took
about 19 minutes so do it once yourself
watch her with my video next day go back
and do it again and it'll start clicking
you just keep doing it so as always guys
thanks for watching keep up the good
work don't forget to Like subscribe and
share and support me on patreon I
appreciate a ton and good luck thanks
for watching the video special thanks to
our sponsor dev Mountain definitely
check them out at dev Mountain com if
you're looking for a boot camp that's in
front-end development iOS or UX go ahead
and give them a shot tuition includes
housing so you can get up and go and
fully immerse yourself in the program as
always thanks for watching I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
