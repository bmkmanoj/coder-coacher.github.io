fights doing avoid obstacles in the
island of knowledge of the intersection
so what are we tasked with well we're
trying to find out how many jumps or
what is the correct number so that we
can jump the numbers in the array
without hitting any of them so we have
an array that's three five six seven
nine and we can jump four is the
shortest jump that we can get through
now that that is our task we get our
array so what I did was I sorted the
array and then I checked to make sure
that for every element that you modulo
it by the current the current value of I
that it doesn't hit if you do that if it
doesn't equal zero meaning like for
instance for all these numbers module
four isn't zero and the reason for it is
and that's what that's why it can they
can continue to jump so that's what I
did now let's go ahead and continue with
the example here so first thing first in
order for that to work I said doesn't
have to be sorted sorted it originally
you know what it doesn't have to be
sorry I just originally I sorted it so
it made more sense like this I don't
think I have to sort it
we'll find out them so we'll skip to the
second thing second alright so a second
thing second will create what I call the
last oh I tell you back now I do I do
have to do it alright so input it where
it's sorted and this is going to be just
certain numerically and an A and a B and
we're going to return Amen speech are
cool and so it's sorted now or in for
the race circuit the next thing we need
to do is we need to find out what the
largest value of the array is and that's
the reason we have to sort it we have to
make sure that this nine in this case it
is but this nine is the census the
largest is the last value and we just do
that by sorting it and then we can just
set choose the highest value there's
other ways we can do that but but uh
that's how I did him this one I'm sure I
could done something max and got the
value well we will redouble that later
so anyhow we'll do a bar last a rave out
and this is because we sorted it it's
going to be equal to the input array and
then input array dot length minus one
all right so now we have the largest
value the reason we need that is we have
our for loop which we start at one
and then we are saying well I is less
than or equal to the last array valve
plus one the plus one is there in case
all the VAT like say because one two
three four five we need it there isn't a
number that you can jump from from zero
on for that so the number that you
actually need to jump it's six which is
one more than the largest array value so
that's where the plus one comes in and
plus plus now here we have an if
statement says if our array this is
where we check for the module function
if every call in in here for the element
the element is the index that we're
passing so if if the fact is that is not
true meaning that in here for every
function and one do this is still our
histogram if that's true meaning that
every element I'm looking at what I'm
highlighting something on my tax letter
I apologize so if every element here
let's go ahead and set that up there we
go so if if every element
and the statement is here if return
elements moduli not equal to zero now so
if any of these are equally divided to
zero scattered false we need it needs to
be every element so if that's false
nothing happens but if it's true we
found our number which is the value of I
which in this case would be four is
going to run our tests and submit it and
just going through this I think there's
probably a couple things I could have
done better like this part right here
but you know as I work through these
things you start seeing errors in your
logic and stuff like that but as always
guys I hope that you share your your
your solution so that I can learn and
other people can learn from it so I'm
sure they're different and better and
all that sort of great stuff so don't
forget to join our Facebook group code
tech and caffeine and our discord
channel and if you can't support me on
patreon it really helps a lot and I will
see you guys in the next video thank you
so much for watching
hey guys thanks for watching the video
especially thanks to our sponsors dev
Mountain if you look for a coding boot
camp where tuition and housing is
included definitely check them out
appreciate it and I'll see you guys in
the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
