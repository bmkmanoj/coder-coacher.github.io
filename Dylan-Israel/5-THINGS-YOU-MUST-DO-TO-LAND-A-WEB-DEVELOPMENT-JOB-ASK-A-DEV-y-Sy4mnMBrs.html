five things that you must do in
2017-2018 to get a job in web
development this isn't going to be so
much on skills there's a separate video
for that this is about the stuff that
you should already be doing if you're
not you're really putting yourself at a
disadvantage when it comes to the job
searching and landing that web
development software job before we get
started I just want to do a little quick
shout out to this lambda tech job for
dummies humbled by model will be a link
in the description right now a lot of
things that we're gonna be talking about
you're gonna find little bits and pieces
from these books so for a dollar you can
get how to land your dream career
resumes job search productivity you get
all those ebooks for a dollar for eight
dollars or more you get how to get a
coding job personal branding job
interviews job searching social media
and then all the way up to $15 you get
all the other stuff plus coding with
JavaScript and getting a web development
job just some great resources that are
only available for about the next two
weeks and you can decide if you want to
give all your money to me which is dope
do that no I or if you want to go ahead
and give it all to charity right or to
the publisher it's all up to you just
one quick thing I wanted to say so the
first and foremost if you don't already
have a github account you need to get
yourself tip number one is gonna github
right
and you're saying okay Dylan well if
people have told me this and I just
don't know what to put on your github
well the easiest thing it try to upload
to it frequently right you can see here
I was in sort of job search mode I
started uploading it to it more
frequently you don't need to do everyday
obviously that it's great but start
working on projects with other people
start working on your own projects and
just committing them and at the very
least if you don't have anything to
commit what you can commit are the
algorithms for free code camp from code
fights you'll notice in my code fight
section here granted I only actually
uploaded them two or three times but I
have in here tons and tons of algorithms
on here so if I took the effort of doing
one algorithm a day I go ahead and push
that to my github why are we what's
so not only what you should do but why
should you do it well it's actually one
of the very few ways that you can prove
to a company especially when you're
landing that junior role you don't have
any really relevant work experience that
you're actually coding they're not just
gonna take your word for it that's why
we have things like technical interviews
and take home projects and things like
that but here you can say look this
person is actually writing code and even
if it's just algorithms they can see it
and work through it and see okay where
is this person at right now in their
learning process so get yourself a
github account put it on your resume and
link to it put all your projects on
there and some people are concerned
about hey well I'm concerned because I
started my github right when I was on
there and all the stuff I have is
dogshit
that's okay you know it's better than
you know it's worse than dog shit no
shit alright so it's a get it on there
start pushing to your github and start
having an active github account this is
really what you're gonna need to have on
there all right the next thing that
you're gonna need tip number two
yourself a website if you don't already
have some sort of portfolio site this is
what I use for my youtube channel
you got really doing yourself a
disservice what's the point of your
website well one it's a little bit of
personal branding you can go to say say
I wanted to have Dylan eat cereal calm
that was available that would probably
be a pretty good name for me so find
something with your name in it or
something else in my case I have a
youtube channel it's one of my main
selling points so I just have this on
here I have various aspects of it I it's
a cool it's a cool thing because it can
actually be one of your portfolio
projects right this is the very first
thing that I ever built in angularjs and
it helped me land in angularjs role I
built it from start to finish various
things hooked up to it filters
controllers HTTP services pulls from the
YouTube API right all this sort of stuff
so make it make it nice make it look
well and have your projects on it not
only have your projects on your kiddo
but have working projects on your
portfolio site you can get you can go on
sites like GoDaddy and by URL for about
$10 a year and hosting for about three
four or five
a month you're not gonna need a lot of
hosting have it there have a portfolio
site where people can go and see your
projects and work through them not only
look through the code but actually
actually click through what development
is a very visual thing you need to be
able to see that right and it doesn't
you know it doesn't have to take up two
years of your life building this site
right I built this in about a week and a
half right it's not the not my best work
ever but it is something that people can
go and see okay well this is what this
guy built out an angularjs and yes some
skill and you know go from there and the
grand this is a year old I want to
update it and I want to actually put all
my projects on here for potential
employers to click through but it is
better than nothing you should
definitely have a online personal
portfolio in my case it is a it is just
a YouTube portfolio but it also sells
that point now more than anything else
have a side project this is tip number
three and probably the most important
tip especially if you're a junior
developer trying to get your foot into
the door the the worst thing you can do
is not be unique that's the absolute
worst thing you can do when senior
developers and you know architects are
looking to hire developers what they
want is a cop they want a couple things
they want someone who's passionate about
it always learning and somebody who can
code and if you're passionate always
learning they'll even be ok if you can
kind of code
right so what are some projects my side
project is YouTube I have a couple
others but that's my main one you can
maybe start a YouTube channel I'm
building a course about how to create a
coding channel and why you should and
all the resources available for you you
can also create a blog you can create by
the way look how much of a heifer I look
in in that motel 6 yeah so you can
create a blog you can host a meet-up all
these sort of things that are going to
make you unique as a candidate too so
that you stand out and that you show
that you're passionate and always
learning and that is the importance of a
side project and if you can't make some
money off it you know get some it's some
personal branding right
one of those books we saw was about
personal branding this is personal
branding and your blog your YouTube
channel your book that you're writing
whatever it is find what you enjoy and
start a side project in it and plan to
continue it long term even after you
land that land that role and benefit
from it right financially or career-wise
so site project is probably the most
important of all five tips in my opinion
for standing out that's really what you
want to do when you're applying for
these roles and getting roles and
getting callbacks is how do you stand
out and side projects side projects side
projects number four get a LinkedIn not
only get a LinkedIn do something with
your Linkedin make it stand out have a
background header image have an image
have information in your in your in your
description here actually have it filled
out have details in here have media
you'll see in here I have an angularjs
project interviews back-end API projects
a certificate of from volunteering
another great thing that you can do to
make yourself stand out volunteer when
you're filling out your experience
section be as detailed as you can be
bullet points are use great on your
resume also in your LinkedIn showcase
what skills and technologies you are
using because a lot of times when you're
interviewing not only will they have
your resume they'll also go to your
LinkedIn and the people who are
interviewing you and submitting your
resume a lot of times they're just
recruiters they're not the most
technical people all they're looking for
our check boxes they're like can I check
this box can I check this box can I
check this box can I check this box
I'll give you a perfect example I used
to put version control down as a skill
set and what that means is I can use git
github tortoise SVN whatever it is but I
stuck to a recruiter and they would
always ask me if I had kid I said well I
put version control and to them that's
not the same thing so I had to take off
version control and put get on there and
I started getting more callbacks and
that's one thing I learned from these
recruiters who didn't know that git was
a form aversion our version control was
a form of git was a form of version
control so have detailed description
included media if you can write your
projects or if you have a cover letter
or accessory if you have a letter of
recommendation from all my work places I
have a letter of recommendation from my
bosses included on here right includes
education right on here free code camp
front-end developer certificate break it
down don't just put it on there a lot of
people don't even know a free code camp
is and it's up to you to sell them put
it put some media in there you'll see
here I say this is broken up into ten
basic intermediate advanced projects as
well 16 algorithms 21 intermediate 5
advanced sell them on it talk about what
skills that it's working on 500 hours
estimated coursework include all your
certifications volunteer experience
another thing that you can not only do
some good in the world but you can also
make yourself unique I've volunteers
through code org whenever they call me
which has been about three times in the
last two years and our if code is coming
up so I include I encourage you if you
can to go to code org and sign up there
include volunteer experience that makes
you stand out it's all about standing
out it's all about being passionate
enjoying this standing out through that
to really get noticed same thing with
your skills go ahead and throw that in
there any courses you have fill all this
out a lot of people don't they just
offer I've a LinkedIn I have zero
friends but I have a LinkedIn so that
box is checked no we need more than that
we need you to go fill out showcase all
this information your LinkedIn is
basically everything you couldn't fit on
your resume LinkedIn more details about
this stuff on your resume LinkedIn right
you can see right here have publications
you can see right here I have honors and
awards projects I should definitely have
more projects on here than I have but
this is at least you have a project
section you can see it on there and I
thought I give a description definitely
put descriptions write your tube is a
hackathon project I worked on you know
fill out your LinkedIn don't just have a
LinkedIn fill it out imagine it's your
resume and that you're handing it to
someone who may or may not give you a
job you really need have your LinkedIn
and that brings us to our fifth and
final point which is have a decent
resume and what do I mean by that
well play to your strengths write my
resume now that I have work experience
is very different than my resume when I
didn't have work experience so my my
weak point at objectively is I don't
have a degree that's that's objectively
my weak point I don't have a bootcamp
other than the the free free code camp
the front end certificate so my
education goes on the bottom along with
my volunteer experience which is really
just there to make me sound in an
interesting candidate and now more so my
work experience goes up but that's not
how it always used to be my personal
projects I had like seven personal
projects on here because that was what I
needed to sell me as a potential
candidate and it was right here where my
work experiences and technical skills
was right there as well and the reason
for that is again it goes back to having
a nice clean resume where that recruiter
can just check off what skills you have
what and see what skills you don't so
get it nice front and center
play to your strengths right one of the
things I did with the mentoring session
was someone handed in a three-page
resume to me asked me to review it first
off 99% of the time you're gonna want a
one-page resume 99% of the time it's
gonna need to be organized it's gonna
need to have a lot of information on
there but you can fit it on one page you
can see right here I have a lot of stuff
going on here I got education volunteer
experience I have three different jobs
with you know six or seven bullet points
on this first one description of the job
all my skills personal projects with
bullet points and I have a whole section
here of where my github is so they can
see that I actually code my LinkedIn so
they can get more details my portfolio
ever my website right there as well as
the section saying willing to relocate
because sometimes if you're applying for
jobs they just if you're in a different
state they're gonna throw it out the
window right so you're gonna want to put
that in there somewhere now some people
will disagree about whether or not you
should have a description on your on
your portfolio as well as a photo so a
description I'm kind of iffy on it I
can't really tell you one way or the
other but I'm very Paul I'm very Pro
having a photo on your resume
take a nice clean-cut photo of yourself
looking professional showcasing that you
are a real person make it hard
for them to Trina you see they put a
face with the resume you're not just
another person you're you're an
applicant that they you want them to
remember that's why I include a photo on
there to show that hey at least one time
in this photo
your boy wore a tie and looking
professional right you didn't just have
his Starcraft gaming t-shirt on so
organize your resume in a way that's
clear easy to stand and it's in
achievements and tasks this is really
crucial especially when you're just
starting out you want to really focus on
what you did not necessarily what your
job entail but milestones of your job
right so you can see here I have six
ones talking about what I built
gathering requirements refactoring code
first or an application periodic code
review and mentoring the other
developers things like that things that
are bullet points of tasks achievements
personal projects again personal
projects and you put them on your resume
don't let this be something I said after
the fact you want it to be front and
center and volunteer experience another
great thing to show that you're you're
very passionate about this and always
learning so those are my five tips and
very practical ones that you guys can
really implement today maybe not the
side-project one you can get started on
it today but it's not really gonna be
there completed and or in a in a state
to be shown for quite some time but I
really encourage you guys to if you're
not doing all five of these things
you're really gonna have a trouble
landing a role in today's world have a
good resume have a good LinkedIn have a
github that you're pushing to have a
side project and I forgot what the other
one was right now but you guys watch the
video you know so uh really just keep on
pushing forward guys oh and a portfolio
site excuse me that's number five
portfolio site but these are the things
that you really are going to need
especially as a junior developer or
someone trying to be a junior developer
if you're not you're you're just
shooting yourself in the foot because
everybody who does have this they're
going to be more sought-after they're
gonna be more looked after and
especially if you're self-taught
developer like myself you're going
want you're gonna need this you're gonna
need this to help walk you through the
door and sell yourself so if you take
advantage of this and again if you're
interested in those books there'll be a
link in the description so that you can
read up on some other resources
sometimes it only takes one or two bits
of information from a book to really
push you over the edge and I hope these
five tips if you're not already doing
them or if you learn one thing from it I
hope it helps you lay in that role so as
always guys thank you so much for
watching the video don't forget to
comment like subscribe and share these
are my 5 tips for how to actually get a
job in what development if you aren't
already right I'll see you next time bye
guys thanks for watching the video if
you happen to be looking for a boot camp
I couldn't recommend dev Mountain any
higher they also include housing with
their tuition so you can get up and go
