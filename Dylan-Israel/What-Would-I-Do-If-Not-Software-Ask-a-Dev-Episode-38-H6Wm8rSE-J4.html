about an interesting sort of
hypothetical but not really question of
what I would do if it wasn't software
now my immediate choices are and I can't
have a couple answers to this so it's
just a straight black and white answer
the reason for that is before when I was
a young lad young lad mean like 15 14 16
what direction I thought I was going to
be going in was journalism there's a lot
of reasons for that and one of them was
that I was you know my father was a
writer I haven't talked too much about
what my dad does Lee here's writers
written television scripts and things
like that and so he was very supportive
of that and it was something he got in
kanji young man you try to go in the
direction your father does on occasion
and too successful and I wanted to kind
of follow in those footsteps so that
would be my first like oh that would be
one possible direction and I I worked at
a data center called Quadra net in Los
Angeles for a while where I actually
wrote tech blogs for them to try and you
know get views and things like that and
so what's the path I went down but after
that job I really didn't enjoy it to be
honest with you it got a little boring
it I didn't really see myself doing it
long term so that'd be my first thought
but having kind of done that not what I
would do my next thought is I don't know
if this counts because if software
doesn't exist or if I don't do software
I can't do subsets the software right so
like my mix next to me it thought would
be project management for a software
company that's something I would like to
do as well or like a tech evangelist
role or UI UX but to me that's all three
of those things are too similar to
software for it to actually count
as answer now why would I do project
management well I think my people skills
are okay I don't think they're the
greatest and I also think that it's a
role that I would enjoy as well as like
a tech evangelist role and if you're not
if you're not a familiar with what like
a techie vengence up evangelist would do
or what that actually entails as someone
in a comment section once put they are
the honeypot for developers if you don't
know what the honeypot is it's kind of
like they bring in with the honey and
then give you what they want sort of
thing you can look it up there's a
better definition but essentially is
they get developers to use their
technologies and they could do this
through a variety of things where it's
hackathons or meetups or you know
YouTube channels outreaching so there's
a variety of ways but that was something
I always would be really interested in
and to this day if I ever was offered a
role for a company that I wanted to work
with you know let's say freako camp
decides that they're making millions of
dollars all of a sudden and they wanted
so they wanted an outreach versus they
wanted to want to throw on hackathons
they wanted so on to interview
developers they wanted like that would
be that would be the world's most
perfect role for me
no necessarily a free code camp but you
know Microsoft or I don't really use
Mac's not Apple and it's not any of the
big companies or the smaller companies
that I use their products I'm a big
believer of working at companies that I
actually use and things like that
in a perfect world right
all right so with all that being said
that's to software-related so what would
it be knowing what I know now right and
that's the thing is knowing what you
know now it's easy to that's why I said
the journalism thing because like let's
say you asked me 10 years ago before I I
kind of ever even thought about software
you know process is not five years ago
that would have been journalism and then
the AFL not what I'm doing now these
other software related roles right so on
too similar and this last one
you know I've talked about private I
think the most practical job knowing
what I know now would be digital
marketing which I think is even though
it involves technology I think it's I
think it's like different than you know
we're talking about SEO we're talking
about social media marketing we're
talking about you know things that
aren't exactly hard hard software realm
skills this is more marketing with
computer skills and social media and the
reason for that is there's a couple one
is it it if you've looked at like the
success of people getting jobs from like
seth's course such courses if you
remember back I interviewed Seth about
digital marketing not too long ago and
how to get started and yes of course and
if you're interested in it'll be a link
will be in the description below but ton
of people are getting jobs for me and I
looked at a lot of research and it seems
that the digital marketing space the
AdWords space it's really uh little
higher supply than there is a demand and
it you know there's a variety of reasons
yeah it's not being taught in
traditional education boot camps Florida
just popping up now though it's still a
big gap and so if things like sets
course where people are learning
valuable skills that the market needs
and able to get jobs with it after one
two or three months of taking the course
and it's something I think I would enjoy
a little bit there's something very
pleasurable about the idea of still
working with computers in one fashion
area another and I have a passion for
social media although the bulk of the
digital marketing course or digital
marketing in general AdWords and things
like that the second reason is the
salaries are fairly decent once you get
up there you know you could still make
over a hundred thousand as a digital
marketer with a couple years experience
third thing is just one of the few jobs
out there other than software but since
that doesn't exist is hypothetical that
you can work remotely or work for
yourself I think one of the greatest
appeals to me as a developer was that if
I wanted to I could start my own company
today it may not be a good company it
may not make a ton of money but I have
the skillset and the means to do such a
thing and who knows what will happen
with it
and digital marketing gives you kind of
a similar thing where you can have
clients you don't even have to meet with
them and you can kind of continue down
that path and so I think that would be
the direction I would be going so my
question to you guys is what would you
be doing if it wasn't software I'm
curious because I think now that we're
trying to reprogram our brain so you can
look at these things a little bit more
objectively and see all right well
what's going to give us a good life in
terms of money and lifestyle and what's
going to give us that lifestyle we want
slash how we want to live and in a
perfect world what job would that be for
you and I think we can all kind of break
it down now that word software
developers are trying to be to think of
these things objectively but as always
