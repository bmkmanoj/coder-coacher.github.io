you another not to video we're today we
are gonna teach you how not to get that
first coding job how not to get any code
in job you see you'll want to good job
you want to continue doing the same
you hate like the other 70% of the
country that hates their job that's what
we're gonna tell you today make sure
that you never ever get your first code
a job might I say while you're out there
not filling out job outs might you
interest yourself in the humble monthly
bundle it's good for another 21 days for
for just $12 a month you'll immediately
get h1z1 and then a hundred dollars of
random games this is good for another 20
days or so in it and you'll help me out
in the process so some of you may be
asking why are you why would we want to
not get a coding job Dylan and I don't
know this is not the video for you this
is food this is where the people who
like making bad decisions this is for
the people who are bringing in a sweet
hundred dollars a week in unemployment
living at home eating up all their
parents food living the dream
this is who that this video is for and
we want to make sure that their dreams
stay accomplished and no one messes it
up so that's what this video is for you
so the first thing that I want to talk
about to make sure that you never land
that coding or all that junk coding job
is communication you don't have any when
you walk into a room you want everyone
to feel awkward that's you when you have
to have a conversation there is no
conversation there is I how are you hi
and the as creepy and as awkward as you
possibly could make it to make everyone
feel uncomfortable that's you because
communication has everything to do with
being a developer but you don't want to
be a developer you want to make people
say you know what I'm kind of scared of
this guy I don't want to give him a job
that's who you want to be and we're not
talking about we're developer
right these are developers that are
looking to give you a job there by
Nature geeky dorky and awkward but you
are special type of I can't communicate
in any fashion or form not because you
don't know words you've got words down
you might even know sign language but
you cannot communicate as an individual
and you scare people in the process
so much so that you'll make sure you
never get any job it's definitely not a
developer job so number two is you don't
have any code to show that's a great way
this the best way you don't have a
github where you have code to show you
don't have a portfolio where you have
code to show when they say do your code
all you say is yes they say do you have
anything show us and you follow up with
nope I got nothing baby
hey guy I got nothing i don't fort folio
I don't have no work experience I got no
github I got nothing and you oh man you
are so excited to tell them how you have
nothing to show them to back up the fact
that you can code
yep github no you better get that out of
here cuz I ain't got that either and you
just move in on nothing don't don't
of course not why would you have any
code to actually show cuz you're trying
not to get the job remember let's say
you're trying to do you're trying to
make sure that you're not here and not
you $100 a week living on a buddy's
couch you ain't need any more money than
that don't get greedy don't get greedy
you don't need health insurance you
don't need pto you're always off you
ain't got no job wait you need pay time
off when you just got a limited time off
don't worry about it right so the third
tip the third tip is a good one in my
opinion you go solo this is always a key
on these not list because you already
know how not to get a developer job so
why would you want to seek out help from
other people but more so than that on
the few items that you do have right you
got those to do apps right you got those
to do apps and you didn't partner with
nobody
you did everything solo because being
part of a team
and working with other people it's the
same reason you know communicate you
don't want to be with other people you
want your the Chuck Norris baby of not
getting jobs and you don't need anybody
else on the team right so it's only you
you have no projects working with other
people because that's too realistic to
what being a developers like right
because almost every developer is on
team so you have nothing right you just
all I got is the to-do app that I did I
can't show you the code because that's
key that's number two but just believe
me that it is a beautiful to-do app well
then take it how beautiful a shitty to
do have and and I did it alone and I
have no projects in which I collaborated
with anybody in which I worked with
anybody else in any open source project
or even everything I wrote I touched and
there's no one else that helped me along
the way and nobody that I helped I am a
solo team member a one-man team I don't
need anybody else I don't want anybody
else alright so you do it all solo and
you got nothing to show that hey I can
work on a team because that's definitely
important to getting the job and you
don't want to worry about that right so
you don't want that job right number
four this is oh this is this is my
favorite on the list to be honest with
you because this is the most real this
is going to be the most real for some of
you right now
for the ones who stumbled upon this
video and actually wanted to learn how
to get a a coding job this will be the
one that's gonna that some of you might
be a little salty about you you're not
prepared that it's that simple baby when
when you were in school and I don't
blame you I the same thing in school
took me a while to correct my habits but
when you're at school and you had a test
yo man you are studying the day before
that test you're like what is this test
on I got no idea you know what I studied
the day before and oh my god I failed
the test what happened this is so absurd
that is you you are in you are adult now
and well legally you're an adult you're
probably a bit if you're if you're
trying not to get a job like us you are
probably a child mentally but that's
okay
so legally you are an adult making the
poor decisions and there's no one to
hold your hand and tell you not to do
these sorts of things so you don't
prepare you see you say hey I want to
get a coding job but you don't spend
time doing research
preparing for technical interviews when
you come oh when you get show up and
there's an empty whiteboard and they say
they give you a whiteboard problem
you leave that whiteboard empty here's
you ain't got nothing to say
you got nothing right you ain't gonna
you're not gonna dirty it up cuz you're
not prepared you got nothing to write on
there right cuz you didn't prepare when
you have interviews and on the on the
rare occasions that you do get those
interviews you make sure to shut them
down real hard and then you take no
mental notes or no notes at all about
what was covered so that you could be
prepared for the next interview right
that's that's absurd you don't because
that would mean that you might get more
clothes you might get closer to actually
getting a role when you know that you're
going in for a angular role you know
doing the research on angular you don't
build anything and angular for fun or to
have something to show that you're
interested in the real nonno you go
unprepared baby you ain't got nothing
you to take a very literal term raw dog
into the interview and and you you know
you're not prepared you're not protected
you just know you're just going in that
might be a little bit much but you just
going in and you are just I ain't got
worry about I'm I'm a free ball well
whatever happens happens hopefully I
don't get this job right
so um number five another personal
favorite of mine is you don't stand out
at all there's nothing unique about you
your resume looks like everyone else's
resume who's not getting the job
you don't want it to be unique the
unique people get the jobs right that
that means that you have no no pair
programming experience on there no
volunteer experience no custom projects
no meetups and no passion baby you are
as unfashionable
your github if you have one hopefully
you don't is as generic as can be and
your LinkedIn
if you have a LinkedIn doesn't showcase
any of your passion if you have any
passion and so you just you are when
when your resume is there it looks like
everybody else's and you're just hoping
to get stepped over because you don't
want to be unique you don't want to be
anything that stands out because you're
trying not to Glen that role you're
trying to stay unemployed those cushy
paychecks and keep it that way
so those are my five tips to make sure
that you don't land your first coding
job again have a it's hot as in
this row having a little bit of fun
today guys and I hope when you're out
there looking for roles I hope that you
are figuring out what it is that you are
trying to do with your life and
understand how you can better the earth
process right so communication key you
really need to be able to have
conversation there's a lot of great
developers who can't get jobs because
they refuse to work on the one personal
the one soft skill that you need as a
developer which is to be able to make
people be able to have a conversation
with people and be able to communicate
because you will be you know as I
elaborate on number three communicating
with teams right
number two is and clients for that
matter number two is you actually have
code to show people how many people
don't have github how many people don't
have a personal portfolio and just say
they code and they can't back it up
right it's a lot easier to land those
roles when they check out your github
and there's stuff on it they check out
your LinkedIn and they see projects on
it they check out your website and you
have a website right so try and a half
code to show number three is if you have
projects where you're working with other
people this is great because it can show
that you can work on a team right so you
know maybe your help organize the meetup
maybe you volunteered maybe you've done
open source code maybe you've done
projects where you've built with other
teams at a hackathon and things like
that to show that you can work on a team
nor for is again I really do think a lot
of people don't
for their technical areas for me
personally when I knew that I was going
to be looking for a technical for a new
job I did code fights and other and I
did the rack now degree program and
start studying angular and I did a
hundred algorithms on code fights to
make sure that I could pass those white
board tests so make sure that I could be
prepared as much as I can right that
doesn't mean that you're going to ace
everything but you're gonna be much more
prepared than if you don't and a lot of
people don't and when I did go to an
interview and there's a question I
didn't know I went home I looked it up
and so on and so forth so you have to
really implement these things and number
five is be unique right so a lot of
people are not unique in the slightest
and they just think like well this this
one person I know got a job just being
doing this one thing and they make
excuses and they compare themselves to
someone who got lucky
don't don't compare yourself be your own
person and be unique and get that
passion because that passion is gonna
help you land your role and that it's
gonna make your resume stand out and
they're gonna be like let me talk to
this guy and see if you can do a for
loop and has good communication and if
he does the passion it's gonna draw me
and those two things so basically people
it gets you the job so I hope that you
are I hope you whatever your if you're
looking for a role or you're thinking
about getting a job role that you have
these five things or the opposite of
these five things I appreciate you all
