what I learned working as a developer
for the one-year mark we're at right now
so last year what have I learned not
only technical skills but what sort of
on the job skills or insights have I
learned working as a dual stack
developer and what what can I tell you
so that you can know what to expect now
before we get going is this we're going
to be talking about learning new things
there's this great ebook bundle that's
going to teach you a lot of new things
that you may be interested such as a
paleo diet stretching you know I'm big
on the essential oils mindfulness
bodyweight training vegan posture sex
positions this is a this is a pg-13
stream so we can dive in too much onto
that yoga for those who don't know I've
done yoga for quite some time I have in
last year but I was doing yoga pretty
much twice a week for about a year and I
really regret not doing it yeah continue
but you know I just wanted to share that
before we got jumped into our video
today so as I mentioned I've been
working for the last year as a
full-stack developer and give you a
little background on the company before
we get started what I've been doing is
I've worked for a military I worked for
a military contract company and
essentially what that means is they as a
service company helped to run military
training exercises and what I did was I
basically helped build web applications
that went along with that and the point
was to either sell them or gain more
contracts in the process having this
proprietary web app web applications
that we built so that's basically what
I've been working on for the last year
so from a technical standpoint I learned
quite a bit I went in there knowing one
of the things people ask quite often is
oh would you know when you got your
first job I went in there knowing HTML
CSS JavaScript a little bit angular and
jQuery and that was really it I mean I'd
been exposed to other things through
coursework my sequel being one of them
and databases but in terms of what I
actually would say that I quote-unquote
knew the reason I say I use quotes there
because I really don't think I know
anything because what I've learned is
that
so much to know about everything and
everything's changing so fast that I
don't know anything I just know a little
bit less or a little bit more than some
other people right so that's how I look
at it but I still don't know much but
yeah so that's basically where I was at
when I started the role and a year later
I'm a much better developer which a much
larger toolset than I had before now
when I started I was fumbling around for
about a month or two and every weekend I
was going going and studying and
studying and not only in the stuff that
was there but that was my first initial
thing as I wanted to make sure that I
could do my job right this was first
development job I ever had
like first real one besides internships
and contract work and I wanted to make
sure that I kept this job and so I would
study and I remember I remember very
clearly I think was the second week
where I was leaving on a Friday and my
boss said hey Dylan make sure you study
this weekend and that was the only thing
that I I needed to hear to say you are
not doing as well as I would like you to
do and get it together and and I did I
think at least I think I did so
throughout the year I got much better at
JavaScript I got much better at
angularjs at that time I'd built one
project in angularjs this was when
angular was in version 1.3 and I'd built
my very first like a YouTube website
coding tutorials 360 comm if you're
interested in it you can go and check it
out still there none of the code has
been touched for the most part and you
can kind of see what I had built at that
time to get to where I wanted it to go
so over it throughout the year so I got
better at angular I got better at
JavaScript HTML CSS I got better at
jQuery because these are all the main
front-end things that we're using but I
also picked up a few brand new things
PHP and my sequel being something I say
my sequel because I yes I've had
coursework in my sequel but I haven't
really created databases I haven't
really connected tables and all the
stuff that goes along with the ANA and
to this day I'm not the best person at
my sequel but I can go and I can create
it just look up some documentation real
quick refresh my memory and I can
start architecting a project out based
off of how you would join tables and
things like that so I got better with
databases in terms of relational
databases and PHP the only PHP
experience I had was a codecademy
tutorial so basically none and so I
picked a PHP and cake PHP which is a
framework and then I got introduced to
testing now I had always been aware of
what testing was but I never really knew
to what detail it was and to be honest I
didn't really know that there's multiple
types of testing and I just thought it
was all sort of under an umbrella one
testing but that's not true so the
testing that I got most familiar with is
called unit testing and we use Jasmin
and karma which is a front-end I guess
is library to run tests and basically
what you're doing is you're testing your
functions so if you have an odd function
you're testing to see that if I pass in
two parameters and we add them together
it's going to return the correct value
and if it doesn't your code broke
somewhere along the way so you're
testing your code there's also into end
testing and what that basically is and I
had very limited experience with this my
coworker did much more end-to-end
testing than I did and was essentially
you are setting up a program to run
through your application in the browser
as if a user was doing it so that's
making sure that everything clicks and
that when this clicks this event happens
if that event doesn't happen something
broke and that could be something where
you're typing a key doesn't let you type
in or you're sending to authenticate
your login it doesn't go and so it's a
that one's a little bit more visual so a
lot of code you got right for that one
I'm not a big fan of end-to-end testing
but unit testing it's pretty
straightforward and pretty fast in my
experience so that I picked that up I
got much better with wire framing as
well I originally my my boss had us
working with a program that's not
supported anymore called pencil project
because it was a huge deal we had very
low resolution wireframes and the big
point of it was to communicate to to our
our bosses our clients if you will who
what we're building and sort of what
it's going to look like it's not going
to be ideal this is a low resolution
it's not like web design where maybe
you'll have someone actually
get it down to the T down to the pixel
what it's going to look like in
Photoshop this is to essentially
illustrate a concept and I'm actually
gonna have a video about wire framing
going more into that as well as the tool
that I ended up using which is called
balsalmic which I used at my previous
job where I was doing technical writing
and making training materials and things
like that
I'm have a video going through that and
walking people through balsamic and how
to create good wireframes so we would do
that as well and it was I got so I got I
got exposed to a lot in a year in terms
of the technical aspect some things that
I pretty much picked up from scratch was
PHP cakephp my sequel karma Jasmine I I
also got it exposed to build tools which
I wasn't using which would be Bower I
wasn't really using NPM too much so node
NPM gulp grunt and then I got exposed to
some some tools that that we use which
was tortoise get to help manage our git
repositories and made me very dependent
on it and I'm trying to break these
habits now so I can just learn get for
what it is and it's it's it's it's hard
it's so funny being being so bad I get I
don't understand why I can't I can't
seem to get it didn't all right yeah get
it get it who got it anyhow so so I
learned live technical skills now the
more so than the technical skills is
what I learned outside of work and what
I also learned being at a company
working as a developer these are these
are maybe the things that you would not
see as much up so so in terms of talking
about that of being a developer and on
site I was on a team of four basically
and when you're on such a small team and
small one team of four there's not like
like ten teams of four so there's a
single team before and basically we had
a senior developer who's kind of the
architect if you will and but we were
given a lot of leeway and how we were
going to design our application
and typically the the biggest change
between working as a solo developer
learning and going on a team is you're
part of a team right here now sometimes
you're going to be working on different
aspects of the same application and
you're going to need to be able to
explain your code to the other
developers every day hey what is this
and why is it here and sometimes they
will have very good responses and my
this is I'm on both sides of this by the
way and sometimes they will not and you
will have caught something that needs to
be refactored or improved but you need
to be able to have good communication
the biggest thing for me was what it was
like to work with other developers what
it was like to be part of a team and
contributing the only really real time
I've ever experienced that was doing
some some pair programming with engineer
truth when he was studying for the
bootcamp at dev Mountain and we would
whiteboard out some algorithms when we
were solving free code cab out runs and
then hackathons whenever I had a chance
to go to hackathons and a little bit in
college not really though not too much
so it was it was a good experience in
that fact factor another thing that I
got more experienced in and I say more
experience because my previous job I had
a similar task in my technical technical
writer role where I would go and pull
requirements from people I would go to
at that company I would go to different
sub companies if you will almost
different departments and sometimes I
would need to get their feedback and
their feature requests I need would need
to create tickets and report back hey
this is what's really important to them
they can kind of wait on this and I
would do that on a much grander scale
now as a developer of which I would have
to be maybe meeting with with the
higher-ups the big bosses if you will
and say hey you know so this is your
application let's work through it step
by step and I want to either show some
of the like well we can't do this
because this is a direct conflict with
this and then oh yeah that makes sense
or no we really need this okay well this
is going to have to go away and then
also on a small team you are
you really have a lot more
decision-making power than perhaps on on
a larger team where there is a senior
architect there is a team lead then
there's several senior developers and
then there's you the grunt right the
junior developer that the the the the
Youngblood if you although I'm not that
young right so the newer developers that
are there that are supposed to not that
you can't contribute your thought
process but you don't have the the
leeway when you have a project manager
and a business analyst and then you have
a you know a team lead and everybody
else it's not up for you to decide what
is being built it's your job sort of
build it and provide input back which
may or may not be implemented in my last
year I basically had a lot a lot of
leeway to choose what tools I wanted to
use what open-source libraries how it
was going to be built how is going to be
architected at the end of the day I
would just sort of like take a piece of
paper with some notes to me like does
this work yeah I change this one thing
so that was a different experience and
that was partially because of us
essentially being a start-up within a
company and more focused on rapid
development rapid development than
anything else
so in terms of what I spent my time
learning outside of work I spent a lot
of time in this a lot of time reviewing
the JavaScript documentation which I
hadn't had a chance to do and so I tried
to replace bad habits of mine such as
always writing a for loop instead of
maybe using a for each as a basic
example but being more comfortable with
the functions that are already in or the
methods rather that are already in the
the library and earth language rather
and making sure that I knew what tools I
had at my disposal this is something I'm
doing right now with es6 I'm trying to
make sure that I'm more familiar with
the documentation and I'm continuing to
be so this is going to be a lifelong
process of learning in this field but
I'm making sure that okay well I wasn't
able to write in es6 so I only did it in
my side projects now that I can at my
current work let's review this to the
fullest and make sure that when I
see something I know what it is and if I
don't know what it is I can ask or I can
google it and do better I yeah I want to
get better but you also want to be as
prepared as you can for your current
role so in the last year outside of work
what I've been getting better at was I
picked up note I picked up Express I
picked up MongoDB Mongoose I also built
you know and how did how did I do that I
well I did some video tutorials I did
some interactive tutorials on free
cocaine and then I built about five
projects in four or five microservice
projects that I have videos on my
channel you know how to build a URL
shortener a date/time stamp
micro-service a to-do list
same thing with react in the last year
elsewill started messing around with
react and redux and in react I built for
four sort of small projects to really
hammer it in also from the free code
camp curriculum for inspiration and not
that I'm necessarily going to put that
on my my resume or my portfolio more so
those are just many projects that that I
like to hammer and after I've done some
video tutorials to make sure that I
actually understand and I can build
something from scratch yeah I watched
this video and I follow it I typed the
code as it was on the screen right but
can I when I open up that blank text I
continue to grind and continue to learn
and take what I learned and without
someone showing me the steps build out
what build out what I want and what I
what I need to accomplish my objective
my user stories so this year has been a
a wonderful year of which I've learned
and grown as a developer more so than
last year and part of that is I've been
working for a year as a developer and
doing full stack development
architecting out my own projects working
alongside other developers and picking
up other frameworks in my in my outside
of work and I also have been doing
things like solving algorithms looking
at documentation watching videos running
my Facebook group in YouTube channel and
and staying up to date and reading up on
these things and continuing that passion
that I always talk about as a developer
and I've been loving it and it was a
worry of mine right so sometimes you
don't know if even though you love
something and you do
the example I give quite frequently is
music because a lot of people can relate
to that more than coding so or video
games for that matter so say you say you
are a musician and you enjoy you love
you come home every day after school
after work you play your guitar your
drums whatever it is now imagine that
that actually becomes your job it sounds
good in theory but what you may not like
about is now you are essentially forced
into a role where you need to do this in
order for you to earn a dollar and it
may actually take all the fun out of it
for me the example I gave is I used to
play a lot of video games and that
started streaming video games and I
hated it and it kind of killed video
games for a while for me and I stopped
streaming but I was worried to a degree
that that could be something where I was
studying so hard and I put being a
developer on such a pedestal that
perhaps but when it did happen when I
really dived in I wouldn't enjoy it
anymore and it would just be a job and I
unfortunately didn't turn out the web so
very happy so so that's what I learned
in last year as a developer and it's
it's kind of crazy sum it up in 15
minutes right the last entire year but
I've learned some technical skills I've
learned some more soft skills and more
practical skills of how I interact with
developers and this next year I'm going
to be learning quite a quite a few new
skills to go along with that and grow
and continue to hopefully thrive as a
eager passionate developer I guess
that's what I consider myself eager
passionate developer with a little less
hair than he had last week so thank you
