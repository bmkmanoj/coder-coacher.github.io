back in code Academy doing CSS
fundamentals from the learn HTML CSS
part 1 basic CSS structure and syntax
last time we basically learned how to
link our CSS file this time we're gonna
be doing some stuff so there's a whole
mess of styling going on here and this
is our HTML this is interesting so there
used to be a build web projects and
they've been incorporating them into
this section that's kind of like a
prequel I guess so if we want to style
so you typically you'll use classes or
IDs for styling but if you know that you
want to style entire tire element you
can do that as well such as just typing
the element we're not putting a style in
here quite yet but if we were it would
target all our H ones
so how do we set properties and
everything like that we have our
selector which is in this case our h1 we
have an opening bracket in a closing
bracket that's basically where our code
starts for the styling for that element
in the code ends anything outside of
there is not going to affect it now we
have our property which in this example
here is font size and then we have the
value so we are targeting this for our
h1 selector and we're setting it to here
and then we put a semicolon to end that
that's how we do this that's how we do
it so we do this e as a that's how we do
what's up if there's a song you guys
know what sometimes yeah so here we're
gonna go ahead and change the color to
fire brick I'm just gonna run that so
you'll see right there we have this nice
red now we want to go ahead and reset
the font size here by default some of
these things may be already there like
for instance your anchor tag may already
be blue if you you were resetting the
default values for some of these some
are we're adding these values so we're
gonna go ahead and see right there we've
now reset this to a more reasonable size
oh excuse me this was supposed to be for
paragraphs so we want to target our
paragraphs don't put a line in between
we're gonna put a font size 18 PX there
we go so this is a little bit bigger now
all our paragraphs are kind kindly been
updated
now you can actually combine use one
selector to change the color of the
heading and paragraph to dark slate
great hmm so what we want to do here is
when you put a comma you're actually
saying look for H ones and paragraphs
set the color to something you know
apply this styling to both these
elements let's go ahead and put dark
slate gray and you'll see right now is
now inherited the coloring for both why
I forget this kind of buggy so let's go
and do that one more time there you go
but that's what's going on there commas
will separate elements that you can set
style for all of them so then we have
the universal selector just the asterisk
basically select all and what you can do
here typically if you're using this
you'll want it to be your first item
so we'll do font - family and we're
gonna go ahead and set it to Georgia
it's gonna run this now all our font has
changed oh my goodness we'll go next all
right
just like how when they won our HTML ran
you want to kind of follow the standard
spacing you'll notice that all these are
on separate lines they're not one big
line thing you typically want to put a
space in between each of these like so
you really need to make your CSS and all
your code in general very readable and
follow kind of the standard convention
indentation so you'll see notice that
these are indented because this is
nested within the paragraph brackets
here nice so comments are slightly
different and caught the way that you
comment in CSS is you do slash star and
then star slash you'll notice that you
can do this on multiple lines or one
line or anything like that so we'll just
put this
this is a comment that I read that oops
slash star star slash comment there we
go so I just keep in mind that's a
slightly different so this is pretty
quick but what we basically learned is
proper structure we learned that you
need to indent when necessary we learned
how to do comments we also learn how to
set the properties and all those as well
in our CSS styling definitely get
comfortable with all this and try and
keep everything together and just do
your best with it there's a ton of stuff
in CSS and I don't know
and I've been using it for years so it's
definitely something that you just need
to get comfortable with the basics
because there's a ton of more advanced
stuff to come with this but as always
