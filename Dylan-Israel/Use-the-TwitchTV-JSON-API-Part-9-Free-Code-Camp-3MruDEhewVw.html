video I showed you how to fix this right
here and I I was thinking maybe everyone
would be able to take that example and
apply it but it seems like quite a few
people have been struggling and they're
trying to get their page to start
working again
so what we're gonna do is I'm going to
show you basically explain a little bit
of how the Ajax works so that we can get
our info to work again I kind of gutted
out the jQuery so just kind of follow
along but it should help you get going
there was apologize if it's a little
weird
I'm actually sitting on the floor cuz my
desk broke why I was filmed I was
live-streaming me working on this but
don't say I don't love you guys and I
took one for the team and continued on
alright so let's go ahead and start from
the top and we'll explain the logic
we're gonna be working completely in the
JavaScript here I don't believe we use
this anymore so the way that I did that
first gets part which is the right here
if it displays the free code campus
online or offline is we changed it to an
ajax call this is in the previous video
but we're just gonna break it down you
set the type here so we're changing that
get JSON to an ajax call the type is
like git push poke post delete the URL
same thing then we had this new header
column now you're gonna have to get your
client ID and do that through the twitch
developer forum if you don't know where
it is or how to find it the previous
video we walk you through how to get
that now what we're gonna do is say on
success we run a function on the data we
get which is essentially like our get
JSON get JSON assumes you have a success
Ajax is not and then in this case we're
saying if data the stream is no they're
offline so we're just throwing our
jQuery in here to change the status else
we're gonna say that they are life
because the stream isn't null so that's
something we already know now the next
part that we're gonna cover is how to
get sick
successful messages like so so you'll
see right here we have a couple things
going on and not all of them are
displaying and that's cool you'll see
that we have a four or four not found
here very cool and everything else in
between
so let's go ahead and look at this real
quick so we're gonna do the Ajax call
again and we're gonna have a git and
then we're gonna pass in this is for the
channels that free code camp follows and
then we're gonna go ahead and pass in
the client ID now on this example we're
just gonna pass in success one more time
it's gonna clean up some of this blank
space and in here we're just gonna go
ahead and throw our logic in here we're
gonna set display name equal to
everything else we're basically just
relocating this this if logo is equal to
null is when the logo isn't set so we're
just gonna go ahead and pass in that
basically if this returns a null it
means they don't have a logo so we're
gonna set that this is just reorganizing
where it was before and we're gonna have
the follower info and again this should
already be done in your to some degree
in your code and we're gonna go ahead
and just prepend that and so we're gonna
pass in the logo the display name and
the status into this HTML and append it
now that that's it for free code camps
followers now to give an example of how
you would do the deleted followers
excuse me is we have just the two
examples that free code camp gives us
calm stir and 404 and we're just running
a for loop that goes around the Ajax
call so that we get one URL each
iteration now you'll see we it's Ajax
what type I get call once again the URL
and then we're just throwing the name on
the end of the URL here and then the
header again is our client ID and then
instead of success we're actually doing
air so this is where a lot of people are
getting confused or trying to use the
dot done function this isn't how it
works
it's Ajax is slightly different so
you're gonna be using air when it runs
an air you're gonna get a different
response and when it's a success and
because we you see I don't even know
right
success function here because we know
it's gonna be an error now what you can
do if you want to just make a simple one
single get call our to get calls is you
can combine these two and then just
instead of just doing this we can create
a a array with the channel name set free
code camp is following and then add
those two to it as we did before and
then we can run that a for loop around
that but for simplicity we didn't do
that so you'll see we're gonna check for
these two users right here and we're
running the air and then it's the same
thing we're just outputting the change
in our data we're four pending the same
stuff except it's slightly different
because the API that we're getting back
is different so in this case the display
name is just status text not found and
then also data 3 dot status which is you
know 404 and then the logo we go ahead
and hard set that to one that's not
there and before you know it
everything's up and running life is good
and you'll see 404 not found it looks
like right here this logo is not found
now we didn't set anything for the
status if it's null so that's still
display null but you could do that
fairly easily on your own but I hope
this got you going it's pretty
straightforward as long as you
understand how Ajax works and the setup
process I'm sorry I didn't go step by
step and covering it over fortunately I
thought this might be easier actually so
that you can take your code and go from
there but as always guys thanks for
watching don't forget to Like subscribe
