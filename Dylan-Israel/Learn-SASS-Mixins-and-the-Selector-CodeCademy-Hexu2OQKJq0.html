ten family we are back in code
codecademy we're doing the SAS mix-ins
and the at selector so let's go ahead
and get started mix-ins are kind of like
CSS style classes that you'll be that
you will use you'll see right here we
have the stripes class it takes in
multiple parameters and you know we're
doing some stuff with it sets the
background which a whole other
parameters bang out let's go ahead and
get started in the main SCSS inside of
notecard nest and invoke the following
at selector so let's go ahead and find
note card so here's our note card we
want to nest within it so you look when
someone's hovering we want to include
the transform just leave is this mixing
right here where I lost my spot
transform and we're going to pass in a
parameter here we're going to pass in
row tote a negative 180 degrees let's go
ahead and run that
trans from needs to be transformed just
going to run that pretty cool and you
see that it's flippin now because of it
180 degrees so it also allows us to
we're kind of creating variables at the
end of the day doing this at mixing and
we're reusing them so we can use them in
our CSS class so at the top create the
following mix in let's go ahead and
collapse this out the way a little bit
so we're going to note that by doing the
act mix in now we're going to say back
face dash visibility and because i'm a
horrible typer i'm going to go ahead and
and the control see this in so what
we're actually putting in here basically
the parameters look back face visibility
hit it now if it needs to be that for
this browser specific WebKit one I think
Maz is firefox I remember correctly this
should inherit all the valley so they're
all gonna have the same value of hitting
now we want to go ahead and call that
mixing in the dot front dot back right
here and we want to nest it in there oh
no we don't need a necessary just need
to put it in there so we want to include
what we the mix and we just created best
we think of mix-ins are there classes
for styling that typically have to do
with animations and things being
animated that that's at least how I
think of it and then oftentimes include
the browser specific stuff so it looks
like we're good here it's now I believe
take my sermon in there all right let's
move on
so now it looks like we're going to be
passing in parameters so before how we
set this up was that our back face
visibility didn't take a parameter in so
the way that we do this is similar to
how we would do a function and we're
going to pass in a parameter that we're
gonna call visibility instead of putting
hidden in here we're actually just going
to put the parameter that we're passing
into it as its value now chances are
it's probably going to be hidden but it
also makes our class a lot more reusable
if we needed to be something else so now
when we go back to our dot front back
nest nesting that we have here we're
going to actually passed in a a
parameter here with what it is that we
want we want it to be hidden and we're
going to get the same effect this makes
our code a lot more reusable we ever
don't want it to be hidden we can pass
in a different value without having to
change five lines of code so you also
have the ability in these mix-ins of
setting a default value the way that you
would do that is you pass in the
parameter and then you put colon and we
pass in a default hinnen now if we go
back to our r dot friend up back here it
is and we take out this parameter i note
that you can leave the brackets there or
without it and it will work either way
i'm not sure what the convention is i
imagine just not having the brackets is
probably all right
but now it's inheriting the hidden when
when no parameter is provided so a
couple more examples here alright so in
the main.css end dots back selector
we're going to go ahead and include the
following just go ahead and find dot
back here we are and we want to include
excuse me include transform road otay
wrote at a wrote at a negative 180
degrees now we're going to run that
pretty cool in addition to flipping the
back we also make sure that the note
card processor is a 3d effect so notice
along the edges there's kind of a little
shadow before we hover over anything and
we want to make sure that that shadow
flips accordingly and everything looks
3d and we're trying to make passing the
3d effect so we're going to add the
Foley mixing transform style and with
the parameter style again because I'm a
little chubby fingered I have issues ten
fingers farther artwork I'm just
unskilled with my hands it's probably
more realistic so instead of actually
typing all this out we're going to go
ahead and copy and paste this in here
they all do the same thing they're all
transforming the style with a parameter
but these are for browser specific
models typically most of these you don't
need in the new versions of browsers
it's really just for the antiquated and
outdated browsers that are that might
need this for older Hawaii or whatever
um so inside the notecard we're gonna
actually go ahead and call that so let's
go find note card here's a note card and
go ahead and put it right her and right
here we want to add include transform
Dutch style and we want to actually
don't need brackets there excuse me one
ink food preserve dash 3d
not too noticeable but uh all right next
we want to create the mix in that is
going to be at mix in transition and
we're going to pass in the parameter
that we call time again I'm going to
kind of copy and paste this over
and the following selects our note card
all right so we are going to go ahead
and add the same thing to include the
transition inside note card probably
best to actually include all this stuff
that we did in order it's probably more
more it'll be easier to see so we're
going to include the transition and
we're gonna I'm going to put first foot
four seconds so we'll put two seconds so
you can kind of see what it is doing it
might be a little too quick see the
otherwise let's see if that that's right
oh so you're seeing how slow it slip in
there the reason I'm taking the time to
do this is really for me it's really
helpful to change this parameter around
a little bit to see exactly what it's
doing so now that we when we run this
and we go where you're going to see it's
much faster it helps me to kind of
understand what it is I'm trying to do
right now
you also have the option of putting in
multiple arguments and setting default
values and things of that nature
according this after we pass in our
first parameter we can use the dot dot
dot notation to just go ahead and
inherit the rest as as we as we want so
we're going to make a new list variable
here at the top so we're going to dot
stripe Josh properties and we're going
to say it to bottom fifteen percent and
we're also going to say blue Tamil white
so those are our striped properties now
inside the strikes mix in just going to
find that right here side up the
including the stress we mix it inside of
the definition select your dot
definition so let's go and find that
here we are we want to include and I've
include stripes cool all right so what's
going on here is we created a variable
that's storing several properties now
now all we have to do to save us a
little bit of time as we're gonna say
stripe dash properties dot dot dot so
basically inherit the wreck inherit the
properties and it's going to separate it
by the commas everything should work
accordingly very nice
string interpolation is process of
placing a variable string in the middle
of two other strings string
interpolation so we're putting in this
variable Jake like okay so we're just
inheriting our file right here and we're
saying look the ID it looks like we're
targeting the URL we're setting it up
like this okay pretty pretty pretty
straightforward so let's create a mixin
now and we're going to go ahead and call
this I'll edit the photo content photo
contact mixin as follows stripes
doctrines transform area photo content
we want our content to take in a
parameter called file we then want the
content parameter to contain the URL and
the wit where's our URL going to be
located we're going to say look it's
going to be located at the file
parameter we're passing in dot JPEG
so now when we go to the photo CSS right
here when we pass in our include photo
dash content we're going to pass in a
parameter so in this case will be
tightened Oh sore and it's gonna go find
that for us BAM there's our titanosaur
seven story building Wow the more you
know all right ah we've accomplished
some fat fancy things we're now at the
at selector the at selector gets
assigned value of the pairing at the
point where the mixin is included
there's no parent selector than its
nolan sass will throw an heir all right
so it means he has to make the new mix
in
as you can see mix-ins are very
important to really add some animation
and cool effect soup to your styling so
we're going to create the hover class
mix in our hover color mixing matter
we're gonna pass in a parameter that we
call color right on also pass in a at
hover effect to it so we're saying look
when this mix it include this mix in
somewhere and then when you hover over
where that mixin is we want you to add
this effect only on hover so it's just
so it's more nesting except included
within the mixin and so we're going to
go to add include for the dot word here
we are let me do it like so so add
include hover color and we're going to
pass in the parameter red so let's go
ahead and run that and so now when we
hover it should change something door up
it's kinda hard to see well you see you
see how it's turning red on one week
when we hover over we also have this
flip so I don't know really how useful
that is Michael so that was a mixin and
hover really the thing to take away from
all of this if this guy new is mixes are
basically classes that we are providing
parameters to you have the ability of
creating multiple parameters to store in
variables and then passing that in by
putting dot dot dot out on the on the
variable name when passing this
parameter and you also have the ability
of passing in a variable and a default
value if they don't pass in anything at
all such as our hidden example so I hope
you guys found this kind of helpful I'm
really enjoying SAS and I definitely
encourage anyone who is styling their
their websites to move away from pure
CSS and go in the SAS direction because
that's the way the industry's going it's
the best thing you can do as always
thank you to everyone who supported me
on patreon thank you for the likes in
the shares they helped a ton if you
want to help the channel out that's the
way to do it and as always guys I will
see you in the next video keep an eye
out for it hey guys thanks for watching
the video my good friend Matt at
engineered truth has a three-part
interview with Quincy Larson the founder
of free code camp go ahead and check
that out and so you'll get a lot of
really cool stuff thanks for watching
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
