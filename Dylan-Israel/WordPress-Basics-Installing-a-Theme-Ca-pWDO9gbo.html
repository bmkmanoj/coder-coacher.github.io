learning how to install a basic thing so
go to appearance and themes and you can
see right here i've already installed
quite a few you can click add new theme
at the bottom or add new at topic i'll
search or themes but probably most
people don't have a specific one in mind
we're just going to choose social
magazine here click install see that
successfully installed it and you can
click activate here or go back to
appearance to see that so here is our
social we can you can also do a live
preview to see alright so this is what
it is there's usually a lot of
customization that comes with this so
it's not going to look identical but say
you actually want to add a custom theme
you wrote one yourself or a friend did
or you know you hired someone to do it
you go to upload theme at the top choose
file make sure it's in a zip format or
it won't work and so let's look for a
new theme that's it you seem so I you
need a better keep your better go
so does it new things on zip open it
install it sometimes it'll take
something you can also do this on the
server side if you have access to your
server in this case I'm using godaddy I
don't and you know let's go back to our
themes and there it is this is my old
works also the people i freelanced for
so this is their current theme i just
downloaded it BAM good to go i'm not
going to use that but that's how you
install a custom theme and you able to
add a theme in the WordPress so as
always questions comments concerns and
if there's any wordpress basic videos
you'd like just go ahead and leave a
comment about it thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
