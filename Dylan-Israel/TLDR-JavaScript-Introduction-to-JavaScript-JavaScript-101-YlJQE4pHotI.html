we are going to tell you everything that
matters in JavaScript to get you going
here the stuff that you're going to be
using 80% of the time we're gonna be
covering a lot of great topics as quick
as we can to cover as much as we can so
what are we gonna be what is JavaScript
let's just first define that javascript
is the language of the web it is the
brains of the Internet if you want to
think of it that way when it comes
especially comes to front-end
development although JavaScript can be
used to build back in applications
databases mobile applications desktop
applications where JavaScript thrives
and lives and started out was in
front-end web development it is one of
the three parts triangle of the the
parts of the internet when it comes to
front-end development which is HTML CSS
and JavaScript and it is how we make our
pages interactive is how when we click a
button it knows to go and do something
when we you know want to add some
numbers together it knows how to do that
and that's JavaScript when we you know
hover over something it goes and does
some stuff javascript allows our
webpages to be dynamic and it is in an
amazing thing and that that's basically
it at the end of the day so what are we
going to be covering here what are the
major points well we're gonna be talking
about the datatypes of JavaScript sort
of give some examples some of the
methods that stand out that are
definitely important for you know we're
also gonna be talking about operators
you know and declarations and control
flow and we're gonna be talking real
quick a little bit about each one of
these sections and what they're gonna
consist of when it comes to datatypes
we're gonna be talking about what are
strings what are numbers what are
boolean objects are race nulls undefined
what is all that right you know what are
some functions and methods that we're
going to be using in JavaScript how does
that work where they do you know how can
I use them effectively when it comes to
operators when we talk about arithmetic
operators relational equality how to
increment decrement assignment operators
all things that you're gonna need to
know when it comes to the logic aspects
of JavaScript and then
finally when it comes to declarations
and control flow what is letting Kant's
how does if else if and else work
what is wall and do-while what are four
loops what are switch statements these
are things that you're gonna have to
know where are some things we're not
gonna cover and I'm slide for that but
what are some things that we're not
going to cover we're not going to be
covering the vanilla JavaScript Dom
manipulation javascript is what's called
an event-driven language and that that
entails manipulating webpages those are
things like the hovering the clicking
those are events that that's not what
this video is about this video is about
the logic aspects that you're gonna get
going the reason for that is as you
progress in JavaScript you're gonna be
using frameworks like react angular for
you jQuery all that sort of stuff and
probably thinks by the time this video
is out that I don't even know about
right but that's gonna handle a lot of
the Dom manipulation the vanilla
JavaScript here we're gonna be talking
about the stuff of JavaScript that's
never gonna change and the things that
you need to know to be able to start
thinking like a developer so let's go
ahead and start started diving into it
if you're over there loving that
javascript thing and you're thinking you
know man I want a full stack Java scrap
bootcamp I wonder if Dylan can recommend
one I can might I recommend dev Mountain
com
dev Mountain coding bootcamp for tuition
and housing is included for free where
you can get over there and learn not
only full stack JavaScript but iOS
development Salesforce development
quality assurance but in terms of the
full stack Java screen you'll be picking
up JavaScript jQuery angular node react
and a whole bunch of other great things
check them out dev Mountain comm alright
if you want to be following along in the
same text editor I am I'll be using
visual studio code for our
demonstrations and our exercises you go
to code visual studio comm to download
this IDE you'll see here it's very nice
I also be using the extension called
quota if you click this little I don't
know why it's this weird square but
that's the extension icon you'll see
that I have this quota cue you okay hey
AJ yes we're gonna be using this as well
for our application so if you want to
use that I think it's kind of a cool
tool especially when you're just getting
started you just need some water to play
around with you can use quota so let's
go ahead and jump right in alright so
let's go ahead and get started by
creating a file here we're gonna go and
call this index J yes this is just gonna
be our example folder or play around
folder and go ahead and close that and
go ahead and hit f5 and if you have
excuse me f1 start quota on this file
and we'll close that and you'll see here
with quota going out and basically what
this has been allow us to do is console
dot log essentially let us write out
code and you'll see that we have this
little too so as we're testing our code
we can kind of see what's going on here
if we want to so let's talk about data
types data types are a huge part of any
programming language and there's several
in JavaScript that you need to be aware
of strings are one of them so let's say
we wanted to create a variable a
variable is a container its stores value
that's basically it so we're gonna just
call this example and we're gonna set
this equal to hello world this is a
string a string is a series of texts
basically at the end of the day and if
we wanted to print that out we could use
console dot log now one thing to keep in
mind here is that one thing to keep in
mind is let's go ahead and take this out
real quick you'll see that we're able to
reference this because we've stored it
in a variable here in our console log
you also notice that we use single
quotes now we can switch it to double
quotes obviously we can have one single
and one double but that would work as
well as of es6 we have these back ticks
that add that lets us do some pretty
cool stuff so so far you saying although
well what's the difference well between
single quote and double quote nothing
but let's say we have we'll just create
this and we'll call this e x2 and we'll
set this to be equal to world say we
wanted to actually inject this in the
past what we might have to do here is go
ahead and do x2 and you'll see here it
adds a space hello world doesn't look
all that good it's a little bit dirty so
what we can do is what's called string
interpolation here add this dollar sign
in these two curly braces and we're
going to throw in our variable x2 you'll
see now it's actually injecting the
world in here
one thing that's a little different than
other programming languages is that
strings and characters are the same okay
some some programming languages will
have characters be their own data type
that's not the case it's just character
being a single character of a string in
JavaScript they're all the same so these
are strings at the end of the day and we
can do some some pretty cool stuff with
them so a string has a property called
dot length or length rather and what
that means is the strings you can
essentially you'll see we have this
hello world it's 11 characters 11
counting the empty space here as well so
Hello is 5 world is 5 in this empty
space is 11 today we needed to get that
length we could with dot length you see
we get 11 out here
it's one the properties of string one of
some other things to consider is strings
have about 20 or 25 different methods or
functions these are special things that
we can do a set of instructions that we
can go and do to the string like let's
say instead of instead of actually
getting the lengths we wanted hello
world to be in Hall in uppercase we
could call dot - excuse me on the string
example dot - uppercase
like so and you see hello world will
come out here and vice versa if we
wanted to call a dot to lowercase we
could do that as well
another one to keep in mind is trim so
this might be a little hard to see here
but if we were to actually call the
length of this string right like we did
earlier it's not gonna be thirty-one
trim we'll take the empty characters on
the left side on the right side of the
string and remove them before it not
trauma trim and you'll see now when we
call dot length on it we can get eleven
again you also notice how we can chain
these together these functions so we
have our original string which we then
shorten and then we get the length of
again one more thing I wanted to show is
the split method of strings this is
going to allow us to take our string and
turn it into an array of strings so
before we move on let's go ahead and
just make a return that back to normal
so split takes in what is called a a
value a parameter and you'll see if we
put an empty character here it's gonna
actually split the words on every single
character so you'll see this is called
an array and we'll dive a little bit
more interest later on in this section
just split is a very commonly used thing
especially in getting started doing
basic algorithms and you'll see it's
breaking out these work this string here
into an array of every single character
even the empty character and say we
wanted to break it out into a word array
we're going to break it out on this
empty space here and now we have our two
words in our list so those are some sub
methods I want to talk about let's go
ahead and dive a little bit into numbers
next
all right so numbers are pretty much
exactly what you expect in JavaScript
one thing to keep in mind if you're more
familiar with more object-oriented
languages and traditional languages
there may be several different number
types
that's not how JavaScript works there is
just number if we have a floating number
currently we have an integer but let's
say we under 724 for seven days a week
24 hours a day or something like that we
get 7.24 that's still a number it's not
a floating-point number now one things
that we can do is we can call upon the
number type and we could actually parse
an integer from there that's one of the
cool things that we can do let's say we
only care about the integer we want to
parse that and you'll see we're only get
to 7 now you can also parse a float
which is fine this little parse a float
and give us our number but let's say we
wanted to even say we wanted to drop we
only we wanted to round this to you know
they're naive around it
we just wanted one index value here how
would we go about that well we use this
wonderful two fixed and let's actually
just do 5 and you'll see it's actually
gonna add zeros on but if we did you
know something like like I don't know
what's a good one we'll just hold down
three for awhile you'll see that it's
going to actually drop them off it will
only get to five places and if we want
to get to one there if we even just
wanted to get to zero we could do that
and negatives aren't gonna work right
because it's Dutch just doesn't work
that way and the reason it says up to 20
is because javascript has a cap of
numbers that are quote unquote safe and
that that's beyond the scope of this but
you know you can get three places so
that's a little bit about numbers you
can add numbers as you might expect
let's just for the simplicity go back so
you can add numbers we can multiply by
numbers we can - by numbers we can
divide by numbers and we'll go a little
bit into modulo and things like that
later on in the video
so bullying a boolean value is the next
data type we're gonna talk about this is
essentially true or false at the end of
the day and that that's really it I it's
I mean they're right there's a little
bit more complicated call there are
there is a little bit more complicated
aspects to it so you have true you have
false notice that they're both lowercase
oh there are things called truth II
values and false e values in JavaScript
and this is part of the if you see a lot
of hate for for JavaScript this is part
of it so let's go ahead and take our you
can use this boolean word and this is
gonna return true or false if it for the
boolean value so in this case is false
and we want to get the boolean value of
something so the boolean value of false
is false the boolean value of true is
true nothing changes there but there are
some very strange things that happen in
JavaScript where if we put in like
single quotes this is going to return
false if we put if weird half a any
words or a space that we return true and
that doesn't that doesn't matter of
quotes and I don't even know if it
matters from back takes for that matter
no it doesn't so there's also so false
returns false for the boolean value
that's actually it looks like the
intellisense the scheme has some issues
so just go ahead and put that down a
couple of zero will return false as well
one will return true so sometimes you
might see that interchangeably a little
note as well negative zero returns false
null and undefined which we'll talk
about a little bit later returns false
so as undefined as well as as well as
not a number which is a very unique data
type that we're not really going to
cover in this video so boolean czar true
or false values at the end of day yeah
you can think of it as a coin one side
is true one side is false it's always
used bullying's when it's always going
to be one thing or another and it's very
helpful when we get to control flow and
if statements and and how that all works
it's a so boolean czar something you're
gonna have to be very comfortable with
moving forward in terms of truth eval
use it's basically anything that has a
value you know hello world a number
anything there so truth II values and
falsity values are something that are a
little bit strange for a lot of
developers we're just getting started
but it's something to be aware of when
you and will cost you issues when you're
getting started if you aren't aware that
this is a thing in JavaScript alright so
let's talk about a raise we showed you a
little bit earlier when it came to
JavaScript two strings how to split a
string into a string array and array of
strings so what is an array an array at
the end of the day starts off with these
little curly these little brackets here
and what it is is it's a list whenever
you want to deal with multiple values
you're probably gonna be using an array
now is there's a property on a rake
called dot length right so remember how
we could check the length of a string
and see how how long it is in a raise we
can see how many items are in the array
right now it's zero so if we wanted to
add zero actually it will do eleven ten
a five for something like that
you'll see that we have a length of five
there are five values in here another
thing to keep in in mind when it comes
to a race that you can access them by
putting in what's called an index value
so if we put index zero you'll see we'll
get eleven a raise start on these zero
index they don't start at one so this is
0 this is 1 this is 2 this is 3 this is
4 so even though the length is 4 if we
were to actually try every length is 5
because you know there's 5 items but
there's up for 0 to 4 for the index
values if we were to check 5 here we're
getting undefined because there's no
there's no 5th index there's a 0 which
is 11 there is a 1 which is 10 there is
a 8 or excuse me a 2 that is 8
there's a 3 that is 5 and there is a 4
that is 4 now let's talk a little bit
about
about some of the more common ways to to
work with erase and there are a ton
arrays this is one of the most important
topics we're only going to be talking
about five methods that party erase but
there's probably about 20 that you
really should know inside and out it's
gonna be one of the largest parts of
your learning when it comes to
JavaScript and I go into in my course
break it all out a little shameless
self-promotion link in the description
below get it with a coupon anyhow
shameless self-promotion but really
there are this is going to be the most
important part important data type a
raisin and objects that you're going to
have to master because of how crucial
they are so let's just talk a little bit
about how do we add values to an array
say I want to add a new item to an array
you have what's called push so we can
take our example and we say dot push and
we'll push I don't know of 100 to it and
you'll see like so BAM now we have a new
value here we can also we can also use
pop to remove the last value pop is the
way that we can remove the ending value
so have example dot pop and you'll see
we'll lose that I'm gonna pop again if
we wanted to although I've never excuse
me not on the same pop we can go example
dot pop and we've remove another value
now we don't have that for that was
originally in there there's also the
ability to shift so let's say we want to
always get shift confused with and
you'll notice that if we're using the if
we're using one thing I should mention
is that we're using Visual Studio code
we have what's called intellisense which
will bring up these functions that are
that deal with this data type and you'll
see here you can see when shift removes
the first element from an array and
returns it so let's say we wanted to
remove the very first element which is
11 we could do that by just calling
shift on it and now we don't have 11
there now how would you
imagine that we would add to the very
first element well of course it would be
unshipped
I makes a lot of sense where we could
throw five in there and now we have five
as our a value and you'll notice that
these are all chaining downwards one in
one this is called sink sink Java
JavaScript is synchronous in this
example so meaning it goes sequential
order it nist an she AIT's the the array
it then adds a value it then removes the
value removed from the end it was
another value from then then removes the
value from the beginning then it adds a
value to the beginning which leaves us
with five ten eight and five now let's
go ahead and just comment that out you
know we'll go back to our original array
there's also what's called slice say we
want to specifically remove that 10
value now we can take our example and we
can slice it out meaning that we want to
remove the zero index and you'll see
that what did I do wrong
excuse me splice I said that's a sliced
and eye splice so we'll splice it out of
the array and now our 10 is gone and so
you're sitting you're wondering as what
is slice then well let's say we wanted
to get a value out of a but we didn't
want to change the array you see how
slice actually removed the tenth let's
in our example here instead create a
value will just call it results and
we'll change this to slice and say we
want to console.log those results
there we go so we're gonna take the 11th
slice is going to return the values in
an array format because we can slice
multiple values
so see here we're only slicing from the
zero index to the one index which is one
value right zero to one not counting one
say you want zero two two zero two three
a little worth noting if you don't slice
with any values it's just going to make
a copy of the array now one other thing
is say we want to go we want that 10
value it would be one two two and then
we get an array of ten now in the past
when we have gone and there's primitive
types and then there's other types so
we're not going to dive too much into
that but let's say that we wanted to one
thing that's gonna get very confusing
right now but it's worth bringing up is
that a raise you have to actually go out
of your way to create a new array and
what I mean by that is let's say we have
example two here and we're gonna set
this equal to example one this is going
to create a reference and right down
below we're gonna go ahead and it logout
example two so you'll see right here we
have the same values in the array now
what's going to happen is if we say
example 2 dot push and then we push I
don't know 77 it's actually gonna affect
example 1 let's put a 1 on that instead
of just example example 1 as well
because what's happening here is we're
creating a reference we're not actually
creating a brand-new array which is why
we're gonna bring up map filter and
reduce as well to show you some of the
ways that you can create a new array and
go from there so a lot of times this
isn't what you want to do if you're
setting a variable equal to an array 99%
of the time you actually just want it to
be a duplicate of the Ray values but not
of the array itself which is very very
confusing and I've ran into a lot of
issues when I first started learning
programming why this was happening so
let's go ahead and talk about how we can
create a new value here so say this
example 1
what we can do is we can just map a new
array out and what that means is is it
is the it takes in multiple arguments in
our example we're just gonna pass in
this parameter meaning element and what
that is is all that is is the value in
and you'll notice I'm using an arrow
function this is just a callback
function this is a lot of people get
very very concerned when you start doing
callback functions all this really means
is call a function on every value that's
in the array so every time we ever for
every value in this case we have eleven
ten eight five four do something with
that call this function every single
time and all the map function does is it
allows us to return an element so now
you'll notice that when we map a
brand-new array which creates a new
array in the process that even though
we're pushing two example to example one
is never touched you can do more there's
multiple ways to accomplish this but map
is particularly useful because let's say
you have an array of values and you want
to change it ever so slightly you just
want to add one to the array values you
can do that where we've now created a
brand new array and we've added three to
every single value there and this will
create a new array reducing filter will
create a new array as well but they have
different values so filter is takes in a
callback function as well and I'm
calling an element but you can call it
whatever you want and this is going to
allow us to filter out values that
return true or false so we'll have our
return statement here and let's say we
only want to return values that are
greater than eight so return element the
value that we're checking that is
greater than eight and so you'll see now
that filter will create a brand new
array and the only value that's greater
than eight eight five and four or not 10
and 11 are and so we can filter out
those values that we no longer need and
create a new array in the process which
is why 77 hasn't added one more thing
actually two more things I want to to
showcase is reduce so reduce is is
another way of creating a new value a
new array and reduce will do something
that is we're gonna get rid of this as
well because we're not gonna push to the
Ray anymore let's say we want to return
all the numbers added together reduce
can do a lot of things but this is one
of the things that we can do so I want
your element it takes in two values the
value that you're iterating over element
1 and element 2 for this instance and so
we want to take element 1 and we want to
add element 2 and you'll see we get 38
now what this really is this first value
is the value that we're storing and then
the element two is each iteration that
we're going over and we end up with 38
but this will also create a brand new
array you notice how we don't have 38 in
example 1 the last thing I wanna show
you is for each this is a simple way of
of iterating through your array to do
something and we'll just call element so
let's say you want to run through your
array one time and do something and you
just want to console dot log the value
of the element you'll see you can do
that it's just gonna run through all the
values and you'll notice that this is
undefined it's because for each doesn't
create a new array doesn't do anything
so there's no need for this example to
it doesn't exist there's no reason for
it to exist this is just if you want to
iterate through every value of the array
so we're definitely getting into some
more advanced concepts here when you're
getting started with the race and
there's about 20 other methods how we
could go over but for the the sake of
this video and for trying to keep it to
about an hour these are the ones that I
think are most important when getting
started
there are probably about five other ones
five to ten other ones that are equally
as important but these are the ones I
think are enough to get you going
alright so let's talk about objects
objects are really important when it
comes to the JavaScript you'll see here
I have these two curly braces that's an
object that's why we're done move on no
objects they're a little bit more calm
flex and that but this is the basic
starting point of an object objects have
what are called keys and values right so
in our example here we're gonna go ahead
and set a a key which is name and the
value which is Dylan
you'll see we're printing out here no
big deal
we'll just space this out so we'll
actually call this first name and then
we'll go ahead and say last name and
they'll be Israel and we'll go ahead and
say middle name coding God actual legal
middle name check my purse
oh okay so we have this object this is
our key and the sir value was that mean
well if we wanted to get the value of
first-name we could do that just by
calling our object which is example one
dot first-name now we're now we're just
getting our first-name if we want to do
the same thing for middle name we do the
same and get coding god and of course
for lastname we could do the same as
well now when it comes to objects it can
be multiple data types they don't all
have to be strings it'll all have to be
numbers so we'll do age for instance 30
and then we could do an array in our
object if we wanted to so it would be an
array value of cats 3 so we'll do a
string value of Milo a value here of
teto and you can even do different types
of values in a race as we learned
earlier and even an object so let's go
and throw a name in here of Achilles I
don't know how to spell our cat's name
but I think this is it your boys not the
best speller but we'll say age here too
so you can have this array of objects
here let's just go ahead and say you'll
see dot age just so you can see
everything's getting set and then you
see we do the cats
and we can target that with the array as
we saw earlier with the 0 a 1 would be
Tito a 2 would be our object kilise with
H 2 and we can even target this as well
and say look I just want to know Tito
Achilles his age and we our name and we
can target it like that so you see we're
taking our object and saying look
getting the cats array specifically
index 2 and then calling the name value
of it you you can also use boolean
handsome this is of course true no
semicolon there excuse me handsome said
to true so you can see we can use
multiple data types
excuse the narcissism no huh it's just
trying to have some fun guys so handsome
but you can see that we can have objects
in arrays we can have objects within
objects different data types so address
we could put an object here with Street
and we'll go ahead and put lol cuz I'm
telling you guys we can do city
capital lol and so on and so forth so if
we wanted to access that all we would do
is chain our items here which would be
addressed Street and we could get a
little and so on and so forth
so objects are a really big important
part of data specifically JavaScript
object notation and we'll talk a little
bit about that next so JavaScript object
notation is basically the way that we
get data from databases nowadays and get
items delivered because the front-ends
JavaScript so they need to send the data
back as a JavaScript object now okay
well one other just center-backs
javascript object it's not the best way
of sending in so all this data here in
the database it's actually stored as a
string most of the time so we have this
here so one thing that we can do and
you're saying well how do we how we
parse that string how do we stringify
the string so we have this JSON that
only has really two things that it does
it stringify x' an object and it looks
the same right but basically what's
happening here is this is now becoming a
string you can tell in this example here
where this is in quotes that's one of
the things that json stringify naturally
does is to put quotes around our keys
technically if you wanted to in your
object this would work just fine this is
bad practice though and in modern
JavaScript there's no need to do that
but let's say that we wanted to let's
actually store this in a value so we'll
say let JSON equal this and then we
wanted to output our JSON still be a
long string but let's say now that we
stringify date we wanted to say
something like JSON dot first name
you'll see we're getting undefined why
is that because this is actually a
string now and one way that we could
check that is what we call JSON dot
length you'd see that it's 183
characters long another way that we can
check that is we could do typeof and
you'd see that it's a string now if we
did type of example one it would be an
object and then vice-versa so the number
five it would be a number if we did true
it would be a boolean if we did zero it
would be a number but it could also be
false the way that we evaluate it's
neither here nor there but JSON we
stringify it typically before we send it
to the database so we just sent to the
string and then when it comes back it
comes back as a string but then how do
we how do we get it back into an object
it's pretty straightforward here let's
just go ahead and reset our example one
and we're said JSON dot parse and we're
gonna pass in our example excuse me our
JSON that we just set up here our
variable and now when we take example
one is now back into our example and if
we wanted to get first-name we could
again so just something I wanted to
bring up about how you can take an
object turn it into a string of five
JSON
and then you could take that stringify
table jecht and turn it back into an
actual object that you can use once
again let's let's go ahead and cover a
little bit of three or four of the more
popular methods that you'll be using
with objects next okay so sometimes
you'll need to find out if a property
even exists right so as we showed
earlier we said something like you know
let's say we wanted to get ethnicity for
instance it's undefined I'm clearly
Caucasian though if anyone's confused
supposed to be a joke
anyhow but ethnicity here is not defined
but how would we check to see if it is
using the object methods well there's
this wonderful house own property method
that we can throw on here and what we
can ask is okay well you know his first
name defined in here and you'll see it's
true right we do have a first name key
and vice versa for ethnicity ethnicity
is false right because there is no
ethnicity in our object here that's one
of the more common methods another thing
to keep in mind is that the object class
so if we wanted to use some of these
static methods and we can talk in
another time about what the difference
is between static minutes that's well
not what you really have to know is that
the object methods that we're gonna be
using right now are essentially static
at the end of the day and our prototype
methods and what we're gonna say is hey
what are the keys object keys what are
the keys in this object that's all I
want to know and so what did I do oh we
have this there we go and you'll see
here we get an array of all the keys in
here now notice how it doesn't actually
go and get name an age of you know cats
is just gonna give us the key on the
level that we're checking right here
you'll see address there's no street or
city it's just address but it'll give us
the keys and vice versa we get the
values
well doing object on values and and
you'll see that we'll actually get all
the values but we won't get any of any
of the keys to target them but sometimes
that's all you get one there's a lot of
other great things to use one more thing
that I'm gonna toss showcase real quick
is just the for in say we actually want
to iterate through all the values
I'll just iterate through our object for
whatever reason and we could do a four
in loop and what that is we're gonna set
let I can just say key in example one
and we'll just go ahead and you know
console dot log key which is essentially
doing what we did with keys before
except now we're just printing them out
instead of returning it as an array but
this would be an example of how we would
iterate through again because of the way
that this works is we're only getting a
you know we couldn't say we want our key
here is essentially you know an element
first-name so if we did keyed out
first-name it's only gonna return the
first name for one of them the rest is
gonna return undefined perk sees me
first name key dot so this is our key if
we wanted to get the value we could do
something like this example one then we
could wrap our key in it to get it but
we're getting a little complex but this
is just the reason I wanted to show this
is that this is just one way for you to
to iterate through a object so last but
not least we're going to talk a little
bit about null and undefined these are
things that are equally as important
there's also not a number we're not
gonna focus on that in this course but
just be aware that it's a thing and you
may have some issues here with that I
don't know if it's technically a type
but that is something that should be
talked about you know in a more detailed
course than this so you'll see here
we're actually getting an undefined
value so say you wanted to for some
reason instantiate your object like so
you could with just a semicolon and not
actually give it a value it's gonna
inherit undefined but also for some
reason if you wanted to set it down to
find although this is I think considered
bad convention because it's more code
that does the same thing now you can
also set it to null so what is the real
difference between null and undefined
well undefined typically if something
that is being set as a value is is
either something got missed completely
or a value hasn't been set null means
there is no value which is a it's hard
distinction but one one thing to keep in
mind is we console dot log example one
dot Dillon our name
for instance cannot read proper name if
null let's go ahead and make this an
object real quick you'll see we get an
object here then we get undefined which
means that this name property doesn't
even exist now if there was a name
property that had a null value what that
basically means is that this null value
hasn't been assigned but the property
does exist they are both going to be
false values but I just wanted to sort
of make that minor distinction between
null and undefined but it's to go any
deeper than that would be beyond the
scope of this video but just something
to keep in mind all right so let's talk
about arithmetic operators basically
math operators what are they what they
do well JavaScript works just like you
would expect mass or a five plus five is
ten it's amazing
five plus five minus four it's going to
be six so you can subtract four in terms
of styling in terms of this all work but
it is better is considered better
convention to space it all out you'd
also divide by as well you'll notice
that it's actually doing them on the
math property we don't actually have to
do this javascript understands the rules
of math as every programming language
should and so just for the sake of it
I'll show this but five plus five is 10
minus 2 is 8 right we can also multiply
as well so let's say we want to multiply
that by 4 we're gonna get 2 because what
is the security of this at this point so
2 times 4 is 8
10 minus 8 is 2 so you can multiply now
there's also some other arithmetic
operators that are a little bit more
complex you have this double
multiplication times
and let's actually do this to to the to
what this is not this isn't actually
multiplying this is 2 to the power of 2
now this is a feature that is that I
believe isn't necessarily supported by
all browsers so if you're going to be
using this just be aware that you may
run into some issues there's a math
library that we could use to put
something to a power so if we did this 3
to the third power that's going to be
equal to 3 times 3 times 3 which is 27
right 3 times 3 is 9 times 3 is 27 then
we did it to the fourth power is going
to go 81 because 27 times 3 is 81 of
course but you get the idea so that's
one thing to do but basically everything
you should know about math the thing
that may be a little bit new to you is
the modulo operator what does that mean
what does that do what does this % mean
it essentially means return the
remainder of something so if we have 4
modulo 4 returns 0 because 4 divided by
4 has no remainder if we have 5 modulo 4
it returns 1 because after we divide by
4 all that's left over is 1 and that's
what we're returning with the modulo
operator vice versa if we go up to 6
it's going to return to if we go up to 7
it's going to return 3 and finally if we
go back up to 8 it's grant to return 0
because it divides evenly into it so
what happens when we return when we
modulo a smaller number by a larger
number it's just going to return the
whole number right because it never
evenly divides anything so it's going to
return the whole number so if we have a
1 0 modulo 4 negative 1 modulo 4 in
return negative right so that's the
modulo operator it just returns the
remainder of an item all right let's
talk a little bit about relational
operators now so we have our example
here and essentially zoom in just a
little bit
that's pretty large but we'll overall
with it so what are relational operators
they're basically ways to similar to the
math operators remember this greater
than or equal to this is gonna
essentially evaluate our code and find
out there if a true or false value is 5
greater than or equal to 5 yes it is
is it equal equal to 5 yes it is is it
doubly equal to 5 yes it is I'll talk in
just a second about what that means is
that less than or equal to 5 yes it is
is that less than equal to 5 no it isn't
right
5 is not 5 but it's 4 less than 5 yeah
it is so we have greater than we have
less than we have less than or equal to
we have greater than or equal to those
are those are the easy ones the
relational operators so what was this
double equals and what was this triple
equals well let's start by making a
number 5 and a string 5 so when we do
double equals we see we get a true value
why is that well double equals
JavaScript is what's called a
dynamically typed language and what that
means is that you can change values of
in a lot of languages when you have a
number 5 like so if we wanted to then
reset that value for example 1 to be
equal to I don't know an empty array for
instance you could do that in JavaScript
a lot of other languages won't let you
do that
but javascript is dynamically typed and
because of that it allows us to do some
very by most people's standards strange
things so let's say we just want to see
if number 5 is equal to string 5 that's
true because the double equals is
checking the value and not the type
meaning that this is value 5 this is
value 5 but this is type of number and
this is type of string so that is what
we call loosely equals and in general
you want to not do this as very bad
practice but here's something to be
aware of and you'll notice right now
that's returning true right number 5 is
equal to string 5 because all we're
checking is the value but let's say that
we want to check
the type and the value so we have value
5 number 5 cool that first check is good
but now we're doing the triple equals
which means we're doing a strictly
equals and we're checking the type as
well so number is not equal to string
which is why it returns false so keep
that in mind in general you're going to
always be using triple equals it's good
coding convention and something that you
should adhere to javascript although it
is dynamically typed language is moving
in a direction to be more strict with
its it's coding which is why things like
typescript exist I actually introduced
some equality operators in the
relational operator so I apologize about
that earlier but one more thing that I
wanted to show about the Equality
operator says we only showed equal to
there's also this not equals 2 which
works exactly like how you'd imagine
except we're checking the knot value
right is 5 not equal to MI be a little
easier here to put 5 no it that's that's
a false statement right because 5 string
num type and value is returning false
even if it's just value because we have
this single equals is returning false
now if we did the double equals on it
the not double equals is gonna return
true right because the value of 5 is
equal to 5 but the type number is not
equal to the type string which is a
false statement which then returns true
right because it's not that that is not
true which then returns the value so
that's just one more thing I wanted to
show when it comes to I kind of combine
relational and equality operators but
another equality operator keep in mind
all right so let's talk a little bit
about increment and decrement and we're
also going to be talking about the
assignment operators as well so what is
increment and decrement so you'll see we
have our variable here example 1 and we
want to let's say we just want to add 1
there's actually a really easy way that
we can do that is we could say example 1
+ + you see it there is equals 6 which
is nice right
you can also minus 1 which is minus -
very cool it's a very easy way to
increment
decrement when it comes to JavaScript
now oddly enough you'll see here we do
plus plus and we still get the same
value we get minus minus so what's the
difference between doing a plus + or
minus - on the beginning of a string or
in industry well let's actually do it in
the console log here let's get rid of
this go to the console log exactly so we
do plus plus you see it's it's nothing
nothing's really happening if - a - -
nothing's really happening why is that
well because it happens after this line
basically we're adding on this line in
this sort of sequential order now if we
did it on the beginning here which is
four and we did it on the beginning here
which was return 6 it's because that
that's the difference is we are
essentially telling JavaScript on this
line we want it to increment this value
because it's important for this line now
does this come does this come in into a
lot of things no most of the time you'll
see plus + or minus - on the end but is
worth making note that that is something
that can happen now what do we what
happens if we want to actually set
example one to something we don't want
just increase by one how would we go
about that well we could have example 1
+ equals 5 and it's going to actually
add 5 to it
exactly like that and this + equals if
we were to write it out would
essentially be example 1 is equal to
example 1 plus 5
same exact thing it's just a shorthand
of doing it and vice versa 4 minus
equals 5 we can minus 5 like this as
well we can also multiply 5 this way as
well so let's divide 5 this way as well
it is again exactly the same thing as
putting an example 1/5 this is some of
the ways that we can increment and
decrement and honestly the the plus
equals if that's what you need to do is
the preferred way when it comes to
writing clean code you can also do the
modulo
operator remember we did the I just
talked about modulo where we can say
example one modulo five is gonna return
zero because 5 divided by five is zero
if we did this by for us can I remainder
of one we need the same thing with our
operator here to return modulo as well
let's talk a little bit about variables
now we're in the declarations section so
far you've been seeing me only you slit
there's technically three types of
declarations there is var which will
work just fine there's a reason we don't
use var anymore and we'll talk about
that right now
so there's var and let which is the new
version of far moving forward as a
developer you no longer want to use var
at all it's essentially been deprecated
if you want to think of it that way
basically there's an issue with var and
let and to give you a very brief example
let's create a variable here called I
and I is equal to zero
well I is less than 5 I plus plus so
we're gonna be going over for loops in a
second but this is a good way to give an
example so what this for loop does is it
iterates through the code and so you'll
see here it goes through five times and
remember plus plus a double adds one it
goes zero one two three four and then it
stops however if we were to console dot
log the value of I right here
we would actually get access to it and
it would be five the reason for that is
we're using var which uses a and this
this is okay if you don't fully
understand this this is an introduction
video but the reason for it is it uses
what's called function scope essentially
and what that means is that variables
get hoisted to the there's their parent
scope essentially and gets hoisted to
this level and now we have access to I
which has a value of five and it's not
as strict and it causes a lot of issues
so let was introduced where now if we do
let it's called block scope which means
this block of code is the only place
that let is and you'll see isin is not
defined
which allows us to not make those airs
and cause a lot of issues down the road
so the very brief example of why we're
being using light but for the most part
if you see someone use of I you dar VAR
no longer use VAR e ops and an awful
thing you should be using let and let
allows us to similar to var allows us to
reset values as well so if we want to
set that to 10 you know example is now
10 there's one more declaration we need
to talk about and that's Const so I'm
going to change this let to a Const and
you'll say assignment to Kant's variable
you'll see it's not printing the reason
for that is Const is refers to constant
right so when you're gonna use a
constant you can use Kant's for the
primitive values primitive values being
numbers and we'll go ahead and give an
example here so primitive values main
numbers primitive values being strings
primitive values being true or false so
those sort of primitive values now why
am I saying primitive values well
something that's not a primitive value
is an array and say we wanted to push to
that array and modify even though it's a
Const we could but if we wanted to
completely override that value and set
it equal to 8 for instance we would have
an issue this is the same when it comes
to objects as well so let's say we have
an object right we can't push to it cuz
it's not an array but we could set the
name equal to Dylan so don't think at
work don't think it's a constant in the
same thing but we are we also couldn't
of course that example 1 equal to 5 so
it's a little bit stricter is the point
of it but when it comes to arrays and
Const and and objects it's little
there's a little bit more breathing room
but something to consider when you're
working with your variables and uh your
variables and different data types for
your declarations all right so let's
talk a little bit about if-elsif and
Elson how they work and what they do so
an if statement is and if else if and
else statements are conditions that
control the flow of your code that's
control flow what I mean by that is you
can set up an if statement with these
blocks that if what's in here is true
and we're just gonna hard code it's true
it's gonna do something right so in our
case just the console dot log ran and
you'll see it is running but if this is
false we're never actually gonna get
this because this code never runs
because this condition here is not true
and so we can do example one like so and
you're like okay well this is true and
you pass variables then this is false so
it doesn't run you can also you know
remember those equality operators that
we talked about is five less than four
that's false right Vica and then that's
not gonna run but it's five less than
six yeah it is one other thing that I
actually forgot to cover was you can do
let's talk a little bit about and or or
which is something that we haven't
covered so let's say we want to see if
two things are true so is this true and
this true it runs but if this is so both
these sides of this hat this and
essentially means both sides have to be
true
so if one of these is false our code
here in this block is not going to run
now there's also the or operator which
only one of these has to be true to run
either or right so if both are false is
not going to run right but if one is
true it is gonna run so that's all right
that's our and an or operator switch I
forgot to cover my apologies so this if
statement does that so what is it what
is it else if so an else if is a
statement that only runs if the previous
if statement fails so else if true we'll
just put true in here and we'll put will
console dot log else if
else if and we'll go ahead and put a hit
from here so and because good syntax is
going to a semicolon so you'll see this
isn't running because our or statement
our if statement here is running now if
we change this to an and it's gonna fail
because it's gonna return false here
because this is now failing this if
statement never runs or it does run it
just doesn't pass its condition here so
our else--if is true and thus it runs
now it can it will be evaluated similar
to how anything else is it's not always
going to run the else if only runs if
it's previous offense and you can nest
these else ifs as well so if we have an
if and we want to have another else if
we could do that as well so else if you
know else if true and we'll just console
dot log second else different you notice
it's not running right only this one's
running because this else if is saying
look these if say this is statement this
statement needs to return false this if
statement needs to return false
otherwise I can never run but if they
all return false so does I finally get a
chance to check my condition here and
then it runs again it's not always going
to run only if this statement here
evaluates to true and then finally
there's the else now just if it's not
apparent you can't have an else if else
if there's no if right if always needs
to be there so this else statement
you'll notice there's no condition here
the reason for it is the else is really
the default value if everything else
fails right you only run this if
everything else is false and so we'll
just go ahead and put a little log here
console dot log else
and so you'll notice that this is true
this is false this is false so this is
true this runs you know Falls here and
bam our else runs but if we change this
to true if any of these are true else
never runs that's really it else is the
default value and so you'll be using a
lot of these with it this is how you
control the flow of your code so that's
if else if and else so let's go back to
make an array real quick and we want to
create a value here and we're just going
to go ahead and put Dylan put a value
and we'll do coding and we'll do a value
here and then we'll do God and then
we'll do a value here Israel all right
so that's our that's our array let's say
we want to iterate through this array
and well you already talked about for
each let's just talk about a basic for
loop we want to iterate through for a
set amount of times how many times in
this case the will do a will do the
length of the array so how do we
remember let's let's sort of chain this
together right so example 1 dot length
is so we'll say well example 1 dot
length or excuse me
example 1 dot length is greater than I
why that's a true statement
I plus plus we can iterate through it
and all we want to do here is console
dot log example 1 well that's all we're
trying to do we're trying to print out
each value for it here example 1 index
value which is I so I is the current in
value we're starting remember arrays
started at 0 and then we're saying while
this is a true statement go ahead and
print this out and actually I've put
this in a wrong way normally you would
see eyes less than example dot length
same thing in this case just a weird way
of putting it I don't know I did that
probably just because I'm recording a
little bit nervous right so and then
every iteration we're gonna iterate
through this value but this is one way
how you would iterate through an array
you would say hey while I is less than
the length of the
go ahead an increase by one and then if
we wanted to get that value of the rate
we would just pass I in like so let's
give a different example though we're
gonna create a variable here called
total then we're set total equal to zero
and then instead of a string let's go
ahead and pass in a bunch of values here
zero will pass in a bunch of it instead
actually let's eliminate the array all
together and just hard code F value here
so while I is less than 5 I plus plus so
what we want to do here this out for the
time being we just want to say total
remember that plus equals I and we just
want to add all the values of FI
together and then at the end here we'll
go ahead and return total I'll comment
this back in and you'll see here we get
10 right so what is total as we're going
through you'll see total starts off as 0
and then add 0 nothing happens and then
it adds one cool one adds at 0 and then
it adds 2 which 1 plus 2 is 3 and then
it goes another loop and then goes we in
console dot log the value of I as we do
it just to make it a little bit more
clean but you'll see here we're adding 0
then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 and then
we're getting our final value here which
is 10 so 4 loops are used when we need
to do a set amount of iterations and
that that's really their purposes well
we need to essentially just repeat code
that we you know for a set amount of
times that's why we use for loops so
let's talk about switch statements a
little bit what is the switch statement
a switch statement is something that you
want to do when you are trying to when
you know that the answers of a value and
you are going to say hey if it's if it's
this value do something if it's this
other value do something let's give an
example so let's set a string here and
we'll go ahead and change this total to
example and we'll get rid of they'll
comment this out so what we're gonna do
is we're gonna create a switch statement
which takes in a value in our case we're
gonna pass in our variable here example
and it's going to check what we call a
case here
we say if the case is Dylan we wanted to
do something but let's say it's my last
name we could then say console dot log
last name and then we're going to use
this break keyword the reason we do this
is so that it exits out of the switch
statement that's what that break is
saying now we're gonna set another case
where if it is Dylan which it is right
which example is equal to Dylan we just
want to console dot log first name and
you'll see it hits it because it is
Dylan and then we of course as I
mentioned want to break this as well to
exit out of the loop the reason for that
is in theory we could actually have
multiple cases that do multiple things
it's bad convention we don't want to do
that the only reason you wouldn't use a
break statement here is if you're using
a return statement which would
automatically break you out of the loop
and last but not least we have this
default statement you can think of this
as our else where if all the cases fail
we have a default a default statement
we're okay it's not first name it's not
last name so in our example I guess it's
got to be middle name dr. right and then
we'll say must be middle name it's not
in this case but let's go ahead and save
it so if we change this to Israel our
case here is Israel args we know we're
passing an example into our switch
statement and we're saying hey this case
in the case that it's Israel go ahead
and print that out and then exit exit
this switch statement you know if we
didn't have that let's go ahead and just
comment this out you'll see that we're
gonna have some issues where now this
can actually go and hit this and that's
that's why we need the break statement
even though it's not right because of
how long q-switched statements are so
make sure you break your statements the
same thing with default although in
theory you don't need to for default I
actually couldn't tell you if it's a
good convention or not anymore to use
breaks the reason why it you don't
really need to use it for default it's
last value there's nothing to run after
but you'll see here we have Israel let's
say we put coding God in here we'll get
pay must be middle name right because
this failed this failed and by default
that's its value so that's switch
statements I so while loops are
particularly fun because you're most
likely to create an infinite loop an
infinite loop is bad code you've wrote
that will never exit out right you know
our for loop runs five times and it
never exits out of the code essentially
you can do very easily with a while loop
and then break your code so be careful
when you're using wild loops it's not
the end of the world or anything we all
write infinite loops all the time but
just something I wanted to mention so
let's say we don't know how many times
we want to run eight we need we need to
read run our code a set amount of times
we don't know what that set is we can
use a while loop and then we'll just go
ahead and create a variable here that
will call this count we'll just make it
ten and we'll say we'll say well true so
now you'll see here that our code is
breaking right because we never exit out
of the code we don't do anything with
this and so it's actually getting a
little slow right now so what we want to
do is we want to break out of this loop
after you know well say well instead of
true let's say well count is greater
than zero and so we're gonna go ahead
and create a variable or we'll say hey
every iteration count - - equals - so -
you from every count otherwise console
dot log count and so you'll see we'll
run this five times and then break out
of here you can also do a while true
because really this is all it's
evaluating - is a true or false
statement now we're not sure how many
times it's going to run and we do
something like so you'll see it's not
printing here because it's a
we haven't actually in our wall wall
while loop excuse me we haven't actually
put any way for it to break the loop
which is why this isn't printing out
because it pronounced an infinite amount
of numbers right now in a negative
direction and so we can go ahead and do
something well you know if count is less
than or equal to 105 and you uh return
false
now break us out we can also just do
break that will break us out and now
you'll see we'll hit 8 6 4 and this 4
runs again right because even though
this is because this runs above this but
that's a while loop sometimes we don't
know how many times we're gonna be
running our code in our case here we're
sending some basic logic to break out of
it but this is one way that we can run a
run our code without knowing how many
times it needs to run alright there's
also the do-while loop is just very
similar to the while loop except the
setups a little bit different and it the
main difference between a while loop and
a do-while loop is a do-while loop will
run at least one time so what how do we
set that up well we have a do right
above our while loop and then we have
this brackets here where the main
difference is our logic is going to be
in the do loop and then our wall we
don't have these closing brackets we're
just gonna essentially have our
condition which is you know 2 is less
than 3 or something like that which is
you'll see here 2 is less than 2 2 is
less than 3 so when this is false this
is gonna run at least one time right so
that's why we get this 8 2 is not less
than 2 you know well true it's gonna
keep running until we break out of it
here but if this is false it's gonna do
that one iteration with a do-while loop
that's the only difference it's a little
bit different setup honestly I can't
even remember I've if I've ever written
a do-while loop in a application
it's not something I used too often but
it is worth noting it the last thing
that we're gonna talk about is functions
I actually forgot to put this in here so
if you're wondering like oh man Dylan
looks like he's evolved he's got a
haircut he looks a little younger
something like that it is because I
forgot to talk about functions so what
are functions well functions essentially
are ways that we can reuse our code at
the end of the day and write reusable
JavaScript so that we don't have to
rewrite things time and time again so
let's go ahead and define a function
called add-here and so basically our
code is going to be between these curly
braces and then this is the name of our
function and right now all we want to do
is maybe return five and let's go ahead
and launch our quill couple in real
quick and then say we want to console
dot log the add function whatever that's
returning back right it's going to
return back five it's going to should
return five there we go so see five but
let's say we want to do it again and
again and again you see that you see the
idea why we have these functions defined
now let's let's make our function a
little bit more complex we want to add
two numbers so functions take in what
are called arguments you might hear the
term parameters as well they're pretty
much interchangeable you don't have to
worry too much about it but let's say we
will have this bead enum one and we want
to add to five here we want to say 5 is
plus whatever no one values and we get
not a number because we haven't put the
value in here but let's say we have
three then we have two then we have one
and so we can make our code not only
dynamic but we can also have the logic
in our functions so that we don't have
to rewrite the same logic again and
again and again as you progress in
programming you'll hear about solid
principles and one of those principles
is don't you know don't repeat yourself
is part of that's dry but part of good
coding is
repeating yourself as the point I'm
trying to make and so functions can also
take in multiple parameters here so
we'll say this is num2 so basically the
difference between parameters and
arguments is parameters num1 and num2 is
parameters but the actual values that we
put into the function itself are the
arguments that's a that's how you have
to kind of think about it so will you do
five oops 3 &amp;amp; 5 2 &amp;amp; 2 and 101 you know
we're not doing anything with it but we
wanted to we can go ahead and add num2
to it and of course all the rest of our
java scripts that we wanted could work
so let's say we want to create a
variable create a constant because we're
not modifying it after this oops Const
total it's equal 2 num1 plus num2 and
then we just want to return the total
there we go
I'll get the values so all our
JavaScript of course works in functions
which is a very brief introduction to
functions to get you going hey baby I
just got done with my my TL DR
JavaScript video pretty exciting stuff
