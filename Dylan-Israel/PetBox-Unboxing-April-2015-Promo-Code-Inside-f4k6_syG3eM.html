laughing thank you
alright guys we're going to be talking
about the pet box you can get your own
pet box of get pet box calm it's pretty
cool box pretty compact this is a ten
dollar box it's called the snack box it
goes all the way up to 50 so it goes 10
20 30 40 50 it's a monthly pet food /
tree / toy even subscription box and as
you can see without my cat Milo right
here and titos off to the corner over
here buddy and they're waiting to get
some of their treats because this is our
second take a very shaken it and they
are ready for some some good stuff so
let's see what we have here the first
thing we have our dental treats these
are grain free it's on the higher end
stuff I know a lot of people may not
know about dental treats and stuff like
that but your pets actually have a lot
of teeth tissue my lil have had in the
past where we've had to take him to the
vet and get his teeth clean because they
were actually rotting but um it's great
free it's made with real chicken grain
grain stuff with grain are going to be
your lower quality products that are
like two three dollars so this being
grain-free you're probably looking at
like a six dollar bag here maybe maybe
even more depending on where you did it
but for me this is worth about six bucks
and I like that a lot so let's see how
they activate to the great day they just
met but I've never known them to turn
down any treats so you can see Milo's
like let's get I'm all about it right
now and he knows like nom don't don't
keep me out of it so here here's some
for you let's see how they like it
because I'm not going to try it like
and they kind of look like brown Fortius
strips or some sort of check mix or
something but as you can see they are
voracious Lee ready to get down on this
right now these are these are supposed
to be good for your teeth so they're
also gluten free grain free and number
one thing is chicken oh we don't buddy
hi I here you go we got more treats so I
saw dental treats are ago they are
devouring them they've both got about
six or seven the next thing I got was
were they got with some grain free cat
treats these are made with turkey and
cheddar their grain free gluten free
just like before it's so great to have
great the grains are really bad for a
lot of core and a lot of just stuff that
you wouldn't like what your cat actually
ever eat corn No okay so they should be
putting into their treats so the number
one ingredient this is turkey so let's
see let's see what we got here for you
guys already and they're all they get my
sip walks on them so they don't go bad
this is one this feels more like a dog
treat like I don't know that's cheddar
yeah you're gonna supply all right so
here you go right yep you know
they can swat a fly out of the air they
can't see a treat two feet in front of
them so let's see I don't Tito doesn't
seem to like him but I don't know he
doesn't desire him but the dental treats
they were all about oh there you go all
right so the last but not least or
something that's kind of cool um they're
one hundred percent human grade so if
times are hard there's an earthquake or
something you can you can eat one of
these bad boys number of ingredients
dehydrated turkey and chicken depending
on which one you get so human great
products you can eat them they're good
to go there it's as if they were making
it for us and so this is supposed to be
a complete and balanced meal also great
for you know he's trying to open up the
treats over here so he's he was really
about these dental treats but um so also
cage free turkey so if you're conscious
with free range chicken as well this is
kind of cool so there are one else
packages you add water so it's probably
more like a six out of six you probably
had about 5 ounces and they're good to
go I don't know if I would use the third
cup of water serve it I don't know if
this is reasonable to use all the time
but it's kind of a cool little gift here
pet something different that doesn't
come in a can they can appreciate that
so just to go over a real quick we've
got the dental treats would say
absolutely love well we'll get back to
you on whether they like this this
dehydrated but I know my cats and it's
probably they'll eat it they love it and
then the grain free savory turkey and
cheddar which they didn't like as much
but it seemed to me don't oh good so a
special shout-out to Samantha who asked
me to make one with the cats I'm the
crazy cat guy at the end of the day and
I love my pets beyond death so hope you
