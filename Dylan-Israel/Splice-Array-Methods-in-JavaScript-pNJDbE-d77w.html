about how to add something to the end of
it right
how to remove something from the end of
the right and we've talked about how to
add something to the beginning of the
array and how to remove something from
the beginning of the array so now what
we're going to talk about is how to add
and remove stuff from the middle of an
array and so to do that we have to use
the splice method and we're gonna get
started with that alright guys so we're
gonna talk about how to add stuff to an
array in the middle of the array and
delete things from the array so first
thing to keep in mind is you may under
the leap and then call out the array at
let's just say this to the one in next
spot at two so this will actually delete
the two but also leave undefined so now
our output right here will just have an
empty space now that's okay if that's
what you're looking to do in my
experience that's typically not what I'm
looking to do so just to clear that up
we're gonna have one undefined and then
we're gonna have our three four five and
six so that's what our array would look
like at that point so let's just go
ahead and address that but now that's
good let's get back into splice real
quick so splice has three parameters
that can be called only two are required
the first one is the index in which you
want to start at and the second one is
how many variable or how many how many
inputs in the array you want to delete
so in this first one let's say we don't
actually want to delete anything but we
want to add a we want to add at that
spot is a new number for instance so all
we would have to do for that is say
array and we'll say we'll want to add it
at this to spot array dot splice we'll
say at the index one spot so again this
is 0 1 2 3 4 5 so in index 1 spot we
want to add
after that so zero means we're not gonna
delete anything because this is where
you define how many numbers are gonna
delete we want to add the number 200 so
now we're gonna have 1 1 2 excuse me
1 2 200 etc and then you know 3 4 5 6
so let's actually say that we want to go
ahead and delete that number it's just
doing we will delete 2 numbers in this
case so well didn't wanted to but we're
not gonna replace anything as well so
now our array would have the numbers 1 4
5 &amp;amp; 6 and their respective indices would
be 0 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 so do keep in mind that you
can also add multiple numbers as well so
let's go ahead and showcase that real
quick so in this case we'll have array
dot splice again dot splice and we'll go
ahead and just will delete tune to
things and we'll add two things so we'll
say starting it to our 1 index we want
to delete 2 &amp;amp; 3 so we're going to delete
2 items and then we're gonna go ahead
and put in the numbers 11 comma 12 so
there are two required parameters here
and then from here on our third
parameter is optional and the way we
separate this is simply by putting a
comma in our third parameter here and
this will let us know that we're looking
to add multiple items so in this case
we're going to go ahead and delete two
and three and our output would be 1 11
12 4 5 6 do keep in mind that you don't
have to delete and add evenly so if we
wanted to change this right here to only
delete one number so we'll go ahead and
delete just the two alright our output
would be 111
12345 and six so that's how splice works
a little bit of insight about delete and
you'll have to decide what works best
for you and what you'll need to do in
the future so I hope that helps clear it
up and I hope that also helps you figure
out what you need to do when talking
about push pop switch on switch
splice and delete so as always guys
