specifically advanced topics in Python
advanced topics in Python so let's go
ahead and get this going all right
so it says create your own Python
dictionary in the editor with two or
three key value pairs so let's say pizza
will do PPG actually PPG this is going
to be equal to we'll do it like this
food :
pizza
gender : guy comma game :
poker and then we'll close our
dictionary and then print the results
print oh they need name this my
underscore dict
and make sure your indentation is
correct
I'm print my I'm just for dict dot items
there you go so that's our dictionary
so if we replace this cause the keys on
my then print mine and this predict dot
values it should print out two separate
things the keys and the values so there
are keys and they are our values cool
seems easy enough alright so for each
key in line did I really feel like I'm
saying my dick but forgot the key then
it's based on a value stored by the key
so they have a nice example here you
should use printing a comma B rather
than printing a please okay so I didn't
know that we could do that but that's
cool so we'll say for key in my dick
with a T my dick I'm thinking of my
dicks your dicks got the HIV my dick
whatever this song I say yeah we want to
print out the key than his face value
values so print key oh my and was
predict key
so you see right here food space Pizza
gender space guy game space poker so
list comprehensions check out the list
comprehensions so evens to 50 this is I
for I Weaver's for 51 if I owe modulo 2
is equal to equal zero print evens 250
okay so we're basically setting a
variable equal to a result of a for loop
and an if statement that's interesting
alright so use this comprehension
building even squares in the editor
you're even squares should include
squares even numbers between 1 to 11
your list should start for 1636 so go
from there okay so look at the example
above so it's all gonna be in a bracket
and we're gonna say I for I in the range
of 1 to 11 so run this for loop in range
from 1 to 11 if
so here's our if so if X modulo 2 is
equal to equal to 0
so if X minus U is equal equals zero all
right so that's right where do we tell
it to square it though this was throw me
off
let's see here
I understand how to square a number you
can use x1 it'll shoot a square number
excellently just check if it's even so
double by three so I don't actually
understand so we have X modulo 2 so this
is checking if it's even
do we just do return X X X 2 all right
no all right so I'm a little confused
about how we oh it's up in the front all
right
so it's X oh my - there we go No
try and arrange pretty hookers alright
so let's go to the forum see what's
going on here we were on 5 of 18 this
comprehension syntax
let's see
yeah this is what I did
so
let's compare this with our code and see
what's going on here so excellent firing
range all right so it looks like we're
our mistake is is that for 100 snaps two
mistakes I see okay so for whatever
reason we use I instead of X which is
fine but we have to make sure we call I
here I just said X once I figured out
that that's where you declare it what
you want it to do and then this needs to
be 12 because we don't actually include
11 there you go so this is what you want
it to do this is how many times you want
it to do and this is an if statement for
that a little bit weird I so useless
comprehension to create cubes by 4 it's
a cubes and a square by 4 4 oops cubes
and there's 4 by underscore for
comparation should consist of cubes this
equals
so we're basically saying I so you need
to cube it qubits to the third power
firm Iraq correctly and I will say for I
in range of 1 to 11 remember start at 1
and we want one more if I wide you low
was it for 4 is equal equal to 0 oh one
too many
looks like Hugh's life force wrongly if
they should have five values
no in this case the cube number should
be evenly divisible by four not the
original number okay so what it's
basically saying here is that I to the
third modulo four needs to be equal
there oops
thank you John three No
looks like nothing we saw and then print
it so cute there you go
so our if see me just need to be
adjusted there they want us to not
actually look at the number but is the
cube of the number divisible by four
that's what they wanted so next is
slicing so let's look at this see if we
can so start and and stride so strides
probably start at two and at nine
increased by two so it's probably going
to all right so it starts at one than it
all right let's just run it so skips two
so there's nine skips
- so there's 25 skips - there's 49 it's
just you that there's 81 and stops okay
um I think I'm coming down with a slight
cold so I do apologize if I'm coughing
or sneezing in this video or any future
ones
all right so useless slicing and print
out every odd element of my list from
start to finish
I'll meant to start and end index you
only need to specify a stride check the
hint if you need help so we start at one
and we only want the odds so and we want
to print so that's first thing and we
want to print my list and here we have
two colons we only need the stride they
say so if we start at one and we only
want the odd I believe if we increased
by two you should just continue so 1 3 5
7 9 cool create a variable called
backwards so backwards set it equal to
the reverse version of my list
make sure the versa listen that by
passing a list slice of mangoes trailing
elbow okay so we can apparently do the
my list : : -1 so that we get the
reverse of the list which is really
helpful to be out without having to do
our own for loop and everything so
that's kind of cool I like that
alright so create a variable back words
by short ends instead of equal the
result of going backwards through to 100
by tens equals 200 and this probably
should just be negative negative 10 and
then print back backwards by chance
leave this correct so cool so we just
started 100 and work our way back by 10
I like that create a list to 21 to
underscore 21 that's just the numbers 1
through 21 inclusively so inclusive so
range
1:22 so you want to include 21 create a
second holistic all odds that contains
only the odd numbers in the 221 so we'll
say odds is equal to to underscore 21
and we're just gonna increase by two
there finally create a third list called
middle and this fourth third that's
equal to the middle third to 21 from 8
to 14 exclusively inclusively so we're
gonna start from 8 to 14 8 to 15 by what
I think that's right middle third is not
defined
oh is equal to to underscore 21 all
right looks like your military's 9 10 11
instead of 8 9 10 11 14 yeah all right
so we just we're off by one there we go
lamb does I don't remember what lambdas
are I just remember not liking using
them ever sorry let's see you here
yeah lambda X is the same as the
function see this file like wait I hate
when they make things where they
already made so they like no man I like
the way we do it can you guess what this
code will print I so we know lambdas a
function sorry saying print the result
of this function with my list so this
should print for X it's gonna print out
all the numbers so it's going to be 3 6
9 12 15 yeah
and 0 cos 0 mod anything is 0 all right
so fill in the first part of the filter
function so the first part is we need to
declare our lambda should ensure that
only Python is returned to filter on the
second part of the filter language its
languages so this is languages so lambda
let's see it let me just mess around
alone 2x X is equal equal to Python
cool so we're basically saying for X if
X is equal to Python print languages
that's kind of what's going on here so
create a list called squares that
consists of squares of numbers to ten so
the squares of numbers to ten so squares
is equal to all right so I like this one
better
versus just equal to X so the second
power for X in range of 1 to 11
all right cool so these are squares we
don't need an if statement for that so
use filter and lambda so filter how
lambda expression print out only squares
are between some X for X if X is less
Sun right X is less this so anyone and X
is greater than 29 comma squares this
could be off a little bit so let's see
so there we go so we got 36 49 64 so
we're saying lambda X so for X if X is
less than 71 and it's greater than 29
print the values that qualified from
squares not too bad
all right so call the appropriate method
movies such that it will print out the
items intent in the dictionary so movie
star items that item
I did that they don't work right
oh don't forget to call print on it
there you go
music comprehension list so we'll do
three underscore by underscore five and
this is going to consist of only numbers
between 1 and 15 inclusively that are
evenly divisible by 3 or 5 so X or X in
a range of 1 comma what's at 16 if X
modulo 3 this equal equals 0 or X modulo
5 secret is here so return all numbers
and three that are evenly divisible by 3
or 5
three five six nine ten twelve fifteen
all threes and fives and of course make
sure you follow the directions and we
should be good so there we go take six
three five six nine ten twelve fifteen
cool stuff alright so the string in the
editor is garbled in two ways first our
messages backwards second the letter we
want it's every other letter useless
slicing to extract the message and save
it to a variable called message
all right so message is equal to garbled
and then we just want to reverse so it's
minus one all right and second let every
one is every other letter and then we'll
say a message it's equal to a message
and we just want every o there so we can
skip some and now we can print out
message
cool I am the secret message that's
actually pretty cool I mean I thought it
was just into xxxxX or some
but so first thing we do we reverse this
one so we this IX is on this end now and
then after that we just skip everyone
with the two alright so to create a new
variable message set it equal to the
filter of lambda L filter out the XS the
second argument will be garble it's
alright so let's fill that out and we'll
say X let's say X is not equal to X
and print message let's see if this
worked cool
I'm another secret message so we just
finished the section just go over this
real quick so we have our garbled string
we say we create a variable that's gonna
filter fences for every character in our
string if it's not equal to X in our
garbled string print that out so I am
another secret message so up next we are
going to be getting an introduction to
bitwise operators and this is kind of
important I don't know why but everyone
always tells me it is but uh to be
honest with you uh they just are it's a
little more in-depth so it's not
necessarily gonna be as object-oriented
focused as some of this course has been
so I'll see you guys in the next video
as always comments questions concerns
and WordPress topics are always
appreciated along with donations which
will be used towards the channel code
CAD me only has so much free stuff and
we're gonna try and do some other more
paid stuff eventually like team
treehouse and other videos so thanks for
watching I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
