gentlemen we are back in code Academy
learn HTML CSS part 1 CSS positioning
layout so let's go to jump right into
this we're wrapping this up so we
basically went over the box model last
time it's very important to see how
things are laid out and we understand
what we're trying to do here so let's go
ahead and move on
so
we're gonna be talking about the
position property this is something I'm
not terribly familiar with so we'll kind
of learn it together so let's go ahead
and see here so position really refers
to the location of the element and how
it interacts with everything else by
default
apparently it's static so we don't
actually need to change this now if we
wanted to just cuz us with the the the
prompt says here let's go to the dot
question we'll go ahead and set a
position and we'll set it to static but
again by default this is what the
browser will we'll have in the system
here
now you'll see right here static this
would be our position push let's say our
question we're there question on here
the content is not changing it's static
it's kind of a weird thing to have like
this but I'm sure we'll be using it so
reset the position the relative
parameter for the relative input allows
you to position it on the webpage
relative to where it is what does that
mean well I think the easiest thing to
do is to kind of see what we're doing so
again remember our question is this
section right here all right
question 2 question 1 no I take that
back so each one of these are questions
so let's go ahead and jump in here and
change this to relative
around that
love these are gonna be hind it hard to
showcase I don't know why this is this
is even here this is making it very hard
to see here all right so the next thing
we want to do is to the top of the div
question again and see the CSS styles
what we want to do is add 250 pixels so
sometimes you may actually just want to
make the block element bigger and you
can do that similar that we did margin
and padding just do top bottom left
right like how they're doing here so in
this case one just do top and won't
throw 240 px
now when we run this you'll see now that
our first question is down here below
which is nice so it's not immediately
covered up by what we're trying to do
so position:absolute basically means
that all the other elements are gonna
ignore it and it's always going to stay
there like we don't care about anything
else this position is their relative is
a little more responsive with when it
comes to the other inputs so let's let's
look at this real quick everything is
kind of cool you're good to go now we're
gonna go to jump to the question or the
header selection excuse me the header
that's this part right here and we want
to go ahead and set position absolute
so you'll see that it's just kind of
always being in the same same area no
matter what now we're gonna go ahead and
add top sit offs offset or just talk
alright so Toph I had a top and left
properties and set them in this so we're
gonna set 0px and then we're gonna say
left 0px because it's probably
inheriting some things as well we want
to go ahead and cancel those out so you
see now this position is absolutely
always here that where we want it to be
it's not gonna be affected by any other
any other block elements or anything
like that you also do fixed see that's
going to change this to fix now if I
remember correctly fixed will make it
stay there no matter if we scroll or not
and you'll see right here that some
elements are passing it up and that's
not too good but the the div here this
block element here is always staying
there always because it's fixed there
and this is something you might use with
menus headers or footers or something
like that I've used it quite often so
the z-index
the z-index really refers to the order
of what lays over what so by default I
believe everything is the same as the
index I don't really remember but uh so
you noticed before that all this is kind
of overlapping on here that's because
this Z index is greater than that one or
vice versa so all we have to do here is
just go ahead and change the Z index to
make it a bigger priority that when
these two overlap we're actually going
to say look our header div takes
priority and and plate over the other
one so here we're just fist as e and X
equal to a thousand just gonna run that
and now you'll see when we do this it's
not overlapping the content technically
it is but you're not seeing it and
that's all that really matters
okay so float what does that mean there
my phone make that noise before all
right float so float you can float
things to left or float things to right
oftentimes this is basically just
shifting things to the left and shifting
things to the right so we have our div
answers like so let's go ahead and jump
on down to that section let's see if we
can find the answer here we are and we
want to go ahead and just assign a float
property and we want it to go left so
all these boxes why doesn't look like
anything changed so you'll see that
these answers are all floating to the
left now as we move farther and farther
away that's kind of what it did it's
kinda hard to showcase that on a single
screen but that's basically what it does
and then you can do it to the right as
well
so you can use this float more than one
thing at a time
oh I haven't actually used to clear
property so the clear property specifies
how elements should behave when they
bump into each other on the page so you
can do clear left side of the element
will not write both nine interesting so
let's go ahead and see the example I
haven't I've never even heard of the
clear property so this will be
interesting
take a look at the answer juice on the
webpage they've been floated left but
the question digits are touching the
answer dish on the right let's fix this
so it's basically saying we don't want
these to be anywhere near it
I believe that's what it's saying so
we're gonna use the clear property to
make sure that it behaves like that the
question is so we're gonna jump to the
question class and we're gonna sit clear
left and this is gonna mean the left
part of our question block should be
clear from that and I believe dropped
down a line if I understood it correctly
so let's go ahead and do this one more
time
you'll see right here it is now no
longer if it touches that it's clearing
it and sending it down to the bottom
very nice something I'm actually going
to be using so thank you coke Adam II
for introducing me back good well ii
thought the layouts on looking so i'm
gonna remove the flow property from the
dot answer and the clear property from
the question okay so they didn't like us
doing that so let's go ahead and just
remove this and this this is actually a
pretty good example of how you'll
actually do your coach kind of guess and
check see what looks nice see what works
clear property it's a pretty cool
position another one of those things
like display them not a hundred percent
i basically only know things i use quite
often i use fixed a bit relative and
absolute a little bit z-index i've used
a couple of times
float you'll definitely lose a lot and
clear is something i've yet to
but I'm very excited to integrate into
my my CSS styling so hope you guys found
this helpful don't forget to Like
