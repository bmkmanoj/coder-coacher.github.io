should you learn PHP or node a lot of
times people want to go in one or the
other direction as they should you
should kind of focus and we're gonna
look at some so stats
we're gonna look at some articles and
I'm gonna give you my opinion as well as
just present what I think is a good
objective reason for one or the other
hey guys a sponsor is me it's so if you
if you're interested in crypto
currencies and you don't know where to
get started I happen to use coinbase
I've used them for quite a bit I like
them it's simple it's easy to get up and
going and you can buy and sell instantly
I like I do is hook up your bank account
so if you're if you're nursing that sort
of thing and you want to get started
with it check out my link in the
description below if after you put $100
in you'll get $10 as a reward for
Bitcoin and so will I so a cool way that
you can help me out so thank you again
to our sponsor me so let me start off by
saying that I've coded in both PHP and
node express all all that great stuff
and MongoDB and my sequel so I'm I'm
pretty familiar with the basics of both
stacks and and I've have professional
experience and PHP and and sort of
personal project experience in node in
MongoDB so what one thing I wanted to
say let's just look at the job trends to
start and I'll kind of give my
impression so here we have and this
isn't the end-all be-all but this is
just something from indeed that I like
to look at because a lot of times people
are asking these questions hey should I
learn PHP or should I learn node which
one should I kind of focus on and it's
to gland a job so we can see here that
PHP in the blue in 2014 had a much
larger share of the market and has been
steadily decreasing and the you'll see
here I have databases as well the reason
I have the databases I kinda have the
the go-to database for the backend
language typically for PHP will be my
sequel most of the time
just so that you could see how closely
it core aligns with its it's sort of
respective partner now PHP will just say
was four times as many jobs in PHP just
three years ago so you can see we're at
point eight and now we're hovering
around point two the reason I think
that's really important is I have this
this mentality that I would rather be in
a job category that is either stagnant
or growing and the scariest thing in the
world is when now we have a surplus of
developers in a decreasing field so in
theory not not you know if everyone lost
their job there's only be 1/4 jobs left
that's not really what's happening
what's happening is is that there's less
PHP jobs and in terms of back-end
languages more jobs are being picked up
elsewhere and you can kind of see with
node and I just chose MongoDB there's a
couple different sort of databases you
can use with node you can see it's kind
of staying steady and I think if
anything give it a little bit time as
new projects are starting it's going to
continue to grow so from a job
perspective I would just even though
there's less jobs in total I also think
there's less developers for those jobs
because here we have 4 times less as
many openings in PHP which worries me
and here we've kind of stayed steady and
stagnant at the very least and hopefully
there'll be growth down the road from a
practical standpoint of of PHP as
someone learning to code I think
full-stack javascript is a much faster
path to becoming a developer because you
get introduced to the back-end
technologies and databases much quicker
than if you did in terms of web
development you know HTML CSS JavaScript
whatever javascript frameworks and then
you have to go pick up PHP which as
someone who's worked in PHP basically
these last nine months of this last year
and with the phret with a framework of
cakephp it gets very very convoluted
because not only do you have to learn
the framework you have to learn PHP and
PHP in itself seems to be at least in my
limited professional experience one of
those languages that requires a lot of
code to do
some very simple things so I know that I
could do something in node in one or two
lines using like Express or something
and in PHP would take me like ten and it
gets very very sort of convoluted over
time and I will say that I like the
documentation for PHP because if you go
on there like a documentation you can
see people are commenting about the
documentation so I think it's really
cool because they kind of expose some of
the gotchas which is nice and this is
just another job seeker interest so like
what are people actually looking for
these are the actual jobs but um I would
say I think not-it's going to be much
easier for someone to learn and get up
and running which is why I lean towards
node but the biggest thing in my opinion
is the sheer amount of frameworks that
go along with PHP I know we're laughing
I reach he's like bro you're talking
about JavaScript I I get that but really
in JavaScript there's two main ones
right there's reacting angular so you
kind of have a choice in PHP you'll see
this article I'm about to show you
eleven best PHP frameworks right you
could even throw a view in there but
that's front end in terms of the back
end
it's just packages and you could kind of
choose what you want I just would be
very worried about learning PHP seen in
three years that the amount of job apps
on indeed at the very least is
one-fourth what it was three years ago
which means that you have so many PHP
PHP developers at the end of the day
that are either let's just say that you
have this the there's always a hundred
job 100 PHP jobs now there's 25 and for
people looking to hire and fill that
role and you have you're going against
especially as an entry-level developer
who's why would they hire an entry-level
developer if maybe for less money but
there's going to be a slight influx of
PHP developers so the barrier of entry
is going to be quite hard which I would
say away from that now if you if you do
say you're like look man I just care
that there's more PHP jobs I hear you on
that
I disagree a little bit but I hear you
so what sort of framework to learn
certain there's been one really
stand-alone PHP framework that has been
taken off and that's been layer veil you
can see here this is from 2012 - I
believe this is 20
teen or 2016 and this is got through
2017 and this is taken from coders eyes
own own survey from PHP developers and
they had 7500 people under it and this
is actually is this the Google stress no
excuse me this is Google Trends and then
down here they have they break it out a
little bit more of their own their own
survey which was pretty pretty on point
with who uses what but you can see that
laravel is the only one increasing here
while all the other are slightly
decreasing not even so slightly right
you see levels making up quite a large
portion of that so if you are going to
learn PHP that is pretty much the only
framework to look at I'll include this
this link in the in the description so
you can kind of dive into a little bit
deeper now one thing I wanted to bring
up since we're talking about back-end
technologies is if you are considering
PHP or node one thing you might want to
consider is c-sharp and net right kind
of in the same category there but you
can see here in terms of share amount of
jobs yes the if we start from five years
ago is that like 1.5 it's now down to
about 1.1 so there has been a decrease
not as much as not in percentage-wise
not as large as PHP but you see that
there's many many more jobs than PHP and
node combined in dotnet and in c-sharp
and that might be something for you to
consider now these are these are
languages c-sharp net are languages that
are more often taught at in computer
science programs and so the the barrier
of entry for those jobs may have to be a
CS degree I I couldn't really tell you
one way or the other but Java C sharp
C++ those are some of the more common
languages object-oriented as you would
be learning in a in a computer science
program well node and PHP not so much
but as a whole it's it depends on what
you're trying to get out of in your
current role so for me I could tell you
that I really didn't enjoy where
in PHP having worked in node I enjoyed
node node felt familiar now that might
have been because I was most familiar
with JavaScript but I've coated in other
languages before and been experienced
you and I could tell you that PHP has a
disgusting learning curve not a hard
learning curve a disgusting learning
curve because of just sort of the code
and the the function names and the the
the convoluted mess of all the
frameworks and and all that sort of
stuff and I never even now nine months
letter later I never really felt like I
fully grasped all of PHP now I could
because I jumped into the cake PHP
framework and I got more custom of that
but I could tell you that I had spent
probably two months trying on my own
time as well as at work for nine months
trying to really understand PHP and to
like it I never liked it and I instantly
fell in love with node and Express and
MongoDB and Mongoose and I really liked
the JSON databases versus a document
oriented databases versus relational
databases that's a different topic so I
would say just just kind of be wary of
what is going on also a lot of times if
you're a full stack developer maybe
you'll get hired for the front-end let's
just have you learn the back end it
really doesn't necessarily matter but if
you if you plan on being a PHP developer
I think the barrier of entry is going to
be harder because the let there are less
PHP jobs popping up year after year
after year so much so that in terms of
pure apps for the last three or four
years it's 75% less I mean while the
amount of jobs which means that there's
more PHP developers going after it I
mean while the amount jobs that have
been in node and slow and steady and I
think eventually will kind of take off
but that's just a personal opinion on it
so for me I would say if you're if your
goal is to go from zero to hero in the
quickest amount of time and just be
exposed to a lot I would say stick with
node and if your goal is to really just
hate yourself and smash your head
against the key
board PHP is a good option for that but
but that's my two cents on PHP verse
node let me know what you guys think you
know job trends aren't everything it's
just one part of the puzzle right I I I
tend to just like to do full stack
JavaScript because I think it's the
fastest way to get a product out and I
think it's the most familiar and you can
learn really deep dive into a single
language also on a side note that when
it comes to node it's still JavaScript
and I did a video recently about why I
thought JavaScript was so amazing in
terms of JavaScript not only you're
doing front-end back-end now you're
doing databases web apps
excuse me mobile apps desktop apps these
aren't things that you can necessarily
do in PHP and you can do some front-end
with PHP but in terms of the the web
excuse me the mobile and in terms of the
desktop applications not so much so you
kind of get that option as well where
you now have a skill set that allow you
to build multiple different types of
applications that you'll you'll gain and
node being javascript leads into that
path as well so those are my two cents
guys or three cents or four cents
whatever you want to call it
I'm sure I'll have a few people who
disagree and I encourage you to let me
know in the comments below because I I
am I this has just been my experience
and you know I know people who love PHP
and we haven't had talked in many years
Manoah but I I I appreciate different
viewpoints so I'm trying to say
let me know what you guys think I'll see
you in the next video like subscribe
