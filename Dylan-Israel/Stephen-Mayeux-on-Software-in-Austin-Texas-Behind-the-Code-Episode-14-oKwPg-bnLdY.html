hey thanks for taking the time man yeah
yeah thanks for having me again
we actually have I don't know if they're
still here but we had we had one or two
people from you the Busan meet up for
free code camp who are those guys
yes they're over here asking when you're
gonna be here they wanted to say hello
but what's up guys are they still there
they're probably sleeping it I think
it's like 3:00 a.m. or something create
over there right now yeah they were
saying it was like 1:00 a.m. I was like
hey for you for powering through but
well I'll have this year you got a lot
of fans man thanks then I got the free
code camp community it's all about YOU
man I got it I got very few fans but but
they go like hundred percent I mean that
they're super supportive I love them and
yeah yeah but thanks for having a dude
yeah yeah um well so last time state to
catch everybody up last time we did an
interview and you were just about to
head into Austin or you had just arrived
and it was like your first week and we
talked about how you're teaching English
in Korea and so I wanted to kind of
reach out to see now that you've been
working as a developer for about six
seven months kind of the same at same
length of time as me is what you've kind
of learned along this sort of journey if
you will oh boy I mean I've learned so
much I don't even know like where to
start or even like how they classify it
yet but what I learned is I guess the
biggest takeaway is one it gets better
and it gets like more and more fun the
more and more you learn so don't give up
yet and and don't feel like oh once I
learned this thing then it'll be all
good and I'll be set for life no no I
always have that that's
you know keep hacking away and keep
building projects but it does get easier
it does get more fun the challenges get
bigger and and yeah yeah your this is
kind of like a life sentence I think
it's I you know I I don't necessarily
like the term life sentence that's the
but it is flex prison yeah it's not
prison but it is like yeah I get your
point to be a good developer you have to
understand that while you're a developer
you're gonna constantly be evolving and
you need to put that effort and energy
into it yeah so you got it like you know
put the effort put the energy into it
you know have a life as well you know do
other things that aren't coding related
but always stay you know hungry and
foolish as you know that's like a common
adage that we say nowadays but yeah
hungry foolish works it's been working
for me yeah now I have it someone asked
earlier they they're wondering you
haven't been too active on YouTube
lately is that gonna change are you
gonna start uploading because right now
I'm doing you know the one-on-one
tutoring and you know with working and
doing all of those lessons that that
does eat up a lot of my time and and
really you know I love offering the
one-on-one lessons I might start scaling
back and you know doing more videos and
like actual you know projects and coding
in the future but to the viewer who
asked that question yeah I really want
to make more videos more on a more
regular schedule now I was like a wafer
for a few months right there yeah and if
you guys I mean I've hired you to tutor
me and you did a excellent such a good
job I made a video about it but a thank
you if anyone's interested in getting
some tutoring through Stephen and covers
a variety of front-end back-end all the
technologies are listed there you can at
the best j/s comm so make sure that if
you guys because i i i encourage people
to get tutoring and mentoring as much as
they can
granted it's cost money but sometimes
one hour of a tutors time is worth about
10 hours
so I you know I don't want to like
become a bootcamp for anything like that
I don't want to you know make these like
wild claims but but you're right you
know it's a you know if you're beginning
and you see a problem that you haven't
ever seen before and the documentation
isn't you know making sense it's like
you're you're like Michael Bolton and
office space you're like one decimal
away for getting your like application
to work but you you spin your wheels for
hours and hours and I'm the guy who like
just moves your decimal place over in
the right place so that you can spend
more time you know you know building
your projects and less time you know
just spinning wheels on these like
little tiny bugs that that that you've
missed anyway that's kind of like what I
like to do to help people just like you
know rocket now like mm-hmm
now you're at a you're at a new company
than the one you you went for did you
how did you originally come across this
job because people are always asking
like about recruiters till they reach
out to you was it a recruiter or how did
how did that sort of job search go yes
so for the for the new company I'm
working at they have they have a couple
of internal recruiters that you know
work full-time only for my company and I
was contacted through LinkedIn so once
again linkedin has scored me yet another
developer job i didn't apply i didn't
send my resume or anything like that
somebody contacted me we had an initial
phone call I was given a coding
challenge and and subsequently a tech
like interview with the follow-up like
offer like pre like I think it was the
same day actually as the tech interview
so it just worked out like really
quickly now was this a you know I don't
know if you're in comfortable so was
this a step up and in pay or how did
that work out for you yeah it was a it
was a step up in pay for sure
and and also you know benefits as well
for our viewers who were like not
residents or have been in the United
States for a very long time
unfortunately your health care is not a
guarantee and it's very hard to find
employers who can offer you you know
very good health insurance and benefits
and you know if you get sick or injured
it's really expensive without it so that
was kind of the impetus that you know to
make me change jobs like so soon I want
the to go for a bigger company who will
offer that so yeah definitely it was to
step up and I just feel like like if I
get hit by a bus it's okay like that I
know I'm gonna be alright I don't have
to pay an arm and a leg for it I might
lose my own that's another matter
however that's good I'm glad that that
worked out for you and it's something
I've kind of I don't say I've preached
about it but I want people to kind of
know that you you really should know
your market value at the end of the day
as a developer and if because I have
recruiters calling me and I'm sure as
they call you all the time promising
crazy amounts of money and things like
that and but it's good to know where you
how valuable you are and there's
something wrong with jumping to another
company if your current company isn't
paying you the market value look I mean
you know gone are the days where you
know like our fathers or grandfather's
you know mothers and grandmothers to
like have been employees of like these
big companies for their entire like
working lives 20 25 years sometimes 30
years but that loyalty that such
long-term loyalty to a company just
doesn't exist anymore and I think it's
because you know not all companies are
loyal to us so so absolutely if you can
find something better with the higher
payout or federal benefits or whatever
you know any loyalty to to that you know
company with the with the lower offer so
so you know go to the good stuff you
know treat yourself look after yourself
and your family first
and yeah those feelings and that guilt
or whatever from helping out I come to
me I forget about it
yeah and it's it's it's kind of it feels
almost counterintuitive at first cuz you
know I I consider us to be both kind of
good guys and like hey you know you're
my employer and I you know you've helped
you've gave me this opportunity and I
want to be loyal to a to a fault
like to a degree and so like I think
engineer truths explained it best to me
and I asked him what is company well
company loyalty worth any said it's
about $10,000 if anything over $2,000 it
turns of benefits and pay you need to
start considering yeah yeah absolutely
and and look yeah while I'm employed for
for any particular company or while on
the team for a particular project yeah
I'm gonna be loyal in that I'm gonna do
my day and this best work and try to you
know move tickets and do it you know as
professionally as possible but but you
know I got bills I'd like to I like to
go on long vacations and and I want a
certain you know quality of life for
myself and my family and so so yeah I
mean beyond beyond just the expectation
that I do where can you pay me I mean
that's that's the only loyalty that I
owe you you promise to do good work but
if somebody wants to offer me more stuff
so I can you know have medications you
know nicer you know quality of living
yeah I'm gonna go see them but yeah
that's my take on it
so how is now that you've lived in
Austin for a while how do you like it
like how is the the software saying
there man the software scene is really
cool there's just so many companies here
like everything from you know startups
to you know really big enterprises and
you know everything in between
right now I'm in a medium-sized company
I guess so I don't know the exact
numbers but probably between you know 52
Hunter people possibly like considering
like technical and non-technical
positions and we're contracted out so I
mainly work a downtown Austin for like
an even bigger company so it's kind of
cool to have two sets of like co-workers
and like offices like that but yeah
Austin is really cool I think if you if
you're on the leading tech and
especially if you're a react developer
you can get like offers just like that
okay some point I went to a react Meetup
I did the short little talk like 15
minutes I got like two job offers from
people I've never even met or heard of
before so it's definitely like you know
I wouldn't say you know shooting fish in
a barrel you still have hustle and you
know present yourself you know really
well but but for people who are like
that and who were ambitious you can find
you know a lot of jobs a lot of good
jobs here in Austin my only gripe about
the city is the traffic man there's too
many people and too many cars on the
road that's my only complaint about
Austin but man those tacos and barbeque
sandwiches dude or tasting so I'll be
here for for at least a year or two I
think maybe longer
Austin was one of the cities I was
applying to I was trouble really rollin
yeah so it's it's on the the radar
Austin in Portland because I got like a
family in Portland so where did or
Portland Maine Portland Oregon Portland
Oregon so okay yeah I've looked at it or
I mean I've been in Maine for for a few
months it gets pretty cold up there
I think Oregon would be a better choice
yeah my brother went to the the as I
call it the dirty hippie mother land of
Portland Oregon so he's up with this
bandana and tied eyes on and whatnot
he's actually he's a traveling in Asia
right now but he'll he'll go back to the
the hippy Mecca eventually but I I mean
that's that's something I would like to
do eventually I want to you know become
an expat again and be one of these
digital nomads
spend like three or four months in one
country in Asia then go to the next one
I think that would be pretty cool you
know traveling like that for a little
bit yes I've seen a lot because I get
spammed with all these sort of remote
traveling digital Nomad lifestyle so
like I I look at them all the time and
they look really interesting where it's
like once called remote year where it's
something like twenty-two thousand
dollars but every year you're in it
every month you're in a different
country and that covers your housing and
food and so if you're a remote developer
and you want to spend you know twenty
twenty thousand twenty four thousand if
you're making a hundred isn't that much
so you get to kind of see the world for
a year twelve different European
countries and there's a lot of them
popping up but it's very attractive did
you happen to read the stack overflow
2017 survey by chance
no not yeah I've been getting the emails
from Quincy and like his take on the
results but I haven't read any of the
data or analysis yet so what one thing
that really stuck out is that one of the
number one things that individuals are
looking for in terms of jobs it was like
55 or 65 percent is remote which I
thought was pretty high but I like I can
see see why like yeah dude I spend like
probably three hours every working day
just in traffic because I have to add
the drop my wife off at work and then go
to my office and pick her up sometimes
if she doesn't take the train home and
yeah like that that like three hours
it's like dang it's like you're driving
like Austin doesn't have like buses or
fan buses but they don't have like
trains like they do in other bigger
cities so I'm just I'm kind of like
loose in three hours a day I would
consider like a remote job if it meant I
could like stay at home do my job and
then that's like three hours that I get
back and I could do like you know
whatever I want like making YouTube
videos or something like that so I mean
that's not surprising I would say like
sixty-five percent is about right maybe
slightly
then that now in my expectations now is
there any is it like is it property
reasons you live so far away from work
with traffic or like what is it what was
the logistics of Austin that you're not
up dude I don't even live that far away
my apartments like three miles from
downtown and and like maybe my wife's
job is like about ten miles
so never not a very long drive but it's
just too many cars unlike the on the
highways and like all the streets during
rush hours are just like clogged to the
max Oh Austin that's great there's a lot
of opportunity here but I I want to tell
people like that that Austin sucks and
don't come here anymore because this is
too many cars on the road and and not
the they don't have like the public
transportation infrastructure to handle
all of that there's a little bit but
this montage oh wow alright so that
sounds that sounds even worse than LA
yeah I've never driven in LA traffic but
yeah it's just like gridlock and it's
not too fun at all
alright so now that you've been working
for a while what was the one thing that
you didn't really expect like you've
been studying all this web development
and back-end front-end technologies now
what was kind of one thing that caught
you off guard once you you know now that
you've been a developer that you wasn't
necessarily on your radar yeah like one
thing that that a lot of people even
though they knew you know I was a junior
like a developer and I had like lots to
learn a lot of people assumed that I was
like really like knowledgeable and
comfortable with like Linux you know
commands like for the terminal and the
shell and you know Linux I mean I guess
I should say UNIX because they work you
know all the same on a Linux machine or
a Mac and and I knew a little bit but
but but I wish I had like ramped up and
gone beyond just like the very basics of
Linux terminal
and I wish I was also more familiar with
with sequel because I'm more about like
a MongoDB guy and that was sort of my
focus as a as I was teaching myself is
just like the mean stack or the burn
stack and I got a little bit of a sequel
but I wish I was just much better at it
and then finally I wish I had been a bit
more knowledgeable of of AWS because of
my job we use AWS and I have to be
around for deployments just in case you
know the DevOps needs some support but
but it looks like a scary room full of
tangled wires to me right now I wish I
understood AWS a bit better so in case
something really hit the fan I could be
you know very you know more useful and
you know act more quickly but but other
than that yeah everything that I
prepared for and studied has helped me
with my jobs there's a certain areas
that that I could be better at but but
everyone has those areas that they suck
at and you know they wish they could be
better bred and so so it's oh don't
worry it doesn't matter like how much
you study and how much you prepare just
go into your first job and yeah you're
gonna suck but just you know work hard
every day and you'll suck less with each
coming day yeah show up me like look day
one I'm gonna suck but I'm gonna work
hard to make sure I don't suck as much
as I suck the day before
exactly exactly it just just be
comfortable feeling like an idiot and
like Bullis it's just like you know
everyone was at that stage before most
people will be cool most engineers will
like get it and like help you out yeah
you'll run into a few like jerks who
like expect you to know like everything
they know but but that hasn't been the
case really nice now how important is
testing at your work is that something
that you're you guys do quite often oh
yeah absolutely so you know we
all sorts of tests the tests that I
touch mainly are the tests for the
linter to make sure that we're following
you know specific like formatting
guidelines and things like that
the lentor also helps me like identify
any reference type of errors so like if
I use the variable that I haven't
defined you know it'll print it out nice
and you know neatly the line number and
things like that so we can't even deploy
if we have any of those linter errors so
it's a quite strict for us there's a
there's a test for for our deployment to
and which I don't really touch it too
much that's more of like a DevOps things
but but yeah we we do test often and and
even though that that does take up time
testing I feel like it saves like you
from losing time trying to figure out
bugs in the future so yeah definitely
worth the investment
it's alright guys if you have any
questions so you would like Stephen the
answer go ahead and start typing them
out in chat as well maybe it's right
here I don't know it's somewhere
wherever all right got the box was there
anything that you wanted us to cover I'm
going to take this down and there's
gonna be some good questions there's
gonna be some bad questions so these are
gonna get a minute
but anything that was in that kind of
last six months a really you would like
to discuss yeah I mean man it's been
kind of a blur it's it's just starting
to slow down a little bit
no I I guess I guess not related to the
job but yeah I'm kind of thinking of
ideas for for my next like you know
video series the last video series that
I did on YouTube you can check it out
but it was those good school command
line tutorials and I was wondering if I
should do more of those
or if I should do another free code camp
project like another react line
so yeah if there's any viewers out there
listening to this right now
if you want me to create some videos
like what topic give me your suggestions
or your ideas and we could talk about
that yeah and if you ever want a guest
developer on there and be happy to jump
in and see if I can contribute
definitely do yeah yeah me and Dylan I
knew you're working on that MongoDB si
you're working on it
Oh yesterday I probably for about six
hours and I had a bug that kept me going
but I finally solved it
I'm not was it like a duplicate key no
for some reason when I was using Const
and a Deconstructor to store the
parameter the the response parameter or
the mess parameter it was adding it
basically I supposed to get a string
which was the original URL and for
whatever reason reason when I change
that from a var to the constant
deconstructive way is in the in the cost
version it was actually adding a fav
icon in there and so it was storing it
as an object is a weird air I and I
don't know enough about it yeah it was
it was it was it was kind of a strange
thing so you were using Express and you
had I'll just write it in the chat right
here so you had something like reading
like icons the name yeah and like nobody
can see yeah something like this right
yes exactly like that so that's really
strange
yeah so what was happening there so I
was had this regular expression that was
supposed to go and take check that
string and see if it was a see if it was
if it matched the the reg X right
when certian of node asserts interrupts
what version of node were you you think
oh I have no idea I did this element you
got it you got a run no dash D and
you're German Allah because it may not
be supporting like
keyword I don't know it was strange so
until I that that held me up for about
six hours and I finally just reverted to
like es5 standard so I think that's only
dude 306 but alright so we got some good
questions here from people in chat they
want to know what stack you're working
in at work currently sweetie so I do
front-end development and the stack that
we use we use a react and redux web pack
for the bills let's see what else so we
use a number of different like
middleware for react and redux like a
redux responsive reacts router react
Redux router we use redux thunk and and
I don't touch the database very much but
the the different projects have
different databases yes so that's the
stack and my last job my stack was a bit
more eclectic it was still mostly mean
and burn stack stuff but I had to do a
little bit of Ruby on Rails and also
react native which is awesome by the way
I love react native yeah I'm excited for
the react react native courses or Redux
courses on freako camp but react native
I've been seeing what's what's unique
about react native cuz I'm not a react
developer so I'm not too familiar with
it yes so react and react native they
share the same principles of like
rendering views I mean after all react
is just a few library so its API is
quite small when compared with the
behemoth is such as angular Jes or
angular 2 but react and react native
they share the same principles of like
rendering components and you know
passing state props between components
and stuff like that and if you know one
you could pick up the other one quite
easily and compared with like other like
mobiles JavaScript development systems
you have you have like ionic and angular
we
just basically a webview it's not like a
true native act I mean it runs on mobile
devices but it's just like a web page or
web application that has been ported
over to mobile devices whereas react
native it actually gets compiled down
into the Java for Android and for the
objective-c for for iOS devices and you
can use like you know react native api's
as well as like native device like
native ios and android api is in your
projects and it's like a real native but
not just like a hybrid of the world a
webview sort of back and it's like
really fast and sappy quite cool stuff I
love it so if I understand correctly
rack native essentially is a way of
writing a react project that will
actually compile into a Android app or
an iOS app or to work with that that is
accurate yeah that's accurate that is
pretty dope possibility so if
you're like a remote developer for
example and you have a client who wants
like a particular web application it
would be quite and if you develop that
web application and react it would be
too much effort support the web app over
its react native because in react your
components are reusable and they're a
little different between the two but
it's easy to port over so as a remote
developer if I was doing that I would
like upsell the client and say hey you
know I could throw in an iOS or an
Android app for you for yet it's just an
extra cost and I think you can make some
cool bucks if you modeled your
freelancing business that way you know
throwing in mobile apps would require
that much effort support over like a
simple crud application to your to react
native nice any any final thoughts for
your fans or anywhere can people follow
you
all that good stuff okay yeah final
thoughts yeah it's been a pleasure there
guys and you know thank you for all the
support nice comments that you leave me
on my videos and YouTube channel
just too let's see how should I do this
should I share my screen with you I can
share my screen oh yeah and you go over
through thee through everything like
that okay so if you're interested in my
tutoring services you know you can find
more information at the best Jay asks it
kind of goes goes over the pricing which
is you know always substitute change and
and all the features of my services so
if you meet one on one health consider
me to be your personal tech tutor if
you'd like to do the Twitter thing you
can follow me at ESL hip-hop and I like
to share links on there occasionally
this used to be my old Twitter for when
I was an English teacher but I still use
it so when I'm a developer so there it
is and then you know finally probably
most important its my youtube channel I
think I am user mr. Steve my you see
what is that you deserve mr. Steve my
you and you'll see a lot of my videos
here they are
I have many playlists for the free code
camp challenges in projects so best
place to go it's the playlist that you
can watch everything in order or you can
watch them in any order that you want to
so there it is there's all my work for
you to enjoy you got ready you got the
beta stuff up already for the rack
challenges this is not no no for the
reactor challenges not yet I haven't
looked at the actually I haven't looked
at those beta reactive contest yet so
I'm guessing that's what they're gonna
release really soon they're putting a
lot of effort into that so I don't think
so no no I I think we got a couple
months to go still okay okay what's do
you know anything about that about the
holds back I know a lot of people are
like looking forward to this
yeah yeah I'm one of those people's life
so I interviewed Quincy not too long ago
and he Quincy is now a politician so he
gives you the the he diverts the
question it'll be ready when it's ready
you know like yeah but if just going
through the stuff like the react
challenges aren't even actually up on
free code camp yet there's still
technically an alpha but they have a lot
of great stuff on there that's
near-complete the regex section they are
they have what I really like is the
front-end library so you there covering
bootstrap they're covering react and
redux and reactor redux as well and
they're covering CSS flexbox there's a
whole bunch of cool things on there
sweet yeah they also have a security
certification on there as well which is
really cool nice yeah so it's gonna be
which is great cuz QA and like testing
and stuff like that it doesn't really
get any like oh yes yeah so there's and
actually six sections now if I remember
correctly so it's going around there but
uh yeah so there's not like a hard set
time if I had to guess I would say it's
probably three months out if I had to
guess but I like any insider knowledge
it's just really good hey well you know
digging up my support don't keep making
videos for free code camp so so quickly
your volunteers and it just let me know
guys I'll try my best and I'll I'll
throw something up on my youtube channel
for you I will thank you thank you again
for taking the time man I appreciate it
yeah thanks for having me and I hope you

I really enjoyed this interview I was
mainly because it's nice to see someone
who seems very honest guy hard-working
guy and a year ago or six months ago he
was teaching English in Korea and he
spent a year doing that and in that year
he taught himself to be a full-stack
developer with no prior technical
knowledge this degree is in English and
now he's working in a very tech Cornette
to the city austin and turned in his
life making more money than he's ever
made before and job offers left and
right it's very good to see what someone
takes these things seriously and how
coding can affect their lives for the
positive and I hope that it'll affect
your life and awesome on that note I'll
