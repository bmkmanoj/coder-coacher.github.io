about investing in yourself and it
sounds pretty dramatic but I can do a
lot for you and it's kind of what I
contribute I contribute if I were to sum
up everything that I all my success in
the last two years from being a you know
two and a half years for being a pizza
delivery driver to driving investing the
time the effort and the energy into
myself by four you know twelve dollars
an hour to go round-trip for hours
around for four hours two hours each way
to an internship that investing in
myself the investing of the time and
energy after work and after that
internship to go and study code CAD me
and free code camp in that investing
that time and it's kind of a chain
effect right once you get a little bit
of success and a little bit of that
investment pays off you know it
investing my time into YouTube has paid
off in various ways and investing my
effort and money and things like that
into YouTube as well has paid off by
getting me my previous job in the
investing the time and energy to come
home after work for hours to study and
then that's paid off to get to my
current full sack role and there's
things in the works that may pay off for
the additional work I'm putting up so I
want I just really want you to focus on
investing in yourself and not being
short-sighted because a lot of people
are and it if not everyone you know
there are there are things where you can
invest in yourself for free freako camp
is a great example that where what
you're investing in is to your time and
your energy no money because a lot of
people you know we're broke man a lot of
people are broke and you know we're
talking about well you know we don't
have the money for things and I can't I
don't it's time and energy is your most
valuable asset and you invest it
correctly you'll get better results so
that doesn't mean that you can't go and
buy a course for ten dollars on you know
udemy they have $10 sales all the time
most of the time all these $200 courses
have a free code to get down ten dollars
right so you can go and do that's your
time and energy in udemy one way that
I'm investing
energy is Udacity I'm doing their react
noun degree program that's kind of why I
wanted to talk this talk about this
because it is something that I'm
starting in five days and coincidentally
if you're interested in doing a noun
degree program right now you can get
$200 off certain ones and 50% off other
ones so $200 off the rack one is 40% off
the entire program which is pretty good
so it goes from being a $500 course to a
$300 so that's what I'll be doing for
the next four months investing you know
forget the 300 dollars investing 12
hours a week for four months it's way
more valuable than $300 right but the
payoff by me investing those four months
in the $300 I mean it's such a better
payoff in terms of a career in finances
and things like that but also if you're
not interested react I just want to
throw out there that a lot of the now
degree programs such as a full sack web
developer machine learning and then the
other ones you get 50% off the first two
months so you have until the 20th you
have till 27th to go ahead and take
advantage of that to invest your time
and your energy into that so that's
something even thinking about go ahead
and take advantage of that but now that
we've talked about that I really just
want to talk about being aware of
planning for the future and invent and
how investing into yourself is the best
thing you can do so a lot of people I
look at a lot of old friends I've had
from high school and things like that
and there's basically two groups of
people there's the people who who never
who never invested in themselves and
because of that they're pretty much
stuck at where they're at they're either
in a bad job living at home in mind you
I don't think I talked about if you live
at home I would live at home if I could
save the money and but if I choice right
life is all about choices and
unfortunately when you don't have a
solid career or you don't have a good
path you're you have limited choices
right
a little maybe maybe bad help because
they have to eat shitty food you know
they can't they're stretched out because
they can't afford
simple things like health insurance oh
they can't afford simple things like
treating you know their boyfriend or
girlfriend writer you know there's a
very proud moment for me coming up right
now in a week my mother is visiting and
it is the first time in my life where I
will be able to pay for dinner and that
sounds really small but it's it is a it
is a very proud moment for me where
she's coming to visit and I've already
told her and my brother and my mom has a
friend in floor I said let them know too
that when you're down here it's on me
you know my mother when April and I were
in the grind I really in the grind was
bringing us groceries when we couldn't
afford to buy you know anything we
couldn't afford buying a food basically
and we're just getting by to keep the
lights on and and all that stuff so it's
a very proud moment for me and part of
part of getting to where I'm at and part
of excelling past where I'm going and
not not only into a good financial
position but into a position where I'm
happy with my job I enjoy it I love it
I'm doing something that very passionate
about that was a very strong investment
into myself that unfortunately as I
mentioned some people don't have the I
don't want I don't know if it's a
maturity thing I don't know if it is a a
self-discipline thing or I don't know if
they're do they just haven't reached the
point in their life where where they're
never reached their rock-bottom I guess
would be what the way I would put it and
when you do you'll realize it's really
the only way to kind of get ahead in
life is to invest in yourself it doesn't
necessarily have to be software I don't
want to miss the turbulent obviously my
entire channel is about software and
things like that it's about learning and
it's about starting there's a lot of
things out there that you don't have to
do but you have to start and a lot of
times people say people are very worried
about a $10
you know like Colts is this a good
course and have you taken this course
it's like obviously a lot of these
things are good choices in life
just extra executing them and that's
really what happens when you're
investing in yourself is your your
acting out on good choices nine times
out of ten we know that these choices
are good you can buy 10 courses if you
do all 10 if you literally just do all
10 if one of them is a good choice
you'll have gotten 100 fold back on your
time and effort right so you might have
spent let's say 10 courses 10 dollars
100 bucks you'd probably get a if you
did the 10 courses built the portfolio
projects you you learn the skills and
you probably would I have a $10,000
increase in your salary by just the
sheer amount of skills and knowledge and
projects you would build from that in a
practical sense maybe you've been
wanting to start a business for a very
long time and you've been scared do you
but you've even do you've been investing
the time into the market is it something
I'm understanding them you want to dive
into something you're passionate about
that's another way you can invest in
yourself but a lot of people
unfortunately they never they never take
the chance man I don't know I don't know
if they're scared I don't know what it
is but a lot of times you know we're our
parents or society they want you to take
safe choices and there's something wrong
with safe choices right but there is
something to be said about taking
educated risks so you can take the
Udacity nano degree educated risk so we
could say you're new to do it you can
you can teach this to yourself it's
saved $300 yes yes I could I could
definitely save $300 may not go through
this program and teach myself I may miss
some things in the process but what I am
doing here is I'm investing time and
energy into a program that's going to
accomplish a couple things for me one
I'm going to learn three skills and have
three portfolio items based off those
skills on a practical sense I could also
I could also review Udacity and I get to
give feedback to some to a lot of you
guys who are in that situation where
you're like you know what I just need
somebody I trust to tell me who's gone
through the program so I can pull the
trigger and what I want you guys to do
when they're trying to invest in
yourself is pull the trigger
none of this stop being scared stop
waiting stop worrying about all the
things that can go
that pull the trigger and move forward
get going get started and get you'll
eventually get there one step forward is
one more step closer than anywhere the
day before right and so investing
yourself in whatever ways you can
whether it's doing whether that's four
hours of your day coming home every
night an hour of your day there's not a
single day that you should not be
working towards being a better version
of yourself or bettering an aspect of
your life now that could be your health
right that's the one thing that I've
been ignoring in my personal life that I
have that's caught up with me and I am
investing into my health I'm investing
into my career investing into my youtube
again not all that money taking care of
the things and becoming a better person
a better whole package to have a better
life at the other day and and be able to
to enjoy it to the fullest so if if you
are scared because that's what it is it
scared it's scared of you know what if
what if what if well what if you succeed
what if your hard work pays off what if
you're actually one in the one in ten
who actually follows through with it
nope stop with the top what if you pull
the trigger and you move forward and you
say okay I'm going to do that
free coke am I'm going to do the noun
degree program I'm going to start
exercising I'm going to follow a
nutrition plan whatever it is that
you're scared to pull the trigger on I
encourage you to go that extra mile and
to do it so I hope that you guys are at
that point in life where you're
realizing the value of investing in
yourself I don't want say believing in
yourself but understanding that your
effort your time and your energy is
spent wisely on improving your situation
it will improve your situation just got
just got put in the energy and you got
to pull the trigger and just do it stop
thinking about it
a lot of people over analyzing the
anticipation of the failure that you the
impending doom is what stops you and
that's a lot worse than the failure I've
learned is it's better to
it's better to have failed and you'll
learn something in the process that
never would have started to begin with
and I wish I failed a lot earlier in
life than I have now just so that I
could be much farther along so I'll
leave you with that guys the key word is

trigger win yourself a free course I
