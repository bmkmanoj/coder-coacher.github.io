structures using list HTML basics to so
just reminder i did already do this once
before but i'll be resetting the code
and we can start from fresh so in this
case let's get warmed up by adding a
title and a head so just don't remember
how to add title it is title total and
we'll say we'll just call it HH HTML a
62 in the in the head uh Heather and
then in the body create a paragraph and
this is my paragraph cool simple enough
alright so indentation is your friend
it's just uh usually there's probably
some in the environment here I dancer
sort of function you can write um but in
this case we will have to be indented on
around okay so online for team what
happened here the line for Team curry a
so there's line 13 ordered list by 14
creating h2 heading and called list of
things I fine just okay all right and we
have to close it and starting line 15
create lists using the oal tag so co l
is for ordered list then of course we
need to end rol and we should list three
items three items i find you just okay
fine apples just okay and we have to end
up I find when Emma's banaynays i kinda
like Vanessa find honeydew just okay I
apologize it's funny you is one word not
quite sure and I find soda to just be
okay so around what they said about
indentation is our friend BAM so that
should be what we're trying to do here
so there is our header and our ordered
list and you can see our list on this
okay in the body tag create an h3 tag
excuse me h3 tag with texts knows
annoying these little ridges and the h3
test
make an ordered list so these are 0 l
and here you want a list of annoying so
we'll do carrot top oh let's see um Kim
Kardashian again I apologize phone on
spellers properly and she also my second
comes up how about Paris Hilton all
right remember to close it all right yet
then I remember to close our ordered
list all right and then you want to make
an h2 tag here and we want it to say top
three things I can do for mothers day
period nh3 create another ordered list
and then I'm on their list object one so
you see how it changed the one is
because we didn't properly close it
sorry so Li clean her house close that
list a line walk her dog sorry these are
conspiring let exciting think of them on
the spot and do the dishes all right so
do you think second you from all right
cool let's see what's next so we're
going to reset this
in your body tag create an h1 all right
checking for some random thoughts inside
of it RPGs all right under your h1 tag
credit paragraph okay this is sure which
describes the list you like so once it's
create an unordered list in our
paragraph so what's asking us to do okay
so UL is how you use unordered list it
works exactly the same essentially as a
regular list does except it is listed by
like bullet points and not numbers so
we're going to be lifting our favorite
RPGs here series also the best time yet
the standard final fantasy we have two
standard breath the fire this is
shakotan another great series hopefully
they will bring that one back and let's
see what is the last three megaman
legends is kind of a kind of amazing so
we'll put that in there you know it's
probably not technically an RPG or an
action game okay so in this case is
saying make sure your to type your
paragraph of your above your unholy list
okay so they wanted just to type
something so a mistake there so some
great
a RPG series there we go all right so on
this case they want to create another
unordered lists or UL / 0 I really
should have two items so item one
favorite toys games okay items under
each item the of the unordered list
create an ordered list okay so this is
going to show us how we can do what we
want to do here so we're going to create
it Oh L here and they want us to have
three and three so let's go ahead and
get started here so first off on boys
leaves and then we'll create poisoning
so we'll just take Dylan I've always
really liked the name zach so we'll go
Zach then we will go just go Matt throw
my friends all right and favorite girl
needs don't forget to close your ordered
list for each one opening closed around
like let's see oh I a little bit try to
be a little funny with baby's mama
sidechick and of course the HBIC go the
head bitch in charge as I say I so now
we're going to be looking to style in
the font so comments start and end with
like this this is an example of the
comment McLain one into account that is
a really painless way to make a comment
like try think I'm going to be using the
comments in HTML so yeah well it's
because it's kind of a pain but uh yeah
so let's say you do comments okay on
line 7 make text size equals 10 and make
20 and 40 are all right so here we're
going to start altering the response so
you're going to do p style font size
pull in and we want that to be 10 PX so
you do it again right here sip on that
size colon we want this to be 20 PX and
then we're going to get one more time
style you want to go for a lot size and
we're going to set this equal to 40 X
and you can see they're getting
exponentially bigger cool but not too
too shabby so next thing we're going to
be doing is header style so we can use
it for more than just paragraphs so
let's see here in this case we want to
change the head
coloring the green so we are going to do
head out to the h1 style table and we'll
just color three so that changes it to
green and then it was a change the first
color of the paragraph pilot so as you
can see it's going to work the same one
so there's violet it kind of looks pink
on my screen but whatever and then we're
going to change the style of the color
and font so it's kind of same thing
except we have a semicolon in different
sort of color to red so there's a red
semicolon then we want it to be font
size font size and yes okay so for some
reason did not change it
oh that's wrong right here so they have
fun bosch sighs oh yeah so let's see why
it didn't change it its color green
color violet
oh this will also change this to 16 so
let's go ahead semicolon and we want to
change font size hole into 16 so there's
that I want to change the color of first
paragraph Lila change color second
paragraph to read now we did it the same
way here looks like your headers font
size is 16.3 60 of 16px interesting so
let's go ahead and copy this and
like this happens you kind of sometimes
it's good to refresh the page but we are
still getting an air so let's see so
somehow it's interpreting our font size
is sixteen point 36 something another
your citta just 16px so let's go ahead
and see if that helps it does not so
we're going to go ahead and go to the
Q&amp;amp;A forum
wow there's 105 answers here so we are
on section nine so section 9 of 16 HL
basics font color
alright let's suit me fine
let's see did we do this Vince oh
there's our style we have it equal to
color green colored on violet
Oh wish rep equal to here and we don't
need that colon so let's see if that
fixes it huh so we fixed part of our
code
alright so we're going to copy this
right here we're going to reset the code
and in the heading we are going to redo
that part manually again so the h1 style
is equal to color on green semicolon
then we're going to font size is equal
to 16 to X right excuse me colon 16px in
line for the rest of this it looks like
your font header size nice let's going
to copy this and see what it says the
Q&amp;amp;A forums
huh so this might just be not quite sure
what is going on maybe it's that let's
say okay so this there we go um ok so
we're learning to hint here what's
happening is because I was zoomed in a
little bit it was changing the font size
so controlled 0 our commands your own
depending on for using a mac or not will
be what you need to do for the future
that to take care of that so a little
bit of an odd thing but uh I guess
that's just how it works ok so we can
also do this for a list so let's say the
list is equal to iron it wants us to
change the font size to 16px and the
font to Arial so send Michael wad ash
family I do Ariel so you can see all
right little change that change the font
size little second list item song is
equal to a twelve PX on 512 X and then
we are going to change the font family
too
fergana no it's a nice phone I've always
liked her done I'm pronouncing that
correctly I mean on me and then finally
we want to change the font size said 10
PX and we want to change font family to
see you see this is a little is slowly
slowly smaller and different so oh and
it's also saying to make sure that you
capitalize it it is case sensitive okay
so we're doing the same thing 10.3 right
so we're gonna have to take command 0 I
personally don't have my glasses on
right now and I think for the example
it's just better to have it zoomed in a
little bit so we'll be hitting controls
are quite a bit sorry so this is asking
us to change the size the color and the
font family so it's just you an order
font size call on a px semicolon now
your font or color and once three blue
oh so we don't forget the quotation so
color dash blue and then finally font
dash man like I don't want to set that
the aerial and then we get a truly
spectacular paragraph so there is that
and let's see do some more styling here
so now we can change the background
color for body so same thing with body
style equals para princes and we are
going to do it by doing background
ash ash color and we want to do it as
brown some reason that comes out is red
on my computer but whatever and uh for
the body style Oh change back on the
body tag to brown there we go excuse a
change the background color the ordered
list do so order list style equals
background color and so you can see
right here everything on the ordered
list not one list item is actually
changed not too bad all right so make
the h3 heading aligned center so there's
also text align that we can use for
styling so we will give text and the
line dancer so now this is centered and
then make the first item in the list a
line sorry so we're going to lose first
11 style set that equal to I'm guessing
it's just lists so text align this your
left either so it's not going to change
because it's already standardly the line
to the left and then here we're going to
Center so we're going to text dash the
line center to see it shifts to be lined
up in the center with everything else
and then here we go style equals text
align this one is right so this is going
to go quite a bit over make sure you put
the parentheses ma'am there we go
so now we want to use the word sing of
online seven are shooting bold or thing
so we saw a little bit of this earlier
in some examples so we're going to use
the word strong not sure if it wants us
to get the question mark or not we're
going to put an end to it like that and
then the word too so I'll quite sure why
they were it just a new bold we've made
more sense to me but maybe that's used
for something else so there is our bowl
how to eat bold things I am then that
italicized you use am so on that BAM so
that is I tell sighs and then so program
pretty easy stuff and now we are going
to do it all Wow oh it's just a summary
of what we've learned and just a
reminder of what is going on here so up
next we're going to be working with
social networking profile so a little
you can see we're throwing everything
together slowly but surely and you can
see how you know you can customize
pretty much everything looks like so
i'll see you guys next video for the
social networking profile activity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
