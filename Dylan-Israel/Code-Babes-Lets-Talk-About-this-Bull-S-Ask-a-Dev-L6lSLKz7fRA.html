babes and I I have been aware roughly of
what they are what they were but I never
I never want to talk about it because I
don't like necessarily giving attention
to something I don't agree with I
usually will avoid the topic and if
you're not familiar with the reason I'm
doing it now is they haven't posted in
eight months and I came I actually
watched the first 30 seconds of a code
babes video accidentally today and I
couldn't believe how outlandish it was
the first 30 seconds started off with
the girl undressing no no bullshit
undressing and you could tell and by the
way I want to I want to set this start
this off before because they any time
you talk about I feel like you talk
about women in their sexuality have to
you have to choose your words very
carefully and I'm going to do my best
for that but I don't I don't like stuff
like this I have no problem with there's
channels like Lena the plug Lena the
plug talks about her her sexual
escapades and that's the point of her
channel I got no problem with that she
said she's going to put a sex tape out
and a million subscribers got no more no
problem with that more power to use your
sexuality what I have a problem with is
is using sexuality and to perpetuate a
lie that you're going to learn and to be
very blatant about it so a code babes if
you're not familiar is essentially
imagine that you were watching the
episode of Billy
I think it's Billy Madison and you're in
the that tent where his teacher is
undressing for every every correct
answer he gets about that now apply that
to software and you basically have code
like if you ever thought hey I wonder
what softcore porn would be while
learning how to code you would probably
get something like code babes and it's I
mean you can just tell that thumbnails
right like a little hood and you know
it's the crease right if I can't even
get through
find out if any of them are actually
developers or not or if they're the
toriel's are good but I wanted to do a
video about this because recently Oh
this was the video I clicked on so let
me I'm actually going to mute this and
and you can just see the intro of this
video and by the way before we moving
any further any further they are quite
literally objectifying women this is an
object and that is a woman in there they
are literally saying within our objects
let's proceed and we'll just watch the
first 30 second and I'm like what the
hell is going on here because I I just
clicked it this is this is what
development now this is it voice this is
the gate what if every what if every
video I started I just started taking
off my fucking pants what about that
what is now as a coding Channel you know
what long dick style that's how we teach
code now and this may get a little crude
I apologize but we're talking about a
very crude subject but this is it isn't
it let's just search let's just start
reinforcing every negative stereotype
not only about women but about men as
well and it goes down to their
philosophy and oh we go fast each lesson
is a quickie pause it when you get to
rest or you know you want to fat because
we're uncontrollable fapping monkeys
apparently oh my goodness
so Cody Bates have hasn't uploaded in
eight months and so back to the reason I
wanted to talk about this other than to
obviously just show my distaste for this
type of blatant just blatant abuse of
fourteen-year-old boys who watched
because I can't I can't imagine anybody
who's watching this video right now
would say you know what and I could be
wrong I could be wrong but I can't
imagine that anybody who's watching this
video said you know what build angular
for tutorials that they thought were
really great
that was shit was fine or they said you
know I just won't look at some some some
provocatively dressed women with their
breasts out partially out with cleavage
I won't look at the cleavage okay
I can respect that I can't understand
when trying to learn web development
right so a clear moneygrab way now so
they haven't uploaded in eight months
I'm okay talking about this but one of
the comments I got back recently today
was about from someone who said you I
did a video about Chris Hawkes leaving
YouTube and he had posted a video about
basically clickbait and his his thing
about software and being kind of burnt
out with the fact that things like this
exist you never set code babes but this
is the type of shit he's talking about
where this is a channel they have they
have significantly more this video alone
this video alone where is it where is it
there's a video with like 900 n-- has
almost as many views as my channel
it's got like 75 percent views in my
channel why cuz she's cute alright fine
whatever but this is the type of shit
they got more than twice my subscribers
they're nearly as many as Chris Hawkes
probably more views than both of us
combined they probably gave up on this
about eight months ago after sticking
with it about two years because they
realized that they're not probably
making as much money as they thought
they were going to on YouTube and
selling their courses and stuff like
that or I I don't know that that would
be my guess as to why they stopped up
with me I don't really know I I haven't
done any research I don't really care
I'm just glad that they that that this
sort of content is no longer getting
pushed out so when Chris Hawkes says
things like you know clickbait and the
type of content that gets followers and
they remind you this is the only channel
I dislike I typically this is the only
channel worth mentioning that has no
business being in this space I truly
mean that I truly mean what that means
oh are you see women can't post got that
of course not so the best developers
I've ever met have been women but
something like this perpetuates this
very male-dominated developer
environment it doesn't help doesn't help
I'm going to say necessarily hurt so I
can guarantee say it doesn't help and
then you know what what is what is the
what a chick's like I can't imagine
chicks are too okay with this like okay
so this is my coworker right here isn't
it this out this out just how the women
in my office dress down now come on man
so shit like this I can totally relate
to why somebody like Chris ha has been
putting its time in to the YouTube and
his effort and his energy and you see a
channel like this or actually a channel
like this I say what like like we're not
we're not talking about like another
like maybe your fitness model maybe
you're a stripper maybe you're a vlogger
we're talking about software fucking
development and we can't keep shit like
this out of the the YouTube space I
understand the frustration I'm glad that
they're not uploading your mark
I hope all their videos are be monetized
I really do I hope that the that this
sort of blatant sort of disrespect to
men and women that men are just and you
know what shame on you if you're one of
the $56,000 subscribed shame on you
shame on you for its first supporting
this unless you're like 16 and younger
I'll give you a pass of you're 16 or
younger I don't blame you in there and
mind you I think they're all cute so I
don't think I'm saying that how they're
not cute they're all very attractive
girls but that's the whole fucking point
they're not going to put somebody up
there that's not attractive that's the
only reason people watch these things
anyhow softcore porn and codeine if you
didn't know what it looked like it looks
like this it looks like coding babes and
the it's a strange concept it's like
they were sitting around having a beer
and smoking a blunt and say oh you know
what would be cool you know what I bet
all the dudes would watch us if we just
you know we wore our Halloween costumes
are scantily clad Halloween costumes and
then we pretended like we knew web
development we probably know little
weird google search session you know we
can you know probably have our our
boyfriends or our sisters who won't do
this who are developers tell us what to
say come on man this shit drives me nuts
absolutely nuts
I but I don't ever want to be completely
negative because it's not their fault
they're taking advantage of a weakness
in in human society so much as I've
discussed I'm not a fan of tide Lopez
for various reasons I will leave them
with a compliment that I think all
scammy sort of nasty people have as a
marketable skill it's a good marketing
ploy they are very good at marketing and
I will leave it with that I am so glad
shit like this is is not I you know what
if tomorrow a coding babes video pops up
it's really going to be a strike to my
soul because shit like this until I pass
them I'm having a chip on my shoulder
I'm not going to feel like a real
youtuber until subscriber count gets me
to fucking 56,000 and 101 more that's
all I need till I feel better oh this is
so sad that this is the thing this is
the state of the world we live in I'm
gonna get off my soapbox now man but
should like this pisses me off if you
want a free course not taught by coding
babes in react thank you to our
developer of choice Stephen Breyer who
has donated these so that we can give
them away and we are if you're
interested in his other courses there
will be a link in the description in the
comments below all you got to use is the
key word of the day could guess what it
is
code babes and and like the video and
you'll be eligible so as always guys
thank you so much for watching don't
forget to comment like subscribe and
share and if you'd like to support me on
patreon which by the way even though
they don't upload anymore they still

why because we're suckers a bunch of
suckers out there but thank you for
watching the video guys I'll see you
next time hey guys thanks for watching
the video special thanks to our sponsors
dev Mountain if you look for a coding
boot camp where tuition and housing is
included definitely check them out
appreciate it and I'll see you guys in
the next video
