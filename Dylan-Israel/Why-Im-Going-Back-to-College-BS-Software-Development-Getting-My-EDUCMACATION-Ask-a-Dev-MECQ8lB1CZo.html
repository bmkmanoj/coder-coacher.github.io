going back to school your boys going
back to finish this degree finally I
will be starting about on January 1st
not about my official start date is
January 1st I have a couple things I
have to do before then but I'm
officially enrolled I'm paying my
tuition in two days and we are getting
going and hitting the ground running so
I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about
what program I choose why I chose it
and also why I'm going back to school
even though I'm already working as a
developer hey guys just wanted to quick
shout out to our sponsor dev Mountain
we've been partnered dev Mountain for a
while and I'm very happy with them I've
had several friends who have gone
through their program and loved it and
often times when you're just getting
started in software you know it's a
direction you want to go but you're not
quite sure you're going down the right
path so to have a boot camp but it's
bent had some really great grads and
that you know is high quality and can
sort of guide you in the technologies
that are relevant in the working world I
think
dev Mountain does a great job with that
so if you're interested in it go ahead
and check them out dev mountain comm so
why am I going back to school a lot of
people are gonna assume it's money Dylan
doesn't make enough money or he wants
more money although it is true I do want
more money I will get more money just by
years of experience and my degree will
probably pay for itself because it's
only gonna cost me about $7,000 a little
less than that maybe if I put in some
work but I'm assuming about $7,000 and
I'll definitely get a return on that and
it's not a money thing because I
honestly guys I'm making a clear around
85,000 this year between YouTube and and
my my job I would tell you my salary but
I think it would make my my work feel
into not like that so let's just say
YouTube and my job and make eighty-five
to ninety thousand this year which
compared to last year I made forty two
thousand forty five thousand in the year
before that fifteen thousand so it's not
a money thing although I am always going
to make sure that I am getting paid a
respectable rate and I'm I have a year
and three months experience as a
developer and about two years in the
industry as a whole
so I'm just getting my career started as
I get a little bit more experience it'll
jump through now I want to go back for a
couple of reasons one I was looking at
certifications and you know I'll explain
how it ties into the program that I
chose but I was looking at
certifications to essentially bump my
pay at first I wasn't necessarily a
hundred percent that I was going to go
back to college part of it was the money
part of it was the time those are the
two things and I found a program that
kind of worked for me in that aspect and
that was Western Governors University
which is a online program and you play a
flat six-month tuition rate of 3,200 and
then it's about three hundred dollars in
fees and and tools so you're paying
about $3500 every six months now they
have a cool the way that their their
University it's all accredited and all
that sort of stuff don't you think it's
a trade school and I'm just against
certificate I'll be the exact degree
alligator's a software development
Bachelors of Science and it's back to
the certification so what what what
about certifications well I'm very aware
of what the low points on my resume are
the high points of me I'm a good
developer I have I've side projects I'm
passionate about development everything
you want now when getting your foot in
the door some and I have experienced now
all right so that's a that's a good
thing so where's my weakness well it's
in my education so originally I thought
how can I supplement this with
certifications it's like okay the comp
TI a the CI W these are all sort of
hardware tech software certifications
that you can get throw on your resume to
really make it pop a little bit maybe
make up for the fact that I don't have
my bachelor's and and go from there and
what I discovered was as I was kind of
going back and forth that the Western
Governors University there their
platform after some subscribers
recommended them I did a little bit more
research of my own and what's cool about
them is they have what they call a oh my
goodness I'm forgetting the word right
now but the way that you pass their
their classes are three ways one you
actually go and get a certification and
mind you there's homework and they help
you along the way but you don't
necessarily have to do the homework if
you don't want competency based testing
that's what it's called
see base classes and essentially you
have a mentor as you're going through
this online program and you can take
either the sort of the final if you want
to think of that way and if you pass it
you're good to go they don't care about
how many hours you are sitting in the
chair wasting your time going through
courses because they say you have to or
you could do projects that will fill
that and not test or insert some of them
you actually have to go and get
certifications which are part of your
learning platform that will help you out
that way a good example of why I like
this program is I have two web
development courses I work as a web
developer you guys all know I have
projects on here I'm assuming that I'm
competent in what they're going to test
us on and so instead of me spending this
six unit and five unit class which are
very large classes and in terms of units
if you're not familiar with college I
can immediately say you know what let's
go ahead and take the test because I'm a
web developer I should be able to pass
this test and I can knock out these 11
units today or within a week or two and
that's what's really exciting about it
is in that six month tuition you can
take as many courses as you can complete
right so you sign up for five I knock
one out I could throw another one in
there that time and I'm paying the same
amount so the harder you work the less
you're going to pay and in terms of
their stats 83% of their graduates
finished between six months to two years
if you're familiar with free code camp
and Bo Karns who has done like 50 videos
on their YouTube channel and he's he's
contributed to free code camp and really
great guy I encourage you to go I
believe he has his own YouTube channel
so just go youtube.com and search for Bo
Carnes I don't know it off the top of
the head I think it's called like Jay s
and nugget so that might be his series
but yeah he knocked out this exact
program in six months while working full
time which is really impressive but part
of that is he just probably put in works
took the test and studied and knocked it
out and I'm hoping to do something very
similar for me it's not necessarily a
money thing although I don't want to
spend a ton of money on on student debt
I know so many software developers who
have had student debt for five six years
seven years yes that's for most people
not a very long period of time believe
it or not but also I get to go in a comp
these degrees that are part are these
certificates that are part of the
program but that so for a very practical
standpoint that's why I'm going back to
school to learn not because I need it to
keep being developer if I got fired or
laid off today no one would ever hire me
again that's not a concern of mine
or that I'm not gonna make good money
but most people's standards I make great
money and my my income will probably
continue to grow right and I I have no
doubt about that whether I were to go
back to school or not but one of the
things that I want to do later on in
life is I want to be a teacher I have no
interested in doing it now because they
make the money is a focus because I'm
still trying to buy a house I'm trying
to become financially stable and one of
the worst things you can do is early on
while you're getting your experience and
you're working is just going into a
field that pays no money it's
unfortunate right because I really would
if I could make six figures as a teacher
yeah right now I would go when I finish
this degree I'd probably go and work as
a teacher at some school and I think I
would enjoy it and I think it would be
very fulfilling and it would be
something that I'm interested in let's
say that I it wouldn't be as fulfilling
as a developer role but it'd be it would
be an option is what I'm trying to say I
probably want to do it right away but it
would be an option right now it's not
even part of the conversation because
how can you go why would I take half the
pay to go do probably a harder job in
all reality because of all the the
things that go along with being a a good
teacher bad teachers you guys got it
easy it's about 90% of you the other 10%
I know it's a hard job and getting
underpaid but later on in life maybe in
retirement I want that as an option
right maybe in 10 years 15 years 20
years or vice versa people are like well
you know is it can you not get become a
senior developer you're not going to
make good money I can make just fine
money as a senior developer without a
degree but one of the things that will
stop you and make it harder not
impossible none of this is impossible is
it may be harder to really move up and
architect projects and get into
management and things like that
management and
where I don't want to like run a bunch
of cashiers or anything around the place
right but a software developed manager
and and still be a developer and stuff
like that but this will be one we'll
show you so well it will help me and at
least in my eyes and by the way I I have
I have software developers who I work
with talked with who I've suggested this
to about me going back and most of them
have said that I shouldn't and I don't
need to but they understand why I feel
that way and it's it's it's interesting
because everything that I've ever been
told is a guy go school guy go school
guy go school right we've all had that
right we're gonna be crackheads on the
street stealing and we're thievin if we
don't have a bachelor's degree for me
it's more so just a little bit of
insurance and a little bit of something
different so I probably won't appreciate
it while I'm in it but lately I've been
doing YouTube I've been doing projects
and I just want something different
right I want something something fresh
and so that's part of the reason why I'm
going back to schools well let's switch
it up because if I do want to go down
this teaching path or I do want to the
only thing that it's going to hurt me
and this is one of those things where I
tell people to have a look good have
have a LinkedIn kind of the only thing
that hurts you with a degree is the time
and money investment that's really it at
the other day and and for me I've
limited the time I've limited the money
and so the in terms of the benefit it
could do nothing but help me after that
limited time and limited money as far as
I see it but if I'm going to do such a
thing which I am cuz I start on the
first I'm saying this as if I'm
hypothetically if I were going to take a
degree program one that I should take it
now I'm 30 I'm buying a house I am
pretty soon you know I'm trying to find
the right one but I am you know April
and I don't have any children
we're not for a couple years so we'd
like to do that before that ever happens
if that ever happens just like when it
happens dealing when it happens
and it'll be one of those things were
later on it could serve me some benefit
in the future but also be fun I'm
interested to see if there is such a
thing as a good college and a good way
of learning and this is the closest and
the best sort of degree program that I
have come across that will work for me
College never really worked for me I I
was very miserable doing it I hate so
much timing class for nothing it was it
was a really awful experience and I'm
excited to to try Western Governors
University version of college and see if
I can succeed if I can knock it out like
I think I can and their program which by
the way their program their software
development it's not exactly like my
computer science for out that I was on
before it but they have some
similarities I have to say looking over
their degree program was a lot more like
the real world than any computer science
degree I ever saw we're talking about
web development we're talking about
object oriented program with Java C
sharp we're talking about there's a UI
UX course there is a project management
course there's a technical documentation
course and the reason I bring that up is
that that was one of the things that
really I struggled with in college was
this very theoretical approach of you
know you need five physics courses to do
this and and six courses and I did those
courses and it killed me every single
day but I'm very excited to see these a
program in which they integrate
certifications that are relevant to the
industry and I also integrate courses
that have that will actually help you
land a job and help you do this because
it is relevant right we're talking
project management principles agile this
stuff you do every day UI UX stuff you
do every day front-end development stuff
you do every day and I'm very excited to
see the program and jump into it and I'm
uh I can't wait to talk about it a
couple times during it because I want I
want if there is a good program out
there I can recommend because uh Cal
State Los Angeles sorry I would not
recommend you to anybody and
what you're talking two separate video
about that but hopefully what Western
Governors University will be a great
program for me and I can give you guys a
healthy recommendation and as they say
finish faster and pay less which is what
I'm trying to do with this program and
finish up my degree and see what I can
do with it from there but you know guys
that's today's video just I'd be an
interesting thing because a lot of you
assume I either have a bachelor's in
computer science which I don't I'm a
dropout or that I've gone to a coding
boot camp which I haven't and and I
thought maybe I'd do a video
specifically on this topic just to clear
it up a little bit because I am a
self-taught developer at the end of the
day I had a few courses in in school
nothing on JavaScript and I taught
myself through free free resources like
YouTube code Academy free code camp I
never bought a course until I already
had a developer job partially because I
was cheap partially because I was too
broke you know when you're trying to
either keep the lights on and keep food
in the fridge or spending $20 on course
on udemy even though you think it's
gonna help you oftentimes you don't just
because you just can't right when your
family's bringing your groceries how can
you be spending money on this stuff not
to say that's a bad investment but
that's what how I was thinking about at
the time but I am now a developer things
are good and I don't have to take out
any loans to go back to school so I'm
excited to do that and excited to update
you about the program as I go through it
so thank you so much for watching the
video don't forget to comment like
subscribe share support me on patreon
all that good stuff guys I appreciate
you watching these videos and I hope
that if you're out there trying to
trying to learn to code and you can I
don't know my girlfriend screaming about
in the other room but I hope if you're
help there gently decode you are having
a I'm told she totally got math talk
thank you for watching the video I'll
see you guys next time bye hey baby I'm
finally going back to finish my
bachelor's what were your thoughts about
that
what about your masters I guess if
you're looking for a fun little project
to do I have my very first course out
called learn angular by projects part
one where we build a personal portfolio
it's about three hours of content it's
one project I can teach you everything
in angular by any means but it's a great
way to get your feet wet and go ahead
