loops of JavaScript
search the text rename alright so this
is showing us what we're gonna make it
looks like we're gonna have some text
we're gonna look for a variable my name
it's going to go into the hits array and
it's going to run through the whole text
off length and if it equals e in this
case from Eric we're going to add that
to the text so let's get started so you
can see it knows Eric Eric Eric it's
breaking down each one one by one so
clearance at the following three
variables so we have there Tex will say
and then we'll say hits is equal to
empty array and of course we have to go
back with our semicolons it seems to
work without it but I think the
convention so onto the next step
below your existing code we want to
write a for loop now we're going to
stick into PI rather I is equal to 0
while I is less than text dot length and
then we wanted one in the for loop
all right so we're not writing anything
before you good all right it wants us to
write an if statement in the body of our
for loop
you should check to see if the current
letter is equal to the first letter B
name
so we're say guess so we'll say if I
so needs to be
okay so if my name we're checking the
first letter of my name so if this was
just kind of think of it as a string
there's zero one two three four so we're
seeing if my name is equal to the first
letter in this case is capitalized we
want it to do some stuff for now we're
not asking it to do anything
oh this case we need it to be I
one more equals no see yes Oh
if Tex whoops so we're checking text not
my name my mistake
all right so if text is equal so deep
it's asking us to write a for loop in
our if statement here and we're going to
change the variable so we're going to
say
why are they declaring it there
I should were to sign
in this case go ahead and add the second
for loop inside your statement so for
say J is equal to zero
je les AI J plus plus I believe that
should work but I'm not quite sure
your your loop should stop when it hits
the value of the first iterator and say
I plus the length of your dot my name
all right so what's the start off when
it's equal to I this listen text online
I'm not quite sure what's going on oh
the name dot mine alright it wants to do
it I'm looking for you so we're gonna go
to
Oh bad gateway alright there we go so
we're on slide five or seven
why my name dot lights plus I instead of
mine named online so this is equal to it
and then it wants to sit on my name but
line
so in this case J is equal to I because
that's where we're starting and then we
want to go for the full length of our
name Plus where we currently started RI
and that should work
ah
it looks like your second for loop isn't
pushing values to the hits array it
doesn't ask us to push values that's
right
make sure it's working properly and that
my name's text appears somewhere in the
text variable let's just go back to our
form here
all right so let's see here the loop
will not round likewise with this where
Jesus should be Jim so when we did know
J is less than I plus my name means
alright let's say for some unknown
reason we just crashed so my computer
crash because I ran an infinite four
loop so we're just going to start this
section over it's asking us to write a
second for loop inside our if statement
so it hits the value of the first
operator so it's gonna say J is equal to
I and it runs where J runs from I plus
my name dot length and then J plus plus
and then the for loop it wants us to add
to our say it's
push-push we'll add it to the next very
next available spot in the hits array
and we're going to do it for the text at
the J position and that should add it to
careful your second for loop should stop
when it reaches its current point in the
string plus my name means
you're second for loop should stop when
iterations is current point in the
strengthless minding Doppler
oh I used capital L there and there we
go close that and we'll go on to the
next section under the existing code
I'll set all your loops so outside our
for loop set up an if-else statement
you don't have any if all right so if
it's not like just not equal to zero
wants us to print to print your name
all right so this is if it is equal is
there a relic else wants us to print its
and here we go so we got Dylan twice so
a little bit of interesting of a for
loop but it all works and move on to our
next step of Java goodness as I said so
we're going to share it as always it
looks like next section we're going to
be taking a look at while loops in
JavaScript
