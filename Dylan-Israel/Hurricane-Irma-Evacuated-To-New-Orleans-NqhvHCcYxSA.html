mm-hmm
David yang what's going on man how's
everybody doing today
yeah Jamal
how am i I'm good man yeah so April and
I have been monitoring we had our carp
prepped and we we said hey if it if if
it comes towards if it looks like it's
coming towards area we're gonna evacuate
so yesterday we got on the road at 9
a.m. and then we finally got to New
Orleans which is normally a 10 hour
drive in about 19 hours when we got here
at 19 hours when we woke up this morning
they said but they steamed
that's absolute like it is yeah so I'm
sorry guys if it if it keeps on cutting
in and out the internet here even though
we paid for some wife
yeah premium Wi-Fi I don't think it's
actually all that premium so it may cut
in and out but yeah so we were gonna
have to evacuate but we evacuated the
day before basically our apartment and
some flood zone be flood zone a on
Thursday was mandatory evacuation and so
we took pto off yesterday on Friday and
April and I drove to New Orleans took
about 19 hours
it was crazy though I have a bunch of
put a vlog together probably about a
week or two but basically I'll show you
guys images of the end video of the trip
up we had to turn off the AC and the
poor cats and you can see that they're
all here with us right we're just
hanging out on the bed with us but they
were panting their asses off we had the
windows down and couldn't because we
were worried about running out of gas we
couldn't get gas so it's it's been
pretty hectic but we're here now so
we're just
hanging out man we're basically hanging
out till Tuesday maybe Monday depending
on how what goes on with the storm but
it's been it's been strange it's like we
are in the probably the worst room I've
ever stayed at the ceiling in the
bathroom so and put this in perspective
we arrived here at 2:00 a.m. last night
with that reservation and they tried to
tell us that we weren't gonna get a room
and I got kind of nasty about it because
like we had driven so far and like I'm a
pretty polite guy for the most part I'll
let a lot of people walk over me because
I just figure that there's something
else going on in their life that they're
unhappy with but last night at 2:30 a.m.
which was 3:30 our time I've been been
on the road till 9:00 a.m. I wasn't
having that at all and I made sure that
we got whatever room they had so the
ceiling is leaking but we don't want to
say anything so I have a bucket down
like it's coming through like an AC vent
it's leaking in the room but we don't
say anything cos we know there's no more
room so we're just hanging out got a
little bucket down filled up filling up
with water dripping the cats we packed
up all our stuff a couple days before am
I going to lose my job
no why would I lose my job everyone's
evacuating did I take in did I take my
computer with me I originally I planned
not to and then I was like I can't leave
you behind I packed it up into the I
packed up the desktop into the the back
of the trunk that was the one piece of
like non-essential stuff that we took
with us everything else was clothes food
water flashlights the one thing that we
should have had
we did leave the state we're in New
Orleans we're in Louisiana which is
about 700 miles away from where we're at
so we're good we're not in the storm
path at all we're good but no I won't
lose my job I'm actually so that's funny
that you say that this coming Friday is
the last day that that is the it's the
last day that I'm at my current job so
that following Monday I start a new job
so you're in live like everyone see that
everything it's not like oh you didn't
show up for work now everyone gets it um
because it's yeah they're I mean there's
people who are like that
they refuse to back out it is no joke
going straight through Tampa uh panic
mode no I mean there's a ton of
people on the road we left before a lot
of mandatory evacuations yeah and there
was no gas pen but now there's like how
many people that you ating yeah yeah
it's allegedly over five million people
are evacuating Florida so I don't know
what people are doing for gas because we
barely were able to lock one time
I believe I got flood into flooding
damage because we had to get it for
whole new place yeah because we live in
a flood zone we had to get it so I
believe we have it but I I could be
mistaken but I did get an email from the
insurance company saying not to worry
that we're covered and just a gets hey I
could just be some who knows
but yeah but we had to leave so much
stuff of value behind mainly my Suffolk
April stuff is like clothes and and
knickknacks we took like photos and
stuff with us but like like my four
monitors I just hit the hit the the
standing desks to the max so they're
just there I I also got
yeah so uh at the end of the day though
once every five years or so I get very
sentimental and and I want to go and see
what it's all about
put them up we weren't sure we were
gonna leave but uh we had our car packed
we had all our supplies so it not saying
that it's not going to get it baby
but yeah yeah it's funny training away I
saw them the Weather Channel that
there's people in Miami that are out
there kite surfing now it's not hitting
Miami but you're still gonna get bad
weather no weather where you're at the
thing is in the Tampa area
literally the
talking about picking up chicks picking
up chicks on what you like hey my
parents place in California what is he
saying but yeah I mean basically I
brought the laptop so once I kind of
recover even though it's like 6:30 we
were driving from 9:00 a.m. to about
3:30 our time and so I'm pretty
exhausted so so we're just going to sit
in bed watching stuff but if we if we're
able to kind of recover for the next day
or two I might do some coding just do
some algorithm stuff you're in
Jacksonville very nice I don't think
you're gonna be hit directly I think
tamp was probably gonna be the
accordions a the weather channel the
workplace how is the traffic well it's
there are certain parts that slow-add
you down monumentally so the trip
normally should take in 10 to 10 1/2
hours took about 19 and when we filled
up gas the one time it took about we say
about 45 minutes ago yes
getting my gas the show yeah but that's
because the shell people were like
 yeah the one across the street
was insane people were just
losing their respect you use and
make it up here to Idaho I was thinking
about it until I realized that you were
like all the way I'm living on the west
coast where trust me heard down for a
road trip man we went to New Orleans
yeah I was thinking about it what if the
hurricane is just category two and no
damages so that's good man that'd be
good stuff it just means that we spent a
day being safe you can't put a cost on
peace of mind yeah have we had any good
food in New Orleans yeah yeah we picked
up some food we're not really wanting to
leave the cats alone that's a weird
thing to say Sergio how long is the
storm you last according to what's going
on here you exit out of Florida
sometime early Tuesday
sound like a escaped an invading horde
of zombies nom and we just left and
dealt with traffic and whatnot just
hoping that our stuff is there only get
back we got even people in arc even the
people when we left am i doing the
encoding not today man I'm so exhausted
I'm thinking about just awful Monaco
well you say that this is less seriously
if it wasn't for her hurricane Harvey I
think a lot of people are taking it are
taking it more seriously because of how
bad it is is a fair statement it's also
like the worst one in history on the
East Coast for the Atlantic how long did
the final project free age from April's
priam course how did the phone
how'd your final project go baby
apparently the person who reviewed it
said it was perfect like exclamation
point had nothing but great things to
say about it so I guess that went very
well
perfect time to explain way bro so
hundred days the coding isn't going on
you more hurricanes no mainly because I
couldn't keep up man April studied on
their own and kind of decided that she's
gonna study project management and then
continue studying coding after she lands
a project manager role or during the
process of it yeah so right now she's
finishing up her project management
certification and lean and agile she
just submitted the final project and now
before all this sort of craziness
happened we were taking she was taking
the practice test and soon when we get
back into the swing of life we'll be
doing it one more time and then taking
the actual test driver
gret moving the Florida now I do think
it would be a common occurrence no I'm
not really meant for me it's a for me I
just
letter Judaism in Los Angeles what's the
name of the certification baby
Six Sigma so I don't know I don't know
exactly
stream keeps on breaking up that's
because we're on the world's finest
internet at the moat bootleg ass motel 6
yeah and by the way this cheap hotel
Wi-Fi after pay three dollars a day for
it's not even included so gotta love
that man oh and also only one of us can
use that time if I log in on my phone
and April logs in on her phone or her
laptop it kicks the other person off
but yeah so I don't watch a lot of TV
there's really nothing else to do though
for the next couple days
I mean heirlooms they kind of served the
purpose that that asks you what they
were supposed to do which was prepare me
for algorithm tests and considering that
I got I got a couple person obviously I
would say that it probably did exactly
what it's supposed to do but I do enjoy
doing them
there's nothing although nobody watches
them so that's kind of a downer right I
think Brandon I forget Brandon's last
name but circles beat Brandon is the
only guy watching the the Brandon bear
it's probably not bigger
he's he's a he's comment he's solving
them in three different languages if I
remember correctly
we're the other cats in here so Tito's
right there and then Achilles is over
there yeah man they were they were all
in the cage cuddled up they actually did
pretty good
- fact the first 20 minutes Milo's throw
up on top of Tito and then we had to we
had to stop and clean him off and then
after that they're good go show them the
bathroom it's up again oh yeah
Averell super good so this is this is
the type of that we've been dealing
with I'm not you can see that
so that's the life right now voice but
it's either that or sleep in the car so
I didn't drive and by the way we stopped
at about and that's not because of the
hurricane or anything that's just cuz
we're going to shitty hotel so we
stopped at every God maybe 50 different
motels along the way past Tallahassee
and so hope you're not paying much we're
paying like $70 a day by the way you
even even all the way to New Orleans man
everything's booked everything is booked
this was the last place and I told you
about how they were trying to get us out
of it
couldn't you have gone on holiday
trust me man I would I tried to get
everything I was willing to pay like
$300 a night for stuff I couldn't could
do it in I was I couldn't schedule an
Airbnb last minute and so once we got
this place for the night it might
because mind you we didn't know I was
thinking that I was gonna go up to East
Coast because that's what until Friday
morning all the analysts except like the
one or two models showed 90 percent
chance that it's probably going up the
East Coast and so we're like okay cool
let's be prepared if it changes path
we'll go we'll go we'll go New Orleans
and we'll stop at a place once we're out
of the zone we could not find a place to
save their life everything is booked man
so
but anyhow so we're here til til Monday
half the people in the motel are for a
man they're pissed off because this it
really is like delicate to point to star
out of out of five on Yelp and Google
reviews and all that sort of stuff so
but uh but um yeah so every time I go
out to like the lobby to get ice there's
someone for Florida yelling at
the people and uh what is somewhere
between eighteen and nineteen hours is
how long it took for it what normally
would be about a ten and a half hour
trip
I feel like I'm a decent developer most
jobs I see have a couple requirements I
don't have have you got any bad feedback
from flying places you might not be
qualified for it now one thing that it
could be man is maybe your personal
skills your communication skills
definitely worry about that oh that's
something like a lot of people don't
realize how I bombed the out of my
Amazon interview not too long ago so
Amazon reached out to me the hiring
manager on one of the teams for just me
and then I bombed this interview like
you would not believe um choked up um
have I gone to a Toastmasters no I don't
know what if Toastmasters is how does
the hurricane affect your new job I
don't think it's gonna have I don't
think it's going to affect anything we I
emailed them before I said hey are we
all set they said yeah just be safe and
we'll see you on Monday so I think we're
all good in that aspect I hope you had
her car serviced recently I did I spent
about $400 getting oil change getting
your battery new windshield wipers and
the brakes clean basically all the stuff
they said and we actually so that's
funny you say that David yang we started
out with yeah so we started out that so
this Friday morning yesterday we start
out with like okay let's let's get let's
get out we gotta get out packing up the
car I look my right driver or my left
driver's side tire is flat so I have to
use a fix on a flat and then put air in
it I was worried the whole time we're
driving up here
came anyway
don't with me right now right now
it's not the time to with me
no seriously I really feel like the
first like she she thought I was lying
to her for like a minute about this like
no I'm beautiful flat tire right now um
so I I have some pictures and videos up
on the vlog together of our adventure
let me tell you man it was an adventure
when we were like in the car no way see
just bumper-to-bumper traffic wandering
uh but we picked up now that we're in
New Orleans gasses and s scarce on the
on the way up Florida there is a there's
so many people that are running out of
gas that there's
you
right up right out outside from where it
is you'll see it like just suddenly yeah
just walk out and then it's right there
oh well I guess I'm like gonna fill my
time life streaming too much longer cuz
this internet is oh I thought maybe
the upload be ok how many people are
using the upload oh man what a week
I spent about $700 in car repairs food
supplies if I thought any I spent about
$700 getting ready and then April is
covering the room right now to help out
because uh I actually put up
I took normally I I keep very little
money on hand I invest the rest of my
money as all
hundred up to my account Oh free angry
about we're lost and found by like a
event or dates so it just kind of it
that's the only thing to be honest like
I haven't been thinking too much about
it um I'm just glad you know my main
concern have been these three guys so
yeah yeah we're good man we're in New
Orleans
Motel six so we're out of the any radius
that the storm could hit so we're all
safe and we're just hanging out here
till Monday evening and then we may end
up driving background late Monday night
and make it to work Tuesday morning or
maybe just Wednesday morning depending
on how the storm goes there is just
depends I don't know
it has been an adventure though I'm
sorry that much
look at those cats hey guys
they're just as talking basically when
we got here that Wi-Fi is anymore three
let's tell you I tend to agree when we
got here the nothing by the way this
this entire Motel six it should be
ashamed everything about this is awful
the only the only plus-size is it
councils a green screen the only upside
is that you get it comes with a green
screen wall for that for that the
occasional youtuber that's traveling
from hurricanes the cats know what's
going on for the most part they uh they
just go along with the right what we're
gonna tell them there's a hurricane they
have no idea right um stop slacking huh
I'm uh I'm actually thinking about it
man cuz like what else am I gonna do I
barely have any internet I did bring the
laptop although I don't like working on
the laptop so we'll see but any I guess
um I'm gonna go back to sleep
I'll uh I'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
