code camp we are working on those
intermediate algorithm section and it's
bonfire search and replace so what's
going on here in this case we have a my
replace function that takes in a string
a quick brown fox jumped over the lazy
dog we then find the word jumped and
then we replace it with our afterwards
so this is jumped
this is leapt and the circus drink so
eventually we wanted to print out a
quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
they give us some cool helpful links
splice string that replaces what I end
up using so let's go ahead and just get
started with that so the way string dot
replace works is you just select the
before we ran in the afterward and then
we will it will replace it so pretty
simple but it's not a complete but let's
go ahead and get started there so we're
just going to reset our original string
that's going in in and we're gonna say
it's equal to itself after your place
the before word the jumped with the
leaped word the afterward so it's gonna
save that and now when we run it you can
see right here some of this works but we
see oh man why isn't some of this
working and it's kind of for a BS reason
so what's actually going on here is they
want us when we receive a lowercase s if
the word that it started with had a
capital S they want us to return it
capitalized so how do we do that without
upsetting everything so this works for
90% of the stuff but what we're going to
do is an if statement for this case and
we're gonna say if for our before word
because that's what we're checking if
it's capitalized for the character at 0
where it starts is exactly equal to our
before word in this case jumped or else
we'll say sleeping and sitting so if
it's equal to itself but that first
character is capitalized so dot to
uppercase
we want to do some stuff so let's go
over this statement if our first word
for the first letter of our first word
is the same as itself but capitalized
it's already capitalized and we can move
on and with that that's exactly what we
need else ignore it because everything's
lowercase and we don't need to worry
about those one in a million not one in
a million but the those easier things to
solve so what are we gonna do here we're
gonna use replace again but we're just
gonna have to kind of get a little
tricky with how we set it up so the
we're still gonna be moving on the
before word but now how are we gonna
change this so the way I did this where
I select it or after word and the
character at 0 and we wanted to bring it
to uppercase but if we just end it there
let's go ahead and put the semicolon and
we can end it here you can see for o and
then fix this dot char at so if we just
fix if we just did this here let's go
ahead and use this string we can see
that will probably only be replacing the
letter so he is s yeah it's capitalized
but it's not exactly good so if you
remember back there's something called
slice where you can slice off part of
the word so how many do we want to slice
in this case we want to slice the word
after by one so now what's gonna happen
is let's go ahead and take this out so
we can see the before and after so if we
take our original afterward and slice it
by one it's going to slice off the first
letter so here we have 18 so all we have
to do is add that with this and we're
good to go
and there we go and that's it so let's
go ahead and write some comments in here
real quick so we can see what's going on
here so here which will say check if
first letter is capitalized
and here we change after to be
capitalized and then we just replace
before word for string is better with
after string and that's it so I hope you
