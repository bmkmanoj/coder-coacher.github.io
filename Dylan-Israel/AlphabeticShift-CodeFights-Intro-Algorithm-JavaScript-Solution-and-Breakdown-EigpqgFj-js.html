fights rains of reason the intro section
doing alphabetic shift now how I solve
this was I took our input string and I
made it into an array of characters I
compared it with a alphabet that I
created which was an array of letters
and then I found out what index valve
that letter was on and then I pushed one
more and unless it was Z if it was the z
space meaning it's the end of the
alphabet I just go ahead and set it to
the front so essentially what the task
is here is we're getting a a string such
as crazy then we would just want to
switch the letters to be one more than
the rest of them so let's go ahead and
get started with that as I mentioned I
created an alphabet such that equal to
the right now to save myself time and to
save time in the video I'm just going to
cut and paste all the values in here
that I would normally have so you'll see
right here we have the entire alphabet
ABCDEF all the way to Z has to be in
order for the logic I'm about to do to
work the next thing that we want to do
so take our input string I want to
convert that string in this case the
first ones crazy as a the ex-boyfriend
or girlfriend is crazy that is a context
of that and so we will go ahead hit put
that in it we're going to split it up
into a and array of characters now once
we've done that we want to go ahead and
iterate through that array let's go
ahead and create a standard array and
we'll eyes left when the input string
dot length go ahead and continue the
array
all right now that we've done that we
want to create what I call index Val and
we'll go ahead and set it equal to zero
studying equal to zero because in the
case in which the value is is Z it's
going to already be set to zero so I'm
going to check for that so what we're
going to do is we're in second check if
the input 3 hi
it's not equal to the character Z so
basically we're checking all the other
use cases doesn't really matter which
one we do we're go ahead and set index
Val equal to the alphabet and then index
up this is where we're going to find out
where that character is so if it's a see
it's going to return index 2 and if we
want to make that a D we just need to
add 1 to that index which is what we do
so of the current input string that's
the value that we're checking but
stirring eye we're going to go ahead and
just add 1 to it that's all
so we got that to where to say hey mount
index of Alex 3 and then we're going to
overwrite that input string with the eye
we're going to equal to the alphabet of
index out and at the end we're just
going to join the string back together
in our return statement we say look if
input string dot joy
we're not if so make that character
right back into a string array and we're
done so one more time the logic is we
created an alphabet the in order from
there we create we broke it up into a
string array we iterate through that
array we create an index value 0 for the
use case here if it's not equal to the
last value all we want to do is go ahead
and add 1 to the index value and change
the value if it's equal to Z or the last
one we've already set it we've now
shifted all of our characters by 1 and
at the end here we join the array back
together into a string and return not
not too bad there's probably a couple
different ways you can do this one this
is just how I solved it I solved
something similar I want to say on free
code camp in the past so this came
pretty quickly to me but as always guys

thank you so much for watching hey guys
thanks for watching the video especially
thanks to our sponsors dev Mountain if
you're look for a coding bootcamp or
tuition and housing is included
definitely check them out appreciate it
I'll see you guys in the next video
