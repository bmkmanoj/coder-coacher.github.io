share a little bit of code Oregon hour
of code for some of those of you who may
not know co.org is basically an
organization set up by Bill Gates and
Mark Zuckerberg a bunch of other people
who are involved in it to basically get
more kids out there to code and every
year they put on an event called hour of
code you go to hour of code com to check
it out and it's from December fifth to
December eleventh but now they had that
the purpose of it is getting more and
more and more kids to code and as of
right now they've had 293 million 480
1294 people who have competed in the
hour of code to basically spend an hour
their day to learn to write their very
first line of code which is pretty cool
and something I think everyone should do
so be aware of that that's out there now
the thing I really want to talk to you
about is the volunteer I'm not somebody
who kind of puts out advice without
doing it themselves and when I I've been
in st. Petersburg about seven weeks now
and I just got done volunteering at an
elementary school and as proof so you
guys don't think I'm bullshitting here
is the certificate of appreciation for
the great American teaching which
happened yesterday but back to what's
important and what's important is
volunteering to help out those who may
may need to learn to code for me I
signed up with the intention of helping
out for hour of code and I had a teacher
reach out and asked if I would come and
talk to several groups of students
several classrooms about software and
being a developer and they were between
the third and fifth grade and I was
happy to do that and the way she was
able to find out about me personally
wester co.org so if you want to
volunteer your time and you want to give
back a little bit to the community and
even if you just want to maybe help help
build up your resume or help your resume
a little bit because it does look good
that you're involved in coding and
things related to coding you have some
volunteer work code.org is a great place
to get started if you want to sign up as
a volunteer all you have to do to get to
this page just go to code org slash
volunteer they take on various levels of
people you're you can put your name in
company university the last year
experience level you can put if you're a
non engineer but you work in a technical
field that's great too you can talk to
them if you're a computer science
student that's great too and if you're a
you know software engineer or Technical
Specialist that's great they'll ask you
about how you can help out so there's
remote tutoring and stuff like that I
personally went in person and did that
you putting your LinkedIn profile
facebook profile in a little description
and email address and after that you
basically go into a database in which
various teachers can search their area
and see a is there any developers or any
computer science students that might
want to talk to my classroom where maybe
come in and tutor you know 20 students
for an hour to every now and again so
that's something that you're interested
in maybe you want to build your resume
up or maybe you just want to give back I
really encourage you to do so and now
it's the best time to sign up code.org /
volunteer an hour of code calm hour of
code is taking place December 5th to
December 11 so lots of teachers are
going to be looking for some people to
present or talk or answer questions and
it's you know you may not realize how
talented you really are to you know
maybe a third or fourth or fifth grader
and you can help them get started I know
we all remember back when we've all were
struggling and I we're all struggling on
advanced up now or getting our foot in
the door and things like that there's
you know try try to take it how it hard
it must be the code when you're you know
10 or 11 and granted their sub 10 year
olds that code better than me but most
of them are just getting started and
this is a great place to help out so if
you're in rest of that checking out code
org slash volunteer and as always guys
