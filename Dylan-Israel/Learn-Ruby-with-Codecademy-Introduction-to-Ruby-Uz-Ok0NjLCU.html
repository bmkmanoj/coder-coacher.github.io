guess one of my favorite sites code
Academy which is a free to learn kind of
online code insight we're gonna be
learning Ruby I've zero experience with
Ruby we're gonna do the first section
the entire thing takes about nine hours
I guess
it's beginner level so if you know
nothing about coding should be able to
pick it up pretty quick and this kind of
gives you an overview of what you'll be
learning obviously if you have some
programming experience it's going to be
a little bit easier but I encourage
everyone who's looking to kind of add a
skill to their resume to check out code
Academy completely free just like two
clicks you're in log in with your
Facebook Python Ruby PHP jQuery
JavaScript HTML and then they have a
bunch of other cool like little side
things that you can do to kind of test
your skills and create something new I
personally love it it's just another way
to stay on top of programming and maybe
get familiar there's so many skills you
need nowadays that it it's nice to have
something easy like this that's helpful
like I said uh so I guess this first six
this first section is sixteen yeah
times in the u basically P info here the
built in like environment I'm gonna kind
of skip over ready to learn Ruby Cletus
meant to continue so I you know first
thing first Neil I guess it's nothing
there and the next thing is like oh this
is going to be pretty basic we're
talking about data types right now so
okay so in this case we're initialized
an integer they want us to set it to 25
in instructions boolean true or false
value that want to set to true and then
string they want us to call Ruby so we
got make sure you here parentheses and
then I have hints here also if you get
stuck like this one it's pretty pretty
basic one you can set a variable to
value just by type of value after the
equal sign
you know stuff that maybe if you've
never
coated before would it be so intuitive
set the variable my num to the value I'm
so again pretty easy we're gonna just
follow the instructions declare a
variable it would seem that the standard
for Ruby is to use a underscore I'm not
I'm just assuming that I don't know for
sure so far this is pretty similar most
object-oriented we have our modulo I so
this I need to take note of double
double times for powers it would seem
okay alright we're not gonna do a little
MOSFET practice for ready to go alright
uh so two double double before so they'd
be two times two which is for them times
two times two so should be sixteen cool
all right let's see here
put some prints for the put string of
slightly different adds a new blank line
after okay so this is like print a line
put is like println and in Java and
print is just a prints about without
taking a newline
all right so French
like print Alan Java by the sounds of it
so let's do put actually and we'll do
hello
and then we'll print world oops
and then we'll print one more time so
it's really apparent sample I just face
just to keep it nice and so what this
should print is hello on one line drop
down online world same line I guess I
don't see this is where my my Java and
Python and you'll catch yourself doing
this where you just oh it's kind of the
same thing and then you're putting
things in that arcs for you there
should work
oh it's puts okay there we go so it
splits I'm not sure why is printing now
but uh might just be built into the ie
so you see hello drops down a line then
same line period now so next we're going
to be doing so string method it's just
things we can use we're gonna just skip
over this not really one big for
instructions all right so we're going to
call the length method and it's nice
because it looks like we're not gonna
have to use print Caesar or brackets too
often so let's see one two three four
five six four counting space seven eight
nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
fifty so this should give us a return of
fifteen and we got fifteen all right we
can also call the reverse method so
we'll do the same thing with on you and
it should print it backwards and we'll
do it right here just for fun
so that's le a are s I sexually dot C
and al Y C
all right and so this should the
basically swap the lines here oh let's
try over time actually see it uh I guess
it only would do it for one of them in
this ID but if we're gonna do it the
other way should do it alright sorry
next thing I had a up case will make
everything caps in down case will lower
everything I said I wants to put our
name so we'll do like that up case and
then just same thing in but I have to
skip a line in between stuff it's just
something I've always done so my code
may look a little more larger than
what's normal jot down case so let's see
here so we have all uppercase all
lowercase
cool so next writing good code I just
got done doing pythons so everything has
to be intended perfectly
and here we're using comments Java
standard to slash slash and it would
seem and Ruby that pound is the way to
go so here we go
common example it looks like a single
line okay so in their case their
multi-line equal began equal end is how
they do comment one two three so in this
case sadly that do their multi-line
comments it's a little bit interesting I
like that
okay listen just keep every keep your
string lowercase to start so we have a
name right here and we're gonna put my
name and again and I should work all
right so we initialize the string set to
down Christopher Israel next is gonna be
a quick review could a very well call my
name again standard is you use lowercase
or a underscore rather I'm just gonna go
Dillon show you this up pretty my age
oops and forget the quotes here because
it's not a string so here we go so that
worked declare variable name instead of
equal to string containing your name so
do dylan and call the down case so now
we're going to say name dot down case
call that rehearse on lower case name
they call up pace I said and on down
case let's just say name equals name
down case actually let's see if this
works
so I'm a damn case let's say okay so
that works and then we want to call the
upper hey stop up case see if that works
okay cool
and so what basically happens we were
just chaining the methods together so we
call our name string we down case it
reverses it and then I finally up cases
it so even though it doesn't look down
case this this happened then this
happens this happens another way to show
this would be name got reverse name okay
it's just show to do one at a time
that's kind of how you have to think of
it we would have got a different result
there though
create a single line comment on
multi-line comments or remember again
this is a single line comment pound or
hash tags them yeah and this be saying
single and then equals began pickles and
comments here and that is our
introduction Oh
come on
when we should have run into Naren
pretty sure I'm doing this right and see
here single line with hashtag multi-line
searches no space between the equal okay
let's reset the code real quick
Welsh look again hashtag comment - what
is this madness going on here okay I
guess I'll use just show you so
sometimes we'll get stuck on stuff so
there's a Q&amp;amp;A forum and a glossary here
kalasa real probably a little more
inches joshan so let's see 16 of 16
that's what we're on right here easy way
to find it
okay so it just seems like a little bit
of a probably an air on there and we're
for this except how it works you need to
have a space there but normally I don't
think we have to so that was our
introduction to Ruby the next session
putting the form in formatter you can
see it's already a little more complex</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
