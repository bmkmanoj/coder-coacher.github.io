interviewed Nicolas vanozza who just
graduated from a very prominent coding
boot camp called hack reactor in San
Francisco and I mean just graduated he
graduated literally the day before he
interviewed on my channel so we're gonna
kind of review hack reactor talks about
the pros and cons what he learned what
he really liked what he hopes they
improve upon we're going to talk about
hit what he hopes to achieve with the
after going to hack reactor and the
direction he hopes to go and anything
else that we cover and as always we took
questions at the end from subscribers so
definitely look forward to this very
smart guy I was really impressed with
him and hack reactor as well
who only accessed about 3 percent of the
application that applicants so hope you
guys enjoy this and thanks for watching
oh there's someone going to call hey
don't hate down good good oh oh how's
your day going you you said you're in
the East Coast right yeah yeah I'm in
Jersey but I'm job searching in New York
so yeah I just just moved cuz we finally
sold the house it's now I'm in a I'm in
a friend's apartment there you like
until I move out thanks gunner hey I
respect the grind man that yes the thing
is a lot of people want to be there's no
such thing as like an overnight success
so sometimes you got to grind it out a
little bit it's all about the grind and
that's I think one of the the things
that will if you choose to do a boot
camp that mentality is what is gonna
make you successful I mean I can really
only speak to hacker act there but I
think it's probably a safe assumption to
say that there is nothing in the world
that you can go and do and just like
plug something into your head and come
out in 3 months and like be good at
something if you don't work hard that's
that's that's a very good point because
I um I see people I'm you know I'm sure
you do the same thing you you know
Facebook groups and coding groups and
all this sort of stuff but I see people
all the time posting like I just went to
a boot camp and I lost all motivation
after
I graduated I don't I don't code for
like weeks at a time months at a time
now why do you add someone who just
graduated you graduated like a week ago
or how possibly yesterday yesterday are
you you're fresh fresh out of the boot
camp why do you think that is for some
of these people I go boot camps I mean
it really depends on what your
motivation is going into it I mean like
I've sort of been tinking around with
programming since like I did a
breadboard in class in high school so
it's always been something I've been
interested to but there's a lot of
people right now and I wouldn't say this
is necessarily true and hacker actor but
there's a lot of people looking at boot
camps and looking at the statistics and
seeing you know the money that people
could make after doing something for
three months and looking at it purely
from a financial perspective so I think
if that's like what your primary
motivation is maybe you're more likely
to burn out if you don't get hired right
away but if you're like me and you're
just like tinkering around with like
cool technologies like I do it for fun
too
like I'm gonna be working with angular 2
after this just the just for fun nice
nice so let's let's dive into hack
reactor a little bit why why hack
reactor because obviously boot camps are
popping up all over the place they're in
such high demand what was it that kind
of stood out about hack reactor so I did
a lot of research like I read about
everything and then it was funny because
I was between hack reactor and dev
Mountain so I saw Matt ended up going to
the mountain literally like two weeks or
something before I started hack reactor
but I chose hack reactor because you
know it there's it's obviously more
expensive and for me it's sort of
important I know that sounds like
counterintuitive but it helps me to have
skin in the game so to speak I have no
doubt that I or anyone could do it
without a boot camp at all but it really
helps you to be motivated you know when
you have skin in the game and I
interviewed at a bunch of places and I
was much more impressed with the
interview process at hack reactor it
took me like three interviews to get in
it was like really hard and that to me
was really impressive and the level of
the people that were doing the
interviews was was really impressive to
me so you know after I talked to a bunch
of them that was
my primary reason for choosing hack
after nice now if you don't want me
asking because I remember the hack
reactor is a little bit more expensive
what did what did it's about a
three-month program right what is it
what does that run you in terms of
finances uh I think exactly seventeen
thousand seven hundred eighty I believe
is the number now so which which sounds
like a decent amount of money but when
you when you compare it with you know
what the the numbers are throwing up and
what it would compare to go and get a CS
degree it's pennies on the dollar in
comparison yeah so I'm 22 so I
originally just was like okay I guess
I'll go back to school I was doing
culinary before this perspective and so
I was looking at prices and you know the
state school where I am at Rutgers my
parents make decent money so I get
nothing from federal so altogether it's
about like 19 a year so four years of
that versus you know seventeen once was
very compelling for me
nice no you said some I'm looking at
your LinkedIn right so excuse me why I
kind of Facebook stock you you said that
you it looks like you went to school to
be a culinary beforehand yeah so I
originally started as a computer
engineering and like I said I really
fell in love with like logic from bread
boarding in high school and I got into
to college and the only programming
class that I could take for the first
two years was MATLAB I don't know if
you've ever worked with MATLAB but it's
awful it's like it's like an advanced
calculator I don't think I wrote like a
single if statement or a loop and I was
just like man this sucks
so I switched I did culinary went to
culinary school worked in like a few
Michelin star restaurants and I really
loved that but it's very hard to sustain
yourself so I had to find a happy medium
that's why I switched back is so was it
so it sounds it sounds like it was like
a money thing is it like it's just like
I'm not good I'm not gonna make decent
money as a chef and I need a new career
path is that kind of like proposal yeah
yeah and the thing about coding is like
when you cook you're really affecting a
small amount of people and sort of an
intimate way
but with coding you know you can really
sort of paint with a broad brush and
really like affect a lot of people you
know whether it's like you know with
some enterprise facing app or something
like maybe more social interest like
there's a lot of options and for
directions you can go with it now what
would you advise for somebody who maybe
is going downwind went to a different
path maybe they were a chef maybe they
when they got their EMT certification
what would you what would be your advice
for them if they were considering to
perhaps go to hack reactor anywhere else
um I'm gonna sound like a broken record
but free code camp and coke atom II do
those things a lot and I think Matt may
have given similar advice but you know
there's a down payment necessary for all
of these all of them I assume if you're
gonna finance and if you're doing that
sort of like lower pay scale job like do
free code camp and code Academy while
you're saving up for a down payment and
if you can get if you feel very
confident like if you can you know do
higher-order functions and stuff in
JavaScript like around that level and
you save it up and you're still
interested like you're not burn out yet
that's when I would consider it and
start doing your research so it sounds
like you did a little bit of prep
beforehand when you went like before
your interviews oh yeah that's right so
I started like maybe May of last year
started teaching myself and I was pretty
far and then they do a prep class that
you can take which for me was really
helpful because I thought the most
difficult part was getting like from
being finished like code Kadim ii and
then there's like sort of like that gap
and resources to get you to like that
autonomous level well were you like you
don't need a tutorial anymore you could
just like look at the docs and do things
and for me that prep class is really
helpful to get especially with like at
the beginnings of functional programming
with stuff like under that or underbar
that kind of thing there's also a whole
bunch of good YouTube channels of course
yeah man like this one no awesome so I
so I interviewed Matt about dev Mountain
back and I asked him three basic
questions I'm gonna ask you the same
ones which was what what was the one
thing that you like most about hack
reactor okay so I mean there's a lot of
things but I think the thing I was most
surprised about was how smart everyone
there is I mean like I've always found
out that smart people has always been
you know the people that have been
interested with but man everyone that is
a hack reactor is so incredibly smart
like one of the the people who is in the
cohort with me has his PhD in
computational mathematics from Lehigh
and he is he was a hacker so like that's
the level of intelligence everyone's at
and if you just have people a bunch of
people that are super smart and you know
the same space like you're gonna learn
as long as you're willing to you know as
long as you don't have an ego and you're
like hey man can you show me how you did
that
like you'll learn so much like just by
proximity now what let's go in the
opposite direction now what would you
say was the thing that you would
probably didn't like the most about
hackers or some maybe an area where they
could improve upon um I would have liked
a little bit more emphasis on
architecture especially like flux and
Redux on the front end and it's sort of
a very minor thing and I I was
definitely able to learn it myself
during the time but I think that would
that would be the biggest improvement
that I could see okay oh and I like if
some of the people don't know what that
stuff is it's just state management on
the front end yes I kind of combined
those last two because last time we if I
want to interview it was like well what
didn't you like and then what what can
they improve the pond and it was like
we'll just improve on what I said I
didn't like me yeah I was trying the
reason I formatted those questions was
you know agile typically at the end you
you do like what worked well this week
what didn't work and pretty much like oh
I just apply that to here and that's
actually a really good idea so that's
kind of that's kind of what you know and
I encourage people by the way to kind of
apply that when you're learning as well
so it's like right now you're looking
for work in New York and I'm sure you're
still studying up every
eh yeah and sometimes it helps to
evaluate what worked what didn't work
and what you're gonna do to change that
yeah that's it's actually really good
that you bring that up because that's
how hack cracked your schedules like the
learning everything isn't like sprints
and you have scrum masters so you sort
of structure learning like development
works and like actual companies did you
ever consider about maybe doing any
other sort of development or was web dev
always I'm very pragmatic and I caught
the tail end of what you were saying as
I was coming in here from a jobs
perspective web dev seems to be the
easiest thing to get your foot in the
door although to be honest I'm much more
interested in like back-end technologies
especially the functional languages like
Haskell and closure and Scala I'm sort
of teaching myself closure just for fun
you know though maybe not the most
efficient thing to be doing before you
get a job but it seems that getting and
getting your foot in the door with like
web dev technology it seems to be the
best bet that's why I went with that
nice so I'm looking here and it looks
like you have four projects or these all
made while you were at a at a hack
reactor yes those are all at a crack
game which which one would you say is
probably like are you most proud of and
use the most tech knowledge like if you
were to show an employer employer says
hey show me your best project what was
it what did you make it with and you
know what what does it do essentially uh
so hmm it's kind of a tough question
because there's there's a project that I
really like that I think is the coolest
is tech trends but it's not necessarily
like it's the hard part is vanilla
JavaScript because you know we
aggregated data quote/unquote web
scrapes from job boards so that was like
really challenging and really cool
especially because it's sort of like a
dual database design because we're
dealing with like a lot of like huge
scrubbed text files from websites and
then you know rolling that up and
crunching the data to get analytics and
so it's sort of like two different use
cases for data that needs to be stored
but from like a frameworks perspective
the last project I did rapport which is
an angular 2 front-end it was
challenging just because angular 2 was
ratified
and I think October like came out of
beta so it's very new and there's a lot
of a lot of kinks there but yeah so
that's that's what I would say that one
is it's like a social automation tool so
you can connect with your Facebook and
your Gmail and automate like reaching
out to people when you're too lazy to do
it like well I mean I I think it's smart
more like a lot of people there's
there's just older school generation of
programmers that think like no you need
to make everything on your own and then
meanwhile I feel like maybe in the last
10-15 years there's been a little bit
more exception like nah man this I made
this whole library I'm just gonna take
that it's open-source yeah yeah I mean
don't reinvent the wheel right yeah
exactly exactly so um you uh look the
way that what this interview got started
is you reached out to me and said like
hey you know hack reactor says you know
certain marketing yourself can we can we
talk about that a little bit like I
would love to know what they like what
their their kind of philosophy is as a
developer when it comes to like
marketing yourself a little bit yeah so
the whole last week of hack reactor is
all based on an online presence and
getting your Linkedin up to snuff and
that so they'd spend a lot of time on it
there's like a whole team at hacker
actor for that we have outcomes coaches
that you know all of our applications
and stuff gets recorded and they can
look at it analytically and see you know
are we getting responses applications
are we getting past tech screens etc and
serve guide us on where you know where
to go that way a lot of negotiation prep
at that part I was really really
impressed with probably worth all of the
all the tuition just in the last week to
be honest do they have like a some some
boot camps bring in like you know
regional companies and things like that
to you know view your projects do they
do anything like that I so I did promote
I think they do that on-site but we have
a huge alumni network and there's a
bunch of companies that are partnered
with so we get like job offers but uh
like I guess descript like opportunities
through that that gets like they will
pass on to people they think are the
best qualified for it as well so there's
definitely lot of resources for that so
I didn't I didn't know that you did this
remotely
I didn't I didn't realize that was part
of the operation yes yeah I did remote
which I would I would recommend the
reason I I did remote over on say salmon
Jersey so I would have had to move to
San Francisco and beyond just the rent
and all that yeah there's a lot of
things to figure out right especially if
you're not from there you have to figure
out public transportation how you're
gonna cook they're gonna eat you know
where you get to your laundry all of
that whereas it's doing it remote
I was literally able to spend like 15 16
hours everyday coding for the last three
months which there's no way I would be
able to do that from on site now was
there any challenges as doing a bootcamp
remotely there's a lot less hand-holding
you definitely have to you know it's
sort of like out of the frying pan and
into the fire with you know learning how
to do things or so of course there's
like a lot of resources for for getting
help there's a great help desk resource
but the whole like ethos of hack reactor
quote-unquote this sort of sort of to
make you into that engineer that can do
things himself because I'm sure you you
know you can't just go here you know to
the senior dev every time you you know
have an infinite loop or something nah
man every time until he tells me to
off it's like this is if you guys want
to know if the senior dev wants to tell
you off that's how it goes there
you're talking to them and you ask them
question they go back to work and then
once they put their earbuds in
don't ask another question it means
they're done with you at that point they
need to get their own done yeah hey
you know that's very impressive that you
did it remote remotely and I'm sure I'm
sure it gave you a lot of benefits and
challenges of time yeah yeah there's
definitely challenges you know it's a
lot easier to develop something if
you're just like right over the shoulder
and you can like jump on their keyboard
they have it technically feel like
figured out very well though these like
zoom which is which is a really cool
video sharing it's not easier to share
your screen then and hangouts and flu
beds for pair programming but there's
nothing to replace you know being able
to reach over your shoulder and point
point out something now this is
something I've always kind of been
worried about it I've recently talked to
somebody about this is when you go
coding boot camps a lot of them are
known regionally like you know hack
reactor as he said is in like San
Francisco and like every all the
companies down in that you know tech
bubbling you know Southern California in
general no like oh man this is a great a
great boot camp and like I always want
like it does it does it worry you at all
trying to go to a boot camp that was in
California and then moving to New York
trying it work uh you know it worries me
a little bit but I'm not counting on
hacker actor's name to give me a job I'm
confident enough that you know in a
technical interview I can I could show
you what I can do I'm not like relying
on a character for that but that being
said most of the recruiters that have
been reaching out to me know it and the
companies in New York know had character
so I don't know if that's a result of
their marketing team or they just
absorbed a few schools in New York but
it's definitely not been a detriment so
far nice nice anything that you wanted
to cover about hack reactor or codeine
anything like that um I guess uh just my
my advice if you are someone that's
looking to make a career change and you
are very very self-motivated then you
can do it with free cocaine you know
there's nothing in a boot camp per say
that you can't find online for free but
what does exist in the boot camp and
what was really important in deciding me
to do it is the people and especially a
hacker actor all of the instructors care
like a lot about you they're doing it
you know to help you to get back not not
because of the money and the students
like it's something like a 3% admittance
rate in to hack reactor I'm not sure of
the exact number but it's around there
so everyone that there is very very
smart and they're all in it to do the
same thing so it's just sort of being in
that environment for me there's no way
would I could have gotten done in three
months what I did I found what uh people
always are very curious about like this
entry-level salary what entry-level
salary are you hoping to to get a job at
you know realistically and in New York
now
so you know that's kind of like the
lowest thing on my priority I kind of
really fell in love with coding even if
I did get into it for more of a
a financial reason and I really just I
want to work with really cool smart
people with tech that I think is cool
that being said however I'm looking into
like 90 to 110 so we're there there you
go that's I mean that's a healthy salary
it's a big job but in New York you know
like I can't find a bedroom for less
than 1300 a month so it's all relative
yeah definitely uh have you heard
anything about Google all right this is
a weird random question I haven't heard
anything about this but Jessica Rose
asks have you heard any thing about
googled Ananth denouncing coding boot
camps and their hiring practices no I
haven't it's interesting though because
someone from the cohort above me just
started at Google like two weeks ago
so I'm sure it's there's definitely
truth to it but I think it really
matters how good you are rather than the
boot camp itself yeah and I think that
really goes I I think you're in it
software is an industry where it's it's
very contingent about how motivated you
are and the individual much more than
your experience and and resume and it's
it's one of those things where like if
you can prove your value software's
industry is very accepting of that yeah
I would say the same thing especially
because there's a there's a great I
guess range in skill level as ELISA my
co or anyway and if you're gonna be the
person that is gonna be in the top 10%
of your class then I don't think you'll
have any trouble finding a job it's when
it seems like so far anyway
soryo Kenard says you put all your good
all your code everything you do on
github and would that be good for
employers I put most of my code on get
up there's still a lot of it that isn't
and I don't think there's any downside
so putting code on github a lot of
people are like nervous to put like some
of the first stuff on there because
maybe it's not like the cleanest or
maybe it's there's like crazy you know
oh and squares high complexity all over
the place but I mean it just its growth
and employers can look at that and they
know that this is not like production
quality code today I don't think there's
any downside unless you have like IP
that you want to protect and you're you
know maybe starting something up but
other than that I don't think there's
really any downsides
now I'm gonna kind of change this
question a little bit
sumit Kumar is the origin of the
question but he's asking about
freelancing versus working full-time
if you ever considered maybe doing
freelance work uh I mean I'm considered
it sort of as like a side hustle I'm
much more interested in the security and
the mentorship that comes from a
full-time gig like I said I really just
want to get really really good I mean I
think I'm good now but you know you can
always get better especially if I can
get that Haskell job yeah
good they may cut you off but this is
this is something we were talking about
when the before this interview started
of the value of having a senior
developer to kind of leech off of a
little bit because I mean realistically
they probably charged $100 an hour $200
an hour for a good senior dev and you
get to sit right next to them and be
like hey why does this not do this or
why does this work yeah that's and you
know some people don't see the value in
that but that's always been you know
especially coming from culinary like I
did I know how to learn for people that
are better than me it's like my best
skill and that's why a hacker actor is
really good because you know in the
beginning there's people that were a lot
better than me but so yeah I want to be
next to that senior dev that like really
knows their all right you're even
wasting joven I mailed that name you did
what are some things that you learned at
boot camp that you would find essential
to be ready for the job market
okay that's sort of very specific to
like if you're looking for full-stack
jobs or front-end jobs or back-end jobs
but the one thing in general is testing
write tests do it don't fall into the
trap of not writing tests like I did for
some things totally write tests for
everything learn tests learn continuous
integration like Travis CI is great
learn how to deploy so like AWS and
Heroku and dissolution all that is not
very essential but there are things that
will look very good on your resume I
mean the thing that's essential is that
you know how to code
you know like know whatever language you
pick like front and back like if you're
gonna learn JavaScript
make sure you know es6 and es7 know how
closure works well you know function
hoisting works all that be good at at
the language like you can learn a
framework in a couple of days you know
at least enough to be productive it's
more important that you're just like
really solid at computer science now
someone's trying to make the transition
from like a because you said you you
worked a little bit in high tea right no
now are there any skills that kind of
carried over that you thought oh this
kind of helped or is a nice to have I
think kind of the thinking is is very
similar especially when you have a bug
like just kind of systematically working
through you know trying every Ethernet
port making sure there's nothing wrong
with the operating system etc to you
know this very well
undefined here because JavaScript does
not tell you it's you know same sort of
thing I'm sort of methodical you know
you can't get angry that kind of thing a
lot of overlap in that regard yeah this
is a good question by sumak come are
what were some things you wish you knew
before the boot camp before going to a
boot camp and it would advise your
previous self when you're about to start
the boot camp uh CSS I spent a lot of
time getting really good at javascript
and short of did everything that I was
gonna do in the first week I like I'm
learning CSS more now like if you want
to be a real badass like learn your CSS
media queries and how to do responsive
CSS without bootstrap that would be the
thing I mean of course you can use
bootstrap but most front-end gigs want
you to be really good at CSS at least
that's what it seems so far yeah I'm I'm
I am a victim of bad CSS so I'd be like
so yeah there's definitely something
where I don't know I just it doesn't
appeal to me it's kind of weird because
I'm a developer it's not I don't know
it's like different logic it's CSS to me
it feels like here just memorize a bunch
of stuff and put it together yes like
with programming it's like here's your
tool set you're an engineer you can you
know how to do the things
probably why I like react a lot more
than angular to see I like I just love
the logic of it like I'm very
that's the JavaScript and the frameworks
of connecting things and making it work
but it's just like making it look pretty
give that to a web designer oh yeah
yeah no I agree but uh you know whatever
it gets me a job I could be picky once
I've already hired exactly like get your
foot in the door and do what you need to
do to get hired and you know start
making that money and getting that
experience yeah that's what it's all
about but yeah CSS I would say is the
big thing I don't know if that's
different for other boot camps there's
