back in Codecademy react Jas part 1
doing components interacting components
render other components a short section
but a very important section so when
developing your react applications or
your act websites you're going to be
using components you're going to be
using it for basically everything and an
important part of that is being able to
kind of chain your components together
so that when you are rendering it out
you're rendering out all your components
are not just one and that's basically
what this section is about here so they
give us an example of how we would
create a component all this should be
pretty familiar you'll see here that
we're actually creating multiple
components right here and in one of our
components for returning our OMG
component right here so just keep that
in mind you're seeing a component
returned within a component so let's
let's jump right in right now now the
way that we would be able to do this is
exactly how we saw so you'll see that we
have two files here one is a navbar file
which contains a navbar component the
other is a profile page that j/s file
that contains a profile page component
so what it's asking us to do is that on
line 9 it wants us to simply insert our
nav bar right here now this is how you
would insert or link a component just
like that it's pretty straightforward
right the only thing is because we're in
two different JavaScript files we're
going to actually have to link to that
file and similar to how we do require
like so so you'll see right here that
basically gives us an example of that it
uses the relative the relative
path and we're going to go ahead and
just go ahead and require the file like
so so we're gonna save our nav bar is
equal to require basically just saying
where's this file at and it happens to
be at this location Doug at bar close it
just going to run that real quick so
we're basically just importing the nav
bar 5 so that we can use the navbar
component nice now it goes into a lot of
detail here about module exports take a
second to read over this if you want
more documentation it's there it gives
us a nice example here module dot
exports fav manifestos basically what
it's saying here is at the end of a file
you can use this module exports and it's
gonna so when we call that file when we
require that file we're only going to
actually get that's very like get the
component that we want in nothing else
so it's gonna it's gonna won't work it
won't return the entire entire first
file as they explained here so let's go
ahead and jump into our nav bar and
you'll see inside if you outside the nav
bar but within the navbar jas file I saw
the navbar component i should say we're
going to actually export module exports
are component now this isn't going to do
anything unless we call this file but
now when we go and it uses the required
here it's actually only going to pull
this aspect right here it's only going
to pull this component and nothing else
so maybe we had multiple components but
we only wanted to pull one aspect of it
that's kind of why you'd do something
like that no need to import the react
file second time as well
very nice and then finally we're going
to go ahead and just render this out so
now that we've required the file we're
going to go ahead and just do the same
thing we've been doing in the other
tutorials where we're going to react on
render and what do we want to render out
we want to render out our profile page
component right here which is also going
to render out our nav bar component
because we've imported it and we've only
are going to import the navbar component
because of our module exports so let's
go ahead and do this so we're going to
import our profile page component
actually not import we're going to say
look out export our profile page
component to document dot get element by
ID to this location app then when we run
it
damn any second now there we go so we
have our our component here which is our
nav bar and then we have our profile
page so a little bit of a short lesson
but an important lesson of how that you
can import components from other Jas
files and and use components within
components which is a very crucial part
of react so up next I imagine this is
going to get a little bit more
complicated and we're going to be
talking about something called props as
well so it's a dynamic way to store
information apparently my views across
very limited amount but it should be fun
