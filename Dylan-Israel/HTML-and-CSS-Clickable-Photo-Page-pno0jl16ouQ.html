in HTML structure table dude spans and
we're going to be making a clickable
photo page so some photos on your table
I know the first thing notice right here
is that there's a stylesheet CS s
cascading style sheet this is going to
be slightly changing how our code our
HTML looks and is generated so and the
way you do it right here is linked I'd
text / CSS stylesheet address you know
you'll get inside so we're going to
create table within the body so here we
have table and then we want to put in
table with three table rows Sochi are
here and then be our last ER and then we
r / here's those are our table rows all
right looks like we got a little
something here probably from the
stylesheet put at every table cells per
0 to get a total of nine cells and so
that's the TD so um so each one of these
we want to add to the TV / TV and the
instance of time we're just going to
copy pasta this in there and cut the
fastest in there and same thing here so
we have
and then save the game alright cool so
we're basically laying down the
groundwork for our table so we now need
to create our table head so there's our
table head and we're going to call this
will call this some skill set on oh it's
in our table hood got to declare you get
more than one so there we go
I insert an image between each set at TD
oh my god so let's get an image what do
we want we did ninjas us to cats sighs
and we want icon size here we go now we
will copy the image URL let's get back
to already done and in here we are going
to sit between the table cells each one
table so you want to make a little
something so damaged sr c is equal to
and don't forget of course do the ending
/ all right and just in the instance of
time so that we don't kill ourselves by
having to do this so so many times we
will just be doing again and again and
again
and so you see we have now are three
rows and three columns of our cats
pictures and then a wrap each image tag
and link above so now we want to wrap
all right oh yes Pat's calm we're going
to close it and then this home and how
do we close it outside so BAM this one
click one I there's this one and then
we're going to just go ahead and do the
same right here and then one more time
right here in about seven more times
here there hopefully we did skip wanna
mess up on one will have to work through
this but I typically like to have one
HTML tag just because that's kind of how
I've always done it with coding but you
can see all of a sudden you're going
through quite an amount of lines of code
so it's all is you do whatever you want
basically all right so looks like you
don't have enough links ok so let's see
here we have one not closes we have two
and then I closes three up three and
then it closes therefore and then it
closes we have five it doesn't close
okay we'll see if that was there nope we
have six
well now we have six yes that was I BAM
so there we go nine links and now you
basically saw what we were trying to do
here we made a clickable photo page so
here we are we have our skill set table
header and you can see that the style
sheet is just given us a little bit
basic style without this and without
customizing it further this is what it
would look like so what are we doing
next oh and of course share as always
next up we're going straight into CSS
and over here so we 26 sections of this
and it looks like we're gonna be doing
puppies we should've made it cats but i
will let that slide and you can see
style sheet right here it's getting very
in-depth so for the image it's going to
have default image height with a shadow
you know resets RGB so last stuff list
how much the left and how much what's
paragraph should be so this is all just
styling for different things but knows
for the bold all that sort of stuff so
lots of cool stuff you can do a CSS and
we'll be getting started on that in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
