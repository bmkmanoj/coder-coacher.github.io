often
strangely enough what is the worst part
of being a developer and I can tell you
what the worst part is for me I don't
think this is gonna be a mind-blowing
statement I think it's gonna be a
personal choice more than anything else
like what bothers you about being
developer I don't think there's like a
universal thing but for me it is clients
so it's kind of weird thing to say
because the way that we get paid is
through our clients right so whether
you're doing freelance or whether you're
working for a company that company has
clients and the reason I say that is
because it's sort of this the customer
is always right mentality sometimes at
as a developer and whether you're
working by yourself you're working on a
team is you can kind of let your voice
be known right say hey I think I think
this idea you have the way that you want
it to be executed isn't gonna work
you're gonna you can have that
conversation and it may be received or
may not but if it's not remember this is
sir this is her brainchild a lot of
times this is their baby right it could
be a website for business could be a web
application that they finally a got a
developer to make it could be anything
but they're they're the architect at the
end of the day they're their vision and
sometimes the vision the practicality of
how things line up you have to kind of
explain it to them and sometimes they
accept it and sometimes they don't I've
been in a lot of situations where as a
developer I knew something was gonna
fail in terms of not the overall project
but the feature I like the I knew the
weaknesses and I made it known or you
know my boss made it known or other
people made it known and you knew very
well that three to six months down the
line you're going to be having a
conversation with your client and
they're gonna be like oh I actually need
you to change this thing that you just
spent a month on and that's fine that's
business at the end of the day but you
know as as developers we want to do what
we know works best and sometimes you
just have to say look you're the client
you
paying us and I'll do what you want and
maybe you'll prove me wrong but I'm the
developer and I'm telling you it's a bad
idea how you want this structured and so
clients for me have always been the main
issue and that goes back to when I was
freelancing right so not that I have any
bad clients now or anything as a
developer I have but there's there's
more of a kind of like the the customer
is always right I guess is the easiest
way to put it and when the customer is
always right and the customer is paying
you you do what the customer asks
whether you're good with it or not
but I've had bad clients also in the
past where they've argued with me about
prices and things like that or you know
I had one guy I was working with his
girlfriend a while back and I stood
freelance for them for a relatively
cheap rate at that time I started at $15
I moved up $20 an hour freelancing for
them and I the first time I ever met her
boyfriend who owned the company it was a
luxury furniture company rental
furniture rental company he for about
three to five minutes yelled at me for
not getting enough stuff done on on the
amount of hours I gave him which was
only about eight hours of work and I
asked him very briefly I was like oh
okay so how much web development do you
know and he didn't like that at all
it was just smartass thing to say by the
way um but uh that's my wonderful
girlfriend back there I don't know if
everybody heard that but with that being
said the sort of stepping out of line
and screaming like legit screaming at me
was a pretty unappreciated I actually
quit that job that day the girlfriend
offered to hire me back at a higher rate
and I declined what I really declined I
said sure and then I added about 40% on
so Shalford hired me back at $25 an hour
I said because this guy have set me I
was like uh I'm gonna need $35 an hour
if you want me and that was too much and
I didn't really want the work at that
point but that
that's one of probably about three or
four bad experience stories I could tell
you but I guess the more of the story is
forget the fact that for me the worst
part about webs of them is clients
because I'd like to think of myself as a
purist I like learning right in a
perfect world I'd be making tutorials
and doing projects and do my own thing
right not necessarily working for
somebody but do my own projects my own
passion things were like I can make
mistakes on my own right instead of
making mistakes that they choose right
but I think I think when talking about
what's the worst part about web
development I don't really mind the
clients because it's just part of the
world and I think there's not like a
single thing that stands out I just
wanted to kind of share that with you is
that being a web developer being a
developer in general there's always
going to be with any job those rough
days those days where you're gonna be
like yo man all of a sudden this isn't
as much fun as it used to be it's just
part of the process and for me is with
clients it probably would be something
different for you it's gonna be
different for everybody but um it's very
my new like I would say and if a typical
job you hate your job every other day I
don't know if that's a fair statement I
think most people probably I read a
statistic I said something like 80% of
people hate their job hate that's the
word I hate their job but I would say
that of all the developers I know most
love their job and like their job and
I'm very happy and that could be a
combination of being intellectually
stimulated or it could be a combination
of being well paid you know when you're
making good money and you can afford
stuff food and you come forward housing
and things like that that's another
thing to keep you happy not that money
makes you happy but I've said this
before that money made money may not
equal happiness but I do believe poverty
makes you sad and so that's one thing
but everyone's gonna find a little thing
that they don't enjoy fully doing mine
is interacting with clients yours may be
unit testing it could be something much
more technical but at the end the day
don't don't be afraid
you don't enjoy everything it's okay
it's natural everyone's gonna have
things that they lean to I
I love diving into new things and try
new things and building tutorials I do i
I do some lat
but at work you have to do things that
you may not choose to do in terms of the
tech space right like setting up
projects is probably number two for me
like having to set up in development
environments and going through all the
loops and hooks to just get ready to
code is probably the number two thing I
hate most but yeah that's my two cents
as always guys if you have any questions
