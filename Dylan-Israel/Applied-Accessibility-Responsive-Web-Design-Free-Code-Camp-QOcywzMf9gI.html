back in free code camp in the responsive
web design section doing applied
accessibility let's let's go ahead and
see what's going on so accessibility
this section is going to be about adding
additional things to our HTML and CSS
logic so that we're able to basically
make it better for people who have
visual auditory mobility or cut
basically four people are disabled or
have special issues we are going to
allow our our web page to be easier to
navigate through and this may be things
such as adding audio adding text having
special text adding special tags oh all
this ourselves let's jump right in
though it'll be much easier to
understand so what the alt tag does for
your image is basically if our image
fails the alt tag will be the text
alternative so let's say our image for
whatever reason doesn't display when we
run it right now you'll see that we just
have this broken image however if we add
the alt tag what's going to display
instead it's going to be text basically
same with that image was supposed to be
so in this case it looks like it's
karate Wow so let's just look karate Wow
and when we run it you'll see now that
we still get the broken tag it's not
going to fix this but it's going to give
you a description of a description as to
what it's supposed to be doing
now you also can put all tag in there
with no description so excuse me I've
been doing lousy some kind of losing my
voice a little bit so camper cat has
coated a skeleton page for a blog part
of its website explaining to add a
visual breakdown between these two
articles with decorated have an alt tag
to the image at your add alt attribute
to them a check and set it to an empty
string okay so we have our image ass
route here we're going to add an alt tag
and before we do that it's going to run
our code so we can see what we're
working with so we have our broken tag
and we're going to do alt is equal to
that when we run our tests and you'll
see we can still add the alt tag and
nothing is showing up in there it's just
an empty string
so in a and our example here camper cat
wants camera catches camp for cat wants
a page on the site dedicated to becoming
a ninja help him fix the headings so his
mark up gives semantic meaning to the
content it shows proper parent-child
relationships to section okay change all
the h5 tags to the proper heading level
to indicate their subsections of h2 ones
so I'm a little confused about what
they're asking that's ok let's see it
lets get a hint all the h5 tags are
siblings it should be changed to the
same new heading level hmm so let's go
ahead and read through this
okay okay so it looks like they just
want to change our tags from age 5 days
3 i'm still very confused about this
section this specific section but what
actually asking us to do
thanks
but we change our tags as per the
instructions so we can jump so we have
this main tag cool thing about the main
tag is it allows us to jump straight to
the
so that's always saying we have this
main tag and the main tag is basically
in a element well that which will allow
it to jump straight to the section that
we're at kind of where all your main
sort of content goes so if you have here
we can go ahead and put main and notice
this is header not head so don't go can
confuse we're going to wrap it all in
our main tag like so we run our test oh
excuse me this is actually supposed to
go before the footer my mistake
your code should have one main tag
should between the header in the footer
there we go so I just put in the wrong
spot there so you basically just wanted
this is the main site this is where all
the bulk going so you have your
basically the top of your website
interest be like your header your
navigation you have your footer at the
bottom but everything else in there in
the kind of the main section of the body
if you will is where you would use the
main tank you also have the article
element so instead of showing this real
quick so instead of divs here what we
want to do is we want to go ahead and
because these are all articles articles
kind of similar to give these are more
html5 tags that just kind of have a
slightly different purpose but are still
containers at the end of the day and all
we're doing is kind of correlating
everything these are our articles these
are article containers that's really all
you really need to know about that
there's also sections and there's some
additional thing so right here let's
read the difference before we move on
you have div which blocks content you
have section with which blocks related
content and then you have article which
blocks independent self-contained
content so a lot of just got to dive
into the details a little bit but you
can kind of see how these are kind of
independent articles right so maybe if
you had a section around all your
articles and then each article
alright so camera carrying great
articles about ninja training wants to
add a page for them to his site change
the top tip that currently contains the
h1 to a header tag and set so ever top
div here and part of the reason you do
this is it makes it easier to see right
you're like little a header tag and a
header and I did kind of do the same
thing kind of but what's what's
happening here is most web pages will
have a header like so and it becomes a
lot easier to see where your header is
when you have a tag just called header
so similar to how we did the header we
also can do our navigation right and so
we have nav tags for that so it says
it's div here what we want to do is wrap
our our our navigation here these three
lives in the nav tag this makes it much
easier especially if you're working on
projects to kind of see this is the
navigation you don't have to go hunting
it down you just have to find the nav
tag or the header tag or the footer tag
and so on and so forth so we have our
footer here which is between a div we
don't need that as well we're going to
be using the footer tag
and notice nothing actually is going to
change but are the way that we have our
code organized and using the proper tags
is really what's important here all
right so we're going to use the audio
element this is something I'm not too
familiar with an example here we have
can apply audio you give an ID this
controls adds controls to it and then
you put what audios you want to be in
there and basically how this goes is it
will play the first one if i remember
correctly and then the second one now
what do we want to put it so we are
going to pass in an audio tech so I
don't tag I'm opening and closing yes it
does / audio we want to give it the
controls attribute so that we have
actually let's leave it out first so I
can just kind of show you I think it's
better than me just talking about it
then we want to have is its source yes
source source tag and then a tyke this
is basically what file tuck types the
audio is source and we'll go ahead and
do the audio / MPEG alright let's jump
up grab one of these sources real quick
we'll grab this first one which is audio
slat dot slash me now mp3 all right
let's run this real quick
so you'll notice that we nothing's
actually happening here however what we
could do is we want to add some controls
and we run it and this controls oh I
headed to source excuse me you add it to
the audio tag so we're going to have
controls to our audio tag and now we
have our little playlist button here so
that we could play it if we wanted the
valley for this RC element should match
the link in the extractions exactly and
I'm fairly certain that it does but
let's go ahead and just copy this over
just in case they want to have oh whoops
and don't forget your closing source oh
we don't need closing tag what we do
need though is a slash at the end here
let's see if this fixes it hmm alright
that's actually just copy and paste is
them to see if this will solve our issue
so I think we understand the concepts
involved in this hurt tively easy all
right so here this one
oh my mistake so I see that there is a
link right here that we need to pass it
a nice passing in the example code but
what we need to do is pass this in so
I'm pretty sure this will do it nice and
now we can play we can adjust the volume
and then we have whatever audios going
on that actually I didn't have I don't
have audio on so let's enjoy this real
quick Apple bit yeah I don't know what's
going on with that but that's how you
can get your audio playing on your web
page like that now i am not familiar at
all with the figure tag so we're going
to slow down here for a second the
figure element along with the fig
caption used together with these items
wrap a visual representation like an
image diagram or chart along with its
caption this gives a two-fold
accessibility boost by somatically quite
excellent it's figure for data
visualizations like charts the
captioning of us briefly note the trends
or conclusions mr. ensue over here to
transfer conclusions alright so caprica
is started working at work creating a
stacked bar chart showing the amount of
time per week to spend training in self
calvin and weapons help him structure
his page better by changing the div tag
he used to a figure tag that surrounds
the caption to a thick caption so
instead of this div here what we want to
do is do our figure so this has seems to
be if I understand this correctly what's
going on is we now have certain things
to deal with with data visualization
which is a huge part of web development
typically data analytics is a giant
field so it's not it's not too crazy do
you think that they're going to make a
custom tag to help facilitate with that
so instead what we want to do here is we
want to
you want to add a fit caption now fig
caption is going to go around the
comments so instead of this paragraph
tag and you'll see this right here this
is kind of our figure we're going to add
a fig caption tag let's see if anything
actually adjust this if it I I don't
think too much is going to change or
anything at all really but it does help
us organize our code a little bit better
now there's the label element now this
is part of forms basically what the
label does is it makes our forms kind of
flow load bit better and be more
associated so you have kind of instead
of putting like an h1 tag you could have
your label and it'll be associated with
your input or your drop down or anything
like that so chemical addicts works a
lot of interest in thoughtful blog post
wants including email signup form on the
email label a fruit that matches ID so
we have our email you see we have our
labels next to it what we want to do
here is look at the example so we have
this for statement basically we have our
name and we've set it right here and all
we're saying is this label is for name
another name its use me email we're
basically associating our label with our
input here that's all that's going on
so fieldset allows us to wrap a bunch of
things together in inputs it's all form
related stuff which is a huge thing to
get comfortable with I work with forums
on a regular basis now what they wants
to do your code should have feel so
tagging around the radio button set so
we have our type here radio alright so
instead of this diff what we want to add
is field set and I'm going to go right
here fieldset cool and you should have a
legend tag around text using what level
ninja it is okay so the legend tag let's
let's read up about that real quick so
the legend tag is basically like a label
except it's for the entire set so we're
working with radio buttons so this is
kind of the description if you will
similar to a label right but this is for
a set of data so instead of label we're
going to put legend and there we go so
you also notice that there's some nice
styling that goes with it our fields
that groups everything with that box
with like a low box and you can
obviously customize it and then we add a
legend I instead of being inside of the
box is now like a part of the box if you
will so really let you know organize our
code nicely and neatly add accessible
date picker okay so for a date submit
what we want to do here is add one input
tag so that a date picker to hear we
just need to include our infotech we
have to put the type is equal to date
and what else do they want so we have
our type ID with the value of pic date
so we're gonna give an ID as well
typically all year inputs will have an
ID
so it's big date and then we're going to
have a name is equal to date and let's
go ahead and run that for now and you'll
see here when we give it a type it's
going to function a little differently
right so here's kind of our standard
little date picker that's how you would
do a date picker which is great makes
life easier right so you can also do a
time or a date time picker so this is
that your time tag should wrap around
the text Thursday September 13 all right
so uh where's Thursday well I can't your
voice ooh the word Thursday alright so
here we go you're passing the time tag
let's just see how this looks I haven't
actually used the time type before /
time alright so we have this right here
let's see how this changes if at all Oh
does it we are going to apply a datetime
attribute to this as well so and we're
going to set this equal to okay it looks
like they want us to put a value in here
which is 2016 09 15 and so this is some
data that we can go ahead and do
something with later that's what we're
coding in here basically where do you
have everything formatted the way we
want it here cool
so make elements only visible to a
screen reader by using custom CSS okay
so camper cat created a real cool
stacked bar chart for its training page
and put the data into a table for his
visual impaired users so this is going
to help people who are visually impaired
so that they can still use websites to
the best of their ability you see we
have some CSS to help with all this so
that's our only you see this is stuff
that you're gonna have to have in here
to kind of help out what's basically
going on is we're going to add an
absolute position meaning this isn't
going to move we're going to throw it
off by ten thousand pixels meaning
you're never going to see it the width
is going to be 1 pixel the height is
going to be 1 pixel we can leave top and
over overflow meaning motor CSS
parameter so we're going to add all
these parameters they are now going to
allow things to be more or Apple
basically we're going to have more
additional data but you're not going to
see any of it on the screen
some prove readability with high
contrast text that's kind of cool your
code should change the text color of the
body to darker grey so darker grey is
this color so you notice how we can't
see jack diddly let's go ahead and
change the background color kind of a
strange thing to throw in here I feel
like this might be in the wrong section
but now we can have a darker gray Oh see
here oh they wanted oopsies I did the
runway so they wanted to text a change
so there we go text a little more
popping out looking good looking nice so
some people are colorblind you know they
can't see red or they can't see blue or
there it's Ritter green they can see red
or green so instead let's go ahead and
change certain color blind properties
will read the statement here kampra
Cadiz experimenting with using color for
his blog text and backrub let his
current combination of greenish
background color with maroon tech seller
has a two point five to one contrast
ratio you can easily adjust euthanasia
sell property which we've talked about
before so basically it sounds like the
lightness values have an effect when
talking about dealing with people who
are colorblind so instead let's run this
what we're going to do is we're going to
add this fifteen percent and then we
want to change excuse me to change the
lightness value the text color this is
actually fifty five percent and this was
fifteen percent it will be much more
manageable for people who are going
another way that you can kind of help
facilitate that is to use colors that
aren't super common with people green
colored lines so right now we're using
green and like a pupil colored line of
yellow s people are colorblind of yellow
and green and all that sort of stuff so
instead of doing that what we can do is
use dark blue because it sounds like
less people will be affected by that
give links meaning by using description
link text so the link text of the camper
cat is using is not very descriptive
without the surrounding context moves
the anchor the tags so they wrap around
text information about batteries instead
of click here okay so
uh
I think what's happening here is their
kind of showcasing you like something
that's old it used to be that they would
be like click here and go to the page
but it's kind of strange still so people
don't do that anymore I think that's
really the point of that just kind of
teaching you better design skills I
guess at the end of the day to make your
code a little bit more accessible in
terms of what's a current standard to
keep things going and you can see it's
just you know you won't oftentimes see
people say click here for more
information I think it's basically the
point they're trying to get across here
so HTML offers to access key attribute
I'm not familiar with this to specify a
shortcut to activate or bring focus to
an element okay cool I did this awhile
back in like jQuery is awful your code
should have an access key attribute to
the a tag with idea first all right so
we have our a tag which is right here
first and we're going to sign an access
key we
alright so let's assign access here and
we're going to test this out so access
key here is G and then access key of
second is going to be seek cool so we're
over here let's click here G C now maybe
it's not working is around 4 on this
paycheck I don't know but that's how I
understand it pretty cool so tap index
what tabindex does is basically it
allows you when you hit tab to jump to
certain things and certain orders such
as how we're hitting tab now it'll jump
from here to here here and there are
default values and things like that or
tries to its best we can also specify
how these things work so camera cat
create a new cigarette collective
refurbish browser you notes field
automatically get keyboard focus but he
wants to make sure the keyboard under
clause so as it gets default you can
actually override that using tabindex so
we're going to jump to our P tag here
and we're going to give it a tab index
equal to 0
again this can be you can so we just
kind of set it where it's posted you
have supposed to start off at and we're
going to now jump to a tab index for the
input tag where's our input tag so input
tag one your coach it out of tabindex
input tag okay tab index so this is
going to be equal to 1 and this is going
to have index equal to and those are we
start at one and two and not zero the
most part just keep that in mind
basically what so it's happened is we
hit tab it jumps to hear notice I'm not
anywhere in the page I'll be right here
you may have messed it up so here here
to here get here get here get here every
time cool so that was the accessibility
section the main things to take away
from that is that you can do obviously
additional things like tabindex alt tag
just cool stuff that's going to make
your webpage more user friendly also
help out people who maybe are visually
impaired color color impaired and you
can do stuff like that with your CSS and
you know just basic things that are kind
of expected of high quality web
applications and just make your your
president your your projects look more
professional as well but that's always
