just say I'm stuffed
so for watching this video thank you
this is our every thousand subscriber
livestream where we try to say thank you
to oh did I do it again oh no I was
thinking that I started the stream on
private but it's not I did that recently
so um so those are you are new what I
like to do is every time we get a
thousand new subscribers I like to do a
live stream just so that I can answer
some questions so that I could provide
some value because a lot of times I'm
not that's just as a way if guys say hey
thank you for the support thank you for
watching thank you for being part of the
channel so I this is your opportunity
whatever is on your mind I try to do
videos about software and everything
that I can but I don't always get the
opportunity to answer every question I
can or answer every question on your
mind
so for the twenty nine thousand oh geez
thank you for being here for the new
last thousand welcome and you are on
your path to becoming an OG so as
everyone kind of funnels in here a
little bit about what I've been up to
and just feel free to ask questions for
the next hour or so but a little bit
about what I've been up to other than
work I'm also doing No Shave November
which the way if you see this is kind of
the most I shaved recently this is my
attempt at whatever you call this beard
I call this the evil supervillain slash
the guy who was too serious at his job
facial hair so for the the way everybody
in the dev department most of the people
in dev Department who were men which is
everybody essentially didn't shave for
the month
in the last week we all come in with a
different set of facial hair until I'm
the final day you get the mustache
because you know you know you know
you're ending with the mustache I might
keep the mustache just uh just to really
show off to the girlfriend that uh you
know we're rocking it yeah so uh so what
I've been up to on a professional level
not about on a facial hair level is I
working through the dynamic web projects
on free code camp in angular current
versions of angular and node and Express
I also am going through the
documentation deep-diving and I'm
putting up a little one to two minute
videos on a secondary channel just just
Dylan Israel so that that's kind of what
I've been
I plan on deep diving more in HTML and
CSS for the meantime so toddler pendant
says is bootstrap worth learning yes I
recently did a video today it got D
monetized I'm pissed about that
that's another thing going on is I am I
am so unbelievably sick of all my
getting D monetized by YouTube I did a
video today and I relist into it twice
today to see if I could figure out why I
got D monetized it's called top skills
needed to get a front-end developer role
in 2018
could there be a less controversial
topic I think not so that video it's
doing ok it's doing pretty well actually
so it's got about 900 views right now
which is a lot for me on the first day
in about 12 hours that's that's a good
amount for me it's a good topic I'm like
I don't get anything anything from that
video from the time and energy I could
see why people leave YouTube I really
understand the only thing I can come up
with as to why I listen I didn't cuss on
it or anything
I think skills the stupid I think the
stupid AI thinks
skills is kills that's the only thing I
can't come up with asked you why my
kinda why it might um
do that do you have anything with
message shooing like RabbitMQ no I
haven't even heard that check it out
though okay so it's boostrap worth
learning yes or no yes it's worth using
and being familiar with the column grid
system and it's worth understanding how
the column grid system works now do you
need to understand what the class is you
know I mean that's just CSS stuff at the
end of the day that text up there -
assess it's gonna set it to green and
color shoes I would say more so you need
to focus on the column grid and you can
use bootstrap to help maybe help with
the CSS because this is JavaScript stuff
that's really gonna get you the jobs
most of the time how does one go into
JavaScript well that you started three
weeks ago it's gonna it's gonna be rough
I'm not gonna lie to you it's you're
gonna have to try and reprogram your
brain on how you think about things
you're gonna need to say to yourself
okay let's understand the basics first
let's understand what a if statement
does now how do I use it I think that's
maybe the way to go about it how do you
use something and a lot of times people
could give me a definition but can't
actually tell you how you'd use
something how and why would you use a
for-loop if I say a for loop
I'll give you example someone asked me
what is a for loop or describe for loop
I would say well a for loop is something
that we iterate over a set amount of
code that we want it to repeat an
example would be we have an array of
numbers one two and three the first
iteration would add one to two the
second iteration would add three and
then the loop would end if we add
additional values we would you know you
have to understand how you're gonna use
these things and what they do and it's
something that a lot of times people
just sometimes they can't even describe
it so if I were to ask you that's that's
the first step now second step is
actually visualizing how these things
are gonna work when I give you a problem
I say hey
write me a function that adds two
numbers together
how do you do that okay Park me a
function that compares two numbers
greater than or less than and just
trying to understand and oftentimes
write it without without code first to
see if you understand the concept and
then visually look at your code on a
whiteboard or on a piece of paper as
you're drawing it out and pseudocode
write write pseudocode and see if you
can actually understand what it is to
say okay well there needs to be a
function so then draw a function you say
okay well he said add two numbers okay
so I think I need two parameters right
because I saw you pass things into the
functions then you say you know do I
need a variable maybe I could store it
in a variable and then you could
refactor better right below say story on
a variable and I say okay well these two
numbers are here now how do I return
these two well how do I return these how
do I return this number right I use the
return statement that's a very basic
example but you really need to start
breaking it down piece by piece by piece
and that's gonna be the hardest part for
you when you dive in a JavaScript it's
just sort of understanding how to take a
problem open up a text editor not be
overwhelmed by the fact that there's
nothing else there you're gonna need to
take these tools understand what the
tools are and understand how to use them
so just try a reprogram your brain a
little bit on how to think illogically
very logically and step by step on how
you're going to accomplish what you're
trying to accomplish YouTube will just
yeah now YouTube with the D monetization
they just do whatever excuse me is he
sharp sharp good to learn coding yeah
there's a lot of great C sharp jobs net
all that sort of stuff my current work
uses C sharp further back in so
how many video courses have you taken in
which have you finished
I finished my very first video course
like a month ago I've never taken a
video course before then so the first
one was traversing medias angular for
front to back I did that and then I'm
currently working through maximilian
academy ins courses law and angular 5
although if you don't count you that's
counting like long paid courses i'm i'm
more so i usually just use free code
camp and youtube that's what i learned
with you still take in Udacity courses
the Udacity and and agree now once I got
my my current role in angular there's no
reason for me to continue on with
reacting I had to start focusing on
angular as I hadn't coded in angular 2
plus yet well I go back again you're
dirty I actually just sent my
transcripts in to Western Governors
University so it is on the plate on the
agenda and it's a finish up my degree in
software engineering I'm not quite sure
how long it's going to take their
program allows you to test out of a lot
of things as well as to gain credits for
you know work experience and and stuff
like that so um and my my degree my
previous credits so that's what I'm
working on online yes
should I learn PHP nodejs well I would
say you should probably learn a language
so the question is should you learn PHP
or JavaScript you should definitely
learn JavaScript but if you're looking
for a back-end
depends what you want to do right so
there's a lot of jobs in PHP I hate PHP
but you can't deny that there's a lot of
jobs in it and so you just gotta kind of
look at the market in your area and see
what you want to do with it how far my
Maximillian courses uh about
check the routing section I honestly
don't remember I just watch about an
hour a day and it's 26 hours long so
it's taken me a while and I think I'm
about eight hours in I'd have to go back
and look to see what we're exactly
full-stack developer where to start
usually want to start in the front end
and decide what it is that you want to
do right so the reason I say the front
end is because it's an easier route to
get started in my opinion because you
can actually visually theif see things
now also at the same time I think the
front end is much harder for developers
and the reason for that is there's more
moving parts right so you have the HTML
the CSS for where things go how things
look and then from there you have to you
know do the logic which the JavaScript
know much about work visas for recent UK
computer science graduates I do not
sorry John
job is asking for five years plus on
front-end got contacted by a recruiter
today iris ts3 and a few hackathons of
projects you have a chance yeah so this
is thing if you can get an interview
often times they may hire you even for
like a more junior dev for more senior
roles they think they can build you up
into it or you're gonna be a good
long-term candidate so there's no
there's no nothing wrong with taking the
time and Andrey to to UM continue on but
back to my front end thought I think
it's easier for developers just starting
out and because it's harder to just
visualize the actual code doing what you
want and without having sort of a visual
representation but I think long term as
a developer I think it's it's going to
it's a little bit harder in my opinion
College or boot camp it turns where you
are in your life I would tell you that
as somebody going back to college I
would not recommend college for most
people and I may see counterintuitive
but if I was much younger so I'm 30
potential perspective but if I was 18 I
would probably self-study or join a boot
camp
would probably go to college later on in
the future politics aside if net
neutrality ended what in your opinion
how would it affect web developers I
think would affect startups specifically
the reason for that is is I think pretty
much every business that's gonna pop up
nowadays is going to be very internet
heavy it's just the world we live in in
technology right everything connects to
the internet and it uses a lot of it so
when you start creating these fast lanes
and these slow lanes what happens is
these new up-and-coming startups maybe
they're paying a ridiculous amount of
capital they can't hire as many
developers they can't they can't
continue to grow as fast because of this
I I mean that that's really what I
think's happened it's gonna affect
startups you know the big companies are
just gonna pay they're not gonna be
worried about that do as I say not as I
do so let me let me sort of uh i-ian
explain my statement on college so I
will be a senior developer in about two
years for most people that's all they
ever would help though hope that's all
they would ever hope for they'd be happy
with it then maybe they'd be stoked
they're you know they're making probably
as a senior developer with five years
experience they're making you know six
figures they're doing very well but that
would probably be nine times out of ten
where the road would end not all the
time but nine times out of ten now I'm a
unique candidate because my youtube
channel and because I I'm passionate
about this stuff and I study and I code
and could I perhaps go past a senior
developer level into a tech lead into a
into an architect role down the road
without a degree potentially if I error
into a management role without degree
potentially now if I go and finish up my
degree will it increase my income past
that low six-figure range will it make
it much easier for me to get a
management role will make
much easier for me to get a tech lead
role yes and that is kind of a reason
that I'm going back not because I think
that I need more money not because I I
think that I need it to be to continue
to be a developer but I do think that
it's sort of a safety net so that I can
make sure that I can always get a role
very relatively easily and a good role
relatively easy do I make a pass phone
interview at Amazon yes I did I - I made
it past it and then I tanked in the
second technical interview the
complexity of the questions it wasn't
too bad it was like what is
object-oriented programming you know I
got it hey uh honestly I don't remember
I just remember that one cuz I think a
very good answer
is college worth it for tech jobs
college is always worth it and software
it's one of the few degrees that you can
actually pay your student loans off
still because you actually make decent
money but when you graduate you you're
learning doesn't stop so keep that in
mind
a lot of times people think they're
gonna go to college and they they
graduate and they they just think okay
I'm done now know whether you go to
college or not it's gonna be a it's
gonna be a lifetime of learning and as a
developer now if you go in another
direction going project manager you can
go in QA a little bit less so that's not
to diminish either of those fields or
directions I have actually a lot of
respect for them because it's not
something I think I could do for very
long long term but it's not you don't
need to learn as much as you probably do
as a developer I would have liked
working at Amazon I don't care
man I would have liked having Amazon on
my resume I would have been no trust me
I would've been fine being miserable for
a year just get one year Amazon on the
resume
do you think you'd be happier sitting
meetings all day and drawing diagrams
using software what I would picture it's
architect girls consist of am i off on
that
I think compendium you you have some
degree of correctness there I don't
think that's all of it but yeah there's
definitely a different aspect to it and
it's not that I necessarily want to be
an architect however I want to make sure
in five years time in ten years time
wherever I'm at in life if I do want to
be an architect I say you know what a
hundred and twenty thousand dollars or
whatever I'm getting paid isn't enough I
want to ball out let's go for two years
to control that you know that involves
me going and doing an architectural
order and its tech leader like something
like that right I want to put myself in
a position in which I have options and
can do that so that's kind of when I'm
when I'm going to attempt so John Park
and says how can I possibly get
experience in a company to build my
programming experience you're probably
gonna have to code outside of a job most
places wants you to have some experience
coding before hiring you that's just the
facts of the matter you may get lucky
with internship that requires little to
none uh what's the best advice still to
live if you don't live in a tech hub
where programming isn't as big I live in
LA I'm guessing he means to Louisiana
it's that sadly programming is an option
down here in other states well I'm
originally from Los Angeles and I
applied for jobs all throughout the
United States literally all 50 states
with an emphasis in Alaska because I
wanted to go live in Alaska but that's
that's the point and I ended up taking a
role in the tampa florida area so you
may just have to start opening up where
where you can continue to grow and just
be willing to relocate how can i get
that set experience well you're gonna
have to showcase a you have project
something you can code and we have a
good portfolio and then someone will
give you a shot it's business
intelligence a good field to get into
honestly i
know too much about it but it's probably
not a bad one now so I don't work with
too many be eyes a lot of times they are
building reports and if you like data
and you like reports and analyzing
reports is a nice field to get into
when I go to Alaska to get away from
every everything to get a way from
having to deal with family being able to
seclude myself and to enjoy the cold
weather living in Los Angeles the things
I hated most were traffic people and
heat and Alaska and taxes Alaska kind of
fit all that category where I could go
and live in Alaska for a bit is getting
a master's worth it or should I just
stick with applying for college and
getting a bachelor's I think should get
a bachelor's and start working and if
you have a workplace - if you have a
workplace that will pay for it it will
be worth it for you to get a master's
otherwise not are they deaf jobs in
Alaska not enough for me it's LA really
as expensive people say yeah so just
give you an idea I live in a pretty nice
apartment complex on the higher end and
we have a three-bedroom two-bath that's
about 1400 square feet and we pay 1150
for it and you know we have washer and
dryer and and and we have a gym and we
have we have in unit washer and dryer
hookups and we have parking and you know
pools and all that sort of stuff so we
have a lot of amenities if I wanted
something similar in Los Angeles easily
you're looking at $2,500 not to mention
just in state tax alone I save I want to
say it's about five thousand dollars a
year just by not living in California in
state tax and that doesn't include other
taxes as well so
so the state taxes that up and as your
income increases so does that state tax
so yep so Miami's prices are just as
high as LA and Miami is a little bit
unique but that's because they have all
that cocaine money down in Miami that's
what's going on down there
should I just finish my computer science
degree or just learning enough
programming to leave and get into the
workforce you should finish your
computer science degree if you've if you
already started and you'll still need to
learn to program once you finish your CS
degree you're not going to be a very
good developer by the time you finish
your computer science degree in all
honesty and then leave to join the
workforce you'll need to study outside
of work and really dive deep into it
yeah so it's not only the rent right cuz
you can find shitty areas in Los Angeles
for a lower stuff right or rent a room
or whatnot it's also the cost to learn
just everything's more expensive it's
quite literally everything and get
nickels and dime for everything if you
get a ticket say you get a speeding
ticket look at like $400 you know you
get a littering ticket it's like 800 in
any sort of thing where they can screw
you they do you got to pay 10 cents for
a plastic bag you need to pay 10 cents
for a Kanas ona like a CRV tax or five
cents five to ten it's everything is
just money money money out of your
pocket it's absolutely awful man your
thoughts on competitive program is it
bad rather they're not beneficial to
start after college I think it's fine I
think it's fine to do while you're in
college I think it's fine to after
you're in college and it's it's okay for
you to figure that to enjoy that and it
looks can I resume program or
competitions are great you can even just
put your project on there I haven't won
a hackathon but I put my hackathon
projects on there
think it's their fun I think it's cool
to showcase that show Hey look what I
built in 24 hours with the team I never
met before and competitive program is
the same thing look at this project I
built or if you got if you placed in an
algorithm thing whatever it is I think
it's a it'll be fun an excellent
opportunity
what is the system architecture they've
built out for the architectures or
architecture the overlying structure of
a a web application I want to get better
at logic and program any advice start
drawing it out writing pseudo code
before you actually write any code write
pseudo code and then draw that pseudo
code out on a whiteboard what do you
think about functional program with
JavaScript is that what you're doing all
the time in JavaScript ice are not in
typescript but in like react or just
sort of vanilla Jas you're doing a lot
of functional programming
Thanks fine nothing wrong with it I
don't I don't think I've never thought
object-oriented program was all that
great what are your thought
getting into the digital nomads I'm
trying to learn both programming digital
marketing make something of it I think
both of those are good skills to make
that happen
we work with a lot of developers we have
a lot of contract developers outside of
our in-house developers and one of the
ones on my team travels to you since the
three months I've been working he's been
in a new country every month so I am
decent and JavaScript want to implement
the skills and C++ how long and what
path should I take honestly Joe welcome
to channel by the way I know you said
what's up what's what's up Joe I
couldn't tell you I'm not a C++ expert
and I don't want you down the wrong path
how hard would it be to get a remote
junior web developer job with only a
high school diploma at the moment I
think more than anything else the real
issue you'll have Tyler is not that you
have a high school diploma it will be
proving that you're actually a developer
in terms of you have experience and it
sounds like by the way they phrase that
question you don't have any experience
oh my goodness the top-hat got himself
dropping the topic god it's all coming
in here with the thirteen point three
seven pounds doesn't even need to leave
a message thank you kind sir
thank you so much do we have any mods in
the channel you're gonna ban this this
spambot in the channel who wants to be
modded I think I think I know who it
needs to be
my good sir James would you go ahead and
ban ovo Cash TV you're officially James
Shackelford you officially have been
modded topic God thank you again so much
for the support man that makes me so
feel so much better after after having
the video today get D monetized I was
really upset about that I am and the
reason for it so the reason for it is
I've been a little unmotivated with with
YouTube just I haven't been like
normally I have like two weeks of video
Q's queued up for you guys so I've been
a little D motivated by YouTube and so
why is your mustache after this is the
best I could do is all I got that so I
finally thought of a video that I wanted
to film in lava is I don't like doing
duplicate topics and I want to touch on
things that I feel passionate about in
the moment and so this was something
that I was excited about I was alright
cool this is a good video I like this
video top skills to be a front-end
developer and then I woke up this
morning and it was d monetized and that
sort of good feeling we're like hell
yeah man
I'm putting out good content yeah I'm
excited and then this is as good as I
can do crusader rabbits yeah
Caressa James James og in here and and
thank you again to top hat god
so do I do all the challenges Maximilian
gives in the course to doing mainly
watch the videos I mainly watch the
videos basically every morning show up I
watch about an hour to half an hour of
videos and I just I don't I don't really
need to do the challenges if I thought
they were gonna be beneficial I would
but this is really just let me become
more familiar with what's going on in
the the angular framework can I send you
an autograph a you got a pay baby do you
think freelancing is a good way to build
your portfolio I think it's one way
that's for sure
it's better to get paid to do work than
not to do it a lot of times you gotta
build your portfolio just learning um
but yeah I think it's definitely
something skill is blacklisted for
equality people aren't skilling anything
take offense that's why it's not
advertiser friendly what are your
thoughts on the junior dev just showing
the production database on the first day
I think Josh that it's not really his
fault
and I think if you give a junior
developer access and the ability to
delete the production database what you
have done is you need to go find the
person who handles your database
credentials and fire that person because
there's no way that that should happen
so that's really what that's really the
truth of the matter you believe react
yes is the best where you learn
JavaScript I mean I think Java scripts
the best way to learn JavaScript
she was causing many youtubers to try
make videos on Facebook if they could if
I got ad revenue on Facebook I would I
would do it how are the cats they're
good the cats are always good we take
good care of the bottom a couple new
beds and stuff gave them new catnip
stock you'll buy them twenty mice they
have mice on a stick
like on a string that we drag around
yeah look they'll get uh we actually buy
them real mice for Christmas and let
them run around the house and chasing
them no I'm just kidding when should I
start and learn reactor angular at what
stage should I be in JavaScript when you
can go through the intermediate
algorithms and you feel like you're
decent out and you finish the front-end
developer certification because it
sounds like you're doing free code camp
I think you should look into it do you
think pet insurance is worth it I think
all insurance is worth it I don't have
pet insurance but I've thought numerous
times about getting it unfortunately I
haven't followed through with it I
should though I've looked at it and it's
really just for hey hey I want to just
prevent if anything happens to cats and
we need five six seven thousand dollars
I'd rather just pay the $20 a month per
pet
is that revenue on twitch better on
Twitter YouTube so in terms of which
there is no ad revenue unless you're
partnered with twitch so like you're
going to be doing free forever on
twitch to tell your partner you're gonna
make the bulk of your money from from
subscriptions or bulk of your money from
donations until you get subscriptions in
ad revenue
thank you Michael greenberg I appreciate
the Sparkman what are your thoughts on
Bitcoin I think it's a great way to
store money and I think you can make a
lot of money with it
I have doubled my money on Bitcoin which
is nice am I going to write a JavaScript
course I'm currently working on
something similar to that yeah let's see
what you're working with girl
yeah I'll probably start switching the
live streams on Twitch I just haven't
got around to resetting up the
environment to it all right so let's
review this let's review wandah
carats portfolio page together guys so I
haven't looked at it yet but so far so
good right first thing that I always
notice I'm kind of a stickler for this
you don't have an icon take pride in
yourself and maybe put portfolio in the
title or something just a suggestion
that's gonna refresh this page so you
guys can see it so alright so we have my
work I like it
I don't know what's going on with this
ball but I can't I can't tell if I like
it or don't so it's good it's
interesting interesting is good alright
glucose guardian technologies use I like
that I might throw this something in
bold just make this pop a little bit but
it looks it looks clean and then we'll
we'll go review that in a second I'm
liking what I'm seeing that I really do
again I just think this might need to be
there's a lot of empty real real estate
here so maybe make this a little bit
bolder a little bit larger I don't like
it what I'm seeing overall it is a an
excellent project nice yeah let's see
here let's check out the actual projects
uh so here's a problem that doesn't lead
to anything this should lead to an
actual website so that
should go to an actual website yes so
you need to have you need to have an
online link to your actual projects
right now it's just an empty hashtag
that's clean I like this it's good
though you much better CSS I am I said
that much I think that probably the ball
is working pretty well my computer's
just been dying lately so things are
slow
I'm not dejected I would just say that
I'm frustrated a bit about about the way
that you know like I don't have a life
it's just with YouTube I'm frustrated
YouTube right so like I probably won't
have a video on Wednesday or Friday I'll
probably go to go and go and just take a
little bit of a break on YouTube in
terms of like putting out three videos a
week in a livestream of probably just
one video a week and a livestream and
leave it at that
uh let's see here
Tesla or Bitcoin I would honestly think
Tesla's gonna crash man Tesla if you
actually look at stats on how many cars
Tesla cells versus what they're worth
it's crazy how overvalued they are
I think Tesla I think they're at
training around like three hundred and
thirty three hundred fifty I think never
crashed a hundred dollars that's well I
think that happened at some point in
time when they don't deliver the amount
of cars that they said they were going
to deliver but maybe I'm wrong people
are so caught up in the hype I think
there's a bigger crash happening Tesla
than there will be a big going long-term
whatever joint consider moving to
Silicon Valley and joining us sharp I
would man the price was right
mmm Silicon Valley's expensive boom turn
to roll down for about 120 grand cuz I
didn't think it'd be enough money
Silicon Valley but let's say let's say
in a year or two or three years I have a
couple more years of experience in the
belt and they were gonna offer me 150 to
200 thousand I would take it if I
thought about creating my own web and
selling it as a software-as-a-service
yeah I just don't have one that I am
passionate about to create the thing I'm
probably most passionate about is just
YouTube encoding so
they offered you less than 100 and que
no benefits but got a decent amount of
equity in the company so I've done a
video compendium about this topic a
little bit about working at startups and
the way equity works most of the time I
don't know perhaps your situation that's
different is that typically you get it's
like over a four or five year period and
maybe it will say five years for example
in your file in year one after you
complete you get point zero five percent
of your equity in year two you get 10.10
of the year three is like point tuesday
or four is like point two five from the
near five you get the bulk of it so what
the reason I bring that up is you have
to really believe in the product and the
company and the CEO and everything else
in between
for the equity did be worth any money so
let's say you got paid let's say you got
paid ninety thousand right based on this
scenario you could get a job in Silicon
Valley for 110 120 let's just say a
hundred so instantly after one year
you're saying look I want 10k race it's
expensive as to live at Silicon
Valley so let me go get a 10k race and
you can get one really easy honestly you
pretty really good and all right cool so
that point zero five you're saying
yourself is that worth 10 grand maybe
not but maybe then maybe it's close so
you say okay I deal with it
but the next year you think they're
gonna give you a fatass raise on your
one they know they have you locked in
for equity you're in type you have to
stay for the equity and so you say okay
well I don't I want to stay for the
equity I want to stay for the equity but
now I have to I can I just lost ten
thousand dollars this year that's
basically what you're saying I lost ten
thousand year - okay now let's say they
give you up to ninety three right they
give you like a little three percent
raise if you're lucky it's okay well I
lost seven thousand dollars maybe and
they say okay well year to two years
later I'm at ninety six but now I've
lost another ten thousand because I've
decided to stay I have to stay
I can't leave for a race so you could be
at 110,000 right now if you get where
I'm going with this and in that equity
in that time and energy is that equity
it can even be worth anything who really
knows but I could tell you that I
wouldn't do it unless I really thought
that this was gonna make some
money
that's what I would say keV reflection
glasses are keys from glare do you guys
from computers know I'm not saying they
can't live off of it don't get me wrong
I'm not saying can't live off of it I'm
just saying that financially you have to
weigh that option is it actually gonna
be worth it because my argument is that
in the four to five years that you would
have spent there you actually probably
would have cost yourself a hundred
thousand dollars on the low end is your
equity even going to be worth that
that's what I'm saying
and a better job with benefits right if
you think I'm kidding about the costs of
SF man go look up what an apartment cost
in actual an actual downtown San
Francisco for a studio it's like four
grand
yeah so
just a good old rail I can't see good
nerd glasses I got these for free
actually so a company a company emailed
me what is my fifteen to twenty
percent I thought we were talking about
one to two right now at most
whew fifteen to twenty percent I have
fifteen to twenty percent equity in a
company I would need to know what
company but this that makes it a whole
 different discussion you're
talking about getting paid out a large
sum of money I definitely would consider
it at fifteen to twenty percent if you
and some friends started a company well
that's a different thing that's a lot
more fun
you're hyping it up right now baby if I
had me in the homeys if me and the two
homies were like hey bro we got an
investor two mil we're going to Silicon
Valley we're just gonna get the
shittiest little house we're gonna put
up eighteen monitors in there
and we're in a code and we're gonna get
sponsored by Red Bull and we're
gonna just take enough caffeine till we
have a working product I'd be there
I really would I'd be like I'm like
sorry baby I gotta go I gotta leave for
a couple years I'm going to the the the
coding motherland I got to see if I can
make money fifteen twenty percent slot
though um but that is a large amount of
equity which would make me reconsider
but again it has to go back to that idea
but but it is it would be a much funner
time but yeah so I forgot the name of
the glasses company that sent me these
and you know what you can get for 4k a
month in st. Petersburg you get three
house payments all right like obviously
honestly you could bite you could buy
three duplexes and ran out all three
spending four K a month on mortgage I'm
not bullshitting you so yeah if you're
spending four K a month in the Tampa
area got you have a palace no more no
more portfolio reviews right now we
already did one no more a little tired
I'm tired of seeing all the subscribers
that are better than me I get yelled at
videos already I know you guys are
better than me what do you want man I'm
trying my best man trying
hey 3-1 I'm straight I'm with you man I
do think San Francisco's all
overpopulated over rent like if you want
to use that word I don't think that's a
word over a rented over over high rent
and terrible traffic uh but uh yeah I
mean I'm not trying to go and do that
but those words that say that's why it
have to be that's why you'd have to be
it half the price would have to be right
I currently Drive about 20 to 25 minutes
to work and before I took my my new job
it was a 7 to 8 minute drive I'll never
do anything over 30 minutes again and
honestly it's if there's one piece of
advice I could give you guys live within
a 30 minute drive to your work if not
closer it'll give you so much more time
for yourself he'll be so much happier
because of it
my subs finally equal my salary a your
boy does better than that man your boy
salary is doing better than that
that is about if you take that and not
counting investments or YouTube or
potential bonuses and multiply it by two
and a half you have my salary which
doesn't do bad in my opinion for the
Tampa area in the end and just with
one-year software experience under the
belt I think I'm doing all right for
myself what's your opinion of Python for
web development my opinion for anything
is JavaScript for web development some
bird on my car wish I did you see
oh on his nest go establish your
dominance look for the first bird nest
you can see and look I'm dead in the
beak and just note first PHP I'm gone no
Jess I don't blame you man I would do
hah man
somebody asked me earlier who is someone
in tech that I admire look up to one of
the people that I'm very impressed by
and that is super passionate he is a
Quincy Larson for free code camp every
time I watch him I can just see the
passion in him and what he's trying to
accomplish I find amazing so that's
somebody what's the best strategy to
grind up to 250 K salary as a developer
frequent job pumping job humping
depending on the situation yeah I love
your ladder of a developer's but uh oh
no I
yes so um job hopping would probably be
the best-case scenario for you and then
finding a company when you're at that
peak where you're now a senior developer
you can jump into a leadership role sure
web developers looking to webassembly
honestly I haven't seen too many jobs in
it when I was looking recently but uh I
haven't read up too much about it to be
honest with you James with that
brand-new fancy ass wrench next to his
name that's what we should do every
until you a new policy guys every every
live stream I'm going to mod somebody
when we do it every thousand subscribers
live stream so a 31,000 will make
another mod yeah the problem
with it and I I hate to say this as an
employee because it might make me look
bad as an employee and that's not my
intention but you can't really argue
with the fact that on average you can
leave for 10 percent to 20 percent
raised as a developer now if you stay at
a company as a developer you might get a
three to six to seven percent raise so
you can't really argue that leaving for
more money is a better choice also you
get to decide what you leave for why
would you leave for less it's way too
many mods we get to 100k I don't think
so
70 mods at a hundred thousand
subscribers we should have a decent
amount of mods you're talking about one
one one tenth of one percent our modded
how many thoughts people's a lot so at
this rate we have one I don't know I'm
not too worried about it
be mod see up in this bitch if I wanted
to be I'll mod all you right now
everyone get Marty
everybody I do what I want they're gonna
deep monetize my anyhow I'll just
go mod crazy alright
is it really 99.3% Mills to the truth
what's going on man
so one the states I was looking was
Florida of course Herschel I'm here
because there's no sales or no state tax
also states with no sales tax as well as
as well as Washington Portland Oregon
specifically I currently own a house at
Oklahoma would it be optimal sell that
and move to Silicon Valley to job
hopping and grind a big salary it would
be optimal to just hold on to it and
rent it out in my opinion I could then I
could angular to that code everyday and
angular not on the live stream that's
what you ask a job and either switch
coding sorry hey is your job huffing you
hear me job humping a bunch of dudes
like me bunch of guys in glasses so
street fighter motorcycles is that
what's your about a no judgments man its
2017 all right do you think it ever be
good working for a moment would it be
too lonely oh I'd be fine I don't want
to right now because you gain a lot
stats will show you that your career is
better when you go in in person you make
more money and my main thing is getting
my income up and learning as much as
possible those two things not
necessarily in that order
so you'll learn for a lot of developers
and all that sort of great stuff
I would definitely rely on a property
management company it's something that
I'll be doing soon actually uh I I'm
looking to buy my first property which
will be a duplex and and I'll be having
a property management company taking
over the other unit for me most likely
and I don't plan on living on Florida
for more than five years I have about
four years left on that but you never
know I could stay but my folks are
getting older as the years go by so I
probably will move a little bit closer
um but yeah I will be buying property
that I planned to hold and rent jQuery
is dying fast how long until angular
react goes down just cuz jQuery is going
down nice J Cory's not even really going
down it's just used by a lot of property
you give it anyway courses for law they
Susan maybe we'll see what's up see what
I might give voice on my own um yeah I
know it's it's just like I'm saving
money right now we'll see I I so so 3-1
I kind of most of the places I'm looking
at are dirt cheap we're talking about
one hundred two hundred fifty thousand
dollars so I don't know how much those
could actually drop and price price but
uh I do understand that something that
everything's inflated right now but
we'll see I'm saving money right now but
I'm in no rush
also because April is unemployed so she
has he a job first that's really the
thing is holding us back
I'm also going back to school oh I'm
with you on the debt bubble I think
stock markets gonna crash
like 35% I think he's gonna him
just blow up with that being said I have
money in stocks as well excite like Sir
Joseph I um oh yeah I do think we're
come we're going we're coming in for a
bubble Joe remember what decided to get
me into programming or is it just Blair
now oh yeah I know I remember I wanted
so when I was having trouble making up
my mind in in school in college right so
for those who don't know I have about
200 units completed and no degree so I
also have a certifications expired now
as a emergency a EMT so that was another
thing so and uh an a casino dealer
license so both those are expired now
but just to put that in perspective of
how many courses I've taken over about
six the seven-year period
I have no degree and I was just taking a
ton of courses trying to figure it out
and at some point around year for my my
father was like you gotta figure
something out man you can't just be
bouncing around you got to go and you
know get a degree I say okay let me
actually go and and figure out what a
good career is and not like what makes a
good career but what what defines a good
career in terms of what I would want a
degree and it came to three main things
when I looked at what defines a good job
it's the same thing same things same
three things that I've told you guys
about when looking at what fields to go
into the first one is salary second one
is job growth and the third one is the
amount of jobs and when I looked at that
and I looked at every job stat well you
know top ten best list of jobs top 25
best list of jobs from LinkedIn from
indeed all of them were software
technology related and going off the the
stats for how much growth
salaries all that it all led to a
computer science degree and that's what
got me into programming I didn't really
fall in love with it until I dropped out
of college that's a separate story well
that's what led me into that that led me
into that honestly there's not many
fields that even can fall into the same
category of - of being a very high lead
like like today if I lost my job it
would suck but I could find another job
and I could probably make just as much
money and there's a reason you can jaw
pop and leave to get raises it's because
people want to hire you and people want
to pay you people want to you know
because there's there's not enough good
developers and so you get job hop for a
10k race or plus in any career that's a
very unique software software field and
career for that so yeah but a lot of
people are just I mean you can look at
you know not - I don't want you know
April if you're watching and sometimes
she watches these live streams so yeah
be careful but um the thing is is that
April is a good example of somebody who
got a degree in English and has been
struggling to make money like a good
career a good career because you can't
really do too much with a liberal arts
sort of degree like that and in today
scent it's like what defines a good job
is salary job growth and amount of jobs
and on average Liberal Arts degrees pay
less half-horse jobs have a ton of
competition and you can't really do too
many things with it one of the other
things that defines a good job is how
technical it is and what I mean by that
it's not like oh do you have software
skills what I mean is do you have skills
that somebody couldn't pick up in a week
like I could go
be a cashier today I've never been a
cashier I could go and work a liquor
store today today and I could probably
be 90 percent as good as the guy who's
been working there for a year a lot of
positions are like that that don't
require hard skills does your role for
five hard skills another good example of
that that falls into that category is
health nurses doctors that's why they
make good money so I think should enroll
in the hack reactor certificate police
affirm there's more sought after than
most degrees now I gotta go back and
finish up the bachelor's also a factory
actor wanted to pay me to attend I would
but other than that I don't think I
would do a coding bootcamp unless I was
self-employed through through YouTube
ah man hello we've been going I think it
might be time to start wrapping this up
yeah it's about a hour so for those of
you who are new to the livestream so
when we do these live streams every
thousand I like to end with a final
thought of some sort before we do that I
just wanna say thank you to the twenty
nine thousand you were here before and
thank you to the one thousand new people
who are here um if you want to support
me you can by going to patreon.com slash
tutorials 360 and you can like the
videos watch the videos share the video
so there's probably nothing more than
you can do other than giving me that
cold hard earned money which I know a
lot of you don't do cuz like sucks watch
a vlog don't think I don't know but you
could share the video with your friends
that helps me out of time
but just watch man watch like the video
share the video is that it helps me out
of time so today's final thought today's
final thought I think we're gonna be
talking a little bit about a little bit
about thank you for the YouTube red
money that's another way that you can do
it
YouTube Red's interesting because the
way that I looked up how do people like
how do you get actual money from YouTube
red basically they break up your watch
time let's say you watch three channels
and you spent 90% of your time watching
the one channel that person gets 90% of
whatever the split is off YouTube red
sky interesting to me
so earlier earlier somebody asked me
what made me decide to get into
programming and what made me decide to
get into programming is different than
what made me stay in programming and
what made me as I explain what got me
into programming and the reason I want
to talk about this a lot of times that's
today's final thought and honor the the
greatest talk show hosts all-time Jerry
Springer it's a lot of times people the
same thing that gets you into something
isn't the same thing that keeps you into
something right it's kind of like dating
often times when you're just getting
started you just are looking for that
physical fun and the ones that you keep
around are those those ride-or-die
men or women are those those people who
love you deer and deer and and are there
for you when you need them right that's
the thing I separates a girlfriend from
a future wife or a a you know boy toy
from I don't know what women call the
deeds that they they they mess around
with some dude they don't get brought
around around the friends a keeper yeah
that's what separates the keepers for
the ones that are just the old notch on
the belt I guess and programming is kind
of the same thing a lot of things in
life are like this where what gets you
into it in my case the very practical
aspects right the the the very practical
aspects of of hey I want to make good
money I want to I want to make sure
there's a lot of jobs so I can get a job
in the field because there's plenty of
jobs that pay well but it's hard to get
a job and I want to make sure that it's
a field that's growing so I don't have
to change careers down the road
those are all good practical reasons
they're not reasons that are gonna keep
you in a field when I was in school and
studying the stuff I was going to I was
doing a computer science program for
those reasons and it wasn't fun and
wasn't enjoyable but I understood
logically that this was a correct path
it wasn't until I stopped going and I
started coding and learning things in a
fun way
that I enjoyed that I really fell in
love with software and I think that's
what has has motivated me to the point
where on Thanksgiving April had to say
look sit down and play video games all
watch because you're not working on
Thanksgiving and part of it is I've
fallen in love with software development
and I enjoy doing this and when you are
fault when you work for a company we're
gonna spend a lot of our lives working
no matter how smart you are with your
money it's gonna be a hard grind to not
have to have a job I mean that's the
goal but it's gonna be hard and in this
field to be a developer you really have
to love what you're doing so for what's
kept me in coding is that I love being
mentally challenged I love building
things there's something exciting about
that I love actually knowing that I can
do something that nobody else can nobody
else but a good portion of people can't
I like talking about this I find it what
I've found a way to make it exciting to
make it fun to who to keep it fun to
keep it alive and you know those things
that got us into it aren't the things
that are going to keep us sharp keep us
good keep a strong keep us motivated so
I hope that when you as you get started
you understand why you're getting into
something but also find the reason is to
make sure that you stay in it and I hear
you're there and you're you're going to
thrive in it that's a final thought is
just understand that
just understand that the things that get
you into something may not be the things
that keep you into something and loving
it so um with that being said guys I
appreciate you you all I understand on
mentally challenged thank you so much
we're 30,000 strong thank you again to
the top hat God Himself who graced us
with his presence donated that thirteen
point three seven pounds which i think
is eighteen point six seven euros if I
remember correctly that's very unique
number thirteen point three seven
thousand I don't know what that's about
this seems like normally I would round
but like a topic that's got swagger I
think that's what it is
so um I appreciate y'all I'm going to
I'm going to I don't even know what my
name last year I'm probably just gonna
go code I uh I've been working through
the documentation for a while recording
videos let me tell you man I have never
like gone through the documentation all
of it line by line
piece by piece it is a long and
absolutely draining process but I'm
learning a ton in the process I'll
probably going to take a 5-10 minute
break guys and then on my live stream
for a bit we'll see but I appreciate you
all thank you again we hit thirty
thousand that's impressive where I'm
trying to get I'm trying to get to that
hundred K I want that I want the plaque
man I want that I want the little silver
play button I want I want it I want it
so bad I want I just want that I want
that I feel like I feel like until you
have that it's not it's all for nothing
yeah so I got it I gotta get that so
even though even though YouTube is
screwing me on the D monetization you
know you know YouTube I'm talking about
you even that's all happening I want at
least stick around till I hit 100k I'll
get my silver plaque I'll give them the
finger I tell suck these nuts and I'm
out this bitch see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
