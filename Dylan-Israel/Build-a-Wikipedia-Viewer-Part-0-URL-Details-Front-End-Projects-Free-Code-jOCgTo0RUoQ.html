before you get started in this video
here shell casing how to build a
Wikipedia API I'm going back to show how
I actually found the Wikipedia API URL
and how I kind of got it to work because
that seems to be the hardest thing I've
got quite a few requests basically
explaining the logic and how I went
about this search so we'll go ahead and
call this part zero and dive into it so
the first thing I did when I started
this project was actually just googled
Wikipedia API and I clicked on this
first link right here which is this page
and as I kind of scroll through here I
read the documentation a lot of this is
a combination of reading through the
documentation and just taking the time
there's really no magic effect to it
it's just a lot of deep diving into it
and so I read this page more or less and
I saw okay cool this is the English
version so I noticed that there's an
English version and a this was basically
the first part of it I was like okay for
myself I want to use the English version
and then I kept on scrolling and
scrolling and eventually I saw this tiny
little link this is API help this little
little link that is absolutely hidden
but this is the hidden gem and I pulled
this up right here so this Wikipedia API
help is really really good and from I
was like really good but it's you it's
what I what I did that helped me helped
me out tremendously so after that I kind
of started from my from what I saw here
I kind of found out that action is
required for the API because they're
performing an action we have all these
actions that you need to do and I went
through a couple here that I thought
might be at query was one of them open
search was what it ended up being
and then I deep dived into this a little
bit more a lot of this and we're going
over this in a few minutes but at this
point I've spent about a half an hour
diving through the documentation
and googling things and so I bring up
the open search API and this is where I
kind of see what it is that I need to do
I read a little bit about it so what it
does is it searches that's basically it
and you can dive into more documentation
here as well but when I got once I got
to this page I looked at these
parameters which you'll be building your
string with right and then this is where
it all started clicking I thought I was
maybe on the right path and you'll see
right here let's go ahead and bring up
our page real quick and the URL right so
you see right here we have our English
API this was talking about the first
link and then we need to start adding an
action the way that you would do this
what they're a few guys you tell it's
basically a query string and you say
action if not used to query strings what
it basically means is a question mark
then a word that you set like a variable
basically in this case is action so in
the Wikipedia API you always have to set
the action in our case it was the open
search this right here so this will
allow us to do a search so you see our
actions open search and then our
parameter we have a couple here so
search is a string that we're looking
this is required it says right here so
again it's not like super standing out
you just have to deep dive into the
documentation but this is required but
there's other things that we could do as
well for instance we could limit this by
default it's 10 if we wanted more than
that as you'll see we have search is
equal to search term that's our search
term the string we were talking about
and then our format this is a string
we're passing in that we'll do in the
later parts of the video and then the
format is equal to JSON what that means
is your data can come back in various
formats in our case we have JSON JSON FM
XM l XML F we could actually leave this
out now that I'm looking at it by
default jason you don't need to define
it we do but now that I look at this I
probably didn't see that it was by
default JSON now where does this
callback questionmark come into so this
gets a little more complicated and this
ended up taking me the whole URL
creation process took me about two to
three hour
once I dive into the documentation took
me about an hour and a half to get to
hear this at callback took me about
another hour and a half now what's going
on is called a cross-origin air and what
it basically means is that our so if we
were to take this out and we'll go ahead
and showcase this real quick so it makes
sense it's going to save this and then
we'll do a search that says test submit
and we'll get a little air here that
says air the reason for that is we're
getting a Korres air what's called a
Corsair and what's basically happening
is that the that what the API is set up
so that if the call if the the endpoint
the URL that we're passing in when we do
our get call isn't coming from Wikipedia
or at a certain location it doesn't
trust it and thus doesn't send it back
unless you do a callback so what's
basically happening is that it's called
a wrapper function but without going
into too many details the callback is
all we're doing is saying callback where
basically we're sending our initial
request wikipedia saying look we don't
know who you are tell us who you are so
it sends back their request and it
requests more data at which point you
send back a second request our callback
you can think of it like that and this
is okay thanks for tell us who you are
here is your data and that's how I went
about solving the URL open search a lot
of its deep dive into documentation a
lot of it's just like it I did a search
came to the API took a piece from up
here found this little help help brought
me to the action which is pretty much
required by default its help is that you
can see there's a lot of parameters here
so a lot of its just going over the
documentation and going from from there
I did a little bit more in here once I
kind of found out why it was failing
when I thought it I did a little bit of
research and I came across some Stack
Overflow help and that's how I ended up
getting the URL so hope you guys found
this helpful and a little bit of how I
learned to work with the Wikipedia API
this is one of the more requested videos
