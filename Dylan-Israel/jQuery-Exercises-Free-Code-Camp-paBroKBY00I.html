400 hours we will get our 400 hours of
estimated work we'll get our front-end
development stack and obviously we're
just getting started here so ice there's
no video for gear up for your success so
take time to go ahead and do that on
your own time what we're gonna be doing
instead of doing about 10 prop 10
exercises per video we're just going to
I downloaded some random timer app and
we're going to change this to 15 minutes
we're gonna do 30 minute videos let's do
let's start with 15 we can always up it
by 5 so we're gonna start with 5 minute
video so our 15 minute video so we're
you're just gonna see what we can do in
15 minutes and probably stop the video
and then there'll be another part
another time so let's go ahead and get
started we're using jQuery it looks like
we're using bootstrap here so we're
we're back we're just working exactly
off the the responsive design it's a
create a script element so we want to
have create a script and scripts I don't
know make sure this isn't the right
place we run it so cool so next this is
how you instantiate your jQuery it's
it's always the same way so you're gonna
say document and then dot ready and then
inside here there's a function and then
at the end of that I believe it goes
with something like this and then a
semicolon cool so this is how we
instantiate our jQuery so for our
basically we are checking the document
if it's ready and then we're doing some
functions that we're writing similar to
like how you would write a function for
Java for instance we're just doing in
JavaScript so it may be a little
confusing this is obviously the first
slide so let's see so let's see how we
do um great thing about jQuery is it
makes everything it makes our webpage
responsive and dynamic and it's really
good to have a up-to-date website and
something users feel comfortable messing
with so yeah
choose jQuery and class so give us so
what are we doing here for our buttons
we want to select the buttons so how do
we do that that's with the Cash Money
symbol there's probably a name for that
I don't know what it is and in
quotations we are looking for button
cool so here is our button we have it
selected now what we want to add the
class is it's probably already
previously defined somewhere else not
something we're gonna write and what do
we want to add we want to pad animated
so one thing is animated and another is
bounce
what was that bounce
that's kinda cool yeah so in control Z
this excitement I like that so all we
did was use some jQuery code to target
some HTML elements in this case button
and then we we target this document
which is all this and then we select all
the buttons and then we had some classes
that we just added some effects to
alright so in this next one we want to
select what we want well so for all it
all our wells
you know I think we have to use the dot
when we select it because it's a class
so before this was a type 'button or if
we were a target div but when we're
targeting this actual class we use it
done at least that's what it looks like
in the documentation here so let's see
we can try it without and see if it will
do it but I don't think it will so we
want to add a class and in here we want
to add the classes
animated and shake and then we'll put a
semicolon let's see if that works so I
didn't so it looks like you do have to
add the the class oh I was like my
milkshake brings all the boys to the
yard damn right it's better than accept
what's code if that makes any sense
all right up and down all around all
right so some pretty pretty simple
jQuery stuff so far let's see here
target element with the ID target three
and use the jQuery add class function to
give the class fade-out all right so
what do we want when we target ID's we
use the hash tag selector or the pound
or an ampersand
I believe whatever kids are using
nowadays and we're trying to select
target three this one right here and
what we want to do to it we want to add
the class to give it fade out and then
so you can see right down now it's
fading out and obviously this isn't a
program that we would probably run like
this but it's a good example of all the
cool things that you can do with jQuery
so Italy all three of these okay so you
see that our document just displays
normally if we delete all three all
right so what do we want to do we want
to select first off the button so again
the cash money and then we select the
button HTML on it
so they want to add the class here to
four buttons we want to add animated so
let's go like that cool and then now we
want to select the class dot BTN and
after we do that we want to add the
class and I'm getting this from up here
typically we can usually figure out by
the the checklist what we need to do but
in this case you're gonna have to read
from above oops so we're going to shake
it so now that all those are shaking
when you run it to make sure and now we
want to select the target one and
because that is an ID we use the hashtag
target one and we want for this only one
add the class BTN oops
BTN - primary so that one changes that's
kind of cool and there we are done and
good to go so you can see that now we
can target their IDs and classes as well
I so remove the button default classroom
on your button elements so let's just go
ahead cut this bad boy out cool
Oh apparently we were supposed to do
like this so we need to use jQuery which
was like okay I can delete things
friendly I got that down a couple
classes ago let's see what's going on
so for select BTN select all buttons dot
remove class cuz who you want to remove
the button default from all things so
what we're gonna do is just select all
the buttons and then remove class b TN -
default I believe that's the same owner
just like the button dot removeclass
beauty an ash default well move class no
rub move class there we go alright so
just a little syntax mistake or spelling
more like it
your target one element should every
class so in this case we're going to
target a one thing so what are we
targeting we are targeting found target
one dot and that so right now what
you've seen is weekends we can do custom
CSS in our targeting and in this case we
are targeting the color and the color
property and we are setting it to red so
you can see right there that target one
our button text is indeed right very
nice disabled an element using jQuery so
disable target one so in this case we
can select target one again because it's
ID we just a hash tag so it's like
target one dot prop disabled
true so apparently this is how you
disable something well
remove an element using jQuery so let's
say we don't want target Ford to be
there anymore again we select target for
with the hashtag because this past
that's the ID dot remove and bam it
deletes our button right off the bat
alright so your target two elements
should be should not be inside your left
well so we can actually move our targets
that's kind of cool
so I don't know why you'd do this but
because it would make sense a you want
to I mean if you had a function but just
in a default load like this you wouldn't
do this but uh yeah so um so target you
don't
dot append to and then in here we want
to call pound right well so let's see
did we do that right right
- well nope
so let's take a look at this notes area
transition so pound target - nothing you
wanna know append to the right side so
you see right here that we moved our
second button over to the right side
with this code there we go
clone element using jQuery alright so in
this case we want to clone target five
copy or check your file space on your
left well so what we want to do first
thing I want to do is we want to make a
copy of a with dot clone of our target
five element after that we can also we
want that copy we want to append it we
want to move it to the left well pound
left - well cool so now we have a target
five on both sides
okay so now we're gonna work with
parents and child's if that makes any
sense we are going to address how to do
styling and CSS and stuff like that for
the parent so you work it works its way
down if that makes sense so yeah so left
left well element should have red
background so what we want to do we want
to start off by selecting the left well
and in here we want to dot parent dot
CSS and we want to change some things in
this case we want to change background -
color exactly we do and CSS and we want
to set that to red so you can see right
there that it is made red
well it looks like our 15 minutes are up
so I will finish this slide action fr
are we sorry to do this in the middle of
the video what oh oh I will just
finish it up alright so we tried to
change the parent method should be
called on target while the target one
element okay so maybe we called this on
the wrong one so this so that uh they
wanted it actually around right here
so cool all children of right well
should have green text so now we're
working with children so we're gonna say
anything in right well basically right -
well and for the children for those
inside of it we want to dot CSS
and the first one we want to color and
then a comma and the second one we want
to do green cool so you can see right
there changed all the values there's
obviously a couple ways we could do that
but sometimes parent and child may be
the best way to do it
so the second element you're targeting
elements should bounce oh yeah so now
it's getting a little more complicated
in this instance we want you can
actually call it on things so so the
first thing we'll do you can see right
here it's this target so that's what
we're going so we're gonna say for the
for our targets don't target
select the second dense child what is oh
yeah okay so : ants - child so select
the second child so this is how we're
finding out which target we want to get
so we want to get the class target but
we want to get the second one so this
would be one - I believe I I could be
mistaken
it could go 0 1 2 so we'll see we'll see
what happens here so we actually have to
put 3 ok so and we want to add the class
bounce
we have to put animated - balance as
well let's let's see if we got that to
work yeah so we need to animate it
animated cool all the targa I should
consider even should shake animation
shake alright so just select target dot
add class you can see right here only
the middle ones are bouncing that's
because of this code we had it all right
here then we want to add class animated
and then shake let's see
you should use the die even function to
modify these elements so in this case
we're selecting only the even ones to
shake every balance rather so even even
cool
so we want to add the classes animated
hinge to your body element so yeah so
now we're just gonna mess with the whole
thing you can actually select your body
so here is our body and then we want to
dot add clothes and what do we want to
add we want to add animated and hinge so
you can see right there that's bringing
tense well it's kind of kind of a cool
thing you do with your a singular page I
guess so I think that is because it
looks like we're going straight into
JavaScript
interesting to teach jQuery or
JavaScript but I like it so that was our
jQuery section if you're looking if
you've already finished this and you're
like hey man I really like jQuery head
over to code CAD me and check out their
jquery section as well as their
javascript section and i'll see you guys
in the next video and as always
constructive criticism is appreciated
thanks for watching the video don't
forget to Like and subscribe that'd be
great and leave me a comment letting me
know what you liked about the video what
