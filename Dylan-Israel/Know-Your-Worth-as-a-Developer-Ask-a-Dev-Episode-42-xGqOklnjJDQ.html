bit of story time if you will and I
guess if I had to say without sounding
too dramatic what the kind of overall
message for this story is is fighting
for what you're worth and that could be
a lot of things in this in this context
it's going to be about what your your
market worth as a developer is or what
you should be paid so back when things
are really rough I was doing some
freelancing work getting paid fifteen
twenty dollars an hour with very few
clients I I really needed a job and
eventually I ended up getting a job but
before that I went to an interview at a
web design company it was a small one it
was it was not a nice one uh it was um
everything about it was change so I yeah
I don't know if you've ever seen trailer
park but it's kinda one of the
characters reminded me of the
over-the-top guy who's yeah you're
riding one of the characters on there
and he was the owner and I'm sitting
there with my resume and at that point
all I had on there was a few freelance
clients and a internship so I didn't
have you know I had a three-month
internship as a freelancing and they
have I didn't have much right it wasn't
completely empty but it wasn't like a
godly resume um work was hard so I uh
I'm being interviewed by this gentleman
who has a a Bluetooth in his ear right I
was gonna paint the picture he's got the
Bluetooth in his ear he's got the crazy
hair um he's actually eating a salad why
he interviews me as well right uh I'm
cool with it
I'm rollin with it um not how I would
conduct an interview
he called me and it's not like I know
it's not why I showed up drop my resume
off he called me in to be interviewed
after I applied and yeah anyhow so he's
eating lunch right there why we're doing
it and uh he wants he wants to hire me
great he's building me up spending ten
fifteen minutes like hey this is what
we're going this is what you're gonna be
working with it's not necessarily stuff
I want to work with there's more web
design and SEO basic stuff and stuff I
was qualified to work with and he spent
a good portion of it telling me what was
wrong with me like breaking me down and
I didn't like that at all um when I when
I told him I didn't use Dreamweaver he
said oh well you know all real
developers all with real developers use
Dreamweaver
well you just open up a text editor I
start building it no no one does that
that's what he that's what he told me
right um and I remember thinking like
it's just a little strange but all right
I'm rolling with it I'm dead I'm pretty
desperate man um and so he's breaking me
down just kind of telling me everything
that's wrong with me and how he's going
to make it better and like how I'm going
to grow and mature as a developer and
then he hits me with my job I'm charging
around $20 an hour as a freelancer and
this is in a Los Angeles California by
the way to give you a context for what
that is minimum wage I think at this
time was a $9 an hour so he wants to me
$12 an hour and I told myself that the
lowest at that time I could go and
devote my time to was 15 realistically I
wanted your cable I was making
freelancing which was a very reasonable
range fun 20 an hour um and so I was
almost as I said look Ben the lowest I
would ever go is $15 an hour and he
basically I did the same thing he just
said told me everything that was wrong
with me as an applicant and
promised how he's going to make me into
a better person or better developer all
this or so and I had my sip if I really
believed that I might have been more
willing to work with him but uh after he
told me about the dream we were saying
everything was suspect after that I'm
like look I'm just here to get some
resume experience and a little something
a little paycheck so that I can buy food
and rent right that was where we were at
in life and I am I just was honest with
I said look man this it's too that is
too low it is too low I can get a job
you know I want to work I like what you
guys are doing here I want to learn
trying to get better but in terms of
hourly compensation it's nowhere near
what I think I'm worth and the lowest I
could go is 15 and we're having that
we're doing the give-and-take right now
it might be most the time you never have
this issue they'll send you a decent
offer or you'll be upfront about it and
like but this is a much smaller company
you know it's got six eight employees
and they're doing Dreamweaver right and
so that's where that's the situation and
so I walked away um basically I I said
you know I'm not going to accept that I
I apologize thank you for your time I
was very nice about it we just were in
two different pages he he um he said
some smartass thing that even if I was
super desperate just because he said it
I was I wouldn't go back he said uh he
shook my hand and I'm Indian nice I said
you know I should put stick my hand out
I say you know what thank you for taking
the time I appreciate it I'm sorry that
it's not going to work out best of luck
something like that something normal and
Andy shook my hand and he said something
along the lines of you know good luck to
you and if you come to your senses give
me a call back that was it if you come
to your senses give me a call back and
even if I came to my senses I cut off my
goddamn hand before I ever go work for
someone like that um that's the type of
person who carries you down as he was
through the whole interview process and
one of the worst things you do for
yourself no matter
how desperate I was so that's forward
and I'm not just I'm trying to I'm
trying it so fast-forward to actually a
about a month later I get a job at a
software company a real company if you
will uh that has about 40 50 developers
in my previous job not the one I'm
working now and I I actually exceeded
remember I said I was in a perfect world
I wanted to get paid at least what I was
getting paid as a freelancer I exceeded
that I got 22 an hour there um and I was
which still by the way I at this point
April and I had broken up and so I'm on
one income and it was rough man I'm
barely getting by barely paying my rent
you know I'm at that time I'm saving 10%
as well and struggling so I always think
suggest save me money if if you can
skate by I barely skated by barely
paying rent you know barely paying the
bills staying afloat I made the decision
to stop going to school so but that's
for another video so I did I did what at
the time I thought was very good for
myself I got some relevant somewhat semi
relevant experience and the potential to
be promoted down the road that was what
I was looking for and I was very happy
about it and I really appreciated the
opportunity and during the interview
process everyone was friendly everyone
was you know there's a difference
between testing you and just telling you
your right and there it's all it's
all about delivery right constructive
criticism not just criticism and it
really it was a good interview I got
hired 20 minutes later over the phone
everything was great they made me a fair
offer they paid me they asked what I
wanted to get paid I said somewhere
between 20 and 25 these are my skills
they offered me 22 I couldn't how can
you say no they gave you exactly what
you asked for
um so fast forward to the drive down
here from California to Florida I get a
call
and mind you I'm just driving right I'm
just driving I get a call from a number
I don't recognize no big deal I've been
filling out a bunch of job apps someone
called me back about one I actually got
three job offers as I'm driving down
works are you sure not you're sounding
like I'm pretty committed right now man
I'm driving down across country
my little mirage is all packed up I'm
driving I'm truckin over I it's too late
for any other offers right so I I I got
some but one of those calls one of those
three calls was from the little web
design shop in Long Beach California
it's the same guy it is it is the owner
and he I recognized his voice
he's a very unique character you meet
this guy one timing you remember him the
rest of your life I kid you not so I
instantly recognize his voice and once
and once we're caught up the street I
was like it's noise sounds familiar he
tells me I was like I was like oh
we still have your resume on file and
we're looking to hire some some
designers some developers and he's like
if I remember laughs correctly last time
we we were talking about a price or
about hourly rate or something like that
and we couldn't come to terms he's much
much nicer this time by the way because
it sounds like a bunch of people
probably quit because he's a douchebag
well yeah so um so I'm having this
cordial conversation he's leading and
I'm uh I'm I'm feeling good man I I'm
enjoying that he's calling me leave was
that way and I got nothing but 36 hours
of driving so I got nothing but to do
but talk with the dude so we're talking
and he's like you know I'd be willing to
go up to $18 an hour and you know we're
going to any search giving me the whole
spiel again he's like he's like you know
I have you got any additional experience
and I start
on him like you know I I was just
working at a I don't tell him I'm on the
way to my new job
I don't you know I just got uh you know
nine months experience at this software
company and I was doing documentation I
was doing wire framing user flow charts
gathering requirements project
management sort of stuff technical
documentation I start going over all the
more technical things I did at my job
and he's like you know I'd be willing it
sounds like you've improved your skill
set um I'd be willing to go all the way
up to $18 an hour and and so I I I said
I you know I cordially declined I said
you know that that's not going to be
high enough and I appreciate I
appreciate you taking time to call me
but it is it's not going to work out
he's like well what would you like and I
said my hourly rate of at that time when
I started my job it was about compared
to $18 an hour I think it comes to about
30 an hour so significantly higher and I
said you know I would need I would need
uh and I'm I do I know I had no
intention of doing this I just I just
remember having the conversation with
him and I'm killing time in this car
right and I remember saying you know I
would the lowest the lowest I could go
is 30 $30 an hour and and to him
apparently I just dropped an f-bomb
and he said good luck with that no one's
going to pay you it's a same sort of mo
and hung up on me
this is this is a hundred percent true
story good luck with that
no one's going to pay you that hung up
on me
um so to wrap this whole long-winded
story that spanned like a year and a
half to two years up is um no you're
worth right no no what your market value
is and when you meet talk
sick people like that and understand I'm
just as desperate as the rest of you at
that time if not more so don't bring
toxic people into your life your
workplace or anything else and if you're
worth twenty dollars an hour what you
should be doing is trying to go up to 25
we're twenty-five try to go up to thirty
and that's going to give you options in
life it's going to make sure that your
lights are on your internet is here if
you you know your your house you rent
the food you know and eventually if
you're doing well you upgrade to
high-speed Internet whatever it is that
I uh it gives you some of the more
comforts of life but also having respect
for yourself and understanding that this
is not a person I would choose to have
in my life all my bosses I've had since
meeting that that gentleman all the
bosses I've had in my life have always
been very respectful it doesn't mean you
have to agree with them on everything
that doesn't mean that you have to be a
suck-up or anything like that it just
means that as an employee they respect
you and they treat you reasonably that
that's it I'm not a I'm not an
unreasonable guy I'm pretty practical
but I I just remember I'll never forget
it I'll never forget the interview and
I'll never forget the phone call I will
not remember his name or the name of the
company all you could say is a small web
design thing in Long Beach uh but know
your Worth guys uh when you're when
you're going out and you're trying to
get a junior level role know what the
market value is know where you can get
started and if you're just below market
value no problem but if you're fifty
percent below market value if you're
seventy percent below market value and
they're offering you $12 an hour and you
were previously making twenty or thirty
you know know what your experience
brings you I know what your skillset
brings you but more than that more than
the money I think really just know that
he's a better person like I probably
shouldn't have had that phone call I
took it we had a conversation and I
could have I could have gone down the
route
saying you know I'm sorry I'm actually
accepted a job right now I'm not
interested and I could stop that but I
kind of played it out a little bit I'll
be honest with you but I was also on a
36 hour car ride so in my defense but
don't turn into that guy and don't
surround yourself with people like that
when someone tells you you can't do it
just say hey thanks for the motivation
when someone tells you you're not worth
that you say you may not be but I am so
I hope that you guys stay focused hope
that you stay motivated and in this case
it was an external person that was
trying to tear me down someone who
didn't know me or what I'm capable of
but oftentimes what will happen is that
the people closest to you may not
understand what you're trying to do they
may not understand you as an individual
and and they may they may tear you down
inadvertently because they don't want
you to take any risks that once you take
any Gamble's um and they may not get it
they may not understand it and it that's
that's when it's super rough like this
guy two days in my life ever had to deal
with him when it's you know parents
sisters brothers friends that say eh
don't do this I was watching a video
where Elon Musk before he was starting
SpaceX one of his very close friends sat
him down and made him watch a 30-minute
compilation of rockets blowing up so
that you on must good it loses fortunes
it happens to everybody happens to me
happens to Elon Musk it doesn't matter
how smart how rich how powerful you are
it happens to everybody and the people
that are closest to you are going to try
and do that and it's not like just there
sometimes it is because they're they're
nasty people and maybe someone did that
to them and broke them down and they
just accept it as a way of life it's not
unless you let it be and so I hope you
guys when you're out there and you're
working hard understand that you're
worth into monetary is
tied to your skill set but as a person
it's really up to you to define who you
surround yourself with and who you
listen to
don't let anyone tell you you're not
worth what you think you are
don't let anybody beat you down and and
tell you that you're crazy and
when some when they do
don't get upset don't get angry get
motivated so if you guys get motivated
that's a little bit of story time about
someone in my life for two days anyhow
that tried to tell me that I ain't
so a little bit of it as always guys
