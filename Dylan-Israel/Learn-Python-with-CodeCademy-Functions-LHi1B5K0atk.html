I mean Python sorry just woke up a
little bit I viewed Python functions
functions so as you see already started
this and we're just going to be
resetting it as I go so it looks like we
are going to be doing a tax and a tip
function here so take a look at it see
you know def tax takes a parameter
returns the parameter same thing with
tip and then we do some stuff with it
now let's get going alright so go ahead
and create a function called spam so def
spam that prints the string eggs
okay so the council don't forget to
include a comment of your choice in
these triple quotes this is a comment
let's see if that works
cool so just a basic function that we
call spam it prints eggs as it alright
so we've set up a function called square
so they've already set this up call it
on number on line ten call it on the
number ten put squares all right so
we're calling square on the number ten
on line nine and ten needs to be in
parentheses it says not sure why
all right calls family connection which
is over here what's Square
opinel parentheses I don't know I put in
quotations okay so just showing us how
to call the function here pretty
standard stuff all right check out the
function in the editor power it should
take two arguments a base and an
exponent and raise it to the power so
replace the the blanks with the
appropriate stuff so we have two
parameters we already see their names
because we use them in the actual
function so we have base and we have
exponent and base excellent results so
we want to call power with a base of 37
wait call power with the base in
exponent base of 37 and power four so
base is 37 and the exponent is 4 there
we go and that's looking like one point
eight seven million is answer but uh so
we're just putting in parameters and
then we're calling the function again
and that's about it
so all right what are we doing here
let's look at the two functions in the
editor one good turn which adds one to
the number and deserves another which
adds to change the body Oh deserves
another so it always adds to the output
of one good turn so just a little bit of
math for one good turn up to the output
of one good turn so always adds two to
the output
I think that's what they want us to do
it looks like your deserves another
function returns all right so does
there's another because the to function
it takes in a chance to change law do
deserves another so that always adds two
to the output at one good turn oh whoops
all right so we're going to say we need
to return we need to return one good
turn turn so we're going to call this
function in this function and we're
going to input the parameter n plus 2
there we go so just to go over this real
quick we're saying these are two
separate functions and this our
parameter n we're inserting into here
we're calling it from here say do all
this and then add 2 to it basically all
right
first def function called cube so we got
def cube takes an argument oops
def cube takes an argument number
make that function return the cube of a
number or turn number times number if I
calculate the double asterisk means ^ so
3 ^ actually not sorry - 2 - Cubist's
there there we go 3 make that function
return the cube of the number to find a
section set a second function called by
3 so def by underscore 3 just going to
take an argument called number again and
if we're have a statement if number it's
a visible 3 by 3 should call cube number
otherwise by 3 return false if number
all right so I think what they're saying
is if this doesn't have any so if our
number when we divide by 3 doesn't have
a remainder so mod 3 we want to call
cube
and we'll put in our number else make
sure your indents are correct as well
else return false
don't forget Ville cinemas right
did your overturn result else I return
cube number there we go ok so if this
number is divisible by 3 mod 3 and
meaning there's no there's no remainder
we're going to call cube number on it
all right so this is asking us to print
the square root of 2025 let's see what
happens so we're getting an error
because it looks like we probably have
to import a library so what's going on
here so import so type in import math
along to that insert math before square
root so we're going to say math dot
square root we're going to say take the
square root function from the math
library so you know what to do now
so you don't get the same error that
you've been getting and bam so we get
5.0 and it works now so let's only
import square root function from math
this time so from math import sq RT
we're saying the only function we want
to import is the square root function
from the math library you'd probably do
this if you only really needed one thing
and you don't want it have to run
through it it's probably a speed thing
it probably goes quicker like right now
you don't even worry about things
speeding like the speed of processes and
you know data and whatnot but down the
road if you're having a million hits a
day on a website stuff like that matters
all right yeah so you saw from module
from module import math so this is going
to know it go look spit off all from
math oops from math import alright so
what's this doing is it's going to
import it's a universal importer so
basically saying from our math library
import absolutely everything they can
find so so we import math imports a math
module I'm not sure how it's different
from importing the math but it might
have said just import math then import
from from math import everything so
everything equals direct on let's see
what's going on here basically so this
shows us all the functions when we call
the directory so this says oh this is
what's going on in here okay not not too
too bad you get to see like what why
this could be helpful is although you'd
probably just look at the documentation
but look square root can truncate log
you know a cosign 8n so stuff if you're
trying to figure out what they name
without going online
oops all right so what do you think of
code and editor let's see here so we
have biggest number the all arguments so
print max all right so what I think this
does if I remember correctly and we'll
find out next slide is when you put an
asterisk it means that it can take more
than one parameter so this probably will
run do this whole code for all the code
without writing a loop for you but we'll
see what's going on here
so you can see right here we have
biggest number it runs through here it's
going to print the max the man the
absolute so yep that's what it does so
it's going to run through all these
numbers and then print the max of these
numbers so I was a little bit off so
this says basically you can supply more
than one argument without doing a bunch
of statements we can just and for lists
we can just apply it and we'll give it a
prayer
like a function here and I'll do it
itself which is kind of cool you don't
you know you don't really see that often
all right so try out the max function on
line three of the editor you can provide
any number of integers so the maximum to
the max value of any seven number is
only three for example all right so max
of Max's will do 1 3 comma 5 and then
it's going to print the max of this so
it should print out 5 there just same
thing with men will do want min is 2 4 6
and it should print out two there goes
what a smart computer and then we're
going to have absolute and we it wants
us to do negative 42 and it should print
out 42 oh forget don't forget the ABS
absolute function and there we go
42 all right now we need to print out
the type so we want to print so if we
want to find out what type it is for any
reason we're going to do ant so there's
42 print a float was just let's do 3
point 3 3 3 3 and then we want to print
don't forget the type STR type of want a
string so we'll do pizza poker guy 87
and bam we should get int float string
so there are types all right so let's
get back into some functions we learned
a little bit about a few math math
library functions if you want to call
them it I'm not sure what technical name
and I guess they are functions
all right so def shut underscore down
takes a single parameter s don't forget
the parentheses or the colon
if so if s is equal equal to yes return
shutting down turn shut down return null
return shutting shutting down and you
can see that there's no brackets or
anything just a reminder with Python is
your code won't run if it's indented
properly so if this was right here even
though it looks like it's in the right
order or even if it was right here it
won't run it'll you'll just get an error
because the indentation and I've had a
course in Python let me tell you it's
depending on your ID it can be a
headache so just be aware that this does
happen quite often so hang out l if s is
equal equal to no return shutdown
aborted else
your turn sorry and then we can call
shut down
and we'll put in just a empty space and
it should return sorry actually that's
no fun let's return nope
oops double deaf no good
hmm well our codes right but I don't
know I didn't return shutting down damn
we'll figure that out later
as long as we understand what's going on
here so we are going to import from math
import square root we can do it like
that it also just support the entire
math library but this is probably the
better way to do it and then we want to
print the square root of the number one
three six eight nine which is 117 okay
and last but not least what are we doing
here we're going to write another
function called F distance distance from
zero and it's going to take one argument
we'll just say numb
we'll say if type num equals equals it's
or type num
equals equals float we wanted to do some
stuff return abs of num else
a turn nope
there we go so you see now we're kind of
combining everything we're saying
combining a type we're taking in our
parameters we're saying if it's equal
this or this we could also have done two
if statements just depends on your
coding side just happen to combine it
you can also do another if if it's an
int return absolutely num if it's a
float return absolute num else you like
that but this is probably the best way
to do it so let's see what we're going
to be doing in the next Python video
it's titled taking a vacay here taking a
vacation looks like we'll be probably
doing some sort of vacation planning
with some math objects so I'll see you
guys in the next Python video and as
always and you think constructive is
