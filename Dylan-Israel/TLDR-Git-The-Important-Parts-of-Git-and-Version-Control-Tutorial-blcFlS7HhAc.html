long didn't read for those who are nerds
like me and don't read release notes so
what this series is is this a high-level
overview of basically what you need for
certain topics what you're actually
going to use and we're gonna start by
start with get here as we our first
video and then we're gonna move on to
HTML CSS javascript teach you the basics
to get you up and running when it comes
to programming software eighty percent
of the time you're using twenty percent
of your resources of the language of the
framework of whatever it is and so
that's what we're gonna be focusing on
to get you up and running to cover that
eighty percent in as fast as possible to
just expose to what you actually need to
know right there's so much out there
it'll take you a decade to master
JavaScript but it might take you a month
to be you know get situated with it and
get get going and that's really what
these TL DR courses are about so what is
get right what is it
well it's version control what is that
it allows us to essentially essentially
keep records of code so if I have code
from yesterday I know what code looked
like yesterday i if I have code today
and I go and I save my code imagine that
we were playing an RPG right we're
playing some sort of video game and
instead of saving over the same file
we're now doing a new save every time
and so get in version control is exactly
that where we are now have a safe for
every time we save our code and it's
it's not necessarily gonna override our
existing code but we are going to have
we can look at each save in our code
that's what the version control is what
is github right so you've probably heard
of git and github github is a online
online it's essentially the version
control on the cloud it's a website that
allows us to host our code it's used by
a lot of different companies it's used
by a lot of different developers mainly
because it's free to store your code for
the most part and it's going to be what
we're going to be using when we give a
brief rundown of git and how it works
with github because chances are you're
going to be using github especially
while you're getting started
when you get a professional role you'll
might you might be using Microsoft's you
know version of is you're still going to
be using get but where the where and how
its stored will be its own environment
but for the most part we're gonna be
focused on github we don't care about
how code is stored elsewhere so that's a
brief overview of github it's a place
where we store our code and we're gonna
go and create an accountancy and see how
to get set up and going on github as
well so why learn gate well it's a lot
of reasons so it's gonna allow you to
build a portfolio and document that
you're actually coding right a lot of
developers they say they code but you
know it's hard to prove it and so kid
it's going to allow us to have an actual
portfolio where people can look at our
code and as well as see and we on github
specifically see how often you're
actually coding how often you're using
git how often you're sending your code
out to be saved and so it gives us a way
to to do that it's also going to give us
the ability to backup our code and take
it anywhere we go right you don't have
to have your laptop if you have your if
you're using git and github we're going
to be pushing our code out to the cloud
and then we have access to use it
anywhere and that way other people can
look at it other people can use it and
do something with it most importantly I
think is that it's a required skill in
today's working world front-end back in
whatever sort of web developer role you
have you're gonna need get that's just
the state of the world and you should
there's nothing wrong with it it's not
like one of those skills where oh man
it's just it's just worth my time is
this that is that no you need get and
you need version control and so you're
saying well what about okay I understand
version control but do I actually need
and get and the and the the truth of the
matter is yes you actually need get
specifically because the market is
controlled by 90% version control 90
plus percent ninety percent it's
probably on the low end of version
control of market I have a link here to
dive into a little bit more if you just
want to check it out but you all you're
welcome do your own research but get
control
a version-control market like very few
other things control for some market
percentages and so something we're
you're gonna need to know now what are
we gonna be focusing on in this course
there's really six main topics that come
to mind when you are excuse me when you
are learning get and how version control
works and these are the things that we
need to know are there other topics
absolutely are they as important no this
is the stuff that you're gonna be
working with about 80% of the time 90%
of the time the other sort of one-offs
you can learn that when you get to it
when you run into that issue when you
run into that air this is gonna be
enough to get you going and actually the
stuff that I use as a developer on a
daily basis that I pretty much 95% of
the time 99% of the time so we're gonna
talk about cloning what that is what it
means to stage what a commit is what it
means to push our code the difference
between a the master branch and another
and a different branch these are all
topics we're going to talk about and
hopefully sort of demystify a little bit
of the the the coding even these terms
alone here are very strange right
cloning is nothing more than copying
code that's out out there staging is
nothing more than getting ready your
code before you're about to save
committing is getting your code ready to
go in and push it to your branch what's
a branch it's a version of your code and
master branch that's the the Mac Daddy
and pushing that's actually saving our
code we're gonna go and give some
examples of that right now
before we get started here might I
recommend dev Mountain comm dev Mountain
coding bootcamp as we can see from their
wonderful web development syllabus here
they're going to be covering getting
github which is nice to see JavaScript
angular node react databases HTML CSS
all the things that you're basically
going to need for any front-end or full
stack role in the mean or myrn stack so
check them out the free housing is
included as well ok to get started with
get the first thing that you need to do
is go ahead and install the latest
version and to add it to your computer
so you have the ability to use git you
can do that by going to get - s CM comm
and then just downloading the latest
latest version for your appropriate
system in my case it's windows so you'll
get this exe now I'm not going to
install it but it's pretty
straightforward it's just say it's an
exe file you're gonna click Next Next
Next yes yes yes and go on from there so
yeah let's do all this sort of stuff
next next next you can just keep
clicking next there's really nothing
else you have to do so that's the gist
of it to get going and actually install
gate you're gonna do this on any
computer that you use but once you do at
one time that's it
ok earlier we mentioned github the first
thing you're gonna have to do when
getting started is of course make a
github account you can go to github.com
and create such an account it's pretty
simple there's probably some how auth
you know let me log out real quick and
you'll see oh I can sign up for github
create your username create your
password sign up it's completely free
you know I'm gonna sign back in now but
go ahead and create an account
so once you have an account created
we're gonna need to create what's called
a repo so you'll see here new repository
we can click that so what is a
repository or apposite or e is nothing
more than a folder at the end of the day
so one of my repos for instance
my code quiz project right here so what
we're creating is a folder on the cloud
that we can send our code to and save
our code to as well as going get our
code that's really all a repository is
we have to get it give it a name in my
case I'm gonna call it TL DR - get
tailed er get so and if you want you can
give this a description you'll see that
you can have a private or public
repository now the one thing about
github is if you are using github which
you should be there's no reason not to
that your code is public but you can get
private repositories the ability to make
some for $7 a month it's pretty cheap so
if you think you're making the next big
app something like that you can do it
for just $7 most so our description here
is introduction to get something like
that and then we create a repository and
you can initialize it with a readme file
and a readme file is nothing more than
essentially a a document in your folder
that is in markdown see here there's our
title there's our preview so just to let
us know what it is and we'll cover
markdown in a separate TL DR video but
for now if you see readme MD this is a
markdown file that just renders HTML and
texts let you know what it is and what
it what this repository does so how do
we get access to this repository because
we created it on github right we created
it we didn't create on our computer it's
pretty straightforward so what we're
gonna do is you see this clone or
download what clone means when we're
talking about git is the ability to copy
a repository from the master branch
what's the master branch it is
essentially the main branch that we're
using the the main folder so we'll go
more into branches in a little bit but
basically what eight branches and git is
it's just a different path of your code
so let's say here I'm I we have our
working code but then we're you know
we're making changes to this and we want
to save those change
on the clap but we don't want to save
them in production yet we create a
branch that says hey maybe this is our
test branch if you want to think it like
that we're we're still trying to figure
out if this is gonna work before it goes
out into the world so you could have a
branch before you put it to master which
is really your production code that's
how you can think of a master your
production code all the other branches
or the your plate your playgrounds where
you're working on things so right now
we're going to clone the master branch
you can see right here to the left we
have a branch and all the only one in
there is master right we haven't created
any new branches you can clone branches
but we're only going to clone the master
branch because it's what we're working
with so you'll see here we have this
link and we're basically just gonna copy
it now that we've done that we're gonna
go to wherever you want to save your
code in my case I have a tldr folder
here I'm going to launch after you've
installed it you should see this get
bash if you right-click in the folder
it's gonna launch get bash in that
actual folder see if I make that a
little bit bigger here for everyone so
you'll see that I'm in the folder that I
wanted now all I have to do in order to
clone the folder is use the git clone
command paste that that link which for
some reason I copied TLDR and not what
was in here so let's go and copy that
jump back to here and we're gonna go
ahead and paste that in there so now
that we've done this you'll see wham bam
we've now it's sort of told us we
downloaded three things let's go into
our folder you're Steve wow we have this
TLDR - git folder and it has this dot
git you don't need to really worry about
what's in here basically this is just
what helps get run don't worry about
this but you'll notice that we have this
readme file so if we launch our text
editor and if you're you're doing it the
right way you're probably usually in
Visual Studio code because that's the
best one right now everything else is
garbage no uh but I do recommend I do
recommend Visual Studio code but if you
go to our
to your folder and you'll notice when we
open this the markdown file is gonna say
exactly what was in there when we
preview it now this is markdown but
you'll see here we have TLD alright TLDR
get introduction to get so now we've
actually copied what was what was once
on the cloud to our computer to work
with so how do we actually make changes
though right how do we say all right
cool
I I like this I see that we I know how
to copy the code down but what how do I
make changes what what does that entail
well first you know we'll have our
little browser here but let's say we
wanted to add a a example of how to push
I'm trying to remember markdown spent a
minute but so if you do a dash and then
space will let me make a dot markdown is
just shorthand HTML so in here so how do
we you know we were talking about
staging what is staging well so we've
made a change to this file and you'll
see here in Visual Studio code it will
have this M here to say modified it
means that when we when we pulled down
our code we have since made
modifications and we want to the it's
just letting us know we've done that so
how do we fix that
well first off let's bring up our text
editor here or our get bash you want a
CD won't change into the directory which
is TLDR slash get so and you'll notice
we have this master right here as well
if you're using git bash get bashful's
tell you what branch you're on so not
only are we on the master branch not
only are we on this folder structure
we're also on the master branch
so if we use git status it will tell us
hey is has anything been changed since
when we pull down this code and you'll
notice it actually says hey you've
actually modified readme MD and if you
want to push those changes please do
right so the next thing that we want to
do is we want to stage our codes
what's staging our code because we're
our goal here is to get back code on the
cloud so other people can pull our
changes down so what what can we do to
to make that happen
staging is essentially saying hey we
have all these modified files that
sometimes we've deleted files sometimes
we modified sometimes we've created
brand-new files let's go ahead and do
that real quick where we're gonna create
a new file and we'll just call this
index J s and in here we'll console.log
we're just create a variable forget that
we'll just create a variable will say
Const
hello equals world rank we're just doing
hello world and get at the end of the
day so we have this new file and you'll
see this you us this untracked that
basically means that the repo doesn't
know this file exists yet no you don't
really need to worry about that too much
but now if we go and we say get status
you'll see we have we have a modified
file and then we have untracked files
which are files that we don't know that
we need the the repo doesn't know we
want to add now you can use the command
git add and target this file directly as
well as git add to target this file
directly most of the time I heard you
not to manually add files each
individual files we have a much better
way where we can just use git stage and
then dot what this is going to do is
it's gonna then go check all the modify
files all the deleted files all the
untracked files and it's going to get it
ready for you to for you to go and send
it to the cloud so that's what staging
does and in our extent in our situation
here now we'll still have you'll see
what what we've staged and you'll see
okay well we've said hey we are half
changes to the readme file we have
changed we've now added this new file
but all we've done so far is pulled down
the code made our changes and then we've
staged it to say look at when we finally
get ready to send this code this is what
you need to send so
the next thing that we need to do is a
commit right so a commit is nothing more
than allowing you to save these changes
to your local version before you go and
send it off so it's almost like a second
preparing of your code right so you
staged it to get it ready to be sent and
then you commit it to to essentially
reaffirm that that's what you want to do
one of the benefits to committing is you
can throw this - em on here and that's
going to allow you to add a message one
of the things developers do all the time
is right really shitty commit messages
which make it hard to go back and figure
out what their code would do so one
thing that we would say for a message in
this case is added new index file and
modified readme documentation or push or
something right and so now that's gonna
go and make our commit so you'll see
here it's asking us to I wonder if it's
asking us to login we'll see here if
you're not if you've the first time you
launched get on your computer it may ask
you to login but now if we go get status
oh excuse me get push so get push is
going to send the code to the to the
repository to that folder structure on
the cloud and here we go
boom everything is good to go and I
think I think I'm actually gonna have to
log in manually now that we've done that
if it updates it so it didn't update it
here which means that we have to login
to our application which normally it's
supposed to launch a launch a so get
login okay so you saw here when I tried
to commit we got this error message just
said that's telling us to run we have to
set up our username I was thinking
usually it will prop up like a little
box say hey you
to login and so little dialog thing but
uh we can do it this way so user email
is dental in this email 3100 at
gmail.com suite and then we gonna have
to go into and put our username get
config control see a set and this is a
allow you allow your loud github to know
who should be committing and and who did
commit the code who pushed the new code
once you put Dylan Israel and let's see
if we try to push now everything up to
date that doesn't sound right
let's see git commit there we go
and there you go and sweet so you'll see
two file changes three so now we've made
those commits and finally now that we've
sort of prepped it we had to set our
username and and stuff like that just so
that it could say who did what we can go
ahead and push it and you'll see it's
gonna it's going to be running and now
we're done right so if we go to github
or if we check our status now after you
pushed it it's gonna say that everything
is up-to-date work working clean tree
basically there's nothing for us to
commit there's nothing for us to stage
because we have now we have now gone and
updated our code so now when we refresh
it you'll see our changes here and
you'll see our comments here as well as
our readme has our stage dot here and
then our index dot JSP the repo as well
and now if we for whatever reason we
went in here and we said you know what
man
I just want to delete this and you know
one other thing I want to show you right
now is that we're like oh man what
happened here so we deleted our code how
can we get it back right maybe we made
some changes and we're like look I just
want to revert everything I did
so you might say our get status right
deleted deleted and we're like oh I
didn't mean to do that how can I get it
back well we there's the way of let's
just delete everything and pull straight
down for the repo but maybe there's some
changes that you saved along the way
that you don't want the ATM push out yet
so what we can do is we use this get
stash get stash will essentially just
stash away all the changes that you made
before you went in and stage your stuff
so you'll see now we now have got rid of
all that code and we're back to stage
one where we can do it but say we wanted
to make another copy of this we could
just get cloned and pull it all down on
another computer so let's go ahead and
dive in a little bit more into branches
and the difference between a branch and
the master branch all right so let's
talk a little bit about branches why
they exist and what we are going to use
them for so branches essentially allow
us to make changes to code before we're
ready to put it on our production code
or our master branch right master branch
being the the name of the the branch
that is used the the one that is the
code base at the end of the day the the
file structure the folder that we're
storing all our code into say hey this
is our code that we're going to be
releasing to the clients this is the
current version of our code so we use
branches as a way to create a place for
us to make updates save our code sim on
the cloud similar to how we did on the
master branch except now it's a new
folder structure but it's still in the
same repository just imagine it's like a
duplicate folder structure where it's
slightly different almost like an
alternate reality right where if you're
if you a sci-fi geek like me you know
that they're you know and you believe in
the multiple reality sort of stuff where
everything somewhat similar except
slightly different right and that's kind
of how you could think about branches
and so what I want to do here is I want
to create a new branch and you can do
this by git check out dash B and then
the name of your branch and in my case
I'm just gonna call it
branch underscore example and you'll see
now if you're using git bash again that
we have this branch example and because
we were on the master branch it's gonna
actually keep what's in our code all the
same right even with your refresh here
where we are in the master branch git
will change these files to be according
accordingly so what we're gonna do here
is we're gonna go ahead and just add a
new file so let's say what's great new
file will call this branch dot j s and
we can put something in here and we're
just gonna call it branch equals example
all right no nothing that we're gonna
use but now that we're here we've now
added this file so we want to add the
code to our branch all right so we're
gonna say git stage remember we're gonna
get it well stage it all want it to get
ready you want to get commit and let's
say add a message added branch J s
example so that's going to add our thing
and then finally we want to push it to
our branch it's the same exact thing the
only difference is we needed to create
our branch and then add it now you'll
see here we have this set upstream
origin branch example when you create a
new branch on your local machine this
essentially just has to say hey wherever
you're storing your code in this
repository just let it know that you
need to set up the upstream setup the
ability to send this code and this is a
one-time thing when you create a new
branch so you'll see here but all we
would have to do otherwise is get push
so now that we've done that if we go to
our our github page go ahead and come
back to it so you'll see here we are
TLDR branch go ahead and refresh you'll
see this is basically saying that hey
you have this other branch do you want
to merge it into master we're not
worried about that right now
but you'll notice that we have this
branch example and you'll notice the
master branch here doesn't doesn't
actually go and
there's there's no file there's no
branch file because it's not part of our
production level code our master branch
but if we switch over to the branch
example it's there it's working just
fine you'll notice there's also a
different different version going here
and as I mentioned again if we change
this to be to example 2 and then we
staged our code as we would because we
may change the start code and then we
committed our code and we I had a
message I said
updated example 2 and then we pushed it
you'll notice that we don't have to set
the upstream again everything still work
the same it's just that one time where
you're created a branch so now that
we've done that how do we merge our code
right how do we do that
well this is going to be slightly
different for every organization the
reason I say that is when you are a
developer in a production and as an
actual software developer at a company
usually there are pull requests and
things like that which basically just
means that other developers gonna look
at your code before they say hey it's ok
for this to go into the master branch
but if it's your own personal project
you're ok with it
how can you merge it well you can do it
through the UI here but you can also do
it through the command line as well and
so the way that you do that is it now
merging to the master branch is a little
bit strange but so we have our branch
here and we've already pushed our you'll
see here all our changes for the branch
have already been pushed to the tree so
the way that we can now go is weekends
first you get merged master which the
thing here is that's going to bring in
the master branch changes so let's say
something got updated to the master
branch we're then going to in our other
branch our branch example bring those
changes in in our case everything's up
to date there aren't any changes that we
need to make now after that what we want
to do is we go ahead and check out to
the master branch
so check out allows us to switch between
branches if we wanted to switch back we
could do branch example it would switch
us
back and vice-versa we go back to master
so this is going to switch between the
branches now now that we're in the
master branch we've already checked to
make sure there aren't any conflicts we
can go ahead and do git merge and what
we want is our branch example and that
is going to bring in all the files in
that branch into our master branch now
you'll see here we do get status nothing
to commit we've already brought that in
but the last thing that we have to do so
we don't have to stage it because we've
it part of the merging handles the
staging and the committing for that and
we'll all we have to do now is get push
and now that branch all those changes in
that branch is in our master branch and
is now going out to our github page our
repository which if we refresh here
you'll see wham bam everything's good to
go we have our branch j/s so just to run
over that one more time so the first
thing that you're gonna want to do is
you're gonna want to bring in the master
branch to make sure no changes have
happened now that you've done that the
next thing that you're gonna want to do
is then if if they have you want to
stage what you want to commit it all
that stuff the next thing that you want
to do is then go to the master branch
and pull in those changes from that
using the merge keyword and the branch
name then you just push to the
repository and codes there so that was
your this was your TL DR of git and
github there's a few other things that
might need to be covered down the road
how to handle merge conflicts and things
like that but I think you'll come across
